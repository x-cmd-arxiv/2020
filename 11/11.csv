replace the former classical state-of-the-art methods with deep learning

Google's Generalized End-to-End Loss for Speaker Verification (GE2E), a deep
learning-based technique using long short-term memory units, has recently
gained a lot of attention due to its speed in convergence and generalization.
In this study, we aim at further studying the GE2E method and comparing
different scenarios in order to investigate all of its aspects. Various
experiments including the effects of a random sampling of test and enrollment
utterances, test utterance duration, and the number of enrollment utterances
are discussed in this article. Furthermore, we compare the GE2E method with the
baseline state-of-the-art i-vector-based methods for text-independent speaker
verification and show that it outperforms them by resulting in lower error
rates while being end-to-end and requiring less training time for convergence.

Finally, we study the dynamics of infinite points: for some endomorphisms,

which implies that the dynamics is asymptotically periodic. We also prove the

with is critical for user retention. While the last decade has seen an
explosion of RSs aimed at identifying relevant items that match user
preferences, there is still a range of aspects that could be considered to
further improve their performance. For example, often RSs are centered around
the user, who is modeled using her recent sequence of activities. Recent
studies, however, have shown the effectiveness of modeling the mutual
interactions between users and items using separate user and item embeddings.
Building on the success of these studies, we propose a novel method called
DeePRed that addresses some of their limitations. In particular, we avoid
recursive and costly interactions between consecutive short-term embeddings by
using long-term (stationary) embeddings as a proxy. This enable us to train
DeePRed using simple mini-batches without the overhead of specialized
mini-batches proposed in previous studies. Moreover, DeePRed's effectiveness
comes from the aforementioned design and a multi-way attention mechanism that
inspects user-item compatibility. Experiments show that DeePRed outperforms the
best state-of-the-art approach by at least 14% on next item prediction task,
while gaining more than an order of magnitude speedup over the best performing
baselines. Although this study is mainly concerned with temporal interaction
networks, we also show the power and flexibility of DeePRed by adapting it to
the case of static interaction networks, substituting the short- and long-term
aspects with local and global ones.

computer generated images drawn from a reproduction of an imaging model from a
previously published study of experimentally obtained cell imaging data
representing progressive viral particle proliferation in host cell monolayers.
Inspired by experimental time-based imaging data, here in this study viral
particle increase in time is simulated by a one-by-one increase, across images,
in black or gray single pixels representing dead or partially infected cells,
and hypothetical remission by a one-by-one increase in white pixels coding for
living cells in the original image model. The image simulations are submitted
to unsupervised learning by a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the Quantization
Error in the SOM output (SOM-QE) is used for automatic classification of the
image simulations as a function of the represented extent of viral particle
proliferation or cell recovery. Unsupervised classification by SOM-QE of 160
model images, each with more than three million pixels, is shown to provide a
statistically reliable, pixel precise, and fast classification model that
outperforms human computer-assisted image classification by RGB image mean

fingerprints between different brain scans of the same individual. Here, we
extend the concept of brain connectivity fingerprints beyond test/retest and
assess fingerprint gradients in young adults by developing an extension of the
differential identifiability framework. To do so, we look at the similarity
between not only the multiple scans of an individual (subject fingerprint), but
also between the scans of monozygotic and dizygotic twins (twin fingerprint).
We have carried out this analysis on the 8 fMRI conditions present in the Human
Connectome Project -- Young Adult dataset, which we processed into functional
connectomes (FCs) and timeseries parcellated according to the Schaefer Atlas
scheme, which has multiple levels of resolution. Our differential
identifiability results show that the fingerprint gradients based on genetic
and environmental similarities are indeed present when comparing FCs for all
parcellations and fMRI conditions. Importantly, only when assessing optimally
reconstructed FCs, we fully uncover fingerprints present in higher resolution
atlases. We also study the effect of scanning length on subject fingerprint of
resting-state FCs to analyze the effect of scanning length and parcellation. In
the pursuit of open science, we have also made available the processed and

binary quantum graphs using a dynamical approach. This is the first example
where a spectral statistic can be evaluated in terms of periodic orbits for a
system with chaotic classical dynamics without taking the semiclassical limit,
which here is the limit of large graphs. The variance depends on the sizes of
particular sets of primitive pseudo orbits (sets of distinct primitive periodic
orbits): the set of primitive pseudo orbits without self-intersections and the
sets of primitive pseudo orbits with a fixed number of self-intersections, all
of which consist of two arcs of the pseudo orbit crossing at a single vertex.
To show other pseudo orbits do not contribute we give two arguments. The first
is based on a reduction of the variance formula from a sum over pairs of
primitive pseudo orbits to a sum over pseudo orbits where no bonds are
repeated. The second employs a parity argument for the Lyndon decomposition of
words. For families of binary graphs, in the semiclassical limit, we show the
pseudo orbit formula approaches a universal constant independent of the
coefficient of the polynomial. This is obtained by counting the total number of
primitive pseudo orbits of a given length.

500 MHz and widely separated observing sessions. The pulsar profile shows the
presence of four distinct conal components and belongs to a small group of
pulsars classified as a conal quadrupole profile type. The single pulse
sequence reveals the presence of three distinct emission modes, A, B, and ABN
showing subpulse drifting. Besides, there were sequences when the pulsar did
not show any drifting behaviour suggesting the possibility of a new emission
state, which we have termed as mode C. The evolution of the mode changing
behavior was seen during the different observing sessions with different
abundance as well as the average duration of the modes seen on each date. The
drifting periodicities were 7.8$\pm$0.3 $P$, 4.3$\pm$0.4 $P$, and 3.1$\pm$0.2
$P$ in the modes A, B and ABN respectively, and showed large phase variations
within the mode profile. The pulsar also showed the presence of orthogonal
polarization modes, particularly in the leading and trailing components, which
has different characteristics for the stronger and weaker pulses. However, no
correlation was found between the emission modes and their polarization
behavior, with the estimated emission heights remaining roughly constant
throughout. We have used the Partially Screened Gap model to understand the

impressive work conveys the appearance of striking three-dimensional shapes and
structures in a large-scale pictorial plane. Current perception science
explains such effects by invoking brain mechanisms for the processing of
monocular (2D) depth cues. Here in this study, we illustrate and explain local
effects of 2D color and contrast cues on the perceptual organization in terms
of figure-ground assignments, i.e. which local surfaces are likely to be seen
as nearer or bigger in the image plane. Paired configurations are embedded in a
larger, structurally ambivalent pictorial context inspired by some of Vasarelys
creations. The figure-ground effects the configurations produce reveal a
significant correlation between perceptual solutions for nearer and bigger when
other monocular depth cues are not provided. In consistency with previous
findings on similar, albeit simpler visual displays, a specific color may
compete with luminance contrast to resolve the planar ambiguity of a complex
pattern context at a critical point in the hierarchical resolution of
figure-ground uncertainty. The potential role of color temperature in this
process is brought forward here. Vasarely intuitively understood and
successfully exploited the subtle context effects accounted for in this paper,
well before empirical investigation had set out to study and explain them in
terms of information processing by the visual brain.

efficient malware detection system is on the rise. The existing device-end
learning based solutions tend to extract limited syntax features (e.g.,
permissions and API calls) to meet a certain time constraint of mobile devices.
However, syntax features lack the semantics which can represent the potential
malicious behaviors and further result in more robust model with high accuracy
for malware detection. In this paper, we propose an efficient Android malware
detection system, named SeqMobile, which adopts behavior-based sequence
features and leverages customized deep neural networks on mobile devices
instead of the server. Different from the traditional sequence-based approaches
on server, to meet the performance demand, SeqMobile accepts three effective
performance optimization methods to reduce the time cost. To evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our system, we conduct experiments from the
following aspects 1) the detection accuracy of different recurrent neural
networks; 2) the feature extraction performance on different mobile devices, 3)
the detection accuracy and prediction time cost of different sequence lengths.
The results unveil that SeqMobile can effectively detect malware with high
accuracy. Moreover, our performance optimization methods have proven to improve
the performance of training and prediction by at least twofold. Additionally,
to discover the potential performance optimization from the SOTA TensorFlow
model optimization toolkit for our approach, we also provide an evaluation on
the toolkit, which can serve as a guidance for other systems leveraging on
sequence-based learning approach. Overall, we conclude that our sequence-based
approach, together with our performance optimization methods, enable us to
detect malware under the performance demands of mobile devices.

technological interest because their use in extreme environments. However,
their characterization at high temperatures represents the main obstacle for
their fast development. Obstacles are found from a experimental point of view,
where only few laboratories around the world have the resources to test these
materials under extreme conditions, and also from a theoretical point of view,
where actual methods are extremely expensive. Here, a new theoretical
high-throughput framework for the prediction of the thermoelastic properties of
materials is introduced. This approach can be systematically applied to any
kind of crystalline material, drastically reducing the computational cost of
previous methodologies. Elastic constants for UHTCs have been calculated at a
wide range of temperatures with excellent agreement with experimentally
reported values. Moreover, other mechanical properties such a bulk modulus,
shear modulus or Poisson ration have been also explored. Other frameworks with
similar computational cost have been used only for predicting isotropic or
averaged properties, however this new approach opens the door to the
calculation of anisotropic properties at a very low computational cost.

Force/velocity polytopes appear to be a more appropriate representation to

complexity of the associated vertex search problem, the polytope approach is
mostly restricted to offline use, e.g. as a tool aiding robot mechanical

exploits the parallelotop geometry of actuator constraints. The proposed
algorithm significantly reduces the complexity and computation time of the

highlight the on-line capability of the proposed algorithm and its potential

the load distribution is adapted on-line, as a function of the configuration

such uniform sampling is generally sub-optimal because equal importance is

efficient video-based training of 3D CNNs. It relies on softmax temporal
pooling and a weighted sampling mechanism to select the most relevant training

computational complexity due to efficient clip sampling, and an improved
accuracy since temporal weighting focuses on more relevant clips during both
training and inference. Experimental results obtained with the proposed method
on several facial expression recognition benchmarks show the benefits of
focusing on more informative clips in training videos. In particular, our
approach improves performance and computational cost by reducing the impact of
inaccurate trimming and coarse annotation of videos, and heterogeneous

study of CME observations from two viewpoints in similar directions but at
considerably different solar distances. Aims. Our objective is to understand
how the PSP observations affect the CME kinematics, especially due to its
proximity to the Sun. Methods. We estimate the CME positions, speeds,
accelerations, propagation directions and longitudinal deflections using
imaging observations from two spacecraft, and a set of analytical expressions
that consider the CME as a point structure and take into account the rapid
change in spacecraft position. Results. We find that both CMEs are slow ($<
400\ km\ s^{-1}$), propagating eastward of the Sun-Earth line. The second CME
seems to accelerate between $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.2\ au$ and deflect westward
with an angular speed consistent with the solar rotation speed. We find some
discrepancies in the CME solar distance (up to $0.05\ au$, particularly for CME
\#1), latitude (up to $\sim10^{\circ}$) and longitude (up to $24^{\circ}$) when
comparing results from different fit cases (different observations or set of
free parameters). Conclusions. Discrepancies in longitude are likely due to the
feature tracked visually rather than instrumental biases or fit assumptions.
For similar reasons, the CME \#1 solar distance, as derived from WISPR-I
observations, is larger than the HI-1 result, regardless of the fit parameters
considered. Error estimates for CME kinematics do not show any clear trend
associated to the observing instrument. The source region location and the lack
of any clear in situ counterparts (both at near-Earth and at PSP) support our
estimate of the propagation direction for both events.

between permutations. In such problems, the input is a tuple
$(\sigma_1,\dotsc,\sigma_d)$ of permutations on $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$, and one
wishes to determine whether this tuple satisfies a certain system of relations
$E$, or is far from every tuple that satisfies $E$. If this computational
problem can be solved by querying only a small number of entries of the given
permutations, we say that $E$ is testable. For example, when $d=2$ and $E$
consists of the single relation $\mathsf{XY=YX}$, this corresponds to testing
whether $\sigma_1\sigma_2=\sigma_2\sigma_1$, where $\sigma_1\sigma_2$ and
$\sigma_2\sigma_1$ denote composition of permutations.
  We define a collection of graphs, naturally associated with the system $E$,
that encodes all the information relevant to the testability of $E$. We then
prove two theorems that provide criteria for testability and non-testability in
terms of expansion properties of these graphs. By virtue of a deep connection
with group theory, both theorems are applicable to wide classes of systems of
relations.
  In addition, we formulate the well-studied group-theoretic notion of
stability in permutations as a special case of the testability notion above,
interpret all previous works on stability as testability results, survey
previous results on stability from a computational perspective, and describe
many directions for future research on stability and testability.

radiative heating and cooling at temperatures between $10^2\,\rm K$ and
$10^7\,\rm K$. The interplay between shock heating, dynamical instabilities,
turbulence, and radiative heating and cooling creates a complex multi-phase
flow with a rain-like morphology. Cloud gas fragments and is continuously
eroded, becoming efficiently mixed and mass loaded. The resulting warm mixed
gas then cools down and precipitates into new dense cloudlets, which repeat the
process. Thus, radiative cooling is able to sustain fast-moving dense gas by
aiding condensation of gas from warm clouds and the hot wind. In the ensuing
outflow, hot gas with temperatures $\gtrsim 10^6\,\rm K$ outruns the warm and
cold phases, which reach thermal equilibrium near $\approx 10^4\,\rm K$ and
$\approx 10^2\,\rm K$, respectively. Although the volume filling factor of hot
gas is higher in the outflow, most of the mass is concentrated in dense gas
cloudlets and filaments with these temperatures. More porous multicloud layers
result in more vertically extended outflows, and dense gas is more efficiently
produced in more compact layers. The cold phase is not accelerated by
ram-pressure, but, instead, precipitates from warm and mixed gas out of thermal
equilibrium. This cycle can explain the presence of high-velocity H\,{\sc i}

labels, and special hardware requirements. In this work, to address the
limitations of traditional ML and deep CNN based methods, a novel and
systematic classification framework is proposed for the classification of
PolSAR images, based on a compact and adaptive implementation of CNNs using a
sliding-window classification approach. The proposed approach has three
advantages. First, there is no requirement for an extensive feature extraction
process. Second, it is computationally efficient due to utilized compact
configurations. In particular, the proposed compact and adaptive CNN model is
designed to achieve the maximum classification accuracy with minimum training
and computational complexity. This is of considerable importance considering
the high costs involved in labelling in PolSAR classification. Finally, the
proposed approach can perform classification using smaller window sizes than
deep CNNs. Experimental evaluations have been performed over the most
commonly-used four benchmark PolSAR images: AIRSAR L-Band and RADARSAT-2 C-Band
data of San Francisco Bay and Flevoland areas. Accordingly, the best obtained
overall accuracies range between 92.33 - 99.39% for these benchmark study
sites.

regresses both the mean and the precision matrix of a Gaussian graphical model

studies, our method can determine how genetic variants and clinical conditions
modulate the subject-level network structures, and recover both the
population-level and subject-level gene networks. Our framework encourages
sparsity of covariate effects on both the mean and the precision matrix. In
particular for the precision matrix, we stipulate simultaneous sparsity, i.e.,
group sparsity and element-wise sparsity, on effective covariates and their
effects on network edges, respectively. We establish variable selection
consistency first under the case with known mean parameters and then a more
challenging case with unknown means depending on external covariates, and
establish in both cases the $\ell_2$ convergence rates and the selection
consistency of the estimated precision parameters. The utility and efficacy of
our proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an
application to a co-expression QTL study with brain cancer patients.

semantics for a variety of higher-order programming languages. However, due to
the complexity of most game models, game semantics has remained unapproachable
for non-experts.
  In this paper, we aim at making game semantics more accessible by viewing it
as a syntactic translation into a session typed pi-calculus, referred to as
metalanguage, followed by a semantics interpretation of the metalanguage into a
particular game model. The syntactic translation can be defined for a wide
range of programming languages without knowledge of the particular game model
used. Simple reasoning on the model (soundness, and adequacy) can be done at
the level of the metalanguage, escaping tedious technical proofs usually found
in game semantics. We call this methodology programming game semantics.
  We design a metalanguage (PiDiLL) inspired from Differential Linear Logic
(DiLL), which is concise but expressive enough to support features required by
concurrent game semantics. We then demonstrate our methodology by yielding the
first causal, non-angelic and interactive game model of CML, a higher-order
call-by-value language with shared memory concurrency. We translate CML into
PiDiLL and show that the translation is adequate. We give a causal and
non-angelic game semantics model using event structures, which supports a
simple semantics interpretation of PiDiLL. Combining both of these results, we
obtain the first interactive model of a concurrent language of this
expressivity which is adequate with respect to the standard weak bisimulation,
and fully abstract for the contextual equivalence on second-order terms.

paradigmatic models of classical statistical mechanics, {viz.}, one-dimensional
kinetic Ising model and mean-field zero-range process, when the system is
annealed slowly to the critical point. Starting from the time evolution
equations for the spin-spin correlation function in the Ising model and the
mass distribution in the zero-range process, we derive the Kibble-Zurek scaling
laws. We then test a recent proposal that critical coarsening which is ignored
in the Kibble-Zurek argument plays a role in the nonequilibrium dynamics close
to the critical point. We find that the defect density in the Ising model and a
scaled mass distribution in the zero-range process decay linearly to the
respective value at the critical point with the time remaining until the end of
the quench provided the final quench point is approached sufficiently fast, and
sublinearly otherwise. As the linear scaling for the approach to the critical
point also holds when a system following an instantaneous quench is allowed to
coarsen for a finite time interval, we conclude that critical coarsening
captures the scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point if the
annealing is not too slow.

whether or not agents can aggregate information correctly. In this paper, we
study social networks that support information aggregation when rational agents
act sequentially and irrevocably. Whether or not information is aggregated
depends, inter alia, on the order in which agents decide. Thus, to decouple the
order and the topology, our model studies a random arrival order.
  Unlike the case of a fixed arrival order, in our model, the decision of an
agent is unlikely to be affected by those who are far from him in the network.
This observation allows us to identify a local learning requirement, a natural
condition on the agent's neighborhood that guarantees that this agent makes the
correct decision (with high probability) no matter how well other agents
perform. Roughly speaking, the agent should belong to a multitude of mutually
exclusive social circles.
  We illustrate the power of the local learning requirement by constructing a
family of social networks that guarantee information aggregation despite that
no agent is a social hub (in other words, there are no opinion leaders).
Although the common wisdom of the social learning literature suggests that
information aggregation is very fragile, another application of the local
learning requirement demonstrates the existence of networks where learning
prevails even if a substantial fraction of the agents are not involved in the
learning process. On a technical level, the networks we construct rely on the
theory of expander graphs, i.e., highly connected sparse graphs with a wide
range of applications from pure mathematics to error-correcting codes.

theory. Here we present spin susceptibility measurements across the interaction
strength-temperature phase diagram using a novel radiofrequency technique with
ultracold $^6\textrm{Li}$ gases. For all significant interaction strengths and
at all temperatures we find the spin susceptibility is reduced compared with
the equivalent value for a non-interacting Fermi gas, with the low temperature
results consistent with previous studies. However, our measurements extend to
higher temperatures, where we find that the reduction persists consistently
with a mean-field scenario. At unitarity, we can use the local density

tests above which recovery is information theoretically (IT) possible, and the
number of tests required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to
succeed. Often times such gaps are explained by a phase transition in the
landscape of the solution space of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property phase
transition).
  In this paper we seek to understand whether such a phenomenon takes place for
Bernoulli group testing as well. Our main contributions are the following: (1)
We provide first moment evidence that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase
transition does not take place throughout the regime for which recovery is IT
possible. This fact suggests that the model is in fact amenable to local search
algorithms ; (2) we prove the complete absence of ""bad"" local minima for a part

theoretical results on the performance of efficient algorithms for approximate
recovery without false-negatives, and finally (3) we present extensive
simulations that strongly suggest that a very simple local algorithm known as
Glauber Dynamics does indeed succeed, and can be used to efficiently implement

L-band receiver (1.15-1.73 GHz) of the 100 m diameter Green Bank Telescope.
These observations focused on regions surrounding 31 Sun-like stars near the
plane of the Galaxy. We present the results of our search for narrowband
signals in this data set as well as improvements to our data processing
pipeline. Specifically, we applied an improved candidate signal detection
procedure that relies on the topographic prominence of the signal power, which
nearly doubles the signal detection count of some previously analyzed data
sets. We also improved the direction-of-origin filters that remove most radio
frequency interference (RFI) to ensure that they uniquely link signals observed
in separate scans. We performed a preliminary signal injection and recovery
analysis to test the performance of our pipeline. We found that our pipeline
recovers 93% of the injected signals over the usable frequency range of the
receiver and 98% if we exclude regions with dense RFI. In this analysis, 99.73%
of the recovered signals were correctly classified as technosignature
candidates. Our improved data processing pipeline classified over 99.84% of the
~26 million signals detected in our data as RFI. Of the remaining candidates,
4539 were detected outside of known RFI frequency regions. The remaining
candidates were visually inspected and verified to be of anthropogenic nature.
Our search compares favorably to other recent searches in terms of end-to-end
sensitivity, frequency drift rate coverage, and signal detection count per unit
bandwidth per unit integration time.

unitary character-automorphic Fourier transforms which generalize the

experiments that utilize neutrinos from accelerator sources stems from a lack
of precision in modeling single-pion production (SPP). Oscillation analyses
rely on Monte Carlo event generators (MC), providing theoretical predictions of
neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Pions produced in these processes
provide a significant fraction of oscillation signal and background on both
elementary scattering and detector simulation levels. Thus, it is of critical
importance to develop techniques that will allow us to accommodate
state-of-the-art theoretical models describing SPP into MCs.
  In this work, we investigate various algorithms to implement single-pion
production models in Monte Carlo event generators. Based on comparison studies,
we propose a novel implementation strategy that combines satisfactory
efficiency with high precision in reproducing details of theoretical models
predictions, including pion angular distributions. The proposed implementation
is model-independent, thereby providing a framework that can include any model
for SPP. We have tested the new algorithm with the Ghent Low Energy Model for
single-pion production implemented in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator.

compare the performance of this technique with fixed and variable
circular-aperture photometry, using both BiLinearly Interpolated Subpixel
Sensitivity (BLISS) maps and non-binned Pixel-Level Decorrelation (PLD). With
BLISS maps, elliptical photometry results in a lower standard deviation of
normalized residuals, and reduced or similar correlated noise when compared to
circular apertures. PLD prefers variable, circular apertures, but generally
results in more correlated noise than BLISS. This vibrational effect is likely
present in other telescopes and Spitzer observations, where correction could
improve results. Our elliptical apertures can be applied to any photometry
observations, and may be even more effective when applied to more circular PRFs
than Spitzer's.

statistical properties of three-dimensional rotating turbulence by the means of
direct numerical simulations in a triply periodic box where geostrophic

wave turbulence that verifies the Zakharov-Kolmogorov spectrum derived
analytically by Galtier (Phys. Rev. E, 68, 2003), thus offering numerical proof
of the relevance of wave turbulence theory for three-dimensional, anisotropic

further evidence for bi-stability in rotating turbulent flows.

this could require considerable human effort in the real world, especially if

with minimal supervision while removing the need for resets. We do this by
exploiting the insight that the need to ""reset"" an agent to a broad set of

online platforms to suggest potential items to the end-users. These services
often use different machine learning techniques for which fairness is a
concerning factor, especially when the downstream services have the ability to
cause social ramifications. Thus, focusing on the non-personalised (global)
recommendations in news media platforms (e.g., top-k trending topics on
Twitter, top-k news on a news platform, etc.), we discuss on two specific
fairness concerns together (traditionally studied separately)---user fairness
and organisational fairness. While user fairness captures the idea of
representing the choices of all the individual users in the case of global
recommendations, organisational fairness tries to ensure
politically/ideologically balanced recommendation sets. This makes user
fairness a user-side requirement and organisational fairness a platform-side
requirement. For user fairness, we test with methods from social choice theory,
i.e., various voting rules known to better represent user choices in their
results. Even in our application of voting rules to the recommendation setup,
we observe high user satisfaction scores. Now for organisational fairness, we
propose a bias metric which measures the aggregate ideological bias of a
recommended set of items (articles). Analysing the results obtained from voting
rule-based recommendation, we find that while the well-known voting rules are
better from the user side, they show high bias values and clearly not suitable
for organisational requirements of the platforms. Thus, there is a need to
build an encompassing mechanism by cohesively bridging ideas of user fairness
and organisational fairness. In this abstract paper, we intend to frame the
elementary ideas along with the clear motivation behind the requirement of such
a mechanism.

measure that can only be optimized by sampling. On the other hand,
information-theoretic heuristics compute information gain as the mutual

differentiation. In this work, we add a novel fuzzy logic filter in the
counting of visible frontier voxels surrounding a viewpoint, which allows the
gradient of the information gain with respect to the viewpoint to be
efficiently computed using automatic differentiation. This enables us to
simultaneously optimize information gain with other differentiable quality

which obtains a good agreement with previous laboratory measurements for the
smaller temperature differences up to 15 mK. The influence of different
boundary conditions and side lengths of the square domain is discussed for the
mass standard positioned in the center of the chamber. The complexity is
increased subsequently in configurations with additional built-ins for counter
heating in form of planar plates or hemispherical shells above the mass
standard. The latter ones lead to a full compensation of the updraft force.
Three-dimensional simulations in a closed cubic chamber confirm the
two-dimensional findings and additionally reveal complex secondary flow pattern
in the vicinity of the mass standard. The reduction of the heat transfer due to
the built-ins is also demonstrated by a comparison of the Nusselt numbers as a

into an unordered set. Each feature has an associated probability ranging from

understand the gap between state-of-the-art protocols and what is currently
available in practice for a data scientist, we designed three neural network
architecture to obtain secure predictions via each of the four aforementioned

side product of its primary cosmological mission. Asteroids appear as trailed
sources, that is streaks, in the images. Owing to the survey area of 15 000
square degrees and the number of sources, automated methods have to be used to
find them. Euclid is equipped with a visible camera, VIS (VISual imager), and a
near-infrared camera, NISP (Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer), with
three filters.
  We aim to develop a pipeline to detect fast-moving objects in Euclid images,
with both high completeness and high purity.
  We tested the StreakDet software to find asteroids from simulated Euclid
images. We optimized the parameters of StreakDet to maximize completeness, and
developed a post-processing algorithm to improve the purity of the sample of
detected sources by removing false-positive detections.
  StreakDet finds 96.9% of the synthetic asteroid streaks with apparent
magnitudes brighter than 23rd magnitude and streak lengths longer than 15
pixels ($10\,{\rm arcsec\,h^{-1}}$), but this comes at the cost of finding a
high number of false positives. The number of false positives can be radically
reduced with multi-streak analysis, which utilizes all four dithers obtained by
Euclid.
  StreakDet is a good tool for identifying asteroids in Euclid images, but
there is still room for improvement, in particular, for finding short (less
than 13 pixels, corresponding to 8$\,{\rm arcsec\,h^{-1}}$) and/or faint
streaks (fainter than the apparent magnitude of 23).

class of foldable structures that harness origami-inspired methods to enhance
the structural stiffness of resulting devices; these mechanisms have extensive
applications due to their lightweight, compact nature as well as their high
strength-to-weight ratio. However, the design of these mechanisms remains
challenging. Here, we propose an efficient method to rapidly design OADLC
mechanisms from desired behavioral specifications, i.e. in-plane stiffness and
out-of-plane stiffness. Based on an equivalent plate model, we develop and
validate analytical formulas for the behavioral specifications of OADLC
mechanisms; the analytical formulas can be described as expressions of design
parameters. On the basis of the analytical expressions, we formulate the design
of OADLC mechanisms from behavioral specifications into an optimization problem
that minimizes the weight with given design constraints. The 2D folding
patterns of the optimized OADLC mechanisms can be generated automatically and
directly delivered for fabrication. Our rapid design method is demonstrated by
developing stiffness-enhanced mechanisms with a desired out-of-plane stiffness
for a foldable gripper that enables a blimp to perch steadily under air

not suffer from the measurement problem. While it agrees with standard quantum
mechanics concerning its experimental predictions, it offers novel types of
approximations not suggested by the latter. Of particular interest are
semi-classical approximations, where part of the system is treated classically.
Bohmian semi-classical approximations have been explored before for systems
without electromagnetic interactions. Here, the Rabi model is considered as a
simple model involving light-matter interaction. This model describes a single
mode electromagnetic field interacting with a two-level atom. As is well-known,
the quantum treatment and the semi-classical treatment (where the field is
treated classically rather than quantum mechanically) give qualitatively
different results. We analyse the Rabi model using a different semi-classical
approximation based on Bohmian mechanics. In this approximation, the
back-reaction from the two-level atom onto the classical field is mediated by
the Bohmian configuration of the two-level atom. We find that the Bohmian
semi-classical approximation gives results comparable to the usual mean field
one for the transition between ground and first excited state. Both
semi-classical approximations tend to reproduce the collapse of the population
inversion, but fail to reproduce the revival, which is characteristic of the
full quantum description. Also an example of a higher excited state is
presented where the Bohmian approximation does not perform so well.

  Automatic-Differentiable Information Gain Measure",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  At the heart of path-planning methods for autonomous robotic exploration is a
heuristic which encourages exploring unknown regions of the environment. Such
heuristics are typically computed using frontier-based or information-theoretic
methods. Frontier-based methods define the information gain of an exploration
path as the number of boundary cells, or frontiers, which are visible from the
path. However, the discrete and non-differentiable nature of this measure of
information gain makes it difficult to optimize using gradient-based methods.
In contrast, information-theoretic methods define information gain as the
mutual information between the sensor's measurements and the explored map.
However, computation of the gradient of mutual information involves finite
differencing and is thus computationally expensive. This work proposes an
exploration planning framework that combines sampling-based path planning and
gradient-based path optimization. The main contribution of this framework is a
novel reformulation of information gain as a differentiable function. This
allows us to simultaneously optimize information gain with other differentiable
quality measures, such as smoothness. The proposed planning framework's
effectiveness is verified both in simulation and in hardware experiments using
a Turtlebot3 Burger robot.

gravitational instability in razor-thin, non-viscous, self-gravitating
protoplanetary disks to understand the dependence of spiral arm morphology
(pitch angle $\alpha$ and amplitude) on various disk conditions. The
morphologies of the resulting spiral density wave modes closely resemble
observations. Their pitch angles and pattern speeds are insensitive to the
boundary conditions adopted. Gaussian disks exhibit more tightly wound spirals
(smaller pitch angle) than power law disks under the same conditions. We find
that at a fixed disk-to-star mass ratio ($M_d/M_*$), pitch angle increases with
average Toomre's stability parameter ($\overline Q$) or average disk aspect
ratio ($\overline h$). For a given $\overline Q$, density wave modes with
higher $M_d/M_*$ have larger pitch angles, while the behavior reverses for a
given $\overline h$. The interdependence between pitch angle and disk
properties can be roughly approximated by $\alpha\propto c_s^2/M_d$, where
$c_s$ is the sound speed. Our gravitational instability-excited spiral density
waves can be distinguished from planet-launched spirals: (1) massive cool disks
have spiral pitch angle falling with radius, while low-mass hot disks have
spiral pitch angle rising with radius; (2) the profile of spiral amplitude
presents several dips and bumps. We propose that gravitational
instability-excited density waves can serve as an alternative scenario to
explain the observed spiral arms in self-gravitating protoplanetary disks.

carefully the galaxy-halo relation and implement assembly bias effects into our

Considering a range of cluster masses, we see compelling evidence for

which to study star formation in an extreme environment. Previous high
resolution (1.9 pc) dust continuum observations from ALMA discovered 14
compact, massive super star clusters (SSCs) still in formation. We present here
ALMA data at 350 GHz with 28 milliarcsecond (0.5 pc) resolution. We detect
blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission (P-Cygni profiles) towards three
of these SSCs in multiple lines, including CS 7$-$6 and H$^{13}$CN 4$-$3, which
represents direct evidence for previously unobserved outflows. The mass
contained in these outflows is a significant fraction of the cluster gas
masses, which suggests we are witnessing a short but important phase. Further
evidence of this is the finding of a molecular shell around the only SSC
visible at near-IR wavelengths. We model the P-Cygni line profiles to constrain
the outflow geometry, finding that the outflows must be nearly spherical.
Through a comparison of the outflow properties with predictions from
simulations, we find that none of the available mechanisms completely explains
the observations, although dust-reprocessed radiation pressure and O star
stellar winds are the most likely candidates. The observed outflows will have a
very substantial effect on the clusters' evolution and star formation
efficiency.

examples where single-phase ionization models cannot reproduce the full set of
measured column densities. To explore models that can self-consistently explain
the measurements and kinematic alignment of disparate ions, we develop a
Bayesian multiphase ionization modeling framework that characterizes discrete
phases by their unique physical conditions and also investigates variations in
the shape of the UV flux field, metallicity, and relative abundances. Our
models require at least two (but favor three) distinct ionization phases
ranging from $T \approx 10^{4}$ K photoionized gas to warm-hot phases at $T

""component"" includes contributions from more than one phase, and up to 30% of
the H I is not from the lowest ionization phase. If we assume that all of the
phases are photoionized, we cannot find solutions in thermal pressure
equilibrium. By introducing hotter, collisionally ionized phases, however, we
can achieve balanced pressures. The best models indicate moderate
metallicities, often with sub-solar N/$\alpha$, and, in two cases, ionizing
flux fields that are softer and brighter than the fiducial Haardt & Madau UV

We fully re-calibrate the modified L-Galaxies model using a Markov Chain Monte

galaxies at $0\leq z\leq2$ as constraints. Due to this re-calibration, global
galaxy population relations, including the stellar mass function, quenched
fractions versus galaxy mass and HI mass function are all largely unchanged and
remain consistent with observations. By comparing to data on galaxy properties
in different environments from the SDSS and HSC surveys, we demonstrate that
our modified model improves the agreement with the quenched fractions and star
formation rates of galaxies as a function of environment, stellar mass, and
redshift. Overall, in the vicinity of haloes with total mass $10^{12}$ to
$10^{15}\rm M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, our new model produces higher quenched
fractions and stronger environmental dependencies, better recovering observed
trends with halocentric distance up to several virial radii. By analysing the
actual amount of gas stripped from galaxies in our model, we show that those in

quenching both within and beyond the halo boundary. This is likely to influence

study of theories with a higher-spin dark matter particle. In particular, it

only universal gravitational interactions, and is compatible with dark matter
masses in a very broad range from sub-TeV to the GUT scale. The other scenario

depletion times of $\sim 100$ Myr and thus be able to convert their gas very
quickly into stars, possibly leading to a rapid quenching of their star
formation. For these reasons, they are considered progenitors of massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs). In this paper, we study two high-$z$ starbursts,
AzTEC/C159 ($z\simeq 4.57$) and J1000+0234 ($z\simeq 4.54$), observed with ALMA
in the [CII] 158-$\mu$m emission line. These observations reveal two massive
and regularly rotating gaseous discs. A 3D modelling of these discs returns
rotation velocities of about $500$ km/s and gas velocity dispersions as low as
$\approx 20$ km/s, leading to very high ratios between regular and random
motion ($V/\sigma {\lower.7ex\hbox{$\;\stackrel{\textstyle>}{\sim}\;$}} 20$),

that both galaxies are highly baryon-dominated with gas masses of $\approx
10^{11}M_{\odot}$, which, for J1000+0234, is significantly higher than previous
estimates. We show that these high-$z$ galaxies overlap with $z=0$ massive ETGs
in the ETG analogue of the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation once their gas is
converted into stars. This provides dynamical evidence of the connection
between massive high-$z$ starbursts and ETGs, although the transformation
mechanism from fast rotating to nearly pressure-supported systems remains
unclear.

merging timescales of close pairs. We employ an empirical model for galaxy
formation that links galaxy properties to the growth of simulated dark matter
halos, along with mock lightcone galaxy catalogues, to probe the dependencies
of pair merging probabilities and merging timescales. In this work, we
demonstrate that the pair merging probabilities are best described by a
logistic function and that mean merging timescales can be well approximated by
a linear relation in the projected separation and line of sight velocity
difference in observed pairs. Together, our fitting formulae can accurately
predict merger rates from galaxy pairs to at least $z\sim4$ under a wide
variety of pair selection criteria. Additionally, we show that some commonly
used pair selection criteria may not represent a suitable sample of galaxies to
reproduce underlying merger rates. Finally, we conclude from our analysis that
observation timescales are primarily driven by dynamics and are not strongly
impacted by the star formation properties of the component galaxies.

perturbation blunts the effect of another, are typically interpreted as
evidence that the two perturbations impact the same cellular pathway or
function. Yet, this interpretation ignores extreme antagonistic interactions
wherein an otherwise deleterious perturbation compensates for the function lost
due to a prior perturbation. Here, we report on gene-environment interactions
involving genetic mutations that are deleterious in a permissive environment
but beneficial in a specific environment that restricts growth. These extreme
antagonistic interactions constitute gene-environment analogs of synthetic
rescues previously observed for gene-gene interactions. Our approach uses two
independent adaptive evolution steps to address the lack of experimental
methods to systematically identify such extreme interactions. We apply the
approach to Escherichia coli by successively adapting it to defined glucose
media without and with the antibiotic rifampicin. The approach identified
multiple mutations that are beneficial in the presence of rifampicin and
deleterious in its absence. The analysis of transcription shows that the
antagonistic adaptive mutations repress a stringent response-like
transcriptional program, while non-antagonistic mutations have an opposite
transcriptional profile. Our approach represents a step toward the systematic
characterization of extreme antagonistic gene-drug interactions, which can be
used to identify targets to select against antibiotic resistance.

an intense and fast starburst forms blue and disk-dominated galaxies. After

causes structural evolution and size growth. Given the stochastic nature of
mergers, a small fraction of red nuggets survives, without any interaction,
massive and compact until today: relic galaxies. Since this fraction depends on
the processes dominating the size growth, counting relics at low-z is a
valuable way to disentangle between different galaxy evolution models. In this
paper, we introduce the INvestigating Stellar Population In RElics (INSPIRE)

velocity dispersion. We also infer the stellar [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance from
line-index measurements and mass-weighted age and metallicity from
full-spectral fitting with single stellar population models. Two galaxies have
large integrated stellar velocity dispersion values, confirming their massive
nature. They are populated by stars with super-solar metallicity and
[$\alpha$/Fe]. Both objects have formed >80 % of their stellar mass within a
short (0.5 - 1.0 Gyrs) initial star formation episode occurred only ~1 Gyr
after the Big Bang. The third galaxy has a more extended star formation history
and a lower velocity dispersion. Thus we confirm two out of three candidates as

$\Upsilon_{\star \rm DYN}$ for the subsample of BCGs with no young stellar

reconcile the stellar population and dynamical modelling results although for a
small number of BCGs, a Kroupa (or even lighter) IMF is preferred. For those

to delay acceptance and general use of the revised series. We argue that the
solar observations constitute several distinct populations with different

supported by several proxies: diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field,
geomagnetic signature of the strength of the heliomagnetic field, and variation
of radionuclides. The Waldmeier effect shows that the sunspot number scale has
not changed over the last 270 years and a mistaken scale factor between

the early sunspot number scale; while a reconstruction of the group number with

terms of the number of vertices of $H$. Our results answer and address

theory. The optimal solution is a linear controller that requires access to the
state of the entire system at any given time. When considering a network
system, this renders the optimal controller a centralized one. The
interconnected nature of a network system often demands a distributed
controller, where different components of the system are controlled based only
on local information. Unlike the classical centralized case, obtaining the
optimal distributed controller is usually an intractable problem. Thus, we
adopt a graph neural network (GNN) as a parametrization of distributed
controllers. GNNs are naturally local and have distributed architectures,
making them well suited for learning nonlinear distributed controllers. By
casting the linear-quadratic problem as a self-supervised learning problem, we
are able to find the best GNN-based distributed controller. We also derive
sufficient conditions for the resulting closed-loop system to be stable. We run
extensive simulations to study the performance of GNN-based distributed
controllers and showcase that they are a computationally efficient
parametrization with scalability and transferability capabilities.

in fixed-parameter tractable algorithms in various communities including
combinatorics, integer-linear programming, and numerical analysis. Many NP-hard
problems are known to be solvable in $\widetilde{O}(n \cdot
2^{O(\mathrm{tw})})$ time, where $\mathrm{tw}$ is the treewidth of the input
graph. Analogously, many problems in P should be solvable in $\widetilde{O}(n
\cdot \mathrm{tw}^{O(1)})$ time; however, due to the lack of appropriate tools,
only a few such results are currently known. [Fom+18] conjectured this to hold
as broadly as all linear programs; in our paper, we show this is true:
  Given a linear program of the form $\min_{Ax=b,\ell \leq x\leq u} c^{\top}
x$, and a width-$\tau$ tree decomposition of a graph $G_A$ related to $A$, we
show how to solve it in time $$\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \tau^2 \log
(1/\varepsilon)),$$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $\varepsilon$ is
the relative accuracy. Combined with recent techniques in vertex-capacitated
flow [BGS21], this leads to an algorithm with $\widetilde{O}(n \cdot
\mathrm{tw}^2 \log (1/\varepsilon))$ run-time. Besides being the first of its
kind, our algorithm has run-time nearly matching the fastest run-time for
solving the sub-problem $Ax=b$ (under the assumption that no fast matrix
multiplication is used).
  We obtain these results by combining recent techniques in interior-point

string on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a
charged fermionic field in the background geometry of 4+1 dimensional anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The brane is parallel to the AdS boundary and the
cosmic string is orthogonal to the brane. Two types of boundary conditions are
considered on the brane that include the MIT bag boundary condition and the
boundary conditions in Z2-symmetric braneworld models. The brane divides the
space into two regions with different properties of the vacuum state. The only
nonzero component of the current density is along the azimuthal direction and
in both the regions the corresponding VEV is decomposed into the brane-free and
brane-induced contributions. The latter vanishes on the string and near the
string the total current is dominated by the brane-free part. At large
distances from the string and in the region between the brane and AdS horizon
the decay of the brane-induced current density, as a function of the proper
distance, is power-law for both massless and massive fields. For a massive
field this behavior is essentially different from that in the Minkowski bulk.
In the region between the brane and AdS boundary the large-distance decay of
the current density is exponential. Depending on the boundary condition on the
brane, the brane-induced contribution is dominant or subdominant in the total
current density at large distances from the string. By using the results for
fields realizing two inequivalent irreducible representations of the Clifford
algebra, the vacuum current density is investigated in C- and P-symmetric
fermionic models. Applications are given for a cosmic string in the
Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld model with a single brane.

learning framework that accurately predicts depth-specific temperature in
unmonitored lakes (targets) by borrowing models from well-monitored lakes
(sources). This method, Meta Transfer Learning (MTL), builds a meta-learning
model to predict transfer performance from candidate source models to targets
using lake attributes and candidates' past performance. We constructed source
models at 145 well-monitored lakes using calibrated process-based modeling (PB)
and a recently developed approach called process-guided deep learning (PGDL).
We applied MTL to either PB or PGDL source models (PB-MTL or PGDL-MTL,
respectively) to predict temperatures in 305 target lakes treated as
unmonitored in the Upper Midwestern United States. We show significantly
improved performance relative to the uncalibrated process-based General Lake
Model, where the median RMSE for the target lakes is $2.52^{\circ}C$. PB-MTL
yielded a median RMSE of $2.43^{\circ}C$; PGDL-MTL yielded $2.16^{\circ}C$; and
a PGDL-MTL ensemble of nine sources per target yielded $1.88^{\circ}C$. For
sparsely monitored target lakes, PGDL-MTL often outperformed PGDL models
trained on the target lakes themselves. Differences in maximum depth between
the source and target were consistently the most important predictors. Our
approach readily scales to thousands of lakes in the Midwestern United States,
demonstrating that MTL with meaningful predictor variables and high-quality
source models is a promising approach for many kinds of unmonitored systems and
environmental variables.

lexicographic product graph $G\circ H$ can be expressed in terms of five
different domination parameters of $G$. These parameters can be defined under
the following unified approach, which encompasses the definition of several
well-known domination parameters and introduces new ones. Let $N(v)$ denote the
open neighbourhood of $v\in V(G)$, and let $w=(w_0,w_1, \dots,w_l)$ be a vector
of nonnegative integers such that $ w_0\ge 1$. We say that a function $f:
V(G)\longrightarrow \{0,1,\dots ,l\}$ is a $w$-dominating function if
$f(N(v))=\sum_{u\in N(v)}f(u)\ge w_i$ for every vertex $v$ with $f(v)=i$. The
weight of $f$ is defined to be $\omega(f)=\sum_{v\in V(G)} f(v)$. The
$w$-domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{w}(G)$, is the minimum weight
among all $w$-dominating functions on $G$. If we impose restrictions on the
minimum degree of $G$ when needed, under this approach we can define, for
instance, the domination number, the total domination number, the
$k$-domination number, the $k$-tuple domination number, the $k$-tuple total
domination number, the Italian domination number, the total Italian domination
number, and the $\{k\}$-domination number. Specifically, we show that
$\gamma_{I}(G\circ H)=\gamma_{w}(G)$, where $w\in \{2\}\times\{0,1,2\}^{l}$ and
$l\in \{2,3\}$. The decision on whether the equality holds for specific values
of $w_0,\dots,w_l$ will depend on the value of the domination number of $H$.
This paper also provides preliminary results on $\gamma_{w}(G)$ and raises the

apply the tilting theory to the derived category of coherent sheaves, whose
objects label the Wilson loops, allowing us to pick a 'basis' for the latter.
We can then compute the fusion products in this basis and we show that the

unbound by interactions with baryonic objects such as stars. Here, we
characterize the spatial distribution and properties of miniclusters in the
Milky Way (MW) today after undergoing these stellar interactions throughout
their lifetime. We do this by performing a suite of Monte Carlo simulations
which track the miniclusters' structure and, in particular, accounts for
partial disruption and mass loss through successive interactions. We consider
two density profiles - Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Power-law (PL) - for the
individual miniclusters in order to bracket the uncertainties on the
minicluster population today due to their uncertain formation history. For our
fiducial analysis at the Solar position, we find a survival probability of 99%
for miniclusters with PL profiles and 46% for those with NFW profiles. Our work
extends previous estimates of this local survival probability to the entire MW.
We find that towards the Galactic center, the survival probabilities drop
drastically. Although we present results for a particular initial halo mass
function, our simulations can be easily recast to different models using the
provided data and code. Finally, we comment on the impact of our results on
lensing, direct, and indirect detection.

covariance steering problems for discrete-time stochastic (Gaussian) linear
systems. On the one hand, the minimum variance problem seeks for a control
policy that will steer the state mean of an uncertain system to a prescribed
quantity while minimizing the trace of its terminal state covariance (or
variance). On the other hand, the covariance steering problem seeks for a
control policy that will steer the covariance of the terminal state to a
prescribed positive definite matrix. We propose a solution approach that relies
on the stochastic version of the affine disturbance feedback control
parametrization according to which the control input at each stage can be
expressed as an affine function of the history of disturbances that have acted
upon the system. Our analysis reveals that this particular parametrization
allows one to reduce the stochastic optimal control problems considered herein
into tractable convex programs with essentially the same decision variables.
This is in contrast with other control policy parametrizations, such as the
state feedback parametrization, in which the decision variables of the convex
program do not coincide with the controller's parameters of the stochastic
optimal control problem. In addition, we propose a variation of the control
parametrization which relies on truncated histories of past disturbances. We
show that by selecting the length of the truncated sequences appropriately, we
can design suboptimal controllers which can strike the desired balance between
performance and computational cost.

a conventional QR factorization-based Gauss-Newton solver. It then uses the

characterizing low-energy collective excitations in materials. RIXS is a
powerful probe, which often requires sophisticated theoretical descriptions to
interpret the data. In particular, the need for accurate theories describing
the influence of electron-phonon ($e$-p) coupling on RIXS spectra is becoming
timely, as instrument resolution improves and this energy regime is rapidly
becoming accessible. To date, only rather exploratory theoretical work has been
carried out for such problems. We begin to bridge this gap by proposing a
versatile variational approximation for calculating RIXS spectra in weakly
doped materials, for a variety of models with diverse $e$-p couplings. Here, we
illustrate some of its potential by studying the role of electron mobility,
which is completely neglected in the widely used local approximation based on
Lang-Firsov theory. Assuming that the electron-phonon coupling is of the
simplest, Holstein type, we discuss the regimes where the local approximation
fails, and demonstrate that its improper use may grossly \textit{underestimate}
the $e$-p coupling strength.

models for radiographic and histologic modalities and combines them through an
ensemble method. The classification algorithm initially carries out tile-level

whole-slide and whole-volume sub-type prediction. The classification algorithm
was evaluated using the data set provided in the CPM-RadPath 2020 challenge.

in the era of the Internet of Things and big data in which data is essentially

measure on $\text{U}(n)$. The density $e^{\text{tr}(U\Lambda U^*Y)}$ is known
as the HCIZ density. Random unitary matrices distributed according to the HCIZ
density are important in various settings in physics and random matrix theory.
However, the basic question of efficient sampling from the HCIZ distribution
has remained open. We present two efficient algorithms to sample matrices from
distributions that are close to the HCIZ distribution. The first algorithm
outputs samples that are $\xi$-close in total variation distance and requires
polynomially many arithmetic operations in $\log 1/\xi$ and the number of bits
needed to encode $Y$ and $\Lambda$. The second algorithm comes with a stronger
guarantee that the samples are $\xi$-close in infinity divergence, but the
number of arithmetic operations depends polynomially on $1/\xi$, the number of
bits needed to encode $Y$ and $\Lambda$, and the differences of the largest and
the smallest eigenvalues of $Y$ and $\Lambda$.
  HCIZ densities can also be viewed as exponential densities on
$\text{U}(n)$-orbits, and these densities have been studied in statistics,
machine learning, and theoretical computer science. Thus our results have the
following applications: 1) an efficient algorithm to sample from complex
versions of matrix Langevin distributions studied in statistics, 2) an
efficient algorithm to sample from continuous max-entropy distributions on
unitary orbits, which implies an efficient algorithm to sample a pure quantum
state from the entropy-maximizing ensemble representing a given density matrix,
and 3) an efficient algorithm for differentially private rank-$k$

lot of image training data of the subject which is not an issue if the subject
is a celebrity for whom many images already exist. If there are only a small
number of training images then the quality of the deepfake will be poor. Some
media reports have indicated that a good deepfake can be produced with as few

the physical layout of an Intel Knights Landing processor, with a particular

developed tool for the analysis of the empirical measure of a small noise
diffusion to transform the variance reduction problem into an explicit
optimization problem. Our first analysis of the optimization problem is in the
setting of a double well model, and it shows that the optimal selection of
temperature ratios is a geometric sequence except possibly the highest
temperature. In the same setting we identify two different sources of variance
reduction, and show how their competition determines the optimal highest
temperature. In the general multi-well setting we prove that a pure geometric
sequence of temperature ratios is always nearly optimal, with a performance gap
that decays geometrically in the number of temperatures.

this learning approach does not require a carefully constructed reward

accounted for in the gait generation or in the controller. In both experiments,
the framework achieves stable, robust, efficient, and natural walking in fewer

3-regular graphs. We explore the idea of improving the solutions returned by
the simplest version of the algorithm (depth-1 QAOA) using a form of
postselection that can be efficiently simulated by state preparation. We derive
theoretical upper and lower bounds showing that a constant (though small)
increase of the fraction of satisfied edges is indeed achievable. Numerical
experiments on large problem instances (beyond classical simulatability)
complement and support our bounds. We also consider a distinct technique: local
updates, which can be applied not only to QAOA but any optimization algorithm.
In the case of QAOA, the resulting improvement can be sharply quantified
theoretically for large problem instances and in absence of postselection.
Combining postselection and local updates, the theory is no longer tractable

difficult in acene dimers where the formation of the triplet-triplet spin
biexciton is truly ultrafast. Conversely, relatively slower biexciton formation

uncertainty of the reported incidents challenge the design of such a proactive

Accordingly, security between such tags and readers have primarily been studied
among many issues of RFID. However, the authenticity of data cannot be
guaranteed if logistics services can give false information. Although the use
of blockchain is often discussed, it is simply a recording system, so there is
a risk that false records may be written to it.
  As a solution, we propose a design in which a digitally signing,
location-constrained and tamper-evident reader atomically writes an evidence to
blockchain along with its reading and writing a tag.
  By semi-formal modeling, we confirmed that the confidentiality and integrity
of the information can be maintained throughout the system, and digitally
signed data can be verified later despite possible compromise of private keys
or signature algorithms, or expiration of public key certificates. We also
introduce a prototype design to show that our proposal is viable.
  This makes it possible to trace authentic logistics information using
inexpensive passive RFID tags. Furthermore, by abstracting the reader/writer as
a sensor/actuator, this model can be extended to IoT in general.

pre-supernova (SN) mass loss and outbursts, some of which could be powered by
wave energy transport within the progenitor star. Depending on the star's
structure, convectively excited waves driven by late stage nuclear burning can
carry substantial energy from the core to the envelope, where the wave energy
is dissipated as heat. We examine the process of wave energy transport in
single-star SNe progenitors with masses between $11-50 M_{\odot}$. Using MESA
stellar evolution simulations, we evolve stars until core collapse and
calculate the wave power produced and transmitted to the stars' envelopes.
These models improve upon prior efforts by incorporating a more realistic wave
spectrum and non-linear damping effects, reducing our wave heating estimates by
$\sim$ 1 order of magnitude compared to prior work. We find that waves excited
during oxygen/neon burning typically transmit $10^{46-47}$ erg of energy at
0.1-10 years before core collapse in typical ($M < 30 M_\odot$) SN progenitors.
High-mass progenitors can often transmit $\sim 10^{47-48}$ erg of energy during
oxygen/neon burning, but this tends to occur later, at about 0.01-0.1 years
before core collapse. Pre-SN outbursts may be most pronounced in low-mass SN
progenitors ($M \lesssim 12 M_\odot$) undergoing semi-degenerate neon ignition,
and in high-mass progenitors ($M \gtrsim 30 M_\odot$) exhibiting convective
shell mergers.

learning and iterative learning. Acquisition and transmission of speech is
modeled by training generations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on
unannotated raw speech data. The paper argues that several properties of sound
change emerge from the proposed architecture. GANs (Goodfellow et al. 2014
arXiv:1406.2661, Donahue et al. 2019 arXiv:1705.07904) are uniquely appropriate
for modeling language change because the networks are trained on raw
unsupervised acoustic data, contain no language-specific features and, as
argued in Begu\v{s} (2020 arXiv:2006.03965), encode phonetic and phonological
representations in their latent space and generate linguistically informative
innovative data. The first generation of networks is trained on the relevant
sequences in human speech from TIMIT. The subsequent generations are not
trained on TIMIT, but on generated outputs from the previous generation and
thus start learning from each other in an iterative learning task. The initial
allophonic distribution is progressively being lost with each generation,
likely due to pressures from the global distribution of aspiration in the
training data. The networks show signs of a gradual shift in phonetic targets
characteristic of a gradual phonetic sound change. At endpoints, the outputs
superficially resemble a phonological change -- rule loss.

through operations such as $k$-XOR applied to ""local views"" of codewords of
$\mathcal{C}$, according to a suitable $k$-uniform hypergraph. The $k$-XOR
operation yields the direct sum encoding used in works of [Ta-Shma, STOC 2017]
and [Dinur and Kaufman, FOCS 2017].
  We give a general framework for list decoding such lifted codes, as long as
the base code admits a unique decoding algorithm, and the hypergraph used for
lifting satisfies certain expansion properties. We show that these properties
are satisfied by the collection of length $k$ walks on an expander graph, and
by hypergraphs corresponding to high-dimensional expanders. Instantiating our
framework, we obtain list decoding algorithms for direct sum liftings on the
above hypergraph families. Using known connections between direct sum and
direct product, we also recover the recent results of Dinur et al. [SODA 2019]
on list decoding for direct product liftings.
  Our framework relies on relaxations given by the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) SDP
hierarchy for solving various constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We view
the problem of recovering the closest codeword to a given word, as finding the
optimal solution of a CSP. Constraints in the instance correspond to edges of
the lifting hypergraph, and the solutions are restricted to lie in the base
code $\mathcal{C}$. We show that recent algorithms for (approximately) solving
CSPs on certain expanding hypergraphs also yield a decoding algorithm for such
lifted codes.
  We extend the framework to list decoding, by requiring the SOS solution to
minimize a convex proxy for negative entropy. We show that this ensures a
covering property for the SOS solution, and the ""condition and round"" approach
used in several SOS algorithms can then be used to recover the required list of
codewords.

acceleration of iterative methods for solving large-scale linear systems. These
methods often work by augmenting a solution subspace generated iteratively by a
known algorithm with a fixed subspace of vectors which are ``useful'' for
solving the problem. Often, this has the effect of inducing a projected version
of the original linear system to which the known iterative method is then
applied, and this projection can act as a deflation preconditioner,
accelerating convergence. Most often, these methods have been applied for the
solution of well-posed problems. However, they have also begun to be considered
for the solution of ill-posed problems.
  In this paper, we consider subspace augmentation-type iterative schemes
applied to linear ill-posed problems in a continuous Hilbert space setting,
based on a recently developed framework describing these methods. We show that
under suitable assumptions, a recycling method satisfies the formal definition
of a regularization, as long as the underlying scheme is itself a

play crucial roles for fully exploiting the potential of gravitational wave
astronomy. One approach to pursue this direction is the utilization of laser
interferometers equipped with the Fabry-Perot optical cavities in space.
However, a number of challenges lie in this path practically. In particular,
the implementation of precision control for the cavity lengths and the
suppression of laser phase noises may prevent a practical detector design. To
circumvent such difficulties, we propose a new interferometer topology, named
the back-linked Fabry-Perot interferometer, where the precision length controls
are not required and an offline subtraction scheme for laser phase noises is
readily applicable. This article presents the principle idea and the associated
sensitivity analyses. Despite additional noises, a strain sensitivity of
$7\times 10^{-23}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ may be attainable in the deci-Hertz band.
Several technological developments and studies must be carried out to pave the
way forward for the implementation.

occur in ITER even when the walls are perfect conductors, as a consequence of
the current quench [A. H. Boozer, Physics of Plasmas 26 114501 (2019)]. We used
the extended-MHD code M3D-C1 with an ITER-like equilibrium and induced a
current quench to explore cold VDEs in the limit of perfectly conducting walls,
using different wall geometries. In the particular case of a rectangular wall
with the side walls far away from the plasma, we obtained very good agreement
with the analytical model developed by Boozer that considers a top/bottom
flat-plates wall. We show that the solution in which the plasma stays at the
initial equilibrium position is improved when bringing the side walls closer to
the plasma. When using the ITER first wall in the limit of a perfect conductor,
the plasma stays stable at the initial equilibrium position far beyond the
value predicted by the flat-plates wall limit. On the other hand, when
considering the limit in which the inner shell of the ITER vacuum vessel is
acting as a perfect conductor, the plasma is displaced during the current
quench but the edge safety factor stays above $2$ longer in the current decay
compared to the flat-plates wall limit. In all the simulated cases, the
vertical displacement is found to be strongly dependent on the plasma current,
in agreement with a similar finding in the flat-plates wall limit, showing an
important difference with usual VDEs in which the current quench is not a

better diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection. Clinical trials have been
the gold standard for determining causality, but they are resource intensive,
sometimes infeasible or unethical. Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain a
wealth of real-world data that holds promise for the discovery of disease
mechanisms, yet the existing causal structure discovery (CSD) methods fall
short on leveraging them due to the special characteristics of the EHR data. We
propose a new data transformation method and a novel CSD algorithm to overcome
the challenges posed by these characteristics. Materials and methods: We
demonstrated the proposed methods on an application to type-2 diabetes
mellitus. We used a large EHR data set from Mayo Clinic to internally evaluate
the proposed transformation and CSD methods and used another large data set
from an independent health system, Fairview Health Services, as external
validation. We compared the performance of our proposed method to Fast Greedy
Equivalence Search (FGES), a state-of-the-art CSD method in terms of
correctness, stability and completeness. We tested the generalizability of the
proposed algorithm through external validation. Results and conclusions: The
proposed method improved over the existing methods by successfully
incorporating study design considerations, was robust in face of unreliable EHR
timestamps and inferred causal effect directions more correctly and reliably.
The proposed data transformation successfully improved the clinical correctness
of the discovered graph and the consistency of edge orientation across
bootstrap samples. It resulted in superior accuracy, stability, and
completeness.

super-resolution(SISR) due to the development of deep learning in the field of
computer vision. In these method, the high resolution input image is
down-scaled to low resolution space using a single filter, commonly
max-pooling, before feature extraction. This means that the feature extraction
is performed in biased filtered feature space. We demonstrate that this is
sub-optimal and causes information loss. In this work, we proposed a
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network method called Dense U-net with
shuffle pooling. To achieve this, a modified U-net with dense blocks, called
dense U-net, is proposed for SISR. Then, a new pooling strategy called shuffle
pooling is designed, which is aimed to replace the dense U-Net for down-scale
operation. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted filter in the
SISR pipeline with more lossy down-sampling filters specifically trained for
each feature map, whilst also reducing the information loss of the overall SISR
operation. In addition, a mix loss function, which combined with Mean Square
Error(MSE), Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) and Mean Gradient Error (MGE),
comes up to reduce the perception loss and high-level information loss. Our
proposed method achieves superior accuracy over previous state-of-the-art on

Homogeneous components of a Nottingham algebra have dimension one or two, and
in the latter case they are called diamonds. The first diamond occurs in degree
$1$, and the second occurs in degree $q$, a power of the characteristic. Many
examples of Nottingham algebras are known, in which each diamond past the first

  A prospective classification of Nottingham algebras requires describing all

contributions towards that goal. One is showing that all diamonds, past the
first, of an arbitrary Nottingham algebra $L$ can be assigned a type, in such a
way that the degrees and types of the diamonds completely describe $L$. At the

the primary mechanism for data storage is thermal excitation. However, there is
a limited body of research regarding the thermal properties of PCMs at length

on PCM operation is unknown. Our work presents a new paradigm to manage thermal
transport in memory cells by manipulating the interfacial thermal resistance
between the phase change unit and the electrodes without incorporating
additional insulating layers. Experimental measurements show a substantial
change in thermal boundary resistance as GST transitions from one
crystallographic structure (cubic) to another (hexagonal) and as the thickness
of tungsten contacts is reduced from five to two nanometers. Simulations reveal
that interfacial resistance between the phase change unit and its adjacent
layer can reduce the reset current for 20 and 120 nm diameter devices by up to
~40% and ~50%, respectively. The resultant phase-dependent and geometric
effects on thermal boundary resistance dictate that the effective thermal
conductivity of the phase change unit can be reduced by a factor of four,
presenting a new opportunity to reduce operating currents in PCMs.

binary codes of distance $1/2 -\epsilon$ and rate $\Omega(\epsilon^2)$ (where
an upper bound of $O(\epsilon^2\log(1/\epsilon))$ is known). Ta-Shma [STOC
2017] gave an explicit construction of $\epsilon$-balanced binary codes, where
any two distinct codewords are at a distance between $1/2 -\epsilon/2$ and
$1/2+\epsilon/2$, achieving a near optimal rate of
$\Omega(\epsilon^{2+\beta})$, where $\beta \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$.
  We develop unique and list decoding algorithms for (essentially) the family
of codes constructed by Ta-Shma. We prove the following results for
$\epsilon$-balanced codes with block length $N$ and rate
$\Omega(\epsilon^{2+\beta})$ in this family:
  - For all $\epsilon, \beta > 0$ there are explicit codes which can be
uniquely decoded up to an error of half the minimum distance in time
$N^{O_{\epsilon, \beta}(1)}$.
  - For any fixed constant $\beta$ independent of $\epsilon$, there is an
explicit construction of codes which can be uniquely decoded up to an error of
half the minimum distance in time $(\log(1/\epsilon))^{O(1)} \cdot
N^{O_\beta(1)}$.
  - For any $\epsilon > 0$, there are explicit $\epsilon$-balanced codes with
rate $\Omega(\epsilon^{2+\beta})$ which can be list decoded up to error $1/2 -
\epsilon'$ in time $N^{O_{\epsilon,\epsilon',\beta}(1)}$, where $\epsilon',
\beta \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$.
  The starting point of our algorithms is the list decoding framework from Alev
et al. [SODA 2020], which uses the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy. The rates
obtained there were quasipolynomial in $\epsilon$. Here, we show how to
overcome the far from optimal rates of this framework obtaining unique decoding

magneto-crystalline anisotropy. First of all, at both the helical-to-conical
and the conical-to-ferromagnetic transitions, taking place at H$_{c1}$ and
H$_{c2}$, respectively, the cubic anisotropy leads to reversible or
irreversible jump-like reorientations of the spiral wavevectors. The subtle
interplay between the easy and hard anisotropy axes gives rise to a phase
transition between elliptically distorted conical states almost without any
detectable change in the period. We show that the competition between on-site
cubic and exchange anisotropy terms can also lead to oblique spiral states. Our
work gives clear directions for further experimental studies to reveal
theoretically predicted spiral states in cubic helimagnets beyond the
aforementioned well-established states thus, can help to understand the
magnetic phase diagram of these archetypal skyrmion hosts. In addition, we show
that properties of isolated skyrmions such as inter-skyrmion attraction,
orientation and/or nucleation are also rooted in the properties of host spirals

mechanism of ICD induction from near field interaction of chiral molecule with
achiral nanostructure. By introducing dipole approaching of chiral molecule and
a near field approximation of molecule-nanostructure interaction, we derived an

dipole radiation of chiral molecules breaks the enantiomorphic relationship of
the electric field strengths in the nanostructure. Furthermore, the derived
formula exhibits ICD proportional to molecules chirality parameter and number
density, and it exponentially increases with the inverse cube of distance
between molecule and nanostructure. Most importantly, the formula shows that
ICD is proportional to strengths of electric field in nanostructure and
magnetic field in molecular region. To verify the analytical results, we
studied the ICD properties of graphene nanohole metasurface (GNM) and chiral

in the relativistic chiral effective field theory at leading order. First, the
potentials are derived from the $S=-1$ sector assuming that the corresponding
low-energy constants are related to each other via SU(3) flavor symmetry. The
comparison with the state-of-the-art lattice QCD simulations, show, however,
that SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effects can not be neglected. In order to
take into account these effects, we redetermine two sets of low-energy
constants by fitting to the lattice QCD data in the $\Xi\Sigma$ and $\Xi\Xi$
channels respectively. The fitting results demonstrate that the lattice QCD
$S$-waves phase shifts for both channels can be described rather well. Without
any additional free low-energy constants, the predicted phase shifts for the
${}^3D_1$ channel and the mixing angle $\varepsilon_1$ are also in qualitative
agreement with the lattice QCD data for the $S=-3$ channel, while the results
for the $S=-4$ channel remain to be checked by future lattice QCD simulations.
With the so-obtained low-energy constants, the $S$-wave scattering lengths and
effective ranges are calculated for these two channels at the physical point.
Finally, in combination with the $S=0$ and $-2$ results obtained in our
previous works, we study the evolution of the irreducible representation $27$
in the baryon-baryon interactions as a function of increasing strangeness. It
is shown that the attraction decreases dramatically as strangeness increases
from $S=0$ to $S=-2$, but then remains relatively stable until $S=-4$. The
results indicate that the existence of bound states in the $\Xi\Sigma$ and
$\Xi\Xi$ channels is rather unlikely.

clearer picture of residential electricity use, it becomes increasingly
apparent that we must also construct a detailed picture and understanding of
consumer's complex relationship with gas consumption. Both electricity and gas
consumption patterns are highly dependent on various factors, and the intricate
interplay of these factors is sophisticated. Moreover, since typical gas
consumption data is low granularity with very few time points, naive
application of conventional time-series forecasting techniques can lead to
severe over-fitting. Given these considerations, we construct a stacked GP
method where the predictive posteriors of each GP applied to each task are used
in the prior and likelihood of the next level GP. We apply our model to a

long-term disability, possibly leading to early mortality and currently,
limited safe and effective therapies exist. A double-blinded randomized
placebo-controlled trial (CEQUEL study) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy
of Lamotrigine plus Quetiapine versus Quetiapine monotherapy in patients with
bipolar type I or type II disorders.
  Objective: The objective of our study was to reanalyze CEQUEL data and
determine an unbiased classification accuracy for active lamotrigine versus
placebo. We also wanted to establish the time it took for the drug to provide
statistically significant outcomes.
  Methods: Between October 21, 2008 and April 27, 2012, 202 participants from
27 sites in United Kingdom were randomly assigned to two treatments; 101:
lamotrigine, 101: placebo. The primary variable used for estimating depressive
symptoms was based on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self
report version 16 (QIDS-SR16). We analyze the data using feature engineering
and simple classifiers.
  Results: From weeks 10 to 14, the mean difference in QIDS-SR16 ratings
between the groups was -1.6317 (P=.09; sample size=81, 77; 95% CI -0.2403 to
3.5036). From weeks 48 to 52, the mean difference was -2.0032 (P=.09; sample
size=54, 48; 95% CI -0.3433 to 4.3497). The coefficient of variation and
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) exponent alpha had the greatest
explanatory power. The out-of-sample classification accuracy for the 138
participants who reported more than 10 times after week 12 was 62%. A
consistent classification accuracy higher than the no-information benchmark was
obtained in week 44.
  Conclusions: Lamotrigine plus Quetiapine treatment decreased depressive
symptoms in patients, but with substantial temporal instability. A trial of at
least 44 weeks was required to achieve consistent results.

intriguing properties also render them fairly intractable through typical
perturbative treatments. For this reason, the mechanisms responsible for these
technologically promising properties remain mostly elusive. Computational
approaches have played a major role in efforts to fill this void. In
particular, dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its cluster extension, the
dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) have allowed significant progress.
However, despite all the insightful results of these embedding schemes,
computational constraints, such as the minus sign problem in Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC), and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space in exact
diagonalization (ED) methods, still limit the length scale within which
correlations can be treated exactly in the formalism. A recent advance to
overcome these difficulties is the development of multiscale many body
approaches whereby this challenge is addressed by introducing an intermediate
length scale between the short length scale where correlations are treated
exactly using a cluster solver such QMC or ED, and the long length scale where
correlations are treated in a mean field manner. At this intermediate length
scale correlations can be treated perturbatively. This is the essence of
multiscale many-body methods. We will review various implementations of these
multiscale many-body approaches, the results they have produced, and the
outstanding challenges that should be addressed for further advances.

utilizes the correlation to obtain the really hard negative samples and aims to

only are suitable for settings with real-time requirements but also provide
provable performance guarantees. To this end, they merge noisy data from only a
single finite-horizon trajectory and, if available, various forms of side

the dynamics, algebraic constraints on the states, monotonicity, or decoupling
in the dynamics between the states. Specifically, we develop two algorithms,
$\texttt{DaTaReach}$ and $\texttt{DaTaControl}$, to over-approximate the
reachable set and design control signals for the system on the fly.
$\texttt{DaTaReach}$ constructs a differential inclusion that contains the
unknown dynamics. Then, in a discrete-time setting, it over-approximates the
reachable set through interval Taylor-based methods applied to systems with
dynamics described as differential inclusions. We provide a bound on the time
step size that ensures the correctness and termination of $\texttt{DaTaReach}$.
$\texttt{DaTaControl}$ enables convex-optimization-based control using the
computed over-approximation and the receding-horizon control framework.
Besides, $\texttt{DaTaControl}$ achieves near-optimal control and is suitable
for real-time control of such systems. We establish a bound on its
suboptimality and the number of primitive operations it requires to compute
control values. Then, we theoretically show that $\texttt{DaTaControl}$
achieves tighter suboptimality bounds with an increasing amount of data and
richer side information. Finally, experiments on a unicycle, quadrotor, and
aircraft systems demonstrate the efficacy of both algorithms over existing

locales of neutron stars is of great interest to the understanding of accreting
X-ray pulsars, rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars. This paper explores
scattering transport in the classical magnetic Thomson domain that is of broad
applicability to these neutron star classes. The development of a Monte Carlo
simulation for the polarized radiative transfer is detailed: it employs an
electric field vector formalism to enable a breadth of utility in relating
linear, circular and elliptical polarizations. The simulation can be applied to
any neutron star surface locale, and is adaptable to accretion column and
magnetospheric problems. Validation of the code for both intensity and Stokes
parameter determination is illustrated in a variety of ways. Representative
results for emergent polarization signals from surface layers are presented for
both polar and equatorial magnetic locales, exhibiting contrasting signatures
between the two regions. There is also a strong dependence of these
characteristics on the ratio of the frequency of a photon to the cyclotron
frequency. Polarization signatures for high opacity domains are presented,
highlighting compact analytic approximations for the Stokes parameters and
anisotropy relative to the local field direction for an extended range of
frequencies. These are very useful in defining injection conditions deep in the
simulation slab geometries, expediting the generation of emission signals from
highly opaque stellar atmospheres. The results are interpreted throughout using

achievable rate over the single-input single-output wireless communication

circuit-theoretic multiport models for radio communication systems, we derive
the information-theoretic limits of compact antennas. We first describe an
equivalent Chu's antenna circuit under the physical realizability conditions of
its reflection coefficient. Such a design allows us to subsequently compute the
achievable rate for a given receive antenna size thereby providing a physical
bound on the system performance that we compare to the standard
size-unconstrained Shannon capacity. We also determine the effective
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which strongly depends on the antenna size and
experiences an apparent finite-size performance degradation where only a
fraction of Shannon capacity can be achieved. We further determine the optimal
signaling bandwidth which shows that impedance matching is essential in both
narrowband and broadband scenarios. We also examine the achievable rate in
presence of interference showing that the size constraint is immaterial in
interference-limited scenarios. Finally, our numerical results of the derived
achievable rate as function of the antenna size and the SNR reveal new insights

our study is threefold: 1) to measure the proportion of defects for which the

to compare the accuracy of the proposed method versus three SZZ

stable life cycle in terms of the proportion of the number of versions affected
by the defects before discovering and fixing these defects. Results related to
212 open-source projects from the Apache ecosystem, featuring a total of about
125,000 defects, reveal that the realistic method cannot be used in the
majority (51%) of defects. Therefore, it is important to develop automated
methods to retrieve AVs. Results related to 76 open-source projects from the
Apache ecosystem, featuring a total of about 6,250,000 classes, affected by
60,000 defects, and spread over 4,000 versions and 760,000 commits, reveal that
the proportion of the number of versions between defect discovery and fix is
pretty stable (STDV < 2) across the defects of the same project. Moreover, the
proposed method resulted significantly more accurate than all three SZZ
implementations in (i) retrieving AVs, (ii) labeling classes as defective, and
(iii) in developing defects repositories to perform feature selection. Thus,
when the realistic method is unusable, the proposed method is a valid automated
alternative to SZZ for retrieving the origin of a defect. Finally, given the
low accuracy of SZZ, researchers should consider re-executing the studies that
have used SZZ as an oracle and, in general, should prefer selecting projects

Foundation accordingly convened a workshop, bringing together speech, language,

report, in which we identify key scientific and engineering advances needed.
  Our recommendations broadly relate to eight general themes. First, meeting
human needs requires addressing new challenges in speech technology and user
experience design. Second, this requires better models of the social and
interactive aspects of language use. Third, for robustness, robots need
higher-bandwidth communication with users and better handling of uncertainty,
including simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses and goals. Fourth,
more powerful adaptation methods are needed, to enable robots to communicate in
new environments, for new tasks, and with diverse user populations, without
extensive re-engineering or the collection of massive training data. Fifth,
since robots are embodied, speech should function together with other
communication modalities, such as gaze, gesture, posture, and motion. Sixth,
since robots operate in complex environments, speech components need access to
rich yet efficient representations of what the robot knows about objects,
locations, noise sources, the user, and other humans. Seventh, since robots
operate in real time, their speech and language processing components must
also. Eighth, in addition to more research, we need more work on infrastructure
and resources, including shareable software modules and internal interfaces,
inexpensive hardware, baseline systems, and diverse corpora.

to their high modelling power, but are not compatible with state-of-the-art
independent vector analysis based on majorization-minimization (AuxIVA), since
deriving the required surrogate function is not easy, nor always possible.
Instead, we do away with exact majorization and directly approximate the
surrogate. Taking advantage of iterative source steering (ISS) updates, we back
propagate the permutation invariant separation loss through multiple iterations
of AuxIVA. ISS lends itself well to this task due to its lower complexity and
lack of matrix inversion. Experiments show large improvements in terms of scale
invariant signal-to-distortion (SDR) ratio and word error rate compared to
baseline methods. Training is done on two speakers mixtures and we experiment
with two losses, SDR and coherence. We find that the learnt approximate
surrogate generalizes well on mixtures of three and four speakers without any
modification. We also demonstrate generalization to a different variation of
the AuxIVA update equations. The SDR loss leads to fastest convergence in
iterations, while coherence leads to the lowest word error rate (WER). We
obtain as much as 36 % reduction in WER.

well-studied problems in terms of the parameter $k$: Densest $k$-Subgraph,
Smallest $k$-Edge Subgraph, Densest $k$-Subhypergraph, Steiner $k$-Forest, and
Directed Steiner Network with $k$ terminal pairs. For example, we show, under
SPCH, that no polynomial time algorithm achieves $o(k)$-approximation for
Densest $k$-Subgraph. This inapproximability ratio improves upon the previous
best $k^{o(1)}$ factor from (Chalermsook et al., FOCS 2017). Furthermore, our
lower bounds hold even against fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with
parameter $k$.

problem: Suppose we are given a metric system (M, X), which contains k metrics
M = {\rho_1,..., \rho_k} defined on the same point set X. We aim to find a
maximum subset X' of X such that all metrics in M are ""consistent"" when
restricted on the subset X'. In particular, our definition of consistency will
rely only on the ordering between pairwise distances, and thus we call a
""consistent"" subset an ordinal consensus of X w.r.t. M. We will introduce two
concepts of ""consistency"" in the ordinal sense: a strong one and a weak one.
Specifically, a subset X' is strongly consistent means that the ordering of
their pairwise distances is the same under each of the input metric \rho_i from
M. The weak consistency, on the other hand, relaxes this exact ordering
condition, and intuitively allows us to take the plurality of ordering relation
between two pairwise distances.
  We show in this paper that the maximum consensus problems over both the
strong and the weak consistency notions are NP-complete, even when there are
only 2 or 3 simple metrics, such as line metrics and ultrametrics. We also
develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for the dual version, the

better accuracy than continuous pressure models even for highly permeable

act as barriers for the other phase, resulting in a pressure discontinuity at

state structure of the nuclei. In particular, the onset of deformation when
passing from $^{98}$Zr to $^{100}$Zr is one of the fastest ever observed in the
nuclear chart. It has been probed both experimental and theoretically that
certain low-lying excited states of Zr isotopes own different shapes than the
ground state.
  Purpose: We intend to disentangle the interplay between the sudden changes in
the ground state shape, i.e., the existence of a quantum phase transition, and
the presence in the spectra of coexisting states with very different
deformation, i.e., the presence of shape coexistence.
  Method: We rely on a previous calculation using the Interacting Boson Model
with Configuration Mixing (IBM-CM) which reproduces in detail the spectroscopic
properties of $^{96-110}$Zr. This IBM-CM calculation allows to compute
mean-field energy surfaces, wave functions and any other observable related
with the presence of shape coexistence or with a quantum phase transition.
  Results: We obtain energy surfaces and the equilibrium value of the
deformation parameter $\beta$, the U(5) decomposition of the wave functions and
the density of states.
  Conclusions: We confirm that Zr is a clear example of quantum phase
transition that originates from the crossing of two configurations with a very
different degree of deformation. Moreover, we observe how the intruder
configuration exhibits its own evolution which resembles a quantum phase
transition too.

solution for privacy-preserving distributed learning over wireless networks.
Air-FEEL allows ""one-shot"" over-the-air aggregation of gradient/model-updates
by exploiting the waveform superposition property of wireless channels, and
thus promises an extremely low aggregation latency that is independent of the
network size. However, such communication efficiency may come at a cost of
learning performance degradation due to the aggregation error caused by the
non-uniform channel fading over devices and noise perturbation. Prior work
adopted channel inversion power control (or its variants) to reduce the
aggregation error by aligning the channel gains, which, however, could be
highly suboptimal in deep fading scenarios due to the noise amplification. To
overcome this issue, we investigate the power control optimization for
enhancing the learning performance of Air-FEEL. Towards this end, we first
analyze the convergence behavior of the Air-FEEL by deriving the optimality gap
of the loss-function under any given power control policy. Then we optimize the
power control to minimize the optimality gap for accelerating convergence,
subject to a set of average and maximum power constraints at edge devices. The
problem is generally non-convex and challenging to solve due to the coupling of
power control variables over different devices and iterations. To tackle this
challenge, we develop an efficient algorithm by jointly exploiting the
successive convex approximation (SCA) and trust region methods. Numerical
results show that the optimized power control policy achieves significantly
faster convergence than the benchmark policies such as channel inversion and
uniform power transmission.

This paper proposes a deep time delay neural network (TDNN) for speech
enhancement with full data learning. The TDNN has excellent potential for
capturing long range temporal contexts, which utilizes a modular and
incremental design. Besides, the TDNN preserves the feed-forward structure so
that its inference cost is comparable to standard DNN. To make full use of the
training data, we propose a full data learning method for speech enhancement.
More specifically, we not only use the noisy-to-clean (input-to-target) to
train the enhanced model, but also the clean-to-clean and noise-to-silence
data. Therefore, all of the training data can be used to train the enhanced
model. Our experiments are conducted on TIMIT dataset. Experimental results
show that our proposed method could achieve a better performance than DNN and
comparable even better performance than BLSTM. Meanwhile, compared with the

wavelength shorter than a basic gain length is able to suppress the inflation
of SRS through harmonic waves. And, the PIC simulations qualitatively agree
with our Vlasov simulations. Our results offer an alternative explanation of
high reflectivity at underdense plasma in experiments, which is due to
long-wavelength modulation, and a potential method to suppress SRS by using the
short-wavelength modulation.

change over time. In practice, humans interacting with a novel environment or
performing well on a novel task will change their demonstrations as they learn
more about the environment or task. We investigate the consequences of relaxing
this assumption of stationarity, in particular by modelling the human as
learning. Surprisingly, we find in some small examples that this can lead to
better inference than if the human was stationary. That is, by observing a
demonstrator who is themselves learning, a machine can infer more than by
observing a demonstrator who is noisily rational. In addition, we find evidence
that misspecification can lead to poor inference, suggesting that modelling
human learning is important, especially when the human is facing an unfamiliar

that the high-density oil-based drilling fluid (HDOF) induced down-hole working
condition, which is typically high-temperature, high-pressure and

Focusing on the impact of bottom-hole osmotic pressure and solid phase content

customers, such as solo ride services, shared ride services, etc. It is
generally expected that demands for different service modes are correlated, and
the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical
observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint
prediction of demands for multiple service modes can help the platforms better
allocate and dispatch vehicle resources. Although there is a large stream of
literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific service mode,
little efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands
for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task
multi-graph learning approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple
multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks for predicting demands for different
service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable knowledge
sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task
learning structures are established. The first one is the regularized
cross-task learning, which builds cross-task connections among the inputs and
outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear
relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the
weights of various MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between
different MGC networks, the weights of these networks are constrained by each
other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated with the
for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our propose approach
outperforms the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different

algorithms have dominated implementations, graph coloring and linear scan,
differing in how live values are modeled. Graph coloring uses an edge in an
`interference graph' to show that two values cannot reside in the same

and uses, and then intervals that do not overlap may be allocated to the same
register. For both algorithms the liveness models are computed at considerable
runtime and memory cost. Furthermore, these algorithms do little to improve
code quality, where the target architecture and register coalescing are
important concerns.
  We describe a new register allocation algorithm with lightweight
implementation characteristics. The algorithm introduces a `future-active' set
for values that will reside in a register later in the allocation. Registers
are allocated and freed in the manner of linear scan, although other ordering
heuristics could improve code quality or lower runtime cost. An advantageous
property of the approach is an ability to make these trade-offs. A key result
is the `future-active' set can remove any liveness model for over 90% of
instructions and 80% of methods. The major contribution is the allocation
algorithm that, for example, solves an inability of the similarly motivated
Treescan register allocator to look ahead of the instruction being allocated -
allowing an unconstrained allocation order, and an ability to better handle
fixed registers and loop carried values. The approach also is not reliant on
properties of SSA form, similar to the original linear scan work. An analysis
is presented in a production compiler for Java code compiled through SSA form

Notable advantages of this approach are seamless end-to-end propagation of

in the most natural basis for each uncertain quantity; optimized computational
costs with little or no need for intermediate human interaction between various
analysis steps; and a complete overview of the entire analysis process within
one single framework. We focus in particular on low-$\ell$ CMB polarization
reconstruction with Planck LFI. We identify several important new effects that
have not been accounted for in previous pipelines, including gain
over-smoothing and time-variable and non-$1/f$ correlated noise in the 30 and
44 GHz channels. We find that all results are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM

with a low-resolution $\chi^2$ probability-to-exceed of 32%. This uncertainty
is about 30% larger than the official pipelines, arising from taking into
account a more complete instrumental model. The marginal CMB Solar dipole
amplitude is $3362.7\pm1.4\mu\mathrm{K}$, where the error bar is derived

Earth-like planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star with LUVOIR
are explored. Using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis
code Cloudy, we produce a far-ultraviolet atomic transmission spectrum for an
Earth-Sun-like system, and identify several nitrogen features, including both N
I and N II lines. We calculate the number of transits required for 1$\sigma$
and 3$\sigma$ detections of the planetary N{\sc i} $\lambda1200$ triplet signal
with the G120M grating of the LUMOS spectrograph designed for LUVOIR, as a
function of distance to the system and stellar ultraviolet emission. The
minimum number of transit observations necessary for 1$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$
detections of atomic N are 188 and 1685, respectively, for a system located at
a distance of one pc with 100 times the Solar ultraviolet flux. Given that the
orbital period of an Earth-Sun system is one year, it is not feasible to detect
atomic N in the transmission spectrum for these systems. Future studies in this
direction should therefore focus on Earth-like planets orbiting in the
habitable zone of M dwarfs.

then transferred to the real world, is a technique that enables faster deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) training. However, differences between the
simulator and the real world often cause the model to perform poorly in the
real world. Domain randomization is a way to bridge the sim-to-real gap by
exposing the model to a wide range of scenarios so that it can generalize to
real-world situations. However, following domain randomization to train an
autonomous car racing model with DRL can lead to undesirable outcomes. Namely,
a model trained with randomization tends to run slower; a higher completion
rate on the testing track comes at the expense of longer lap times. This paper
aims to boost the robustness of a trained race car model without compromising
racing lap times. For a training track and a testing track having the same
shape (and same optimal paths), but with different lighting, background, etc.,
we first train a model (teacher model) that overfits the training track, moving
along a near optimal path. We then use this model to teach a student model the
correct actions along with randomization. With our method, a model with 18.4\%
completion rate on the testing track is able to help teach a student model with
52\% completion. Moreover, over an average of 50 trials, the student is able to
finish a lap 0.23 seconds faster than the teacher. This 0.23 second gap is
significant in tight races, with lap times of about 10 to 12 seconds.

of NMR that allows studying molecules and their transformations in the regime
dominated by intrinsic spin-spin interactions. While spin dynamics at zero
magnetic field can be probed indirectly, J-spectra can also be measured at zero
field by using non-inductive sensors, for example, optically-pumped
magnetometers (OPMs). A J-spectrum can be detected when a molecule contains at
least two different types of magnetic nuclei (i.e., nuclei with different
gyromagnetic ratios) that are coupled via J-coupling. Up to date, no pure
J-spectra of molecules featuring the coupling to quadrupolar nuclei were
reported. Here we show that zero-field J-spectra can be collected from
molecules containing quadrupolar nuclei with I = 1 and demonstrate this for
solutions containing various isotopologues of ammonium cations. Lower ZULF NMR
signals are observed for molecules containing larger numbers of deuterons
compared to protons; this is attributed to less overall magnetization and not
to the scalar relaxation of the second kind. We analyze the energy structure
and allowed transitions for the studied molecular cations in detail using
perturbation theory and demonstrate that in the studied systems, different
lines in J-spectra have different dependencies on the magnetic pulse length
allowing for unique on-demand zero-field spectral editing. Precise values for
the 15N-1H, 14N-1H, and D-1H coupling constants are extracted from the spectra
and the difference in the reduced coupling constants is explained by the
secondary isotope effect. Simple symmetric cations such as ammonium do not
require expensive isotopic labeling for the observation of J-spectra and, thus,
may expand applicability of ZULF NMR spectroscopy in biomedicine and energy
storage.

This work aims to achieve semantic segmentation supervised by scribble label

Specifically, we impose diffusion on neural representation by random walk and
consistency on neural eigenspace by self-supervision, which forces the neural

random walk embedded in the network will compute a probabilistic transition
matrix, with which the neural representation diffused to be uniform. Moreover,
given the probabilistic transition matrix, we apply the self-supervision on its

neuronal activity and perception as reflected in behavior. We generated
'deceptive images' of human faces, monkey faces, and noise patterns so that
they are perceived as a different, pre-specified target category, and measured
both monkey neuronal responses and human behavior to these images. We found
several effective methods for changing primate visual categorization that
required much smaller image change compared to untargeted noise. Our work
shares the same goal with adversarial attack, namely the manipulation of images

learning, which is also very essential for click-through rate (CTR) prediction
tasks. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can automatically learn
implicit nonlinear interactions from original sparse features, and therefore
have been widely used in industrial CTR prediction tasks. However, the implicit
feature interactions learned in DNNs cannot fully retain the complete
representation capacity of the original and empirical feature interactions
(e.g., cartesian product) without loss. For example, a simple attempt to learn
the combination of feature A and feature B <A, B> as the explicit cartesian
product representation of new features can outperform previous implicit feature
interaction models including factorization machine (FM)-based models and their
variations. In this paper, we propose a Co-Action Network (CAN) to approximate
the explicit pairwise feature interactions without introducing too many
additional parameters. More specifically, giving feature A and its associated
feature B, their feature interaction is modeled by learning two sets of
parameters: 1) the embedding of feature A, and 2) a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) to represent feature B. The approximated feature interaction can be
obtained by passing the embedding of feature A through the MLP network of
feature B. We refer to such pairwise feature interaction as feature co-action,
and such a Co-Action Network unit can provide a very powerful capacity to
fitting complex feature interactions. Experimental results on public and
industrial datasets show that CAN outperforms state-of-the-art CTR models and
the cartesian product method. Moreover, CAN has been deployed in the display

a procedure of averaging two quadrupole electron density components (L = 2)
inside a sphere vibrating with the Ti nucleus at its center, where the key
factor introducing the temperature dependence is the square root of the
Debye-Waller factor. Although the Debye-Waller factor always reduces the
corresponding Fourier component, in TiO2 due to the interplay between terms of
opposite signs, it results in a net increase of the whole sum with temperature,
leading to the growth of the electric field gradient. Quantitatively, we find
that the increase of electric field gradient is only half of the experimental
value, which we ascribe to anharmonic effects or a strong oxygen position
influence. In addition, our method reproduces the unusual temperature
dependence of the asymmetry parameter eta, which first decreases with

general-purpose grasping pipelines and two other online learning algorithms and
achieves performance within 5% of the optimal policy within 1000 and 8000

reviewing in a pedagogical way different techniques that have been developed in

excursion-set approach. We derive a Volterra integral equation that is free of
a singularity sometimes encountered, and apply it to the case of metric

$\rho_\Gamma$, is sufficiently smaller than the one at which inflation ends,
$\rho_\mathrm{end}$, namely if $\rho_\Gamma^{1/4}/\rho_\mathrm{end}^{1/4}<

the universe content at the end of the oscillatory phase. This confirms the

quantum information processing and quantum state engineering. We propose a
photon-phonon conversion protocol in a hybrid magnomechanical system comprising
a microwave optical mode, a driven magnon mode and a mechanical-vibrating mode.
The microwave photons in the optical cavity are coupled to the magnons by the
magnetic-dipole interaction, and the latter are coupled to the mechanical
phonons by the magnetostrictive interaction. With strong photon-magnon
interaction and strong driving on magnon, an effective Hamiltonian is
constructed to describe the conversion between photons and phonons nearby their
resonant point. The cavity-magnon system can then play the role of a quantum
memory. Moreover, the faithfulness of the photon-phonon conversion is estimated
in terms of fidelities for state evolution and state-independent transfer. The
former is discussed in the Lindblad master equation taking account the leakages
of photon, phonon and magnon into consideration. The latter is derived by the
Heisenberg-Langevin equation considering the non-Markovian noise from the
structured environments for both optical and mechanical modes. The
state-evolution fidelity is found to be robust to the weak leakage. The
transfer fidelity can be maintained by the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments of
the photons and is insensitive to the $1/f$ noise of the phonons. Our work thus
provides an interesting application for the magnon system as a photon-phonon
converter in the microwave regime.

flight delay model, Multi-layer Air Traffic Network Delay (MATND) model, to
capture the impact of en-route congestion on flight delays over an air traffic
network. This model is developed by a data-driven approach, taking aircraft
tracking data and flight schedules as inputs to characterize a national air
traffic network, as well as a system-level model approach, modeling the delay
process based on queueing theory. The two approaches combined make the network
delay model a close representation of reality and easy-to-implement for what-if
scenario analysis. The proposed MATND model includes 1) a data-driven method to
learn a network composed of airports, en-route congestion points, and air
corridors from aircraft tracking data, 2) a stochastic and dynamic queuing
network model to calculate flight delays and track their propagation at both
airports and in en-route congestion areas, in which the delays are computed via
a space-time decomposition method. Using one month of historical aircraft
tracking data over China's air traffic network, MATND is tested and shows to
give an accurate quantification of delays of the national air traffic network.
""What-if"" scenario analyses are conducted to demonstrate how the proposed model
can be used for the evaluation of air traffic network improvement strategies,
where the manipulation of reality at such a scale is impossible. Results show
that MATND is computationally efficient, well suited for evaluating the impact

further the correlation between LOFAR data and HI observations at 21cm from the

signal-to-noise ratio in polarization. The observed HOG correlation in Fields
3C196 and A is associated with all HI phases and it is surprisingly dominant in
the CNM and LNM phases. We discuss possible mechanisms that would explain the

to be obtained. Therefore, making full use of the available unlabeled data can
be a potential way to further improve the performance of current image
classification methods. In this paper, we propose a discriminative
semi-supervised sparse representation algorithm for image classification. In
the algorithm, the classification process is combined with the sparse coding to
learn a data-driven linear classifier. To obtain discriminative predictions,
the predicted labels are regularized with three graphs, i.e., the global
manifold structure graph, the within-class graph and the between-classes graph.
The constructed graphs are able to extract structure information included in
both the labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, the proposed method is extended
to a kernel version for dealing with data that cannot be linearly classified.
Accordingly, efficient algorithms are developed to solve the corresponding

which instead of computing node embeddings directly, computes edge embeddings
by relying on the notion of line graph coupled with an edge weighting mechanism
to preserve the dynamic of the original graph in the line graph. We also
present a link prediction framework called ECNE-LP, which given a target link

advance our understanding on how public interventions affected criminal
activities at a finer spatial scale. The analysis relies on a two-step

distancing and shelter-in-place policies adopted in Chicago via Structural
Bayesian Time-Series across four crime categories (i.e., burglary, assault,
narcotics-related offenses, and robbery). Once the models detected the
direction, magnitude and significance of the trend changes, Firth's Logistic
Regression is used to investigate the factors associated to the statistically
significant crime reduction found in the first step of the analyses.
Statistical results first show that changes in crime trends differ across
communities and crime types. This suggests that beyond the results of aggregate
models lies a complex picture characterized by diverging patterns. Second,
regression models provide mixed findings regarding the correlates associated
with significant crime reduction: several relations have opposite directions
across crimes with population being the only factor that is stably and
positively associated with significant crime reduction.

properties. We investigate a family of continuous elastic quasicrystals with
different rotational symmetry orders that are directly enforced through a
design procedure in reciprocal space. Their mechanical properties are
investigated as a function of symmetry order and filling fraction. Results
indicate that higher order symmetries, such as 8-, 10- and 14-fold, allow for
high equivalent stiffness characteristics that interpolate those of the
constituent material while maintaining high levels of isotropy for all filling
fractions. Thus, quasiperiodic composites exhibit more uniform strain energy
distributions when compared to periodic hexagonal configurations. Similarly,
nearly-isotropic wave propagation is observed over a broader range of
frequencies. Spectral contents are also investigated by enforcing rotational
symmetry constraints in a wedge-type unit cell, which allows for the estimation

the reflected amplitude represents state transfer infidelity that cannot be

dynamically varying the resonator's coupling rate to the flying qubit field.
Here, we analytically derive the optimal coupling rate profile in the presence
of intrinsic loss of the quantum memory using an open quantum systems method
that can account for intrinsic resonator losses. We show that, since the
resonator field must be initially empty, an initial amplitude in the resonator
must be generated in order to cancel reflections via destructive interference;
moreover, we show that this initial amplitude can be made sufficiently small as
to allow the net infidelity throughout the complete transfer process to be
close to unity. We then derive the time-varying resonator coupling that
maximizes the state transfer fidelity as a function of the initial population
and intrinsic loss rate, providing a complete protocol for optimal quantum
state transfer between the flying qubit and resonator qubit. We present
analytical expressions and numerical examples of the fidelities for the
complete protocol using exponential and Gaussian profiles. We show that a state

hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The current deep learning based HSI
classifiers follow a patch-based learning framework by dividing the image into
overlapping patches. As such, these methods are local learning methods, which
have a high computational cost. In this paper, a fast patch-free global
learning (FPGA) framework is proposed for HSI classification. In FPGA, an
encoder-decoder based FCN is utilized to consider the global spatial
information by processing the whole image, which results in fast inference.
However, it is difficult to directly utilize the encoder-decoder based FCN for
HSI classification as it always fails to converge due to the insufficiently
diverse gradients caused by the limited training samples. To solve the
divergence problem and maintain the abilities of FCN of fast inference and
global spatial information mining, a global stochastic stratified sampling
strategy is first proposed by transforming all the training samples into a
stochastic sequence of stratified samples. This strategy can obtain diverse
gradients to guarantee the convergence of the FCN in the FPGA framework. For a
better design of FCN architecture, FreeNet, which is a fully end-to-end network
for HSI classification, is proposed to maximize the exploitation of the global
spatial information and boost the performance via a spectral attention based
encoder and a lightweight decoder. A lateral connection module is also designed
to connect the encoder and decoder, fusing the spatial details in the encoder
and the semantic features in the decoder. The experimental results obtained
using three public benchmark datasets suggest that the FPGA framework is
superior to the patch-based framework in both speed and accuracy for HSI
classification. Code has been made available at:

  for Enterprise Distributed Video Streaming Solutions",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Live video streaming has become a mainstay as a standard communication
solution for several enterprises worldwide. To efficiently stream high-quality
live video content to a large amount of offices, companies employ distributed
video streaming solutions which rely on prior knowledge of the underlying
evolving enterprise network. However, such networks are highly complex and
dynamic. Hence, to optimally coordinate the live video distribution, the
available network capacity between viewers has to be accurately predicted. In
this paper we propose a graph representation learning technique on weighted and
dynamic graphs to predict the network capacity, that is the weights of
connections/links between viewers/nodes. We propose VStreamDRLS, a graph neural
network architecture with a self-attention mechanism to capture the evolution
of the graph structure of live video streaming events. VStreamDRLS employs the
graph convolutional network (GCN) model over the duration of a live video
streaming event and introduces a self-attention mechanism to evolve the GCN
parameters. In doing so, our model focuses on the GCN weights that are relevant
to the evolution of the graph and generate the node representation,
accordingly. We evaluate our proposed approach on the link prediction task on
two real-world datasets, generated by enterprise live video streaming events.
The duration of each event lasted an hour. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of VStreamDRLS when compared with state-of-the-art
strategies. Our evaluation datasets and implementation are publicly available

the number of spacecraft within a constellation increases, the geometry becomes
more complicated, and it is harder to find the first-Brillouin-like zone, since
we cannot use known formulas to calculate the geometry of the zone. To our
knowledge, a quantitative study on the aliasing effects as well as the geometry
of the first-Brillouin-like zone for the constellation with more than 4
spacecraft has not been proposed yet. Herewith we provide a method to estimate
and compare the geometry of the first-Brillouin-like zone in multi-spacecraft
constellations. The corresponding array of reciprocal lattice in the wavevector
space forms the Brillouin zone. We set the preset PSDs conforming to the
``slab-only' and ``slab + 2D' patterns as the benchmark, and compare them with
the reconstructed PSDs using 4, 5, and 9 virtual spacecraft. Our results
validates the estimation of the Brillouin-like zones. The method may provide a

the emergence of a dynamical quantum phase transition hinges on the generation

the finiteness of the post-quench mass gap. The Loschmidt echo exhibits

in scheduling. In this paper, we study the setting of a single machine with
preemptions. The input consists of a set of jobs, characterized by their
processing times, release times, and weights and we want to compute a (possibly
preemptive) schedule for them. The objective is to minimize the sum of the
weighted flow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time
between its release date and its completion time.
  It had been a long-standing open problem to find a polynomial time
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this setting. In a recent break-through
result, Batra, Garg, and Kumar (FOCS 2018) found such an algorithm if the input
data are polynomially bounded integers, and Feige, Kulkarni, and Li (SODA 2019)
presented a black-box reduction to this setting. The resulting approximation
ratio is a (not explicitly stated) constant which is at least $10.000$. In this
paper we improve this ratio to $2+\varepsilon$. The algorithm by Batra, Garg,
and Kumar (FOCS 2018) reduces the problem to Demand MultiCut on trees and
solves the resulting instances via LP-rounding and a dynamic program. Instead,
we first reduce the problem to a (different) geometric problem while losing
only a factor $1+\epsilon$, and then solve its resulting instances up to a
factor of $2+\epsilon$ by a dynamic program. In particular, our reduction
ensures certain structural properties, thanks to which we do not need
LP-rounding methods.

which use readily available technologies (home printers) and inexpensive
materials (paper or semi-transparent films) to generate crafts for anatomical
edutainment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer-generated
crafting approach within an anatomical edutainment context. Our approach
follows a cost-effective, simple, and easy-to-employ workflow, resulting in
assemblable data sculptures (i.e., semi-transparent sliceforms). It primarily
supports volumetric data (such as CT or MRI), but mesh data can also be
imported. An octree slices the imported volume and an optimization step
simplifies the slice configuration, proposing the optimal order for easy
assembly. A packing algorithm places the resulting slices with their labels,
annotations, and assembly instructions on a paper or transparent film of
user-selected size, to be printed, assembled into a sliceform, and explored. We
conducted two user studies to assess our approach, demonstrating that it is an
initial positive step towards the successful creation of interactive and
engaging anatomical physicalizations.

reports observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) of HD80606b near its

decrease the runtime and sampling complexity by taking advantage of the signal
inherent characteristics that a large number of signals are sparse in the

first stage of sFFT is frequency bucketization through one of these filters:
Dirichlet kernel filter, flat filter, aliasing filter, etc. Compared to other
sFFT algorithms, the sFFT algorithms using the flat filter is more convenient
and efficient because the filtered signal is concentrated both in the time
domain and frequency domain. Up to now, three sFFT algorithms sFFT1.0, sFFT2.0,

precision of the Otto cycle compared to that in the absence of quantumness,
whereas in the finite-time mode, it can increase the cycle's productivity and
precision. Interestingly, as the strength (heat conductance) between the system
and the bath increases, the precision of the quantum Otto cycle overtakes that
of the classical one. Testing the conventional TUR of the Otto cycle, in the

than that of the conventional TUR. However, in the finite-time mode, both

convergence of two classes of $hp$ discretizations under the assumption of
analytic data, without any boundary compatibility, in the natural fractional
Sobolev norm $\mathbb{H}^s(\Omega)$. The first $hp$ discretization is based on
writing the solution as a co-normal derivative of a $2+1$-dimensional local,
linear elliptic boundary value problem, to which an $hp$-FE discretization is
applied. A diagonalization in the extended variable reduces the numerical
approximation of the inverse of the spectral fractional diffusion operator to
the numerical approximation of a system of local, decoupled, second order
reaction-diffusion equations in $\Omega$. Leveraging results on robust
exponential convergence of $hp$-FEM for second order, linear reaction diffusion
boundary value problems in $\Omega$, exponential convergence rates for
solutions $u\in \mathbb{H}^s(\Omega)$ of $\mathcal{L}^s u = f$ follow. Key
ingredient in this $hp$-FEM are boundary fitted meshes with geometric mesh
refinement towards $\partial\Omega$.
  The second discretization is based on exponentially convergent sinc
quadrature approximations of the Balakrishnan integral representation of
$\mathcal{L}^{-s}$, combined with $hp$-FE discretizations of a decoupled system
of local, linear, singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations in
$\Omega$. The present analysis for either approach extends to polygonal subsets
$\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ of analytic, compact $2$-manifolds $\mathcal{M}$.
Numerical experiments for model problems in nonconvex polygonal domains and

training models under two types of label noise: 1) closed-set noise, where some
training samples are incorrectly annotated to a training label other than their
known true class; and 2) open-set noise, where the training set includes
samples that possess a true class that is (strictly) not contained in the set

  Intelligence Systems","The paper has been accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on
  Wireless Communications (May 2021)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leveraging recent advances on mobile edge computing (MEC), edge intelligence
has emerged as a promising paradigm to support mobile artificial intelligence
(AI) applications at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the AI
service placement problem in a multi-user MEC system, where the access point
(AP) places the most up-to-date AI program at user devices to enable local
computing/task execution at the user side. To fully utilize the stringent
wireless spectrum and edge computing resources, the AP sends the AI service
program to a user only when enabling local computing at the user yields a
better system performance. We formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming
(MINLP) problem to minimize the total computation time and energy consumption
of all users by jointly optimizing the service placement (i.e., which users to
receive the program) and resource allocation (on local CPU frequencies, uplink
bandwidth, and edge CPU frequency). To tackle the MINLP problem, we derive
analytical expressions to calculate the optimal resource allocation decisions
with low complexity. This allows us to efficiently obtain the optimal service
placement solution by search-based algorithms such as meta-heuristic or greedy
search algorithms. To enhance the algorithm scalability in large-sized
networks, we further propose an ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers) based method to decompose the optimization problem into parallel
tractable MINLP subproblems. The ADMM method eliminates the need of searching
in a high-dimensional space for service placement decisions and thus has a low
computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of users.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely close to
the optimum and significantly outperform the other representative benchmark
algorithms.

Bevis","On the domain of convergence of spherical harmonic expansions",,,,,"math.CA math-ph math.MP physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spherical harmonic expansions (SHEs) play an important role in most of the
physical sciences, especially in physical geodesy. Despite many decades of
investigation, the large order behavior of the SHE coefficients, and the
precise domain of convergence for these expansions, have remained open
questions. These questions are settled in the present paper for generic
planets, whose shape (topography) may include many local peaks, but just one
globally highest peak. We show that regardless of the smoothness of the density
and topography, short of outright analyticity, the spherical harmonic expansion
of the gravitational potential converges exactly in the closure of the exterior
of the Brillouin sphere (The smallest sphere around the center of mass of the
planet containing the planet in its interior), and convergence below the
Brillouin sphere occurs with probability zero. More precisely, such
over-convergence occurs on zero measure sets in the space of parameters. A
related result is that, in a natural Banach space, SHE convergence of the
potential below the Brillouin sphere occurs for potential functions in a
subspace of infinite codimension (while any positive codimension already
implies occurrence of probability zero). Provided a certain limit in Fourier
space exists, we find the leading order asymptotic behavior of the coefficients
of SHEs.
  We go further by finding a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence
below the Brillouin sphere, which requires a form of analyticity at the highest
peak, which would not hold for a realistic celestial body. Namely, a
longitudinal average of the harmonic measure on the Brillouin sphere would have
to be real-analytic at the point of contact with the boundary of the planet. It
turns out that only a small neighborhood of the peak is involved in this
condition.

based on behavioural type systems have received much attention. By abstracting
communication protocols as types, these type systems can statically check that

our coalgebraic spectacles to investigate session types, a widely studied class
of behavioural type systems. We provide a syntax-free description of
session-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. As a result, we rediscover
type equivalence, duality, and subtyping relations in terms of canonical
coinductive presentations. In turn, this coinductive presentation makes it
possible to elegantly derive a decidable type system with subtyping for
$\pi$-calculus processes, in which the states of a coalgebra will serve as
channel protocols. Going full circle, we exhibit a coalgebra structure on an
existing session type system, and show that the relations and type system

the Equation of State (EoS) approach. We assess the veracity of these
implementations on the effective gravitational constant ($\mu$) and the slip

for a set of models we compare cosmological observables, i.e., the matter power
spectrum and the CMB temperature and lensing angular power spectra, computed
using the QSA, with exact numerical solutions. To do that, we use a newly
developed branch of the CLASS code: QSA_class. All three approaches agree
exactly on very small scales. Typically, we find that, except for $f(R)$ models
where all the three approaches lead to the same result, the quasi-static
approximations differ from the numerical calculations on large scales ($k

are reproduced to within 1% up to scales ${\rm K} = k/H_0$ of the order of a
few and $\ell>5$ for the approaches based on the field equations and on the
EoS, and we also do not find any appreciable difference if we use the
scale-dependent expressions for $\mu$ and $\eta$ with respect to the value on
small scales, showing that the formalism and the conclusions are reliable and
robust, fixing the range of applicability of the formalism. We discuss why the
expressions derived from the equations for the potentials have limited

semi-central, and peripheral collisions over a wide $p_{\rm T}$ interval, $3 <

with a massless Dirac like dispersion. In a hard wall treatment based on the 4
x 4 BHZ Hamiltonian and open boundary conditions (OBCs), the wave function is
weakly confined near the edge, with which it makes no contact. In contrast,
standard boundary conditions for the wave function and its derivative (SBCs)
lead to strong confinement with a peak amplitude at the edge. Unfortunately,
weak confinement exhibits unphysical behavior related to a spurious gap
solution that is included in the OBC wave function. This is confirmed by the
gap solutions of the parent multiband Hamiltonian from which the smaller
Hamiltonian is derived, which exhibit physical behavior and do not satisfy
OBCs. Unlike OBCs or other approaches based on phenomenological boundary
conditions, SBCs treat the wall explicitly. Using a basis of empty crystal free
electron states for the vacuum with the same symmetry as the TI states, it is
shown that a large wall band gap overlapping that of the TI can only be
achieved by including a thin passivation layer. For passivation materials such
as silicon dioxide where the mid gap energy is nearly degenerate with that of
the TI, the Dirac point is very close to mid gap and virtually independent of
the TI band asymmetry. The treatment also demonstrates that a significant shift
of the dispersion may be introduced by interface band mixing. The shift is
largest at the Dirac point and decreases monotonically with edge state wave
vector, vanishing when the edge states merge with the bulk band edges.

stars with slightly below solar metallicity (Z=0.014), followed by a decrease
in star formation up to a minimum level occurring around 8 Gyr ago. After a

stars of solar metallicity (Z=0.017). Finally, star formation has been
decreasing until the present, forming stars of Z=0.03 at a residual level. We
test the effects introduced in the inferred SFH by ignoring the presence of

2D pictures. As a consequence, great effort has been invested in developing
systems that reconstruct 3D faces from an uncalibrated 2D image. However, the
3D-from-2D face reconstruction problem is ill-posed, thus prior knowledge is
needed to restrict the solutions space. In this work, we review 3D face
reconstruction methods proposed in the last decade, focusing on those that only
use 2D pictures captured under uncontrolled conditions. We present a
classification of the proposed methods based on the technique used to add prior
knowledge, considering three main strategies, namely, statistical model
fitting, photometry, and deep learning, and reviewing each of them separately.
In addition, given the relevance of statistical 3D facial models as prior
knowledge, we explain the construction procedure and provide a list of the most
popular publicly available 3D facial models. After the exhaustive study of
3D-from-2D face reconstruction approaches, we observe that the deep learning
strategy is rapidly growing since the last few years, becoming the standard
choice in replacement of the widespread statistical model fitting. Unlike the
other two strategies, photometry-based methods have decreased in number due to
the need for strong underlying assumptions that limit the quality of their
reconstructions compared to statistical model fitting and deep learning
methods. The review also identifies current challenges and suggests avenues for
future research.

catalogues, which imply a high computational cost. We propose to replace the
standard random catalogues by glass-like point distributions or glass
catalogues, which are characterized by a power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^4$ and
exhibit significantly less power than a Poisson distribution with the same
number of points on scales larger than the mean inter-particle separation. We
show that these distributions can be obtained by iteratively applying the
technique of Zeldovich reconstruction commonly used in studies of baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO). We provide a modified version of the widely used
Landy-Szalay estimator of the correlation function adapted to the use of glass
catalogues and compare its performance with the results obtained using random
samples. Our results show that glass-like samples do not add any bias with
respect to the results obtained using Poisson distributions. On scales larger
than the mean inter-particle separation of the glass catalogues, the modified
estimator leads to a significant reduction of the variance of the Legendre
multipoles $\xi_\ell(s)$ with respect to the standard Landy-Szalay results with
the same number of points. The size of the glass catalogue required to achieve
a given accuracy in the correlation function is significantly smaller than when
using random samples. Even considering the small additional cost of
constructing the glass catalogues, their use could help to drastically reduce
the computational cost of configuration-space clustering analysis of future

Past efforts in optimising such models often require the knowledge of true
states which can be expensive to obtain or even unavailable in practice. In
this paper, in order to reduce the demand for annotated data, we present an
end-to-end learning objective based upon the maximisation of a
pseudo-likelihood function which can improve the estimation of states when
large portion of true states are unknown. We assess performance of the proposed
method in state estimation tasks in robotics with simulated and real-world
datasets.

  Aliasing Filter",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computing the Sparse Fast Fourier Transform(sFFT) of a K-sparse signal of
size N has emerged as a critical topic for a long time. There are mainly two
stages in the sFFT: frequency bucketization and spectrum reconstruction.
Frequency bucketization is equivalent to hashing the frequency coefficients
into B buckets through one of these filters: Dirichlet kernel filter, flat
filter, aliasing filter, etc. The spectrum reconstruction is equivalent to
identifying frequencies that are isolated in their buckets. More than forty
different sFFT algorithms compute Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) by their
unique methods so far. In order to use them properly, the urgent topic of great
concern is how to analyze and evaluate the performance of these algorithms in
theory and practice. The paper mainly discusses the sFFT Algorithms using the
aliasing filter. In the first part, the paper introduces the technique of three
frameworks: the one-shot framework based on the compressed sensing(CS) solver,
the peeling framework based on the bipartite graph and the iterative framework
based on the binary tree search. Then, we get the conclusion of the performance
of six corresponding algorithms: sFFT-DT1.0, sFFT-DT2.0, sFFT-DT3.0, FFAST,
R-FFAST and DSFFT algorithm in theory. In the second part, we make two
categories of experiments for computing the signals of different SNR, different
N, different K by a standard testing platform and record the run time,
percentage of the signal sampled and L0, L1, L2 error both in the exactly
sparse case and general sparse case. The result of experiments satisfies the
inferences obtained in theory.

planet-disc interactions, where dust and pebbles are trapped at the edges of
planetary induced gas gaps. Recent work has shown that these are likely sites
for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability. Given the large
amount of planetesimals that potentially form at gap edges, we address the
question of their fate and ability to radially transport solids in
protoplanetary discs. We perform a series of N-body simulations of planetesimal
orbits, taking into account the effect of gas drag and mass loss via ablation.
We consider two planetary systems: one akin to the young Solar System, and
another one inspired by HL Tau. In both systems, the close proximity to the
gap-opening planets results in large orbital excitations, causing the
planetesimals to leave their birth locations and spread out across the disc
soon after formation. Planetesimals that end up on eccentric orbits interior of
10au experience efficient ablation, and lose all mass before they reach the
innermost disc region. In our nominal Solar System simulation with
$\dot{M}_0=10^{-7}\, M_{\odot}\, \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\alpha=10^{-2}$, we
find that 70% of the initial planetesimal mass has been ablated after 500kyr.
The ablation rate in HL Tau is lower, and only 11% of the initial planetesimal
mass has been ablated after 1Myr. The ablated material consist of a mixture of
solid grains and vaporized ices, where a large fraction of the vaporized ices
re-condense to form solid ice. Assuming that the solids grow to pebbles in the
disc midplane, this results in a pebble flux of $\sim
10-100\,M_{\oplus}\textrm{Myr}^{-1}$ through the inner disc. Our results
demonstrate that scattered planetesimals can carry a significant flux of solids

the behavior of our Universe on the largest scales, and later became the
foundation of modern cosmology. Its validity has been verified on a range of
scales and environments from the Solar system to merging black holes. However,
experimental confirmations of GR on cosmological scales have so far lacked the
accuracy one would hope for -- its applications on those scales being largely
based on extrapolation and its validity sometimes questioned in the shadow of
the unexpected cosmic acceleration. Future astronomical instruments surveying
the distribution and evolution of galaxies over substantial portions of the
observable Universe, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI),
will be able to measure the fingerprints of gravity and their statistical power
will allow strong constraints on alternatives to GR.
  In this paper, based on a set of $N$-body simulations and mock galaxy
catalogs, we study the predictions of a number of traditional and novel
estimators beyond linear redshift distortions in two well-studied modified
gravity models, chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and a braneworld model, and the
potential of testing these deviations from GR using DESI. These estimators
employ a wide array of statistical properties of the galaxy and the underlying
dark matter field, including two-point and higher-order statistics,
environmental dependence, redshift space distortions and weak lensing. We find
that they hold promising power for testing GR to unprecedented precision. The
major future challenge is to make realistic, simulation-based mock galaxy
catalogs for both GR and alternative models to fully exploit the statistic
power of the DESI survey and to better understand the impact of key systematic
effects. Using these, we identify future simulation and analysis needs for
gravity tests using DESI.

There are several reasons that render an immediate forward of a message

postponing the forwarding for one or more rounds prevents termination. Our
extension overcomes this shortcoming while retaining the advantages of the
algorithm: Nodes don't need to memorize the reception of a message to guarantee

rely on full knowledge of network structure. It is largely not possible or
desirable to obtain population-level social network data due to availability
and privacy issues. It is easier to obtain information about individuals'
attributes (e.g. age, income), which are jointly informative of an individual's
opinions and their social network position. We investigate strategies for
influencing the system state in a statistical mechanics based model of opinion
formation. Using synthetic and data based examples we illustrate the advantages
of implementing coarse-grained influence strategies on Ising models with
modular structure in the presence of external fields. Our work provides a
scalable methodology for influencing Ising systems on large graphs and the
first exploration of the Ising influence problem in the presence of ambient
(social) fields. By exploiting the observation that strong ambient fields can
simplify control of networked dynamics, our findings open the possibility of
efficiently computing and implementing public information campaigns using
insights from social network theory without costly or invasive levels of data
collection.

International System of Units (SI). We provide a mathematically rigorous and
axiomatic presentation of angular measure that leads to the traditional way of
measuring a plane angle subtended by a circular arc as the length of the arc
divided by the radius of the arc, a scalar quantity. We distinguish between the
\emph{angular magnitude}, defined in terms of congruence classes of angles, and
the (numerical) \emph{angular measure} that can be assigned to each congruence
class in such a way that, e.g., the right angle has the numerical value
$\frac\pi2$. We argue that angles are intrinsically different from lengths, as
there are angles of special significance (such as the right angle, or the
straight angle), while there is no distinguished length in Euclidean geometry.
This is further underlined by the observation that, while units such as the
metre and kilogram have been refined over time due to advances in metrology, no
such refinement of the radian is conceivable. It is a mathematically defined
unit, set in stone for eternity. We conclude that angular measures are numbers,

nearly spherical, optically thick, and Eddington limited. Blackbody emission
from the photosphere is the direct observational signature of the wind. Here we
investigate whether or not it can explain the soft emission component seen in
the energy spectra of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Based on high-quality
XMM-Newton spectra of 15 ULXs, we find that the soft component can be modeled
as blackbody emission with a nearly constant luminosity, and the 5 known
pulsating ULXs (PULXs) in the sample display a blackbody luminosity among the
lowest. These are consistent with the scenario that the soft emission
originates from the photosphere of the optically thick wind. However, the
derived blackbody luminosity for PULXs is significantly above the Eddington
limit for neutron stars. A possible explanation is that a considerable fraction
of the optically thick wind roots in the inner accretion flow, where the
radiative flux could exceed the Eddington limit due to a reduced scattering
cross-section or enhanced radiation transfer with magnetic buoyancy. Based on a
wind model, the inferred mass accretion rate in these standard ULXs overlaps
but is on average lower than that in luminous and very soft X-ray sources,
which are also candidates with supercritical accretion. Alternatively, it
cannot be ruled out that the soft emission component is a result of the hard
component, e.g., via down-scattering in a cool medium, as a weak correlation
may exist between them.

distortion. Due to the uncertainty in the distortion variation, restoring
distorted images caused by liquify filter is a challenging task. To edit images
in an efficient way, distorted images are expected to be restored
automatically. This paper aims at the distorted image restoration, which is
characterized by seeking the appropriate warping and completion of a distorted
image. Existing methods focus on the hardware assistance or the geometric
principle to solve the specific regular deformation caused by natural
phenomena, but they cannot handle the irregularity and uncertainty of
artificial distortion in this task. To address this issue, we propose a novel
generative and discriminative learning method based on deep neural networks,
which can learn various reconstruction mappings and represent complex and
high-dimensional data. This method decomposes the task into a rectification
stage and a refinement stage. The first stage generative network predicts the
mapping from the distorted images to the rectified ones. The second stage
generative network then further optimizes the perceptual quality. Since there
is no available dataset or benchmark to explore this task, we create a
Distorted Face Dataset (DFD) by forward distortion mapping based on CelebA
dataset. Extensive experimental evaluation on the proposed benchmark and the

endorse its importance and versatility by presenting novel contributions that
further explore both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom. It begins with
two experiments that use classical light and explore its analogous behavior to
quantum systems. The first one is a classical optics simulation of the dynamics
of a relativistic quantum particle. The second work is related to the theory of
mutually unbiased measurements that are effectively discrete but constructed
from continuous variables systems. In the second part of the thesis, three
works are presented that use the polarization and path discrete degrees of
freedom. The first one is a redefinition of the quantum nonlocal correlation
called steering in the multipartite scenario, based on an inconsistency in the
previous definition, namely the creation of this correlation from scratch using
operations that supposedly would not be able to do so. We call this exposure of
quantum steering. Steering exposure is observed with entangled photons. The
other two works are related to the experimental implementation of quantum
channels of qubits, one of them is a particular channel for which we test for
non-Markovianity using a operational measure called conditional past-future
(CPF) correlation. The thesis finishes with a proposal for an experimental

benefits over household electricity storage systems. More economical
flexibility options such as demand response and sector coupling might reduce
the market size for storage facilities. This paper assesses the economic
performance of community electricity storage systems by taking competitive
flexibility options into account. For this purpose, an actor-related,
scenario-based optimization framework is applied. The results are in line with
the literature and show that community storage systems are economically more
efficient than household storage systems. Relative storage capacity reductions
of community storage systems over household storage systems are possible, as
the demand and generation profiles are balanced out among end users. On
average, storage capacity reductions of 9% per household are possible in the
base case, resulting in lower specific investments. The simultaneous
application of demand-side flexibility options such as sector coupling and
demand response enable a further capacity reduction of the community storage
size by up to 23%. At the same time, the competition between flexibility
options leads to smaller benefits regarding the community storage flexibility
potential, which reduces the market viability for these applications. In the
worst case, the cannibalization effects reach up to 38% between the flexibility
measures. The losses of the flexibility benefits outweigh the savings of the
capacity reduction whereby sector coupling constitutes a far greater
influencing factor than demand response. Overall, in consideration of the
stated cost trends, the economies of scale, and the reduction possibilities, a
profitable community storage model might be reached between 2025 and 2035.

overshoots the result of standard Langevin dynamics at the end of the pre-hydro

sublattice with a statistically random site occupation by magnetic Cu$^{2+}$
and nonmagnetic Ga$^{3+}$ or Al$^{3+}$ ions. A microscopic analysis based on
density-functional-theory calculations for Cu$_2$GaBO$_5$ reveals a frustrated
quasi-two-dimensional spin model featuring five inequivalent antiferromagnetic
exchanges. A broad low-temperature $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance points
to a considerable spin disorder in the system. In zero magnetic field,
antiferromagnetic order sets in below $T_\text{N}$ $\approx$ 4.1 K and ~2.4 K
for the Ga and Al compounds, respectively. From neutron diffraction, we find
that the magnetic propagation vector in Cu$_2$GaBO$_5$ is commensurate and lies
on the Brillouin-zone boundary in the (H0L) plane, $\mathbf{q}_\text{m}$ =
(0.45 0 -0.7), corresponding to a complex noncollinear long-range ordered
structure with a large magnetic unit cell. Muon spin relaxation is monotonic,
consisting of a fast static component typical for complex noncollinear spin
systems and a slow dynamic component originating from the relaxation on
low-energy spin fluctuations. Gapless spin dynamics in the form of a diffuse
quasielastic peak is also evidenced by inelastic neutron scattering. Most
remarkably, application of a magnetic field above 1 T destroys the static
long-range order, which is manifested in the gradual broadening of the magnetic
Bragg peaks. We argue that such a crossover from a magnetically long-range
ordered state to a spin-glass regime may result from orphan spins on the
structurally disordered magnetic sublattice, which are polarized in magnetic
field and thus act as a tuning knob for field-controlled magnetic disorder.

decidable, and is in 2EXPSPACE, when each thread is restricted to a fixed
number of context switches. The best known lower bound for the problem is
EXPSPACE-hard and this lower bound follows already when each thread is a
finite-state machine and runs atomically to completion (i.e., does not switch
contexts). In this paper, we close the gap by showing that state reachability
is 2EXPSPACE-hard already with only one context switch. Interestingly, state
reachability analysis is in EXPSPACE both for pushdown threads without context
switches as well as for finite-state threads with arbitrary context switches.
Thus, recursive threads together with a single context switch provide an
exponential advantage.

twistor space. This is a powerful organizing principle in the theory of
integrable systems. One shortcoming is that it is formulated at the level of
the equations of motion. From this perspective, it is mysterious that
integrable systems have Lagrangians. In this paper, we study a Chern-Simons
action on twistor space and use it to derive the Lagrangians of some integrable
sigma models. Our focus is on examples that come from dimensionally reduced
gravity and supergravity. The dimensional reduction of general relativity to
two spacetime dimensions is an integrable coset sigma model coupled to a
dilaton and 2d gravity. The dimensional reduction of supergravity to two
spacetime dimensions is an integrable coset sigma model coupled to matter
fermions, a dilaton, and 2d supergravity. We derive Lax operators and
Lagrangians for these 2d integrable systems using the Chern-Simons theory on
twistor space. In the supergravity example, we use an extended setup in which
twistor Chern-Simons theory is coupled to a pair of matter fermions.

coordinated community actions which might be undermined in socially diverse

unlocking period in India. On the extensive margin, we find that
caste-homogeneous districts systematically took more days to cross the
concentration thresholds of 50 to 500 cases. Estimates on the intensive margin,
using daily cases, further show that caste-homogeneous districts experienced
slower growth in infection. Overall, the effects of caste-group homogeneity
remained positive and statistically significant for 2.5 months (about 76 days)
after the beginning of the lockdown and weakened with subsequent phases of the
lockdown. The results hold even after accounting for the emergence of initial
hotspots before lockdown, broader diffusion patterns through daily fixed
effects, region fixed effects, and dynamic administrative response through
time-variant lagged COVID-19 fatalities at the district level. These effects
are not found to be confounded by differential levels of testing and
underreporting of cases in some states. Consistent estimates from bias-adjusted
treatment effects also ensure that our findings remain robust even after
accounting for other unobservables. We find suggestive evidence of higher
engagement of community health workers in caste-homogenous localities, which
further increased after the lockdown. We posit this as one potential channel
that can explain our results. Our findings reveal how caste-group diversity can
be used to identify potential hotspots during public health emergencies and

continuity equation. It gives rise to a convex optimization problem. We shall
give a complete characterization of its minimizer (i.e., the geodesic) and
discuss some topological and geometrical properties of these distances. Some
recently proposed models: the interpolation distance by Chen et al. [18] and
the Kantorovich Bures distance by Brenier et al. [11], as well as the well
studied Wasserstein Fisher Rao distance [43, 19, 40], fit in our model. The

general problem. In view of this abstract framework, we suggest a concrete
fully discretized scheme inspired by the finite element theory, and show the
unconditional convergence under mild assumptions. In particular, these

communities using common garden tree species experiments throughout Denmark.
The soil microbial communities differed between six European tree species as
well as between EcM (beech, lime, oak and spruce) and AM (ash and maple) tree
species. The EcM tree species had higher fungal biomass, fungal growth and
bacterial biomass, while AM species showed higher bacterial growth. The results
indicated that microbial community composition and functioning differed between
groups of tree species with distinct litter qualities that generate soil C/N
ratio and soil pH differences. The mycorrhizal association only partly
explained litter quality and soil microbial species differences since lime was
more similar to AM tree species. In addition, our results indicated that tree
species-mediated soil pH and C/N ratio were the most important variables
shaping microbial communities with a positive effect on bacterial and a
negative effect on fungal growth rates. The results suggest that tree
species-mediated microbial community composition and activity may be important

whether they can \textit{trust} the resulting mapping, and perform model
selection to tune algorithm parameters (e.g. the map size). Quantitative
evaluation of self-organizing maps (SOM) is a subset of clustering validation,
which is a challenging problem as such. Clustering model selection is typically
achieved by using clustering validity indices. While they also apply to
self-organized clustering models, they ignore the topology of the map, only
answering the question: do the SOM code vectors approximate well the data
distribution? Evaluating SOM models brings in the additional challenge of
assessing their topology: does the mapping preserve neighborhood relationships
between the map and the original data? The problem of assessing the performance
of SOM models has already been tackled quite thoroughly in literature, giving
birth to a family of quality indices incorporating neighborhood constraints,
called \textit{topographic} indices. Commonly used examples of such metrics are
the topographic error, neighborhood preservation or the topographic product.
However, open-source implementations are almost impossible to find. This is the
issue we try to solve in this work: after a survey of existing SOM performance
metrics, we implemented them in Python and widely used numerical libraries, and
provide them as an open-source library, SOMperf. This paper introduces each

capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics at relatively low frequency (200
kHz). Each of such steps has observed to encompass convolution of the quantized
states occupying ~6 electronic charges. The details of such carrier confinement
are analyzed in the current work by theoretically modeling the device transport
properties based on non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism.

we rely on distant supervision to create Personal-ITY, a novel corpus of
YouTube comments in Italian, where authors are labelled with personality
traits. The traits are derived from one of the mainstream personality theories
in psychology research, named MBTI. Using personality prediction experiments,
we (i) study the task of personality prediction in itself on our corpus as well

an extensive, in-depth analysis of the features used by the classifier, and
view them specifically under the light of the original theory that we used to
create the corpus in the first place. We observe that no single model is best
at personality detection, and that while some traits are easier than others to
detect, and also to match back to theory, for other, less frequent traits the
picture is much more blurred.

we construct a detailed picture and understanding of the behaviour of the water
pipe network by developing a Machine Learning model to assess and predict the
failure likelihood of water main breaking using historical failure records,

Deep Neural Network to classify sleep-wake state and predict sleep-wake time
accurately using the signals coming from a BCG sensor. Our method achieves a
sleep-wake classification score of 95.5%, which is on par with researches based

achieve a score of 94.16% in a controlled environment on 115 subjects and
94.90% in an uncontrolled environment on 350 subjects. The high accuracy and

eigenstates for arbitrary boundary conditions, which allows us to resolve not
only topological edge states, but also a novel $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the bulk. We discover the distinct properties of
topological edge states and defect states in the phase diagram. In the regime
that is not $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric, the topological defect state disappears

after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated lung
infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen
diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19
from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared
spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between
cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged
disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To
address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft
Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19

vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of
trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided
augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims
at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale

its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models. The

neural networks, is highly contingent upon the availability of the massive
amount of annotated training data which should be sufficiently labeled. Though,
data acquisition and manual annotation in the HAR domain are prohibitively
expensive due to skilled human resource requirements in both steps. Hence,
domain adaptation techniques have been proposed to adapt the knowledge from the
existing source of data. More recently, adversarial transfer learning methods
have shown very promising results in image classification, yet limited for
sensor-based HAR problems, which are still prone to the unfavorable effects of
the imbalanced distribution of samples. This paper presents a novel generic and
robust approach for semi-supervised domain adaptation in HAR, which capitalizes
on the advantages of the adversarial framework to tackle the shortcomings, by
leveraging knowledge from annotated samples exclusively from the source subject
and unlabeled ones of the target subject. Extensive subject translation
experiments are conducted on three large, middle, and small-size datasets with
different levels of imbalance to assess the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed model to the scale as well as imbalance in the data. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art
methods, which led in up to 13%, 4%, and 13% improvement of our high-level
activities recognition metrics for Opportunity, LISSI, and PAMAP2 datasets,
respectively. The LISSI dataset is the most challenging one owing to its less
populated and imbalanced distribution. Compared to the SA-GAN adversarial
domain adaptation method, the proposed approach enhances the final
classification performance with an average of 7.5% for the three datasets,
which emphasizes the effectiveness of micro-mini-batch training.

We consider a particular type of NES, a small mass undergoing impacts and dry
