(QNN). A Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) in the hybrid quantum-classical
framework is introduced as a universal function approximator to perform
optimization with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We employ a statistical
and differential geometric approach to study the learning theory of QNN. The
evolution of parametrized unitary operators is correlated with the trajectory
of parameters in the Diffusion metric. We establish the parametrized version of
Quantum Complexity and Quantum Chaos in terms of physically relevant
quantities, which are not only essential in determining the stability, but also
essential in providing a very significant lower bound to the generalization
capability of QNN. We explicitly prove that when the system executes limit
cycles or oscillations in the phase space, the generalization capability of QNN
is maximized. Finally, we have determined the generalization capability bound
on the variance of parameters of the QNN in a steady state condition using
Cauchy Schwartz Inequality.

present a framework for structure-preserving MOR, which allows to compute
structured reduced order models (ROMs) with a much higher accuracy. The
framework is based on parameter optimization, i.e., the elements of the system
matrices of the ROM are iteratively varied to minimize an objective functional
that measures the difference between the FOM and the ROM. The structural
constraints can be encoded in the parametrization of the ROM. The method only
depends on frequency response data and can thus be applied to a wide range of
dynamical systems.

generalizable discoveries. Associations that are consistently observed across
multiple source populations are more likely to be generalized to target
populations with possible distributional shifts. In this paper, we model the
heterogeneous multi-source data with multiple high-dimensional regressions and
make inferences for the maximin effect (Meinshausen, B{\""u}hlmann, AoS, 43(4),
1801--1830). The maximin effect provides a measure of stable associations
across multi-source data. A significant maximin effect indicates that a
variable has commonly shared effects across multiple source populations, and
these shared effects may be generalized to a broader set of target populations.
There are challenges associated with inferring maximin effects because its
point estimator can have a non-standard limiting distribution. We devise a
novel sampling method to construct valid confidence intervals for maximin
effects. The proposed confidence interval attains a parametric length. This
sampling procedure and the related theoretical analysis are of independent
interest for solving other non-standard inference problems. Using genetic data
on yeast growth in multiple environments, we demonstrate that the genetic
variants with significant maximin effects have generalizable effects under new
environments.

presence of a shared resource. We consider the setting where multiple viruses
are simultaneously prevalent in the population, and the spread occurs due to
not only individual-to-individual interaction but also due to
individual-to-resource interaction. In such a setting, an individual is either
not affected by any of the viruses, or infected by one and exactly one of the
multiple viruses. We classify the equilibria into three classes: a) the healthy
state (all viruses are eradicated), b) single-virus endemic equilibria (all but
one viruses are eradicated), and c) coexisting equilibria (multiple viruses
simultaneously infect separate fractions of the population). We provide i) a
sufficient condition for exponential (resp. asymptotic) eradication of a virus;
ii) a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic
stability of a single-virus endemic equilibrium; iii) a necessary and
sufficient condition for the healthy state to be the unique equilibrium; and
iv) for the bi-virus setting (i.e., two competing viruses), a sufficient
condition and a necessary condition for the existence of a coexisting
equilibrium. Building on these analytical results, we provide two mitigation
strategies: a technique that guarantees convergence to the healthy state; and,
in a bi-virus setup, a scheme that employs one virus to ensure that the other
virus is eradicated. The results are illustrated in a numerical study of a

measured signal onto a given subspace. In existing decentralized approaches,
sensors communicate with their local neighbors to obtain a sequence of iterates
that asymptotically converges to the desired projection. In contrast, the
present paper develops methods that produce these projections in a finite and
approximately minimal number of iterations. Building upon tools from graph
signal processing, the problem is cast as the design of a graph filter which,
in turn, is reduced to the design of a suitable graph shift operator.
Exploiting the eigenstructure of the projection and shift matrices leads to an
objective whose minimization yields approximately minimum-order graph filters.
To cope with the fact that this problem is not convex, the present work
introduces a novel convex relaxation of the number of distinct eigenvalues of a
matrix based on the nuclear norm of a Kronecker difference. To tackle the case
where there exists no graph filter capable of implementing a certain subspace
projection with a given network topology, a second optimization criterion is
presented to approximate the desired projection while trading the number of
iterations for approximation error. Two algorithms are proposed to optimize the
aforementioned criteria based on the alternating-direction method of
multipliers. An exhaustive simulation study demonstrates that the obtained
filters can effectively obtain subspace projections markedly faster than
existing algorithms.

part demonstrates, that the adjoint complement can be derived in two ways,
either following a first simplify then derive or a first derive and then
simplify strategy. The simplification step comprises the classical
boundary-layer (b.-l.) approximation and the derivation step transfers the
primal flow equation into a companion adjoint equation.
  The second part of the paper comprises the analyses of the coupled
primal/adjoint b.-l. framework. This leads to similarity parameters, which turn
the Partial-Differential-Equation (PDE) problem into a boundary value problem
described by a set of Ordinary-Differential-Equations (ODE) and support the
formulation of an adjoint complement to the classical Blasius equation.
Opposite to the primal Blasius equation, its adjoint complement consists of two
ODEs which can be simplified depending on the treatment of advection. It is
shown, that the advective fluxes, which are frequently debated in the
literature, vanish for the investigated self-similar b.l. flows. Differences
between the primal and the adjoint Blasius framework are discussed against
numerical solutions, and analytical expressions are derived for the adjoint
b.-l. thickness, wall shear stress and subordinated skin friction and drag
coefficients. The analysis also provides an analytical expression for the shape
sensitivity to shear driven drag objectives.
  The third part assesses the predictive agreement between the different
Blasius solutions and numerical results for Navier-Stokes simulations of a flat
plate b.-l. at Reynolds numbers between 1E+03 <= ReL <= 1E+05 .

$50$ cm/pixel resolution, a 60$\times$ improvement over previous
state-of-the-art results. Our U-Net trained on 30-40cm WorldView3 images can
detect streams as narrow as 1-3m (30-60$\times$ over SOTA). Our multi-sensor,
multi-res variant, WasserNetz, fuses a multi-day window of 3m PlanetScope
imagery with 1m LiDAR data, to detect streams 5-7m wide. Both U-Nets produce a
water probability map at the pixel-level. ii) We integrate this water map over
a DEM-derived synthetic valley network map to produce a snapshot of flow at the
stream level. iii) We apply this pipeline, which we call Pix2Streams, to a
2-year daily PlanetScope time-series of three watersheds in the US to produce
the first high-fidelity dynamic map of stream flow frequency. The end result is
a new map that, if applied at the national scale, could fundamentally improve
how we manage our water resources around the world.

reasons for a machine learning model's behavior to stakeholders. However,
understanding a model's specific behavior alone might not be enough for
stakeholders to gauge whether the model is wrong or lacks sufficient knowledge
to solve the task at hand. In this paper, we argue for considering a
complementary form of transparency by estimating and communicating the
uncertainty associated with model predictions. First, we discuss methods for
assessing uncertainty. Then, we characterize how uncertainty can be used to
mitigate model unfairness, augment decision-making, and build trustworthy

control capability over their movements. Among the different methods used to
map human gestures into robot commands, data-driven approaches select a set of
body segments and transform their motion into commands for the robot based on
the users' spontaneous motion patterns. Despite being a versatile and generic
method, there is no scientific evidence that implementing an interface based on
spontaneous motion maximizes its effectiveness. In this study, we compare a set
of BoMIs based on different body segments to investigate this aspect. We
evaluate the interfaces in a teleoperation task of a fixed-wing drone and
observe users' performance and feedback. To this aim, we use a framework that
allows a user to control the drone with a single Inertial Measurement Unit

selecting the body segment for a BoMI based on spontaneous motion can lead to
sub-optimal performance. Based on our findings, we suggest additional metrics
based on biomechanical and behavioral factors that might improve data-driven

data using the confocal hyperbola approximation to the geometric distance of
points to ellipses. The proposed method was evaluated and compared to
established methods on simulated and real-world datasets. First, it was
revealed that the confocal hyperbola distance considerably outperforms other
distance approximations such as algebraic and Sampson. Next, the proposed
ellipse fitting method was compared with five reliable and established methods
proposed by Halir, Taubin, Kanatani, Ahn and Szpak. The performance of each
method as a function of rotation, aspect ratio, noise, and arc-length were
examined. It was observed that the proposed ellipse fitting method achieved
almost identical results (and in some cases better) than the gold standard
geometric method of Ahn and outperformed the remaining methods in all
simulation experiments. Finally, the proposed method outperformed the
considered ellipse fitting methods in estimating the geometric parameters of
cylindrical mechanical pipes from point clouds. The results of the experiments
show that the confocal hyperbola is an excellent approximation to the true
geometric distance and produces reliable and accurate ellipse fitting in
practical settings.

  Probabilities",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is often desired that ordinal regression models yield unimodal
predictions. However, in many recent works this characteristic is either
absent, or implemented using soft targets, which do not guarantee unimodal
outputs at inference. In addition, we argue that the standard maximum
likelihood objective is not suitable for ordinal regression problems, and that
optimal transport is better suited for this task, as it naturally captures the
order of the classes. In this work, we propose a framework for deep ordinal
regression, based on unimodal output distribution and optimal transport loss.
Inspired by the well-known Proportional Odds model, we propose to modify its
design by using an architectural mechanism which guarantees that the model
output distribution will be unimodal. We empirically analyze the different
components of our proposed approach and demonstrate their contribution to the
performance of the model. Experimental results on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently performs on par with and
often better than several recently proposed deep learning approaches for deep
ordinal regression with unimodal output probabilities, while having guarantee
on the output unimodality. In addition, we demonstrate that proposed approach
is less overconfident than current baselines.

oscillating magnetic field along the symmetry axis of the NV in the presence of
transverse magnetic fields. It is well-known that the coupling between the
otherwise degenerate Zeeman levels $|M_S=\pm1\rangle$ due to strain and
electric fields is responsible for a Landau-Zener process near the
pseudo-crossing of the adiabatic energy levels when the axial component of the
oscillating magnetic field changes sign. We derive an effective two-level
Hamiltonian for the NV system that includes coupling between the two levels via
virtual transitions into the third far-detuned level $|M_S=0\rangle$ induced by
transverse magnetic fields. This coupling adds to the coupling due to strain
and electric fields, with a phase that depends on the direction of the
transverse field in the plane perpendicular to the NV axis. Hence, the {\em
total coupling} of the Zeeman levels can be tuned to control the adiabaticity
of spin dynamics by fully or partially compensating the effect of the strain
and electric fields, or by enhancing it. Moreover, by varying the strength and
direction of the transverse magnetic fields, one can determine the strength and
direction of the local strain and electric fields at the position of the NV
center, and even the {\em external} stress and electric field. The nuclear spin
hyperfine interaction is shown to introduce a nuclear spin dependent offset of
the axial magnetic field for which the pseudo-crossing occurs, while the
adiabaticity remains unaffected by the nuclear spin. If the NV center is
coupled to the environment, modeled by a bath with a Gaussian white noise
spectrum, as appropriate for NVs near the diamond surface, then the spin
dynamics is accompanied by relaxation of the Zeeman level populations and
decoherence with a non-monotonic decrease of the purity of the system.

determined assuming the emission region to be optically thin. However, this
assumption is unlikely to hold for young HII regions such as hyper-compact
HII(HCHII) and ultra-compact HII(UCHII) regions and leads to the
underestimation of their properties. This can be overcome by fitting the SEDs
over a wide range of radio frequencies.
  Aims. The two primary goals of this study are (1) to determine the physical
properties of young HII regions from radio SEDs in the search for potential
HCHII regions, and (2) to use these physical properties to investigate their
evolution.
  Method. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the
X-band and K-band with angular resolutions of ~1.7"" and ~0.7"", respectively,
toward 114 HII regions with rising-spectra between 1-5 GHz. We complement our
observations with VLA archival data and construct SEDs in the range of 1-26 GHz
and model them assuming an ionization-bounded HII region with uniform density.
  Results. Our sample has a mean electron density of ne=1.6E4cm^{-3}, diameter
diam=0.14pc, and emission measure EM = 1.9E7pc*cm^{-6}. We identify 16 HCHII
region candidates and 8 intermediate objects between the classes of HCHII and
UCHII regions. The ne, diam, and EM change as expected, but the Lyman continuum
flux is relatively constant over time. We find that about 67% of
Lyman-continuum photons are absorbed by dust within these HII regions and the
dust absorption fraction tends to be more significant for more compact and
younger HII regions.
  Conclusion. Young HII regions are commonly located in dusty clumps; HCHII
regions and intermediate objects are often associated with various masers,
outflows, broad radio recombination lines, and extended green objects, and the
accretion at the two stages tends to be quickly reduced or halted.

characterized by a periodic lattice distortion and charge density modulation,
often present near superconducting transitions. Here we uncover a novel
inverted CDW state by using a femtosecond laser to coherently over-drive the
unique star-of-David lattice distortion in 1T-TaSe$_2$. We track the signature
of this novel CDW state using time- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory, and validate that it
is associated with a unique lattice and charge arrangement never before
realized. The dynamic electronic structure further reveals its novel
properties, that are characterized by an increased density of states near the
Fermi level, high metallicity, and altered electron-phonon couplings. Our
results demonstrate how ultrafast lasers can be used to create unique states in
materials, by manipulating charge-lattice orders and couplings.

symmetric positive definite (SPD) kernel matrices, both fast matrix-vector
products and fast preconditioning operations are required. Fast
(linear-scaling) matrix-vector products are available by expressing the kernel
matrix in an $\mathcal{H}^2$ representation or an equivalent fast multipole
method representation. Preconditioning such matrices, however, requires a
structured matrix approximation that is more regular than the $\mathcal{H}^2$
representation, such as the hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrix
representation, which provides fast solve operations. Previously, an algorithm
was presented to construct an HSS approximation to an SPD kernel matrix that is
guaranteed to be SPD. However, this algorithm has quadratic cost and was only
designed for recursive binary partitionings of the points defining the kernel
matrix. This paper presents a general algorithm for constructing an SPD HSS
approximation. Importantly, the algorithm uses the $\mathcal{H}^2$
representation of the SPD matrix to reduce its computational complexity from
quadratic to quasilinear. Numerical experiments illustrate how this SPD HSS
approximation performs as a preconditioner for solving linear systems arising
from a range of kernel functions.

resulting in the trajectory of each flow over time. Thereafter, the
differential emission measure inversion method is applied to six AIA channels
along the trajectory of each flow in order to estimate its background
temperature and sound speed. Finally, we classify each flow as supersonic,
subsonic, or sonic by performing simultaneous hypothesis tests on whether the
velocity bounds of the flow are larger, smaller, or equal to the background
sound speed. The proposed methodology was applied to the SDO image data from
the 171 {\AA} spectral line for the date 6 March 2012 from 12:22:00 to 12:35:00

flows were detected, 11 of which were classified as supersonic, 3 as subsonic,
and 3 as sonic at a $70\%$ level of significance. Out of all these cases, 2
flows cannot be strictly ascribed to one of the respective categories as they
change from the subsonic state to supersonic and vice versa. We labelled them
as a subclass of transonic flows. The proposed methodology provides an
automatic and scalable solution to identify small-scale flows and to classify
their velocities as either supersonic, subsonic, or sonic. We identified and
classified small-scale flow patterns in flaring loops. The results show that
the flows can be classified into four classes: sub-, super-, trans-sonic, and
sonic. The detected flows from AIA images can be analyzed in combination with
the other high-resolution observational data, such as Hi-C 2.1 data, and be
used for the development of theories of the formation of flow patterns.

approach for directly optimizing non-differentiable evaluation metrics for

leads to improvements in mostly that metric only, suggesting that the model is
gaming the formulation of that metric in a particular way without often
achieving real qualitative improvements. Hence, it is more beneficial to make
the model optimize multiple diverse metric rewards jointly. While appealing,
this is challenging because one needs to manually decide the importance and
scaling weights of these metric rewards. Further, it is important to consider
using a dynamic combination and curriculum of metric rewards that flexibly
changes over time. Considering the above aspects, in our work, we automate the
optimization of multiple metric rewards simultaneously via a multi-armed bandit
approach (DORB), where at each round, the bandit chooses which metric reward to
optimize next, based on expected arm gains. We use the Exp3 algorithm for
bandits and formulate two approaches for bandit rewards: (1) Single
Multi-reward Bandit (SM-Bandit); (2) Hierarchical Multi-reward Bandit
(HM-Bandit). We empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches via
various automatic metrics and human evaluation on two important NLG tasks:

completeness level, frequency seismicity, and intensity seismicity, referring
respectively to Mc, Z, and E values, of 21 main fault zones, using a seismic

temperatures of $\sim$1500--2500 K and $\sim$900--1000 K, consistent with the
expected properties of sublimating graphite and silicate dust grains. The
domination of the torus infrared output by carbon and silicate grains near
their sublimation temperatures and radii may account for the general similarity
of AGN near-IR spectral energy distributions. The torus inner edge defined by
the hottest dust remains at roughly the same radius independent of the AGN
optical luminosity over $\sim$25 years. The emission by hot dust warmed
directly by the optical/UV AGN output has increased gradually by
$\sim$4\%/year, indicating a possibly growing torus. A third dust component at
$\sim$700 K does not seem to participate directly in the IR reverberation
behavior and its emission may originate deep in the circumnuclear torus. We
find a reverberation signal at $\sim10\mu$m with an inferred radius for the
warm dust of $\sim$2.2--3.1 pc. The lack of variability at 20--40$\mu$m
indicates the far-IR emission comes from even more extended regions. The torus
properties revealed by dust reverberation analysis are inconsistent with
predictions from pure clumpy torus models. Instead, the longer wavelength
emission possibly originates in a flared torus or the polar wind.

observed wide variation in Ca2+ binding loop conformations of the Ca2+-binding
protein calmodulin (CaM), which adopts the most populated ternary structures
determined from the MD simulations, followed by ab initio quantum mechanical
(QM) calculations on all twelve amino acids in the loop that coordinate Ca2+ in

We discovered that the atomic radius of Ca2+ in conventional force fields is
too large for the QM calculation to capture the variation in the coordination
geometry of Ca2+ in its ionic form, leading to unphysical charges.
Specifically, we found that the fitted atomic charges of Ca2+ in the context of
PFF depend on the coordinating geometry of electronegative atoms from the amino
acids in the loop. Although nearby water molecules do not influence the atomic
charge of Ca2+, they are crucial for compensating for the coordination of Ca2+
due to the conformational flexibility in the EF-hand loop. Our method advances

mathematically from a tropical geometry perspective as well as mathematical
morphology. Our contributions are threefold. First, we examine the training of
morphological networks via Difference-of-Convex programming methods and extend
a binary morphological classifier to multiclass tasks. Second, we focus on the
sparsity of dense morphological networks trained via gradient descent
algorithms and compare their performance to their linear counterparts under
heavy pruning, showing that the morphological networks cope far better and are
characterized with superior compression capabilities. Our approach incorporates
the effect of the training optimizer used and offers quantitative and
qualitative explanations. Finally, we study how the architectural structure of
a morphological network can affect shape constraints, focusing on monotonicity.
Via Maslov Dequantization, we obtain a softened version of a known architecture
and show how this approach can improve training convergence and performance.

maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm with a variable step size, which
adaptively changes the step size after each iteration based on how far away the

we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to solve this problem. The

where the goal is to optimize circuit performance subject to certain design
constraints. One of the aspects that makes this problem challenging to
optimize, is that measuring the performance of candidate configurations with
simulation can be computationally expensive, particularly in the post-layout
design. Additionally, the large number of design constraints and the
interaction between the relevant quantities makes the problem complex.
Therefore, to better facilitate supporting the human designers, it is desirable
to gain knowledge about the whole space of feasible solutions. In order to
tackle these challenges, we take inspiration from model-based reinforcement
learning and propose a method with two key properties. First, it learns a
reward model, i.e., surrogate model of the performance approximated by neural
networks, to reduce the required number of simulation. Second, it uses a
stochastic policy generator to explore the diverse solution space satisfying
constraints. Together we combine these in a Dyna-style optimization framework,
which we call DynaOpt, and empirically evaluate the performance on a circuit
benchmark of a two-stage operational amplifier. The results show that, compared
to the model-free method applied with 20,000 circuit simulations to train the
policy, DynaOpt achieves even much better performance by learning from scratch
with only 500 simulations.

theory asks one to maximize the probability of finding the optimal candidate in
a sequentially examined list under the constraint that accept/reject decisions
are made in real-time. A version of the problem is the so-called postdoc
problem, for which the question of interest is to devise a strategy that
identifies the second-best candidate with highest possible probability of
success.
  We study the postdoc problem in its combinatorial form. In this setting, a
permutation $\pi$ of length $N$ is sampled according to some distribution on
the symmetric group $S_N$ and the elements of $\pi$ are revealed one-by-one
from left to right so that at each step, one can only observe the relative
orders of the elements. At each step, one must decide to either accept or
reject the currently presented element and cannot recall the decision in the
future. The question of interest is to find the optimal strategy for selecting
the position of the second-largest value. We solve the postdoc problem for the
untraditional setting where the candidates are not presented uniformly at
random but rather according to permutations drawn from the Mallows
distribution. The Mallows distribution assigns to each permutation $\pi \in
S_N$ a weight $\theta^{c(\pi)}$, where the function c counts the number of
inversions in $\pi$. To identify the optimal stopping criteria for the
significantly more challenging postdoc problem, we adopt a combinatorial
methodology that includes new proof techniques and novel methodological
extensions compared to the analysis first introduced in the setting of the
secretary problem. The optimal strategies depend on the parameter $\theta$ of
the Mallows distribution and can be determined exactly by solving well-defined
recurrence relations.

explosion of the WD may occur when its mass reaches the Chandrasekhar limit
during accretion of material from a companion star. In the present work, we
address theoretical rates and delay times of a specific MS donor channel to SNe
Ia, in which a He star+MS binary produced from a common envelope event
subsequently forms a WD+MS system without the He star undergoing mass transfer
by Roche lobe overflow. By combining the results of self-consistent binary
evolution calculations with population synthesis models, we find that the
contribution of SNe Ia in this channel is around 2.0e-4 per year. In addition,
we find that delay times of SNe Ia in this channel cover a range of about
1.0-2.6 Gyr, and almost all SNe Ia produced in this way (about 97%) have a
delay time of > 1 Gyr. While the rate of SN Ia in this work is about 10% of the
overall SN Ia rate, the channel represents a possible contribution to the old
population (1-3 Gyr) of observed SNe Ia.

dimers together with ionic pairs were studied by potential energy scans. The
results show that the cation-anion pair is the most stable one, while the HB in
anionic dimer possesses similar thermodynamics stability to the water dimer.
The further geometric, spectral and electronic structure analyses demonstrate
that the inter-anionic HB meets the general theoretical criteria of traditional
HBs. The strength order of four HBs in complexes is cation-anion pair > H2O
dimer = cationic dimer > anionic dimer. The energy decomposition analysis
indicates that induction and dispersion interactions are the crucial factors to
overcome strong Coulomb repulsions, forming inter-anionic HBs. Lastly, the
presence of inter-anionic HBs in ionic cluster has been confirmed by a global
minimum search for a system containing two ionic pairs. Even though
hydroxyl-functionalized cations are more likely to form HBs with anions, there
still have inter-anionic HBs between hydroxyl groups in the low-lying
structures. Our studies broaden the understanding of HBs in ionic liquids and
support the recently proposed concept of anti-electrostatic HBs.

encoder-decoder architecture to enhance the performance of deep models.
However, these state-of-the-art solutions mainly suffer from two shortcomings:
(i) their attention mechanisms cannot utilize high-order feature interactions,
and (ii) due to the use of TF-IDF-based reward functions, these methods are
fragile with generating repeated terms. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
reinforced medical report generation solution with x-linear attention and
repetition penalty mechanisms (ReMRG-XR) to overcome these problems.
Specifically, x-linear attention modules are used to explore high-order feature
interactions and achieve multi-modal reasoning, while repetition penalty is
used to apply penalties to repeated terms during the model's training process.
Extensive experimental studies have been conducted on two public datasets, and
the results show that ReMRG-XR greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of all metrics.

negligible compared to viscous forces. In this article, we explore the
consequence of parity-violating and non-dissipative (i.e. odd) viscosities on
Stokes flows in three dimensions. Parity-violating viscosities are coefficients
of the viscosity tensor that are not invariant under mirror reflections of
space, while odd viscosities are those which do not contribute to dissipation
of mechanical energy. These viscosities can occur in systems ranging from
synthetic and biological active fluids to magnetised and rotating fluids. We
first systematically enumerate all possible parity-violating viscosities
compatible with cylindrical symmetry, highlighting their connection to
potential microscopic realizations. Then, using a combination of analytical and
numerical methods, we analyze the effects of parity-violating viscosities on
the Stokeslet solution, on the flow past a sphere or a bubble, and on
many-particle sedimentation. In all the cases we analyze, parity-violating
viscosities give rise to an azimuthal flow even when the driving force is
parallel to the axis of cylindrical symmetry. For a few sedimenting particles,
the azimuthal flow bends the trajectories compared to a traditional Stokes
flow. For a cloud of particles, the azimuthal flow impedes the transformation
of the spherical cloud into a torus and the subsequent breakup into smaller
parts that would otherwise occur. The presence of azimuthal flows in
cylindrically symmetric systems (sphere, bubble, cloud of particles) can serve
as a probe for parity-violating viscosities in experimental systems.

community lately due to their superiority over graphs in capturing super-dyadic
interactions among entities. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the
partitioning of k-uniform hypergraphs. Most of the existing methods work by
reducing the hypergraph to a graph followed by applying standard graph
partitioning algorithms. The reduction step restricts the algorithms to
capturing only some weighted pairwise interactions and hence loses essential
information about the original hypergraph. We overcome this issue by utilizing
the tensor-based representation of hypergraphs, which enables us to capture
actual super-dyadic interactions. We prove that the hypergraph to graph
reduction is a special case of tensor contraction. We extend the notion of
minimum ratio-cut and normalized-cut from graphs to hypergraphs and show the
relaxed optimization problem is equivalent to tensor eigenvalue decomposition.
This novel formulation also enables us to capture different ways of cutting a
hyperedge, unlike the existing reduction approaches. We propose a hypergraph
partitioning algorithm inspired from spectral graph theory that can accommodate
this notion of hyperedge cuts. We also derive a tighter upper bound on the
minimum positive eigenvalue of even-order hypergraph Laplacian tensor in terms
of its conductance, which is utilized in the partitioning algorithm to
approximate the normalized cut. The efficacy of the proposed method is
demonstrated numerically on simple hypergraphs. We also show improvement for
the min-cut solution on 2-uniform hypergraphs (graphs) over the standard
spectral partitioning algorithm.

choosing among $\binom{N}{K}$ options, making the action space large. To
simplify the problem, existing works on combinatorial bandits {typically}
assume feedback as a linear function of individual rewards. In this paper, we
prove the lower bound for top-$K$ subset selection with bandit feedback with
possibly correlated rewards. We present a novel algorithm for the combinatorial
setting without using individual arm feedback or requiring linearity of the
reward function. Additionally, our algorithm works on correlated rewards of
individual arms. Our algorithm, aDaptive Accept RejecT (DART), sequentially
finds good arms and eliminates bad arms based on confidence bounds. DART is
computationally efficient and uses storage linear in $N$. Further, DART
achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K\sqrt{KNT})$ for a time
horizon $T$, which matches the lower bound in bandit feedback up to a factor of
$\sqrt{\log{2NT}}$. When applied to the problem of cross-selling optimization

been made to advance the compositional, structural, and spatial accuracy of
material deposition and patterning. The family of 2D materials provides an
ideal platform to realize atomic-level material architectures. The wide and
rich physics of these materials have led to fabrication of heterostructures,
superlattices, and twisted structures with breakthrough discoveries and
applications. Here, we report a novel atomic-scale material design tool that
selectively breaks and forms chemical bonds of 2D materials at room
temperature, called atomic-layer substitution (ALS), through which we can
substitute the top layer chalcogen atoms within the 3-atom-thick
transition-metal dichalcogenides using arbitrary patterns. Flipping the layer
via transfer allows us to perform the same procedure on the other side,
yielding programmable in-plane multi-heterostructures with different
out-of-plane crystal symmetry and electric polarization. First-principle
calculations elucidate how the ALS process is overall exothermic in energy and
only has a small reaction barrier, facilitating the reaction to occur at room
temperature. Optical characterizations confirm the fidelity of this design
approach, while TEM shows the direct evidence of Janus structure and suggests
the atomic transition at the interface of designed heterostructure. Finally,
transport and Kelvin probe measurements on MoXY (X,Y=S,Se; X and Y

evolution code MESA, we investigate the long-term appearance and observational
signatures of surviving MS companions of SNe Iax by tracing their post-impact
evolution. Depending on different MS companion models, it is found that the
shocked surviving companion stars can significantly expand and evolve to be
more luminous (5-500 Lsun) for a time-scale of 10-1e4 yr. Comparing with the

between the emerging and background magnetic fields. The initial plasma
parameters are based on the C7 atmosphere model. After the current sheet with
dense photosphere plasma is emerged to $0.5$ Mm above the solar surface,
plasmoid instability appears. The plasmoids collide and coalesce with each
other, which makes the plasmas with different densities and temperatures mixed
up in the turbulent reconnection region. Therefore, the hot plasmas
corresponding to the UV emissions and colder plasmas corresponding to the
emissions from other wavelenghts can move together and occur at about the same
height. In the meantime, the hot turbulent structures basically concentrate
above $0.4$ Mm, whereas the cool plasmas extend to much lower heights to the
bottom of the current sheet. These phenomena are consistent with the
observations of Chen et al. 2019, ApJL. The synthesized Si IV line profiles are
similar to the observed one in UV bursts, the enhanced wing of the line
profiles can extend to about $100$ km s$^{-1}$. The differences are significant

averaged operator size for several different architectures, and we also
consider two typical learning tasks, which are a regression task of a quantum
problem and a classification task on classical images, respectively. In both
cases, we find that, for the architecture with a larger averaged operator size,
the loss function decreases faster or the prediction accuracy in the testing
dataset increases faster as the training epoch increases, which means higher
learning efficiency. Our results can be generalized to more complicated quantum
versions of machine learning algorithms.

despite many safety challenges that are yet to be resolved. It is well-known
that there are no universally agreed Verification and Validation (VV)
methodologies guarantee absolute safety, which is crucial for the acceptance of
this technology. The uncertainties in the behaviour of the traffic participants
and the dynamic world cause stochastic reactions in advanced autonomous
systems. The addition of ML algorithms and probabilistic techniques adds
significant complexity to the process for real-world testing when compared to
traditional methods. Most research in this area focuses on generating
challenging concrete scenarios or test cases to evaluate the system performance
by looking at the frequency distribution of extracted parameters as collected
from the real-world data. These approaches generally employ Monte-Carlo
simulation and importance sampling to generate critical cases. This paper
presents an efficient falsification method to evaluate the System Under Test.
The approach is based on a parameter optimisation problem to search for
challenging scenarios. The optimisation process aims at finding the challenging
case that has maximum return. The method applies policy-gradient reinforcement
learning algorithm to enable the learning. The riskiness of the scenario is
measured by the well established RSS safety metric, euclidean distance, and
instance of a collision. We demonstrate that by using the proposed method, we
can more efficiently search for challenging scenarios which could cause the
system to fail in order to satisfy the safety requirements.

magnetically charged black holes. In the asymptotically flat case, it is
possible to choose the magnetic charge of such an object in such a manner that
the black hole is surrounded by a corona in which electroweak symmetry is
restored on macroscopic scales, a result of very considerable interest. We
argue that holographic duality indicates that the asymptotically AdS analogues
of these black holes have several interesting properties: the dual theory is
only physical if the black hole is required to rotate; in the rotating case,
the magnetic field at the poles does not attain its maximum on the event
horizon, but rather somewhat outside it; the magnetic field at the equator is
not a monotonically decreasing function of the magnetic charge; the electric
fields induced by the rotation, while smaller than their magnetic counterparts,
are by no means negligible; the maximal electric field often occurs neither at
the poles nor at the equator; and so on. Most importantly, in the magnetically
charged case it is possible to avoid the superradiant instability to which
neutral AdS-Kerr black holes are subject; but the need to avoid this
instability imposes upper bounds on the magnetic and electric fields. In some
circumstances, therefore, the corona may not exist in the asymptotically AdS
case.

electronic role of anions in the iron-based superconductors utilizing
state-of-the-art scanning tunneling microscopy. By measuring the local

switched off/on by removing/restoring As atoms on Fe layer at the atomic scale.
Our analysis shows that this remarkable atomic switch effect is related to the

presents two GIS methods, EdgeScan and NDScan, for capturing areas with high

processes that count the number of edges and network density, respectively, in
a given focal area (window area). The focal window attaches resultant EdgeScan
and NDScan statistics to nodes at the center of the focal window area.
  We implement these methods on a case study of 1960s connections between
members of the Mafia in New York City. We use various definitions of a focal
neighborhood including Euclidean, Manhattan and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
definitions. We find that KNN tends to overstate the values of local networks,

differ from traditional spatial hot spots in the study area. These methods can
be extended to future studies that detect local triads and motifs, which can

a novel spatiotemporal graph filter approach that integrates graph learning and

new spatiotemporal graph representation and fuses multi-view observations in a

of the Wiedemann-Franz law. In this work, we perform mode-by-mode

understand thermal transport in metallic nanostructures. We take the gold (Au)

of nanostructures is on the order of several tens of nanometers, the
electronic/phonon thermal conductivity is smaller than the bulk value and
decreases with size. The phonon contribution increases in nanostructures for
those metals with small bulk phonon thermal conductivity (like Au), while the
phonon contribution may increase or be suppressed in nanostructures for those
metals with large bulk phonon thermal conductivity (like W). By assuming that
the grain boundary does not induce inelastic electron-phonon scattering, the
Wiedemann-Franz law works well in both Au and W nanostructures if the Lorentz
ratio is estimated using electronic thermal conductivity. The Wiedemann-Franz
law also works well in Au nanostructures when the Lorentz ratio is estimated by
total thermal conductivity.

of two previously performed simulations of cluster sized halos with
self-interacting dark matter and introduce a new function for the density
profile of galaxy clusters, which can perfectly describe the result of these
simulations. This density profile helps to find a velocity dispersion profile
and also a relation between cluster mass and concentration parameter. Using
these relations, we investigate two scaling relations of galaxy clusters,
namely mass-velocity dispersion and mass-temperature relations. The scaling
relations reveal that in the self-interacting dark matter model, halos are more
massive than what the standard non-interacting model predicts for any fixed
temperature. We also study the mass-temperature relation for a hybrid
interacting model, which is a combination of self-interacting dark matter idea
with another model of the dark sector in which dark matter particle mass is
determined according to its interaction with dark energy. This super
interacting dark sector (SIDS) model can change the mass-temperature relation
to a modified form that has the same result as a non-interacting model.
Finally, we provide quantitative expressions which can describe the constants
of this interacting model with the value of cross-section per unit mass of dark
matter particles.

statistical properties and behavior of classification algorithms is still

large. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by providing the first
asymptotically precise analysis of linear multiclass classification. Our
theoretical analysis allows us to precisely characterize how the test error
varies over different training algorithms, data distributions, problem
dimensions as well as number of classes, inter/intra class correlations and
class priors. Specifically, our analysis reveals that the classification
accuracy is highly distribution-dependent with different algorithms achieving
optimal performance for different data distributions and/or training/features
sizes. Unlike linear regression/binary classification, the test error in
multiclass classification relies on intricate functions of the trained model
(e.g., correlation between some of the trained weights) whose asymptotic
behavior is difficult to characterize. This challenge is already present in
simple classifiers, such as those minimizing a square loss. Our novel
theoretical techniques allow us to overcome some of these challenges. The
insights gained may pave the way for a precise understanding of other
classification algorithms beyond those studied in this paper.

developed for rational Chebyshev approximation is equivalent to the application
of the bisection method used in quasiconvex optimisation. Although this
correspondence is not surprising, it naturally connects rational and
generalised rational Chebyshev approximation problems with modern developments
in the area of quasiconvex functions and therefore offers more theoretical and
computational tools for solving this problem. %In particular, this observation
leads a straightforward extension of the linear inequality method to
generalised rational approximation in the sense of Loeb (ratio of two linear
forms). The second important contribution of this paper is the extension of the
linear inequality method to a broader class of Chebyshev approximation
problems, where the corresponding objective functions remain quasiconvex. In
this broader class of functions, the inequalities are no longer required to be
linear: it is enough for each inequality to define a convex set and the
computational challenge is in solving the corresponding convex feasibility
problems. Therefore, we propose a more systematic and general approach for
treating Chebyshev approximation problems. In particular, we are looking at the
problems where the approximations are quasilinear functions with respect to
their parameters, that are also the decision variables in the corresponding
optimisation problems.

capturing shape representation with different neural network architectures,
while the learning ability of each layer in the network is neglected. A common
and tough issue that limits the capacity of the network is overfitting. To
tackle this, L2 regularization is applied widely in existing deep learning
frameworks. However,the effect on the generalization ability with L2
regularization is limited as it only controls large value in parameters. To
make up the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel regularization term called
Gram regularization which reinforces the learning ability of the network by
encouraging the weight kernels to extract different information on the
corresponding feature map. By forcing the variance between weight kernels to be
large, the regularizer can help to extract discriminative features. The
proposed Gram regularization is data independent and can converge stably and
quickly without bells and whistles. Moreover, it can be easily plugged into
existing off-the-shelf architectures. Extensive experimental results on the

lack of reliable negative feedback data. Existing methods address this
challenge by treating all the un-observed data as negative (dislike) but
downweight the confidence of these data. However, this treatment causes two
problems: (1) Confidence weights of the unobserved data are usually assigned
manually, which lack flexibility and may create empirical bias on evaluating
user's preference. (2) To handle massive volume of the unobserved feedback
data, most of the existing methods rely on stochastic inference and data
sampling strategies. However, since a user is only aware of a very small
fraction of items in a large dataset, it is difficult for existing samplers to
select informative training instances in which the user really dislikes the
item rather than does not know it.
  To address the above two problems, we propose two novel recommendation
methods SamWalker and SamWalker++ that support both adaptive confidence
assignment and efficient model learning. SamWalker models data confidence with
a social network-aware function, which can adaptively specify different weights
to different data according to users' social contexts. However, the social
network information may not be available in many recommender systems, which
hinders application of SamWalker. Thus, we further propose SamWalker++, which
does not require any side information and models data confidence with a
constructed pseudo-social network. We also develop fast random-walk-based
sampling strategies for our SamWalker and SamWalker++ to adaptively draw
informative training instances, which can speed up gradient estimation and
reduce sampling variance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SamWalker and SamWalker++.

vs. exploitation problem"". It exploited the key observation that since the
maximum likelihood parameter estimator can asymptotically identify the
closed-transition probabilities under a certainty equivalent approach, the
limiting parameter estimates must necessarily have an optimal reward that is
less than the optimal reward attainable for the true but unknown system. Hence
it proposed a counteracting reverse bias in favor of parameters with larger
optimal rewards, providing a solution to the fundamental problem alluded to
above. It thereby proposed an optimistic approach of favoring parameters with
larger optimal rewards, now known as ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"". The
RBMLE approach has been proved to be long-term average reward optimal in a
variety of contexts. However, modern attention is focused on the much finer
notion of ""regret"", or finite-time performance. Recent analysis of RBMLE for
multi-armed stochastic bandits and linear contextual bandits has shown that it
not only has state-of-the-art regret, but it also exhibits empirical
performance comparable to or better than the best current contenders, and leads
to strikingly simple index policies. Motivated by this, we examine the
finite-time performance of RBMLE for reinforcement learning tasks that involve
the general problem of optimal control of unknown Markov Decision Processes. We
show that it has a regret of $\mathcal{O}( \log T)$ over a time horizon of $T$

``difficult'' (a.k.a informative) instances that contribute more on training.
But this will increase the risk of biasing the model and leading to non-optimal

facial exposedness and assists in the study of error bounds for conic
feasibility problems. In this paper we establish numerous properties of
amenable cones, and investigate the relationships between amenability and other
properties of convex cones, such as niceness and projectional exposure.
  We show that the amenability of a compact slice of a closed convex cone is
equivalent to the amenability of the cone, and prove several results on the
preservation of amenability under intersections and other convex operations. It
then follows that homogeneous, doubly nonnegative and other cones that can be
represented as slices of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, are
amenable.
  It is known that projectionally exposed cones are amenable and that amenable
cones are nice, however the converse statements have been open questions. We
construct an example of a four-dimensional cone that is nice but not amenable.
We also show that amenable cones are projectionally exposed in dimensions up to
and including four.
  We conclude with a discussion on open problems related to facial structure of
convex sets that we came across in the course of this work, but were not able
to fully resolve.

in sociological inquiry. Sociologists predominantly study such variation
through the lens of social contagion, which mostly attributes cultural
variation to the underlying structural segregation, making it epiphenomenal to
the pre-existing segregated structure. On the other hand, arguing culture
doesn't spread like a virus, an alternative called associative diffusion was
proposed, in which cultural transmission occurs not at the preference of
practices, but at the association between practices. The associative diffusion
model then successfully explains cultural variation without attributing it to a
segregated social structure. The contagion model and associative diffusion
model require different types of relationships and interactions to make
cultural transmission possible. In reality, both types of relationships exist.
In light of this concern, we proposed combining the two models with the
multilayer network framework. On one layer, agents casually observed the
behaviors of others, updating their belief about the association between
practices; on another layer, agents' preference of practices are directly
influenced by closed others. In the meantime, the constraint satisfaction
between preference and association is used to link the update of both, thereby
making each individual a coherent entity in terms of preference and
association. Using this approach, we entangle the effect of social contagion
and associative diffusion through multilayer networks. For the baseline, we
explore the model dynamics on three common network models: fully connected,
small-world, and scale-free. The results show nontrivial dynamics between the
two extremes of the contagion model and the associative diffusion model,
justifying our claim that it is necessary to consider the two models at the
same time.

training process or the model inputs; and 2) it needs only one forward pass for
each model. We evaluate the proposed UQ method on three tasks where our
uncertainty quantification yields much stronger correlations with pose
estimation errors than the baselines. Moreover, in a real robot grasping task,
our method increases the grasping success rate from 35% to 90%.

important for modeling and using higher-order and multiway relationships
between data objects. Local hypergraph clustering and semi-supervised learning
specifically involve finding a well-connected set of nodes near a given set of
labeled vertices. Although many methods for local clustering exist for graphs,
there are relatively few for localized clustering in hypergraphs. Moreover,
those that exist often lack flexibility to model a general class of hypergraph
cut functions or cannot scale to large problems. To tackle these issues, this
paper proposes a new diffusion-based hypergraph clustering algorithm that
solves a quadratic hypergraph cut based objective akin to a hypergraph analog
of Andersen-Chung-Lang personalized PageRank clustering for graphs. We prove
that, for graphs with fixed maximum hyperedge size, this method is strongly
local, meaning that its runtime only depends on the size of the output instead
of the size of the hypergraph and is highly scalable. Moreover, our method
enables us to compute with a wide variety of cardinality-based hypergraph cut
functions. We also prove that the clusters found by solving the new objective
function satisfy a Cheeger-like quality guarantee. We demonstrate that on large
real-world hypergraphs our new method finds better clusters and runs much
faster than existing approaches. Specifically, it runs in few seconds for
hypergraphs with a few million hyperedges compared with minutes for flow-based
technique. We furthermore show that our framework is general enough that can
also be used to solve other p-norm based cut objectives on hypergraphs. Our

invariance of visual modality to acoustic signal corruption and the additional
cues they provide to separate the target speaker from the interfering sound
sources, this paper presents an audio-visual multi-channel based recognition
system for overlapped speech. It benefits from a tight integration between a
speech separation front-end and recognition back-end, both of which incorporate
additional video input. A series of audio-visual multi-channel speech
separation front-end components based on TF masking, Filter&Sum and mask-based
MVDR neural channel integration approaches are developed. To reduce the error
cost mismatch between the separation and recognition components, the entire
system is jointly fine-tuned using a multi-task criterion interpolation of the
scale-invariant signal to noise ratio (Si-SNR) with either the connectionist
temporal classification (CTC), or lattice-free maximum mutual information
(LF-MMI) loss function. Experiments suggest that: the proposed audio-visual
multi-channel recognition system outperforms the baseline audio-only
multi-channel ASR system by up to 8.04% (31.68% relative) and 22.86% (58.51%

scalar field. This is accomplished with the implementation of a well-developed
mapping between solutions of Ricci-Based Palatini theories of gravity and
General Relativity. The new solution is parametrized by the scalar charge and
the Born-Infeld coupling constant apart from the mass and spin of the compact
object. Compared to the spacetime prior to the mapping, we find that the
high-energy modifications at the Born-Infeld scale are able to suppress but not
remove the curvature divergence of the original naked null singularity.
Depending on the sign of the Born-Infeld coupling constant, these modifications
may even give rise to an additional timelike singularity exterior to the null
one. In spite of that, both of the naked singularities before and after the
mapping are capable of casting shadows, and as a consequence of the mapping
relation, their shadows turn out to be identical as seen by a distant observer
on the equatorial plane. Even though the scalar field induces a certain
oblateness to the appearance of the shadow with its left and right endpoints
held fixed, the closedness condition for the shadow contour sets a small upper
bound on the absolute value of the scalar charge, which leads to observational
features of the shadow closely resembling those of a Kerr black hole.

field of information technology which offers on demand cost effective services
such as Software as a service (SAAS), Infrastructure as a service (IAAS) and
Platform as a service (PAAS).Promising all these services as it is, this cloud
computing paradigm still associates number of challenges such as data security,
abuse of cloud services, malicious insider and cyber-attacks. Among all these
security requirements of cloud computing access control is the one of the
fundamental requirement in order to avoid unauthorized access to a system and
organizational assets. Main purpose of this research is to review the existing
methods of cloud access control models and their variants pros and cons and to
identify further related research directions for developing an improved access
control model for public cloud data storage. We have presented detailed access
control requirement analysis for cloud computing and have identified important
gaps, which are not fulfilled by conventional access control models. As the
outcome of the study we have come up with an improved access control model with
hybrid cryptographic schema and hybrid cloud architecture and practical
implementation of it. We have tested our model for security implications,
performance, functionality and data integrity to prove the validity. We have
used AES and RSA cryptographic algorithms to implement the cryptographic schema
and used public and private cloud to enforce our access control security and
reliability.By validating and testing we have proved that our model can
withstand against most of the cyber attacks in real cloud environment. Hence it
has improved capabilities compared with other previous access control models
that we have reviewed through literature.

The effects of both techniques may be intermingled in practice: prior
insecticide spraying may debilitate wild population, so facilitating subsequent

of susceptible mosquitoes in an environment where the wild population became

the main identity of Dixit and the third author from which we successfully
deduce all the five q-series identities of Ramanujan. In addition to this, we
also establish a few interesting weighted partition identities from our
generalized identity. In the mid 1980's, Bressoud and Subbarao found an
interesting identity connecting the generalized divisor function with a
weighted partition function, which they proved by means of a purely
combinatorial argument. Quite surprisingly, we found an analytic proof for a
generalization of the identity of Bressoud and Subbarao, starting from the
fourth identity of the aforementioned five q-series identities of Ramanujan.

auxiliary classifier is determined using the synthetic pseudo-labels. Further,
this classifier is incorporated into the generative adversarial framework to
help the generator to yield higher quality imputation results. The proposed

novel VLP system with high accuracy is proposed to realize the long-playing

proposed a shielding protection method for the camera vertically installed on

captured VLP information is not affected by radiation. Besides, with the
optimized visible light positioning algorithm based on dispersion calibration
method, the proposed VLP system can achieve an average positioning accuracy of

star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with UV radiation feedback, in which
the propagation of UV radiation via ray-tracing is coupled to hydrogen
photochemistry. We consider 10 GMC models that vary in either initial virial
parameter ($1\le\alpha_{v,0}\le 5$) or dimensionless mass-to-magnetic flux
ratio (0.5-8 and $\infty$); the initial mass $10^5M_{\odot}$ and radius 20pc
are fixed. Each model is run with five different initial turbulence
realizations. In most models, the duration of star formation and the timescale
for molecular gas removal (primarily by photoevaporation) are 4-8Myr. Both the
final SFE ($\epsilon_*$) and time-averaged SFE per freefall time
($\epsilon_{ff}$) are reduced by strong turbulence and magnetic fields. The
median $\epsilon_*$ ranges between 2.1% and 9.5%. The median $\epsilon_{ff}$
ranges between 1.0% and 8.0% and anticorrelates with $\alpha_{v,0}$, in
qualitative agreement with previous analytic theory and simulations. However,
the time-dependent $\alpha_{v}(t)$ and $\epsilon_{ff,obs}(t)$ based on
instantaneous gas properties and cluster luminosity are positively correlated
due to rapid evolution, making observational validation of star formation
theory difficult. Our median $\epsilon_{ff,obs}(t)\approx$ 2% is similar to
observed values. We show that the traditional virial parameter estimates the
true gravitational boundedness within a factor of 2 on average, but neglect of
magnetic support and velocity anisotropy can sometimes produce large
departures. Magnetically subcritical GMCs are unlikely to represent sites of
massive star formation given their unrealistic columnar outflows, prolonged
lifetime, and low escape fraction of radiation.

challenging for these approaches to learn in a dynamic environment where

  This work develops a methodology that enables data-driven methods to

tool to a desired goal position on the retinal surface while avoiding damage to
surrounding tissues, a procedure that typically requires tens-of-microns
accuracy. In practice, the surgeon relies on depth-estimation skills to
localize the tool-tip with respect to the retina in order to perform the
tool-navigation task, which can be prone to human error. To alleviate such
uncertainty, prior work has introduced ways to assist the surgeon by estimating
the tool-tip distance to the retina and providing haptic or auditory feedback.
However, automating the tool-navigation task itself remains unsolved and
largely unexplored. Such a capability, if reliably automated, could serve as a
building block to streamline complex procedures and reduce the chance for
tissue damage. Towards this end, we propose to automate the tool-navigation
task by learning to mimic expert demonstrations of the task. Specifically, a
deep network is trained to imitate expert trajectories toward various locations
on the retina based on recorded visual servoing to a given goal specified by
the user. The proposed autonomous navigation system is evaluated in simulation
and in physical experiments using a silicone eye phantom. We show that the
network can reliably navigate a needle surgical tool to various desired
locations within 137 microns accuracy in physical experiments and 94 microns in
simulation on average, and generalizes well to unseen situations such as in the
presence of auxiliary surgical tools, variable eye backgrounds, and brightness
conditions.

nanocrystalline methane hydrates remain largely unknown yet at molecular scale.
Herein, using large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, mechanical creep
behaviors of nanocrystalline methane hydrates are investigated. It is revealed
that mechanical creep responses are greatly dictated by internal
microstructures of crystalline grain size and external conditions of
temperature and static stress. Interestingly, a long steady-state creep is
observed in nanocrystalline methane hydrates, which can be described by a
modified constitutive Bird-Dorn-Mukherjee model. Microstructural analysis show
that deformations of crystalline grains, grain boundary (GB) diffusion and GB
sliding collectively govern the mechanical creep behaviors of nanocrystalline
methane hydrates. Furthermore, structural transformation also appears important
in their mechanical creep mechanisms. This study sheds new insights into
understanding the mechanical creep scenarios of gas hydrates.

capture the local subtle motion around each joint as the pivotal joint-centered

scheme effectively boosts performance, while keeping the computational and

an utterance-wise algorithm so that it produces latency according to the length

review systems, plus the obvious complexity of the incentives affecting the
decisions of authors and reviewers, there is very little systematic and
strategic analysis of peer-review systems. In this paper, we begin to address
this feature of the peer-review literature by applying the tools of game
theory. We use simulations to develop an evolutionary model based around a game
played by authors and reviewers, before exploring some of its tendencies. In
particular, we examine the relative impact of double-blind peer-review and open
review on incentivising reviewer effort under a variety of parameters. We also
compare (a) the impact of one review system versus another with (b) other
alterations, such as higher costs of reviewing. We find that is no reliable

makes an important and reliable difference in our model, which raises the

factory cells have to be reconfigured at very short intervals, e.g. after each
workpiece. Furthermore, this scenario cannot be realized with traditional
devices, such as programmable logic controllers. Here the use of well-proven
technologies of the information technology are conquering the production hall

technologies are being introduced in the field of industrial automation. In
addition, these technologies are seen as the key for facilitating various
emerging use cases. However, it is not yet clear whether each of the dedicated
hardware and software components, which have been developed for specific
control tasks and have performed well over decades, can be upgraded without
major adjustments. In this paper, we examine the opportunities and challenges
of hardware and operating system-level virtualization based on the stringent

for different virtualization technologies are set by determining their

  conflict with each other?","To Appear in NeurIPS 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various evaluation measures have been developed for multi-label
classification, including Hamming Loss (HL), Subset Accuracy (SA) and Ranking
Loss (RL). However, there is a gap between empirical results and the existing
theories: 1) an algorithm often empirically performs well on some measure(s)
while poorly on others, while a formal theoretical analysis is lacking; and 2)
in small label space cases, the algorithms optimizing HL often have comparable
or even better performance on the SA measure than those optimizing SA directly,
while existing theoretical results show that SA and HL are conflicting
measures. This paper provides an attempt to fill up this gap by analyzing the
learning guarantees of the corresponding learning algorithms on both SA and HL
measures. We show that when a learning algorithm optimizes HL with its
surrogate loss, it enjoys an error bound for the HL measure independent of $c$
(the number of labels), while the bound for the SA measure depends on at most
$O(c)$. On the other hand, when directly optimizing SA with its surrogate loss,
it has learning guarantees that depend on $O(\sqrt{c})$ for both HL and SA
measures. This explains the observation that when the label space is not large,
optimizing HL with its surrogate loss can have promising performance for SA. We
further show that our techniques are applicable to analyze the learning
guarantees of algorithms on other measures, such as RL. Finally, the
theoretical analyses are supported by experimental results.

the development of tourism. The Zambezi region is a core element of the
Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), a mosaic of areas with
varying degrees of protection, which is designed to combine nature conservation
and rural development. These conservation areas serve as a resource base for
wildlife tourism, and growth corridor policy aims to integrate the region into
tourism global production networks (GPNs) by means of infrastructure
development. Despite the increasing popularity of growth corridors, little is
known about the effectiveness of this development strategy at local level. The
mixed-methods approach reveals that the improvement of infrastructure has led
to increased tourism in the region. However, the establishment of a territorial
conservation imaginary that results in the designation of conservation areas is
a necessary precondition for such a development. Despite the far-reaching
territorial claims associated with tourism, the benefits for rural residents

diagram is simulated using large-scale atomistic spin modeling in the presence
of thermal fluctuations. The boundaries between magnetic ordered phases and
paramagnetic phases are determined by cross-analyzing the average topological

such Janus monolayers, DMI is large enough to stabilize non-trivial chiral
textures. In VSeTe monolayer, an asymmetrical bimeron lattice state is
stabilized for in-plane field configuration whereas skyrmion lattice is formed
for out-of-plane field configuration. In VSSe monolayer, a skyrmion lattice is
stabilized for out-of-plane field configuration. This study demonstrates that
non-centrosymmetric van der Waals magnetic monolayers can support topological

acoustic sources in a turbulent jet flow for aeroacoustic applications. The
proposed algorithms are extensions of Kirchhoff migration (KM) and coherent
interferometry (CINT) which have been considered for smooth and randomly
inhomogeneous quiescent media so far. They are constructed starting from the
linearized Euler equations for the acoustic perturbations about a stationary
ambient flow. A model problem for the propagation of acoustic waves generated
by a fixed point source in an ambient flow with constant velocity is addressed.
Based on this result imaging functions are proposed to modify the existing KM
and CINT functions to account for the ambient flow velocity. They are
subsequently tested and compared by numerical simulations in various
configurations, including a synthetic turbulent jet representative of the main
features encountered in actual jet flows.

effect of high temperature thermal treatment and the number of milling passes.
Small-angle X-ray scattering intensities show that the silica is organized in
small, unbreakable aggregates containing ca. 50 primary nanoparticles, which
are reorganized on a larger scale in filler networks percolating at the highest
silica contents. As expected, the filler network structure is found to be
sensitive to milling, more milling inducing rupture, as evidenced by the
decreasing Payne effect. After thermal treatment, the nanocomposite structure
is found to be rejuvenated, erasing the effect of the previous milling on the
low-strain modulus. In parallel, the dynamics of the samples described by the
rheology or the calorimetric glass-transition temperature remain unchanged,
whereas the natural latex polymer network structure is modified by milling
towards a more fluid-like rheology, and cannot be recovered.

(negative) phenomenon of community disagreements that result in the creation of
separate development lines and ultimately software products, to the (positive)
practice of using distributed version control system (VCS) repositories to
collaboratively improve a single product without stepping on each others toes.
In both cases the VCS repositories participating in a fork share parts of a
common development history. Studies of software forks generally rely on hosting
platform metadata, such as GitHub, as the source of truth for what constitutes
a fork. These ''forge forks'' however can only identify as forks repositories
that have been created on the platform, e.g., by clicking a ''fork'' button on
the platform user interface. The increased diversity in code hosting platforms
(e.g., GitLab) and the habits of significant development communities (e.g., the
Linux kernel, which is not primarily hosted on any single platform) call into
question the reliability of trusting code hosting platforms to identify forks.
Doing so might introduce selection and methodological biases in empirical
studies. In this article we explore various definitions of ''software forks'',
trying to capture forking workflows that exist in the real world. We quantify
the differences in how many repositories would be identified as forks on GitHub
according to the various definitions, confirming that a significant number
could be overlooked by only considering forge forks. We study the structure and
size of fork networks , observing how they are affected by the proposed
definitions and discuss the potential impact on empirical research.

enhance the wireless communication performance by reconfiguring the wireless
propagation environment. In this paper, we propose to apply IRS to the
physical-layer service integration (PHY-SI) system, where a single-antenna
access point (AP) integrates two sorts of service messages, i.e., multicast
message and confidential message, via superposition coding to serve multiple
single-antenna users. Our goal is to optimize the power allocation (for
transmitting different messages) at the AP and the passive beamforming at the
IRS to maximize the achievable secrecy rate region. To this end, we formulate
this problem as a bi-objective optimization problem, which is shown equivalent
to a secrecy rate maximization problem subject to the constraints on the
quality of multicast service. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we
propose two customized algorithms to obtain its high-quality suboptimal
solutions, thereby approximately characterizing the secrecy rate region. The
resulting performance gap with the globally optimal solution is analyzed.
Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to unveil the impact of IRS
beamforming on the performance of PHY-SI. Numerical results demonstrate the
advantages of leveraging IRS in improving the performance of PHY-SI and also
validate our theoretical analysis.

has been conjectured to be linked to the core-shell architecture combining
materials of different transition temperatures. Here the structure of
pNIPMAM-core and pNNPAM-shell microgels in water is studied as a function of
temperature using small-angle neutron scattering with selective deuteration.
Photon correlation spectroscopy is used to scrutinize the swelling behaviour of
the colloidal particles and reveals linear swelling. Moreover, these
experiments are also employed to check the influence of deuteration on
swelling. Using a form free multi-shell reverse Monte Carlo approach, the
small-angle scattering data are converted into radial monomer density profiles.
The comparison of 'core-only' particles consisting of identical cores to fully
hydrogenated core-shell microgels, and finally to H core/D shell architectures
unambiguously shows that core and shell monomers display gradient profiles with
strong interpenetration, leading to cores embedded in shells which are bigger
than their isolated 'core only' precursor particles. This surprising result is
further generalized to different core cross linker contents, for temperature
ranges encompassing both transitions. Our analysis demonstrates that the
internal structure of pNIPMAM-core and pNNPAM-shell microgels is heterogeneous
and strongly interpenetrated, presumably allowing only progressive core
swelling at temperatures intermediate to both transition temperatures, thus
promoting linear swelling behaviour.

via the shift of $\tau$max of the $\alpha$-relaxation induced by the presence

polydispersity 12%). Any noteworthy contribution of interfacial polymer layers
on $\tau$max has been excluded by reference measurements with bare NPs. Our
approach allowed quantifying the partition between the matrix and the NP
interfaces, and was confirmed independently by calorimetry. As a control
parameter, the silane grafting reaction could be activated or not, which was
confirmed by the absence (resp. presence) of partitioning with the matrix. Our
main result is that in the first steps of material formulation, before any
grafting reaction, coating agents both cover the silica surface by adsorption
and mix with the polymer matrix-in particular if the latter has chemical
compatibility via its functional groups. Silane adsorption was found to be
comparable to the grafted amount (1.1 nm-2), and does not increase further,
confirming that the plateau of the adsorption isotherm is reached in industrial
formulations. These results are hoped to contribute to a better understanding

the study of acoustic radiation force due to acoustic pulses. Here, we
introduce the concept of finite-duration pulses, which is the most general

we extend the Gor'kov to formula to unsteady acoustic fields such as traveling
pulses and interfering wave packets. In the latter case, our study suggests
that the concept of acoustic contrast is also relevant to express the acoustic
radiation force. For negative acoustic contrast particles, the acoustic
trapping region narrows with shorter pulses, whereas positive contrast
particles (such as biological cells) can fall in secondary traps when the pulse
width deviates from an optimal value. This theoretical insight may help to
improve the selectivity of pulsed acoustic tweezers.

Darses, J. Math. Phys. 48, 072703 (2007)], we study how the dynamics of the
classical Newton equation for a force deriving from a potential is deformed
under the assumption that this equation can admit stochastic processes as
solutions. We focus on two denitions of a stochastic Newton's equation called
dierential and variational. We rst prove a stochastic virial theorem which is a
natural generalization of the classical case. The stochasticity modies the
virial relation by adding a potential term called the induced potential which
corresponds in quantum mechanics to the Bohm potential. Moreover, the
dierential stochastic Newton equation naturally provides an action functional
which sat-ises a stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The real part of this
equation corresponds to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an extra
potential term corresponding to the induced potential already observed in the
stochastic virial theorem. The induced potential has an explicit form depending
on the density of the stochastic processes solutions of the stochastic Newton
equation. It is proved that this density satises a nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger
equation. Applying this formalism for the Kepler potential, one proves that the
induced potential coincides with the ad-hoc ''dark potential'' used to recover
a at rotation curve of spiral galaxies. We then discuss the application of the
previous formalism in the context of spiral galaxies following the proposal and
computations given by [D. Da Rocha and L. Nottale, Chaos, Solitons and

seen as a consequence of the fractality of space in the context of the Scale

The optical property of the material suggests that it is a very good absorber

an absorber layer in photovoltaic devices. The piezoelectric properties of the
material also showed promising behavior as the piezoelectric stress and strain

demonstrate that Planetesimal formation is not completed when pebble
accumulations exceed the local Hill density. We find that Hill density is not a
sufficient criterion for further gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud into
a planetesimal, but that additionally the accumulated mass has to be large
enough to overcome turbulent diffusion. A Toomre analysis of the system
indicates that linear self-gravity modes play no role on the scale of our
numerical simulation. We nevertheless find that self-gravity, by vertically
contracting the pebble layer, increases the strength of turbulence, which is
either an indication of Kelvin Helmholtz Instability or a boost of the
streaming-instability. We furthermore determine the Bonnor-Ebert central
density to which a pebble cloud of given mass has to be compressed before it
would be able to continue contraction against internal diffusion. As the
equivalent ""solid body"" size of the pebble cloud scales with the central
density to the power of -1/6, it is much easier to have a pebble cloud of 100
km equivalent size to collapse than one of 10 km for the same level of
turbulent diffusion. This can explain the lack of small bodies in the solar
system and predicts to have small objects formed by gravitational collapse at
large pebble to gas ratios, in the outskirts of the solar nebula and at late
times of generally reduced gas mass.

obtained by Assiotis et al.~for the $\beta=2$ case of the symmetric Cauchy
weight (parameter $\eta$ real), allows for an explicit solution of the

symmetric Cauchy weight with $\eta=-\beta(N-1)/2-1-\alpha$, after appropriately
scaling $\alpha$ proportional to $N$, we use differential equations to compute

the RDE into a larger class of higher order partial differential equations

for atmospheric modelling is introduced, for which the horizontal divergence
terms are applied within the implicit vertical substep. The new HEVI scheme is
implemented in conjunction with a mixed mimetic spectral element spatial
discretisation and semi-implicit vertical time stepping scheme that both
preserve the skew-symmetric structure of the non-canonical Hamiltonian form of
the equations of motion. Within this context the new HEVI scheme allows for the
exact balance of all energetic exchanges in space and time. However since the
choice of horizontal fluxes for which this balance is satisfied is not
consistent with the horizontal velocity at the end of the time level the scheme
still admits a temporal energy conservation error. Linearised eigenvalue
analysis shows that similar to a fully implicit method, the new HEVI scheme is
neutrally stable for all buoyancy modes, and unlike a second order trapezoidal
HEVI scheme is stable for all acoustic modes below a certain horizontal CFL
number. The scheme is validated against standard test cases for both planetary
and nonhydrostatic regimes. For the planetary scale baroclinic instability test
case, the new formulation exhibits a secondary oscillation in the potential to
kinetic energy power exchanges, with a temporal frequency approximately four
times that exhibited by a horizontally third order, vertically second order
trapezoidal scheme. For the nonhydrostatic test case, the vertical upwinding of
the potential temperature diagnostic equation is shown to reduce spurious
oscillations without altering the energetics of the solution, since this
upwinding is performed in an energetically consistent manner. For this test
case, which is configured on an affine geometry, the exact balance of energy
exchanges allows the model to run stably without any form of dissipation.

executable file defines a virtual machine instruction set. We provide a survey
of methods for gadgets searching and determining their semantics (creating a

set. If a set of gadgets is Turing-complete, then a compiler can use a gadget
catalog as a target architecture. However, some instructions can be absent.
Hence we discuss several approaches to replace missing instructions with
multiple gadgets. An exploit generation tool can chain gadgets by pattern
searching (regular expressions) or considering gadgets semantics. Furthermore,
some chaining methods use genetic algorithms, while others use SMT-solvers. We
compare existing open-source tools and propose a testing system rop-benchmark

secured output, for an input graph $G$. Specifically, each vertex computes its
part in the output, the entire output is correct, but each vertex cannot
discover the output of other vertices, with a certain probability. This is
motivated by high-performance processors that are embedded nowadays in a large
variety of devices. In such situations, it no longer makes sense, and in many
cases it is not feasible, to leave the whole processing task to a single
computer or even a group of central computers. As the extensive research in the
distributed algorithms field yielded efficient decentralized algorithms for
many classic problems, the discussion about the security of distributed
algorithms was somewhat neglected. Nevertheless, many protocols and algorithms
were devised in the research area of secure multi-party computation problem
(MPC or SMC). However, the notions and terminology of these protocols are quite
different than in classic distributed algorithms. As a consequence, the focus
in those protocols was to work for every function $f$ at the expense of
increasing the round complexity, or the necessity of several computational
assumptions. In this work, we present a novel approach, which rather than
turning existing algorithms into secure ones, identifies and develops those
algorithms that are inherently secure (which means they do not require any
further constructions). This approach yields efficient secure algorithms for
various locality problems, such as coloring, network decomposition, forest
decomposition, and a variety of additional labeling problems. Remarkably, our
approach does not require any hardness assumption, but only a private
randomness generator in each vertex. This is in contrast to previously known
techniques in this setting that are based on public-key encryption schemes.

My activity specifically focuses on ferroelectric tunnel junctions in which an
ultrathin layer of ferroelectric material is intercalated between two metallic
electrodes. In these devices, polarization reversal induces large modifications
of the tunnel resistance, leading to a non-destructive readout of the
information. After a demonstration of the concept with scanning probe
microscopy techniques, I have been exploring the properties of ferroelectric
tunnel junctions with various ferroelectric materials (BaTiO3, BiFeO3, and
PVDF). I showed that these devices possess attractive properties for
applications as non-volatile binary memories. In addition, exploring the fact
that polarization usually reverses by the nucleation and propagation of
domains, I demonstrated a memristive behavior in the junctions associated to
non-uniform configurations of ferroelectric domains. Such ferroelectric
memristors can be used as artificial synapses in neuromorphic architectures.
Coupled to magnetic electrodes, the resulting multiferroic tunnel junctions
enable a non-volatile control of magnetism at the ferroelectric/electrode
interface and of the spin-polarized current associated. Besides this main
activity on tunnel devices, I explored the influence of ferroelectricity on
magnetic orders and on the properties of functional oxides.

object (YSO) that undergo rapid brightening events, often gaining 4-6
magnitudes on timescales of days. This brightening is often associated with a
massive increase in accretion; one of the most ubiquitous processes in
astrophysics from planets and stars to super-massive black holes. We present
multi-band interferometric observations of the FU Ori circumstellar
environment, including the first J-band interferometric observations of a YSO.
Aims. We investigate the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner-most
regions of the accretion disk around FU Orionis. We aim to characterise the
heating mechanisms of the disk and comment on potential outburst triggering
processes. Methods. Recent upgrades to the MIRC-X instrument at the CHARA array
allowed the first dual-band J and H observations of YSOs.Using baselines up to
331 m, we present high angular resolution data of a YSO covering the
near-infrared bands J, H, and K. The unprecedented spectral range of the data
allows us to apply temperature gradient models to the innermost regions of FU
Ori. Results. We spatially resolve the innermost astronomical unit of the disk
and determine the exponent of the temperature gradient of the inner disk to
$T=r^{-0.74\pm0.02}$. This agrees with theoretical work that predicts $T =
r^{-0.75}$ for actively accreting, steady state disks, a value only obtainable
through viscous heating within the disk. We find a disk which extends down to
the stellar surface at $0.015\pm0.007$ au where the temperature is found to be
$5800\pm700$ K indicating boundary layer accretion. We find a disk inclined at
$32\pm4^\circ$ with a minor-axis position angle of $34\pm11^\circ$.

with a significant amount of fine tuning, but possible connections to the $b

manual annotation of sentence boundaries of an Estonian web dataset and then
present the evaluation results of three existing sentence segmentation and word
tokenization systems on this corpus: EstNLTK, Stanza and UDPipe. While EstNLTK
obtains the highest performance compared to other systems on sentence

  SODA21",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the secretary problem we are faced with an online sequence of elements
with values. Upon seeing an element we have to make an irrevocable
take-it-or-leave-it decision. The goal is to maximize the probability of
picking the element of maximum value. The most classic version of the problem
is that in which the elements arrive in random order and their values are
arbitrary. However, by varying the available information, new interesting
problems arise. Also the case in which the arrival order is adversarial instead
of random leads to interesting variants that have been considered in the
literature.
  In this paper we study both the random order and adversarial order secretary
problems with an additional twist. The values are arbitrary, but before
starting the online sequence we independently sample each element with a fixed
probability $p$. The sampled elements become our information or history set and
the game is played over the remaining elements. We call these problems the
random order secretary problem with $p$-sampling (ROS$p$ for short) and the
adversarial order secretary problem with $p$-sampling (AOS$p$ for short). Our
main result is to obtain best possible algorithms for both problems and all
values of $p$. As $p$ grows to 1 the obtained guarantees converge to the
optimal guarantees in the full information case. In the adversarial order
setting, the best possible algorithm turns out to be a simple fixed threshold
algorithm in which the optimal threshold is a function of $p$ only. In the
random order setting we prove that the best possible algorithm is characterized
by a fixed sequence of time thresholds, dictating at which point in time we
should start accepting a value that is both a maximum of the online sequence
and has a given ranking within the sampled elements.

control of ultrafast chiral dynamics. When an intense few-cycle, linearly
polarized laser pulse is tightly focused into a medium of randomly oriented
chiral molecules, the medium generates light which is elliptically polarized,
with opposite helicities and opposite rotations of the polarization ellipse in
media of opposite handedness. In contrast to conventional optical activity of
chiral media, this new nonlinear optical activity is driven by purely
electric-dipole interactions and leads to giant enantio-sensitivity in the near
VIS-UV domain, where optical instrumentation is readily available. Adding a
polarizer turns rotation of the polarization ellipse into highly

optical control of the incident light wave enables full control over the

  This paper aims to propose a failure of the revelation principle. We point

common in many practical cases. The main result is that: For any given social

Nash equilibrium of the direct mechanism, actually the social choice function
can only be implemented ""\emph{dishonestly and disobediently}"" in Bayesian Nash

fails when the format of each agent's strategy is an action.

estimating transition probabilities and applies to any domain on which kernels
can be defined. It also brings new insights into the general theory of kernel

extremely high day-side temperatures, which lead to thermal dissociation of
most of the molecular species. It is expected that the neutral hydrogen atom is
one of the main species in the upper atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. Neutral
hydrogen has been detected in several UHJs by observing its Balmer line
absorption. Here, we report four transit observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter
WASP-33b, performed with the CARMENES and HARPS-North spectrographs, and the
detection of the H${\alpha}$, H${\beta}$, and H${\gamma}$ lines in the
planetary transmission spectrum. The combined H$\alpha$ transmission spectrum
of the four transits has an absorption depth of 0.99$\pm$0.05 %, which
corresponds to an effective radius of 1.31$\pm$0.01 Rp . The strong H${\alpha}$
absorption indicates that the line probes the high-altitude thermosphere. We
further fitted the three Balmer lines using the PAWN model, assuming that the
atmosphere is hydrodynamic and in LTE. We retrieved a thermosphere temperature
$12200^{+1300}_{-1000}$ K and a mass-loss rate ${\rm
\dot{M}}=10^{11.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}}$ g/s. The retrieved large mass-loss rate is
compatible with the ""Balmer-driven"" atmospheric escape scenario, in which the
stellar Balmer continua radiation in the near-ultraviolet is substantially
absorbed by the excited hydrogen atoms in the planetary thermosphere.

  Hadronic Cross-section Measurements",,,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Initial state radiation (ISR) plays an important role in $e^+$$e^-$ collision
experiments such as the BESIII. To correct the ISR effects in measurements of
hadronic cross-sections of $e^+e^-$ annihilation, an iterative method that
weights simulated ISR events is proposed here to assess the efficiency of event
selection and the ISR correction factor for the observed cross-section. The
simulated ISR events were generated only once, and the obtained cross-sectional
line shape was used iteratively to weigh the same simulated ISR events to
evaluate the efficiency and corrections until the results converge. Compared
with the method of generating ISR events iteratively, the proposed weighting
method provides consistent results, and reduces the computational time and disk
space required by a factor of five or more, thus speeding-up $e^+e^-$ hadronic
cross-section measurements.

the notion of environment models in software engineering research. [Principal
ideas/ Results] In this paper, we present a systematic literature review with
the goal to determine the state of the art in environment modeling for adaptive
systems, in particular from a requirements perspective. We discuss the goals of
the approaches, the modeling concepts, as well as the methodology aspects of
environment modeling in our survey. [Contribution] As major result of our
survey, we provide a meta-model of existing environment modeling concepts. As a
negative finding - and a research opportunity - we find that so far
methodological aspects of environment modeling have received very little

  99:1-99:16",,,"cs.DM math.CO math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Random walks on graphs are an essential primitive for many randomised
algorithms and stochastic processes. It is natural to ask how much can be
gained by running $k$ multiple random walks independently and in parallel.
Although the cover time of multiple walks has been investigated for many
natural networks, the problem of finding a general characterisation of multiple
cover times for worst-case start vertices (posed by Alon, Avin, Kouck\'y,
Kozma, Lotker, and Tuttle~in 2008) remains an open problem.
  First, we improve and tighten various bounds on the stationary cover time
when $k$ random walks start from vertices sampled from the stationary
distribution. For example, we prove an unconditional lower bound of
$\Omega((n/k) \log n)$ on the stationary cover time, holding for any $n$-vertex
graph $G$ and any $1 \leq k =o(n\log n )$. Secondly, we establish the
stationary cover times of multiple walks on several fundamental networks up to
constant factors. Thirdly, we present a framework characterising worst-case
cover times in terms of stationary cover times and a novel, relaxed notion of
mixing time for multiple walks called the partial mixing time. Roughly
speaking, the partial mixing time only requires a specific portion of all
random walks to be mixed. Using these new concepts, we can establish (or
recover) the worst-case cover times for many networks including expanders,
preferential attachment graphs, grids, binary trees and hypercubes.

motion. In many examples, such as bacterial systems and biofilament assays,
constituent units are elongated and can give rise to local nematic
orientational order. Such `active nematics' systems have attracted much
attention from both theorists and experimentalists. However, despite intense
research efforts, data-driven quantitative modeling has not been achieved, a
situation mainly due to the lack of systematic experimental data and to the
large number of parameters of current models. Here we introduce a new active
nematics system made of swarming filamentous bacteria. We simultaneously
measure orientation and velocity fields and show that the complex
spatiotemporal dynamics of our system can be quantitatively reproduced by a new
type of microscopic model for active suspensions whose important parameters are
all estimated from comprehensive experimental data. This provides unprecedented
access to key effective parameters and mechanisms governing active nematics.
Our approach is applicable to different types of dense suspensions and shows a
path towards more quantitative active matter research.

boosting the full potential of holistic data-driven analysis. Hadoop has become
the primary choice for mainstream platforms used by stakeholders to process big
data. Thereafter, the security of Hadoop platform has arisen tremendous
attention worldwide. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on enforcing access
control on users to ensure platform security. First, we leverage access proxy
integrated with attribute-based access control (ABAC) model to implement
front-end authorization, which can fully reflect and cope with the flexible
nature of the complex access control process in Hadoop platform, as well as can
release back-end resources from complex authorization process through access
proxy. Moreover, in order to ensure the fine-granularity of authorization, the
access proxy maintains a list composed of trust threshold value provided by
each resource according to its importance. The access proxy interacts with the
blockchain network to obtain the user's trust evaluation value, which serves as
an important basis for dynamic authorization determination. More specifically,
blockchain network works together on-chain and off-chain modes. The user's
historical behavior data is stored off-chain, and the corresponding hash value
is anchored on-chain. Consequently, the user's trust value is evaluated based
on his historical behavior stored on the blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the
authenticity of user behavior data can be guaranteed, thereby ensuring the
reliability of trust assessment results. Our experiment demonstrates that the
proposed model can dynamically and flexibly adjust user permissions to ensure
the security of the platform, while time and money are consumed within a
reasonable range.

further derive the expression for the curse matrix and give the necessary and
sufficient condition on the immunity to Rayleigh's curse. For estimating the
one-dimensional location parameters with a common initial state, we demonstrate
that the global immunity to the curse on quantum Fisher information is
impossible for more than two sources.

and Delta Sct-like oscillations of its mass-gaining primary component. We
analyse high-resolution spectra of RZ Cas that we obtained during a
spectroscopic long-term monitoring lasting from 2001 to 2017. Spectrum analysis
resulted in precise atmospheric parameters of both components, in particular in
surface abundances below solar values. We find that the variation of orbital
period is semi-regular and derive different characteristic timescales for
different epochs of observation. We show that the radial velocity variations
with orbital phase can be modelled when including two cool spots on the surface
of the secondary component. The modelling leads to precise masses and
separation of the components. The seasonal variation of several parameters,
such as vsin(i), rotation-orbit synchronisation factor, strength of the spots
on the cool companion, and orbital period, can be characterised by a common
timescale of the order of nine years. We interpret the timescale of nine years
as the magnetic activity cycle of the cool companion. In particular the
behaviour of the dark spots on the cool companion leads us to the
interpretation that this timescale is based on an 18-year magnetic dynamo
cycle. We conclude that the mass-transfer rate is controlled by the variable
depth of the Wilson depression in the magnetic spot around the Lagrangian point
L1. In the result, based on available data, we observe a damped activity cycle
of the star, starting with a high mass-transfer episode around 2001, followed
by quiet periods in 2006 and 2009, slightly higher activity around 2013 and
2014, and again followed by quiet periods in 2015 and 2016. However, owing to
missing data for years 2010 and 2011, we cannot exclude that a second high
mass-transfer episode occurred within this time span.

intrinsic symmetry breaking is central to the predictive power of EDF
approaches, yet is generally not exploited to the utmost by mass models because
of the computational demands of adjusting up to about two dozen parameters to
thousands of nuclear masses. We report on a first step to bridge the gap
between what is presently feasible for studies of individual nuclei and
large-scale models: we present a new Skyrme-EDF-based model that was adjusted
using a three-dimensional coordinate-space representation, for the first time
allowing for both axial and triaxial deformations during the adjustment
process. To compensate for the substantial increase in computational cost
brought by the latter, we have employed a committee of multilayer neural
networks to model the objective function in parameter space and guide us
towards the overall best fit. The resulting mass model BSkG1 is computed with
the EDF model independently of the neural network. It yields a root mean square
(rms) deviation on the 2457 known masses of 741 keV and an rms deviation on the
884 measured charge radii of 0.024 fm.

from streaming videos without any side information or access to future frames.
Recent methods proposed to aggregate fixed temporal ranges of invisible but
anticipated future frames representations as supplementary features and
achieved promising performance. They are based on the observation that human
beings often detect ongoing actions by contemplating the future vision
simultaneously. However, we observed that at different action progressions, the
optimal supplementary features should be obtained from distinct temporal ranges
instead of simply fixed future temporal ranges. To this end, we introduce an
adaptive features sampling strategy to overcome the mentioned variable-ranges
of optimal supplementary features. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a
novel Learning Action Progression Network termed LAP-Net, which integrates an
adaptive features sampling strategy. At each time step, this sampling strategy
first estimates current action progression and then decide what temporal ranges
should be used to aggregate the optimal supplementary features. We evaluated
our LAP-Net on three benchmark datasets, TVSeries, THUMOS-14 and HDD. The
extensive experiments demonstrate that with our adaptive feature sampling
strategy, the proposed LAP-Net can significantly outperform current

inspired by the pioneering work of Da Prato and Grisvard is developed. Besides
of its own interest, the approach yields a framework allowing global-in-time
control of the change of Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates in various problems
related to fluid mechanics. This property is of course decisive for free
boundary problems. This concept is illustrated by the analysis of the free
boundary value problem describing the motion of viscous, incompressible
Newtonian fluids without surface tension and, secondly, the motion of
compressible pressureless gases.
  For this purpose, an endpoint maximal $\mathrm{L}_1$-regularity approach to
the Stokes and Lam\'e systems is developed. It is applied then to establish
global, strong well-posedness results for the free boundary problems described
above in the case where the initial domain coincides with the half-space, and
the initial velocity is small with respect to a suitable scaling invariant
norm.

perform automated parameter tuning of databases. State-of-the-art approaches
include Bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL). In this
work, we describe our experience when applying these methods to a database not
yet studied in this context: FoundationDB. Firstly, we describe the challenges
we faced, such as unknown valid ranges of configuration parameters and
combinations of parameter values that result in invalid runs, and how we
mitigated them. While these issues are typically overlooked, we argue that they
are a crucial barrier to the adoption of ML self-tuning techniques in
databases, and thus deserve more attention from the research community.
Secondly, we present experimental results obtained when tuning FoundationDB
using ML methods. Unlike prior work in this domain, we also compare with the
simplest of baselines: random search. Our results show that, while BO and RL
methods can improve the throughput of FoundationDB by up to 38%, random search
is a highly competitive baseline, finding a configuration that is only 4% worse
than the, vastly more complex, ML methods. We conclude that future work in this
area may want to focus more on randomized, model-free optimization algorithms.

We speculate that the quasi-nulls are associated with foreshocks and

terrestrial quakes. This implies the energy reservoir built up between glitches
is not released suddenly, but over a period of minutes to hours around the time

connectivity for billions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the
required low-latency massive access necessitates a paradigm shift in the design
of random access schemes, which invokes a need of efficient joint activity and
data detection (JADD) algorithms. By exploiting the feature of sporadic traffic
in massive access, a beacon-aided slotted grant-free massive access solution is
proposed. Specifically, we spread the uplink access signals in multiple
subcarriers with pre-equalization processing and formulate the JADD as a
multiple measurement vector (MMV) compressive sensing problem. Moreover, to
leverage the structured sparsity of uplink massive access signals among
multiple time slots, we develop two computationally efficient detection
algorithms, which are termed as orthogonal approximate message passing
(OAMP)-MMV algorithm with simplified structure learning (SSL) and accurate
structure learning (ASL). To achieve accurate detection, the expectation
maximization algorithm is exploited for learning the sparsity ratio and the
noise variance. To further improve the detection performance, channel coding is
applied and successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based OAMP-MMV-SSL and
OAMP-MMV-ASL algorithms are developed, where the likelihood ratio obtained in
the soft-decision can be exploited for refining the activity identification.
Finally, the state evolution of the proposed OAMP-MMV-SSL and OAMP-MMV-ASL
algorithms is derived to predict the performance theoretically. Simulation
results verify that the proposed solutions outperform various state-of-the-art
baseline schemes, enabling low-latency random access and high-reliable massive
IoT connectivity with overloading.

quantum chemical simulations. From these observations, we describe the quantum
deep field (QDF), a machine learning (ML) model based on an underlying quantum
physics, in particular the density functional theory (DFT). We believe that the
QDF model can be easily understood because it can be regarded as a single
linear layer GCN. Moreover, it uses two vanilla feedforward neural networks to
learn an energy functional and a Hohenberg--Kohn map that have nonlinearities
inherent in quantum physics and the DFT. For molecular energy prediction tasks,
we demonstrated the viability of an ``extrapolation,'' in which we trained a
QDF model with small molecules, tested it with large molecules, and achieved
high extrapolation performance. This will lead to reliable and practical
applications for discovering effective materials. The implementation is

groups of power series expansions and two new groups of expansions in series of
Gauss hypergeometric functions. The convergence of one group in power series is
determined by means of ratio tests for infinite series, while the other groups
are designed to solve problems which admit finite-series solutions. Actually,
we envisage periodic quasi-exactly solvable potentials for which the stationary
one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation is reduced to the Darboux equation. In
general, finite- and infinite-series solutions are obtained from power series
expansions for Heun's equation. However, we show that the Schr\""odinger
equation admits additional finite-series expansions in terms of hypergeometric
functions for a family of associated Lam\'e potentials used in band theory of
solids. For each finite-series solution we find as well four infinite-series
expansions which are bounded and convergent for all values of the independent
variable. Finally we find that it is possible to use transformations of
variables in order to generate new solutions for the Darboux equation out of
other expansions in series of hypergeometric functions for the Heun equation.

system features a very efficient heat evacuation. Diffusion bonding assisted by
Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) was identified as a promising method of joining
the cooling circuits and the materials of the dump's core in order to maximise
the heat transfer efficiency. This paper presents the investigation of HIP
assisted diffusion bonding between two CuCr1Zr blanks enclosing SS 316L tubes
and the realisation of a real size prototype of one of the dump's cooling
plate, as well as the assessments of its cooling performance under the dumps
most critical operational scenarios. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectroscopy, microstructural analyses, measurements of thermal conductivity
and mechanical strength were performed to characterize the HIP diffusion bonded
interfaces (CuCr1Zr-CuCr1Zr and CuCr1Zr-SS316L). A test bench allowed to assess
the cooling performance of the real size prototype. At the bonded interface,
the presence of typical diffusional phenomena was observed. Moreover, measured
tensile strength and thermal conductivity were at least equivalent to the
lowest ones of the materials assembled and comparable to its bulk properties,
meaning that a good bonding quality was achieved. Finally, the real size
prototype was successfully tested with an ad-hoc thermal test bench and with
the highest operational thermal power expected in the new generation SPS

to its flexibility, mobility, and agility. Nevertheless, a limited onboard
battery greatly hinders UAV to prolong the serving time from communication
tasks that need a high power consumption in active RF communications.
Fortunately, caching and backscatter communication (BackCom) are appealing
technology for energy efficient communication systems. This motivates us to
investigate a wireless communication network with backscatter- and
cache-assisted UAV technology. We assume a UAV with a cache memory is deployed
as a flying backscatter device (BD), term the UAV-enabled BD (UB), to relay the
source's signals to the destination. Besides, the UAV can harvest energy from
the source's RF signals and then utilizes it for backscattering information to
the destination. In this context, we aim to maximize the total throughput by
jointly optimizing the dynamic time splitting (DTS) ratio, backscatter
coefficient, and the UB's trajectory with caching capability at the UB
corresponding to linear energy harvesting (LEH) and non-linear energy
harvesting (NLEH) models. These formulations are troublesome to directly solve
since they are mixed-integer non-convex problems. To find solutions, we
decompose the original problem into three subproblems, whereas we first
optimize the DTS ratio for a given backscatter coefficient and UB's trajectory,
followed by the backscatter coefficient optimization for a given DTS ratio and
UB's trajectory, and the UB's trajectory is finally optimized for a given DTS
ratio and backscatter coefficient. Finally, the intensive numerical results
demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significant throughput gain in
comparison to the benchmark schemes.

an algorithm that is authored, designed and maintained by the French Public
Finances Directorate (DGFiP). This algorithm relies on a legacy custom language
and compiler originally designed in 1990, which unlike French wine, did not age
well with time. Owing to the shortcomings of the input language and the
technical limitations of the compiler, the algorithm is proving harder and
harder to maintain, relying on ad-hoc behaviors and workarounds to implement
the most recent changes in tax law. Competence loss and aging code also mean
that the system does not benefit from any modern compiler techniques that would
increase confidence in the implementation. We overhaul this infrastructure and
present Mlang, an open-source compiler toolchain whose goal is to replace the
existing infrastructure. Mlang is based on a reverse-engineered formalization
of the DGFiP's system, and has been thoroughly validated against the private
DGFiP test suite. As such, Mlang has a formal semantics; eliminates previous
handwritten workarounds in C; compiles to modern languages (Python); and
enables a variety of instrumentations, providing deep insights about the

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Due to the commonly applied operator
splitting practice in reactive flow solvers, chemistry can be treated as an
independent stiff ordinary differential equation (ODE) system within each

to a problem that can be parallelized easily (called an embarrassingly parallel

advantage of this feature and balances the chemistry load across available
resources. Additionally, a reference mapping model is utilized to further
speed-up the simulations. When DLBFoam it utilized with both these features

competition, including exclusion of either species, mono-stable coexistence of
both species at different population proportions, and bi-stable coexistence
with proportions of populations that depend on the initial condition.
Remarkably, in the bi-stable phase, the system undergoes a discontinuous
transition as the intensity of immigration overcomes a threshold, leading to a
half loop dynamics associated to a cusp catastrophe, which causes the
irreversible loss of the species with the shortest dispersal range.

for the loss of Landau damping (LLD) in the longitudinal plane are derived
analytically using the Lebedev matrix equation (1968) and the concept of the
emerged van Kampen modes (1983). We have found that for the commonly-used
particle distribution functions from a binomial family, the LLD threshold
vanishes in the presence of the constant inductive impedance Im$Z/k$ above
transition energy. Thus, the effect of the cutoff frequency or the resonant
frequency of a broad-band impedance on beam dynamics is studied in detail. The
findings are confirmed by direct numerical solutions of the Lebedev equation as
well as using the Oide-Yokoya method (1990). Moreover, the characteristics,
which are important for beam operation, as the amplitude of residual
oscillations and the damping time after a kick (or injection errors) are
considered both above and below the threshold. Dependence of the threshold on
particle distribution in the longitudinal phase space is also analyzed,
including some special cases with a non-zero threshold for Im$Z/k = const$. All

Despite their popularity, it is well known that they have constraints that
hinder their applications to complex problems. The core issue lies in the need
to describe the system using a small number of collective variables (CVs). Any
slow degree of freedom that is not properly described by the chosen CVs will
hinder sampling efficiency. However, exploration of configuration space is also
hampered by including variables that are not relevant to describe the activated

where the high-dimensional CVs space is divided into basins, each of which is
described by an automatically-determined, low-dimensional set of variables. A
well-tempered metadynamics-like bias is constructed as a function of these
local variables. Indicator functions associated with the basins switch on and
off the local biases, so that the sampling is performed on a collection of
low-dimensional CV spaces, that are smoothly combined to generate an
effectively high-dimensional bias. The unbiased Boltzmann distribution is
recovered through reweighing, making the evaluation of conformational and
thermodynamic properties straightforward. The decomposition of the free-energy
landscape in local basins can be updated iteratively as the simulation

heterostructures with Rashba spin-orbit interactions come into play. Transition
metal oxides with heavy ions are especially interesting in this respect. We
discuss the design principles for stacking oxide Rashba layers. Assuming a
single layer with a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on both interfaces as a
building block, a two-dimensional topological insulating phase is present when
negative coupling between the 2DEGs exists. When stacking multiple building
blocks, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional topological insulator is
artificially created, depending on the intra- and interlayer coupling strengths
and the number of building blocks. We show that the three-dimensional
topological insulator is protected by reflection symmetry, and can therefore be
classified as a topological crystalline insulator. In order to isolate the
topological states from bulk states, the intralayer coupling term needs to be
quadratic in momentum. It is described how such a quadratic coupling could
potentially be realized by taking buckling within the layers into account. The
buckling, thereby, brings the idea of stacked Rashba system very close to the
alternative approach of realizing the buckled honeycomb lattice in
[111]-oriented perovskite oxides.

health applications, based on combining key aspects of two established online
problems with bandit feedback. Both assume that the optimal action to play is
contingent on an underlying changing state which is not directly observable by
the agent. They differ in what kind of side information can be used to estimate
this state. The first one considers each state to be associated with a context,
possibly corrupted, allowing the agent to learn the context-to-state mapping.
The second one considers that the state itself evolves in a Markovian fashion,
thus allowing the agent to estimate the current state based on history. We
argue that it is realistic for the agent to have access to both these sources
of information, i.e., an arbitrarily corrupted context obeying the Markov
property. Thus, the agent is faced with a new challenge of balancing its belief
about the reliability of information from learned state transitions versus
context information. We present an algorithm that uses a referee to dynamically
combine the policies of a contextual bandit and a multi-armed bandit. We
capture the time-correlation of states through iteratively learning the
action-reward transition model, allowing for efficient exploration of actions.
Users transition through different unobserved, time-correlated but only
partially observable internal states, which determine their current needs. The
side-information about users might not always be reliable and standard
approaches solely relying on the context risk incurring high regret. Similarly,
some users might exhibit weaker correlations between subsequent states, leading
to approaches that solely rely on state transitions risking the same. We
evaluate our method on simulated data and on several real-world data sets,
showing improved empirical performance compared to several popular algorithms.

It has been proposed that the gap is the manifestation of structural
instabilities within stellar interiors due to non-equilibrium $^{3}$He fusion
prior to some stars becoming fully convective. To test this hypothesis, we use
Dartmouth stellar evolution models, MARCS model atmospheres, and simple stellar
population synthesis to create synthetic $M_G$-($G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP})$
color-magnitude diagrams. We confirm that the proposed $^{3}$He instability is
responsible for the appearance of the M-dwarf gap. Our synthetic gap shows
qualitatively similar features to the observed gap including: its vertical
extent in $M_G$, its slope in the color-magnitude diagram, and its relative
prominence at bluer colors as compared to redder colors. Furthermore,
corresponding over-densities of stars above the gap are reproduced by the
models. While qualitatively similar, the synthetic gap is approximately 0.2
magnitudes bluer and, accounting for this color offset, 0.16 magnitudes
brighter than the observed gap. Our results reveal that the Gaia M dwarf gap is
sensitive to conditions within cores of M dwarf stars, making the gap a

evaluating quantum transport measurements offering a powerful alternative to
methods of the traditional full counting statistics. Experimental time-traces
of the occupation dynamics of a single quantum dot are evaluated via
simultaneously fitting their 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-order spectra. The scheme
recovers the same electron tunneling and spin relaxation rates as previously
obtained from an analysis of the same data in terms of factorial cumulants of
the full counting statistics and waiting-time distributions. Moreover, the
evaluation of time-traces via quantum polyspectra is demonstrated to be
feasible also in the weak measurement regime even when quantum jumps can no
longer be identified from time-traces and methods related to the full counting
statistics cease to be applicable. A numerical study of a double dot system
shows strongly changing features in the quantum polyspectra for the transition
from the weak measurement regime to the Zeno-regime where coherent tunneling

constant and the potential part of the initial velocity to be small
independently of the rescaled viscosity parameter $\varepsilon$ while the
rotational part of the initial velocity is assumed to be small compared to
$\varepsilon$. We then show that the lifespan of the system $T^{\varepsilon}$
satisfies $T^{\varepsilon}>\varepsilon^{-(1-\vartheta)}$, where the small
constant $\vartheta$ is the size of the initial perturbation in some suitable

widely used by financial risk managers across the globe. However, they are time
consuming and sometimes inaccurate. In this paper, a fast and accurate Monte
Carlo algorithm for calculating VaR and ES based on Gaussian Mixture Models is
introduced. Gaussian Mixture Models are able to cluster input data with respect
to market's conditions and therefore no correlation matrices are needed for
risk computation. Sampling from each cluster with respect to their weights and
then calculating the volatility-adjusted stock returns leads to possible
scenarios for prices of assets. Our results on a sample of US stocks show that
the Gmm-based VaR model is computationally efficient and accurate. From a
managerial perspective, our model can efficiently mimic the turbulent behavior
of the market. As a result, our VaR measures before, during and after crisis
periods realistically reflect the highly non-normal behavior and non-linear
correlation structure of the market.

tidally stripped intergalactic environment and has a low average metallicity of
$Z~0.1Z_{\odot}$. Here we report the first discovery of three O-type stars in
the Bridge using archival spectra collected with FLAMES at ESO/VLT. We analyze
the spectra using the PoWR models, which provide the physical parameters,
ionizing photon fluxes, and surface abundances. This discovery suggests that
the tidally stripped low density gas is capable of producing massive O stars
and their ages imply ongoing star formation in the Bridge. The multi-epoch
spectra indicate that all three O stars are binaries. Despite their spatial
proximity to each other, these O stars are chemically distinct. One of them is
a fast-rotating giant with nearly LMC-like abundances. The other two are
main-sequence stars that rotate extremely slowly and are strongly metal
depleted. This includes the most nitrogen-poor O star known up to date. Taking
into account the previous analyses of B stars in the Bridge, we interpret the
various metal abundances as the signature of a chemically inhomogeneous
interstellar medium, suggesting that the gas might have accreted during
multiple episodes of tidal interaction between the Clouds. Attributing the
lowest derived metal content to the primordial gas, the time of initial
formation of the Bridge may date back to several Gyr. Using the Gaia and Galex
color-magnitude diagrams we roughly estimate the total number of O stars in the
Bridge and their total ionizing radiation. Comparing with the energetics of the
diffuse ISM, we find that the contribution of the hot stars to the ionizing
radiation field in the Bridge is less than 10%, and conclude that the main
sources of ionizing photons are leaks from the LMC and SMC. We estimate a lower
limit for the fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes from these two dwarf
galaxies.

aims to localize objects with only image-level labels. Due to the lack of
ground truth bounding boxes, class labels are mainly employed to train the
model. This model generates a class activation map (CAM) which activates the
most discriminate features. However, the main drawback of CAM is the ability to
detect just a part of the object. To solve this problem, some researchers have
removed parts from the detected object \cite{b1, b2, b4}, or the image
\cite{b3}. The aim of removing parts from image or detected parts of the object
is to force the model to detect the other features. However, these methods
require one or many hyper-parameters to erase the appropriate pixels on the
image, which could involve a loss of information. In contrast, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Complementary Learning Network method (HCLNet) that
helps the CNN to perform better classification and localization of objects on
the images. HCLNet uses a complementary map to force the network to detect the
other parts of the object. Unlike previous works, this method does not need any
extras hyper-parameters to generate different CAMs, as well as does not
introduce a big loss of information. In order to fuse these different maps, two
different fusion strategies known as the addition strategy and the l1-norm
strategy have been used. These strategies allowed to detect the whole object
while excluding the background. Extensive experiments show that HCLNet obtains
better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

thermodynamics of asymptotically many non-interacting systems. To every state
we associate the vector of its expected charge values and its entropy, forming
the phase diagram of the system. Our fundamental result is the Asymptotic
Equivalence Theorem (AET), which allows us to identify the equivalence classes
of states under asymptotic approximately charge-conserving unitaries with the
points of the phase diagram.
  Using the phase diagram of a system and its bath, we analyze the first and
the second laws of thermodynamics. In particular, we show that to attain the
second law, an asymptotically large bath is necessary. In the case that the
bath is composed of several identical copies of the same elementary bath, we
quantify exactly how large the bath has to be to permit a specified work
transformation of a given system, in terms of the number of copies of the
elementary bath systems per work system (bath rate). If the bath is relatively
small, we show that the analysis requires an extended phase diagram exhibiting
negative entropies. This corresponds to the purely quantum effect that at the
end of the process, system and bath are entangled, thus permitting classically
impossible transformations. For a large bath, system and bath may be left
uncorrelated and we show that the optimal bath rate, as a function of how
tightly the second law is attained, can be expressed in terms of the heat
capacity of the bath.
  Our approach solves a problem from earlier investigations about how to store
the different charges under optimal work extraction protocols in physically

differences between these models. Motivated by this, we consider gravitational
lensing by the nonsingular Kerr-Sen black holes, which encompass Kerr black
holes as a particular case, to calculate the light deflection coefficients $p$
and $q$ in strong-field limits, while the former increases with increasing

more slowly and impact parameter for photon orbits $u_{m}$ more quickly, but
angular separation $s$ increases more rapidly with parameters $b$ and $k$. We
compare our results with those for Kerr black holes, and also the formalism is

we can postulate how it would look in the world; given a 2D image, we can infer
the 3D structure that likely gave rise to it. We can thus translate between the
2D visual and 3D structural modalities of a given object. In the context of
computer vision, this corresponds to a learnable module that serves two
purposes: (i) generate a realistic rendering of a 3D object (shape-to-image
translation) and (ii) infer a realistic 3D shape from an image (image-to-shape
translation). In this paper, we learn such a module while being conscious of
the difficulties in obtaining large paired 2D-3D datasets. By leveraging
generative domain translation methods, we are able to define a learning
algorithm that requires only weak supervision, with unpaired data. The
resulting model is not only able to perform 3D shape, pose, and texture
inference from 2D images, but can also generate novel textured 3D shapes and
renders, similar to a graphics pipeline. More specifically, our method (i)
infers an explicit 3D mesh representation, (ii) utilizes example shapes to
regularize inference, (iii) requires only an image mask (no keypoints or camera
extrinsics), and (iv) has generative capabilities. While prior work explores
subsets of these properties, their combination is novel. We demonstrate the
utility of our learned representation, as well as its performance on image
generation and unpaired 3D shape inference tasks.

performance emerging optoelectronic devices, including flexoelectric systems,
yet the influence of their ionic nature on their mechanical behaviour is still
to be understood. Here, a combination of atomic-force, optical and
compositional X-ray microscopy techniques is employed to shed light on the
mechanical properties of halide perovskite films at the nanoscale. We reveal
mechanical domains within and between morphological grains, enclosed by
mechanical boundaries of higher Young's Modulus than the bulk parent material.
These mechanical boundaries are associated with the presence of bromide-rich
clusters as visualized by nano-X-ray fluorescence mapping. Stiffer regions are
specifically selectively modified upon light soaking the sample, resulting in
an overall homogenization of the mechanical properties towards the bulk Young's
Modulus. We attribute this behaviour to light-induced ion migration processes
that homogenize the local chemical distribution, which is accompanied by
photobrightening of the photoluminescence within the same region. Our work
highlights critical links between mechanical, chemical and optoelectronic
characteristics in this family of perovskites, and demonstrates the potential
of combinational imaging studies to understand and design halide perovskite
films for emerging applications such as photoflexoelectricity.

in the dual cone of the set of so-called homological directions introduced by
Fried for flows in the given manifold.
  As a consequence of our description of the generalized fibered cone, we show
that for a sequence in a proper subcone of the generalized fibered cone, the
corresponding sequence of monodromies admits an upper bound for their
asymptotic translation lengths on the sphere complexes of the fibers, purely in
terms of the dimension of the maximal slice of the generalized fibered cone
containing the given sequence.
  Then we particularly consider the 4-dimensional mapping torus of a doubled
handlebody with monodromy induced by an expanding irreducible train tack map
which is also a homotopy equivalence. Identifying its generalized fibered cone
with a symmetrized ""McMullen cone"" of Dowdall--Kapovich--Leininger, we obtain
similar estimations for the asymptotic translation lengths of the
$\mathrm{Out}(F_g)$-actions on the free-splitting complex and the free-factor
complex as corollaries.
  Moreover, we also apply our argument to the 4-dimensional mapping torus of a

minimal asymptotic translation lengths of handlebody groups on disk graphs,

underlying other well-known quantities such as entanglement, quantum discord,
and Bell correlations. It can be distributed in a multipartite system in
various ways -- for example, in a bipartite system it can exist within
subsystems (local coherence) or collectively between the subsystems (global
coherence) and exhibits a trade-off relation. In quantum systems with more than
two subsystems, there are more trade-off relations, due to the various
decomposition ways of the coherence. In this paper, we experimentally verify
these coherence trade-off relations in adiabatically evolved quantum systems
using a spin system by changing the state from a product state to a tripartite
entangled state. We study the full set of coherence trade-off relations between
the original state, the bipartite product state, the tripartite product state,
and the decohered product state. We also experimentally verify the monogamy
inequality and show that both the quantum systems are polygamous except for the
initial product state. We find that despite the different types of states
involved, the properties of the state in terms of coherence and monogamy are
equivalent. This illustrates the utility of using coherence as a
characterization tool for quantum states.

external stimuli such as light. An initial homogeneous BCP melt is rapidly
quenched to a temperature $T < T_c$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature.
We then let the system go through alternate light ""on"" and ""off"" cycles. An
on-cycle breaks the stimuli-sensitive bonds connecting both the blocks A and B
in BCP melt, and during the off-cycle, broken bonds reconnect. By simulating
the effect of light, we isolate scenarios where phase separation begins with
the light off (set 1); the cooperative interactions within the system allow it
to undergo microphase separation. When the phase separation starts with the
light on (set 2), the system undergoes macrophase separation due to the bond
breaking. Here, we report the role of alternate cycles on domain morphology by
varying bond-breaking probability for both the sets 1 and 2, respectively. We
observe that the scaling functions depend upon the conditions mentioned above
that change the time scale of the evolving morphologies in various cycles.
However, in all the cases, the average domain size respects the power-law
growth: $R(t)\sim t^{\phi}$ at late times, here $\phi$ is the dynamic growth
exponent. After a short-lived diffusive growth ($\phi \sim 1/3$) at early
times, $\phi$ illustrates a crossover from the viscous hydrodynamic ($\phi \sim

training of neural networks in the field of deep learning. In literature there
are many papers that compare neural models trained with the use of different
optimizers. Each paper demonstrates that for a particular problem an optimizer
is better than the others but as the problem changes this type of result is no
longer valid and we have to start from scratch. In our paper we propose to use
the combination of two very different optimizers but when used simultaneously
they can overcome the performances of the single optimizers in very different
problems. We propose a new optimizer called MAS (Mixing ADAM and SGD) that
integrates SGD and ADAM simultaneously by weighing the contributions of both
through the assignment of constant weights. Rather than trying to improve SGD
or ADAM we exploit both at the same time by taking the best of both. We have
conducted several experiments on images and text document classification, using
various CNNs, and we demonstrated by experiments that the proposed MAS
optimizer produces better performance than the single SGD or ADAM optimizers.

candidates with MUSE, with a secondary aim of improving the high-resolution
spectral differential imaging (HRSDI) technique by analyzing the instrumental
residuals of MUSE. We analyzed MUSE observations of five young stars and
applied the HRSDI technique to perform high-contrast imaging. With a 30 min
integration time, MUSE can reach 5$\sigma$ detection limits in apparent
H$\alpha$ line flux down to 10$^{-14}$ and 10$^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ at
0.075"" and 0.25"", respectively. In addition to PDS 70 b and c, we did not
detect any clear accretion signatures in PDS 70, J1850-3147, and V1094 Sco down

characteristics in the spatial direction at multiple wavelengths. We detected
two asymmetric atomic jets in HD 163296. The HRSDI technique when applied to
MUSE data allows us to reach the photon noise limit at small separations (i.e.,
< 0.5""). With a higher spectral resolution, MUSE can achieve fainter detection
limits in apparent line flux than SPHERE/ZIMPOL by a factor of $\sim$5. MUSE
has some instrumental issues that limit the contrast that appear in cases with
strong point sources, which can be either a spatial point source due to high
Strehl observations or a spectral point source due to a high line-to-continuum
ratio. We modified the HRSDI technique to better handle the instrumental
artifacts and improve the detection limits.

prevent potential damage to the robot during navigation. For this purpose, it
is often assumed that one must deal with known probabilistic obstacles, then
compute the probability of collision with each obstacle. However, in complex
scenarios or unstructured environments, it might be difficult to detect such
obstacles. In these cases, a metric map is used, where each position stores the
information of occupancy. The most common type of metric map is the Bayesian
occupancy map. However, this type of map is not well suited for computing risk
assessments for continuous paths due to its discrete nature. Hence, we
introduce a novel type of map called the Lambda Field, which is specially
designed for risk assessment. We first propose a way to compute such a map and
the expectation of a generic risk over a path. Then, we demonstrate the
benefits of our generic formulation with a use case defining the risk as the
expected collision force over a path. Using this risk definition and the Lambda
Field, we show that our framework is capable of doing classical path planning
while having a physical-based metric. Furthermore, the Lambda Field gives a
natural way to deal with unstructured environments, such as tall grass. Where
standard environment representations would always generate trajectories going
around such obstacles, our framework allows the robot to go through the grass
while being aware of the risk taken.

different data sets, both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational

(confounding) co-occurring effects but they may suffer from
unrepresentativeness, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large
observational samples are often more representative of the target population
but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this
paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on
combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds.
We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve
generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data.
Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome
models, and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs
and observational data to either ensure uncounfoundedness of the observational
analysis or to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation. We
also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes

and non-adaptive gradient methods in deep learning stems from the increased
estimation noise in the flattest directions of the true loss surface. We
demonstrate that typical schedules used for adaptive methods (with low
numerical stability or damping constants) serve to bias relative movement
towards flat directions relative to sharp directions, effectively amplifying
the noise-to-signal ratio and harming generalisation. We further demonstrate
that the numerical damping constant used in these methods can be decomposed
into a learning rate reduction and linear shrinkage of the estimated curvature
matrix. We then demonstrate significant generalisation improvements by
increasing the shrinkage coefficient, closing the generalisation gap entirely
in both logistic regression and several deep neural network experiments.
Extending this line further, we develop a novel random matrix theory based
damping learner for second order optimiser inspired by linear shrinkage
estimation. We experimentally demonstrate our learner to be very insensitive to
the initialised value and to allow for extremely fast convergence in
conjunction with continued stable training and competitive generalisation.

allows the membership of a given element to be defined in forms of several
possible generalized types of fuzzy set, we encourage to propose the higher
order hesitant fuzzy (HOHF) Choquet integral operator. This concept not only
considers the importance of the higher order hesitant fuzzy arguments, but also
it can reflect the correlations among those arguments. Then,a detailed
discussion on the aggregation properties of the HOHF Choquet integral operator

Mimicking the learning process of humans with their senses, deep learning
networks are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos or sounds.
These networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and,
because of this, the whole field saw an exponential growth during the last
years. This growth resulted in way over 10,000 publications per year in the
last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone, which covers only a

the field of deep learning is already impossible to obtain and, in the near
future, it will potentially become difficult to obtain an overview over a
subfield. However, there are several review articles about deep learning, which
are focused on specific scientific fields or applications, for example deep
learning advances in computer vision or in specific tasks like object
detection. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution is

Bell-like inequalities can be derived from the entangled histories approach and
as a generalization, we derive the quantum bound for multi-time Bell-like

which the targets are much smaller than the size of the search domain. The
small target assumption allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions and
Green's functions to solve the diffusion equation in Laplace space. In
particular, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux
into each target in powers of the non-dimensionalized target size $\epsilon$.
One major advantage of working directly with fluxes is that one can generate
statistical quantities such as splitting probabilities and conditional first
passage time moments without having to solve a separate boundary value problem
in each case. However, in order to derive asymptotic expansions of these
quantities, it is necessary to eliminate Green's function singularities that
arise in the limit $s\rightarrow 0$, where $s$ is the Laplace variable. We
achieve this by considering a triple expansion in $\epsilon$, $s$ and
$\Lambda\sim \epsilon /s$. This allows us to perform partial summations over
infinite power series in $\Lambda$, which leads to multiplicative factors of
the form $\Lambda^n/(1+\Lambda)^n $. Since $\Lambda^n/(1+\Lambda)^n \rightarrow
1$ as $s\rightarrow 0$, the singularities in $s$ are eliminated. We then show
how corresponding asymptotic expansions of the splitting probabilities and
conditional MFPTs can be derived in the small-$s$ limit. Finally, we illustrate
the theory by considering a pair of targets in a spherical search domain, for
which the Green's functions can be calculated explicitly.

attention received by LIS in terms of communication aspects, it can offer a
high-resolution rendering of the propagation environment. This is because, in
an indoor setting, it can be placed in proximity to the sensed phenomena, while
the high resolution is offered by densely spaced tiny antennas deployed over a
large area. By treating an LIS as a radio image of the environment relying on
the received signal power, we develop techniques to sense the environment, by
leveraging the tools of image processing and machine learning. Once a
holographic image is obtained, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) network can be
used for constructing a super-resolution image leading to sensing advantages
not available in traditional sensing systems. Also, we derive a statistical

investigated. The $om(z)$ analysis of the Universe in derived model shows that
the Universe is filled with dynamical dark energy with its equation of state
parameter $\omega_{de} > -1$. Hence the Universe behaves like a quintessence
model at present epoch. Some physical properties of the Universe are also
discussed.

avoiding bone fracture. The aim of this study is to validate a method using a
hammer instrumented with a force sensor to monitor the insertion of femoral
stem in bovine femoral samples. Methods 20 Different cementless femoral stem
were impacted into five bovine femur samples, leading to 99 configurations.
Three methods were used to quantify the insertion endpoint: the impact hammer,
video motion tracking and the surgeon proprioception. For each configuration,
the number of impacts performed by the surgeon until he felt a correct
insertion was noted Nsurg. The insertion depth E was measured through video
motion tracking, and the impact number Nvid corresponding to the end of the
insertion was estimated. Two indicators, noted I and D, 25 were determined from
the analysis of the time variation of the force, and the impact number Nd
corresponding to a threshold reached in D variation was estimated. Findings The
pullout force of the femoral stem was significantly correlated with I
(R${}^2$=0.81). The values of Nsurg, Nvid and Nd were similar for all
configurations. 30 Interpretation The results validate the use of the impact

After signal processing, this type of data may be organized as a 4-way tensor

suffer from privacy and security concerns since data is collected from clients

an architecture in which model parameters are exchanged instead of client data,
has been proposed as a solution to these concerns. Nevertheless, FL trains a
global model by communicating with clients over communication rounds, which
introduces more traffic on the network and increases the convergence time to
the target accuracy. In this work, we solve the problem of optimizing accuracy
in stateful FL with a budgeted number of candidate clients by selecting the
best candidate clients in terms of test accuracy to participate in the training

of random heterogeneous materials using machine learning based on artificial
neural networks. The proposed neural network-based identification method
requires the construction of a database from which an artificial neural network
can be trained to learn the nonlinear relationship between the hyperparameters
of a prior stochastic model of the random compliance field and some relevant
quantities of interest of an ad hoc multiscale computational model. An initial
database made up with input and target data is first generated from the
computational model, from which a processed database is deduced by conditioning
the input data with respect to the target data using the nonparametric
statistics. Two-and three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks are then
trained from each of the initial and processed databases to construct an
algebraic representation of the nonlinear mapping between the hyperparameters
(network outputs) and the quantities of interest (network inputs). The
performances of the trained artificial neural networks are analyzed in terms of
mean squared error, linear regression fit and probability distribution between
network outputs and targets for both databases. An ad hoc probabilistic model
of the input random vector is finally proposed in order to take into account
uncertainties on the network input and to perform a robustness analysis of the
network output with respect to the input uncertainties level. The capability of
the proposed neural network-based identification method to efficiently solve
the underlying statistical inverse problem is illustrated through two numerical
examples developed within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity,
namely a first validation example on synthetic data obtained through
computational simulations and a second application example on real experimental
data obtained through a physical experiment monitored by digital image
correlation on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone).

studying brain activity. During an fMRI session, the subject executes a set of
tasks (task-related fMRI study) or no tasks (resting-state fMRI), and a
sequence of 3-D brain images is obtained for further analysis. In the course of
fMRI, some sources of activation are caused by noise and artifacts. The removal
of these sources is essential before the analysis of the brain activations.
Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures can be used for denoising and artifact
removal. The main advantage of DNN models is the automatic learning of abstract
and meaningful features, given the raw data. This work presents advanced DNN
architectures for noise and artifact classification, using both spatial and
temporal information in resting-state fMRI sessions. The highest performance is
achieved by a voting schema using information from all the domains, with an
average accuracy of over 98% and a very good balance between the metrics of
sensitivity and specificity (98.5% and 97.5% respectively).

  versions of this paper for more technical details",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A large variety of sophisticated metaheuristic methods have been proposed for
photovoltaic parameter extraction. Our aim is not to develop another
metaheuristic method but to investigate two practically important yet rarely
studied issues: (i) whether existing results are already globally optimal; (ii)
whether a significantly simpler metaheuristic can achieve equally good
performance. We take the two widely used I-V curve datasets for case studies.
The first issue is addressed using a branch and bound algorithm, which
certifies the global minimum rigorously or locates a fairly tight upper bound,
despite its intolerable slowness. These values are useful references for fair
evaluation and further development of metaheuristics. Next, extensive
examination and comparison reveal that, perhaps surprisingly, an elementary
differential evolution (DE) algorithm can either attain the global minimum
certified above or obtain the best-known result. More attractively, the simple
DE algorithm takes only a fraction of the runtime of state-of-the-art
metaheuristic methods and is particularly preferable in time-sensitive
applications. This novel, unusual, and notable finding also indicates that the
employment of increasingly complicated metaheuristics might be somewhat
overkilling for regular PV parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the
implications of these results for future research and suggest the simple DE
method as the first choice for industrial applications.

increases significantly from a background dataset compared to a target dataset.
CPM is particularly useful for characterising changes in evolving systems,
e.g., in network traffic analysis to detect unusual activity. While most
existing techniques focus on extracting either the whole set of contrast
patterns (CPs) or minimal sets, the problem of efficiently finding a relevant
subset of CPs, especially in high dimensional datasets, is an open challenge.
In this paper, we focus on extracting the most specific set of CPs to discover
significant changes between two datasets. Our approach to this problem uses
closed patterns to substantially reduce redundant patterns. Our experimental
results on several real and emulated network traffic datasets demonstrate that
our proposed unsupervised algorithm is up to 100 times faster than an existing
approach for CPM on network traffic data [2]. In addition, as an application of
CPs, we demonstrate that CPM is a highly effective method for detection of
meaningful changes in network traffic.
