more secure than WBAN, nevertheless, the electromagnetic (EM) radiative nature
of HBC in >10MHz region makes the information susceptible to eavesdropping.
Furthermore, interferences may be picked up by the body due to the human body
antenna effect in the 40-400MHz range. Alternatively, electro-quasistatic (EQS)
mode of HBC forms an attractive way for covert data transmission in the sub
10MHz region by allowing the signal to be contained within the body. However,
there is a gap in the knowledge about the mechanism and sources of interference
in this region (crucial in allowing for proper choice of data transmission
band). In this paper, the interference coupling modality in the EQS region is
explained along with its possible sources. Interferences seen by the wearable

HBC setup is designed to recreate it by employing a wearable sized measurement

of methods is to translate the image style from another environment to the one
on which models are trained. In this paper, we propose a weakly-paired setting
for the style translation, where the content in the two images is aligned with
errors in poses. These images could be acquired by different sensors in
different conditions that share an overlapping region, e.g. with LiDAR or
stereo cameras, from sunny days or foggy nights. We consider this setting to be
more practical with: (i) easier labeling than the paired data; (ii) better
interpretability and detail retrieval than the unpaired data. To translate
across such images, we propose PREGAN to train a style translator by
intentionally transforming the two images with a random pose, and to estimate
the given random pose by differentiable non-trainable pose estimator given that
the more aligned in style, the better the estimated result is. Such adversarial
training enforces the network to learn the style translation, avoiding being
entangled with other variations. Finally, PREGAN is validated on both simulated
and real-world collected data to show the effectiveness. Results on down-stream
tasks, classification, road segmentation, object detection, and feature
matching show its potential for real applications.

related to symmetry of the semigroup. While this approach allows to study the
performance of estimators for the characteristics of the process in the minimax
sense, it restricts the applicability of results to a rather constrained set of
stochastic processes and in particular hardly allows incorporating jump
structures. As a consequence, for many models of applied and theoretical
interest, no statement can be made about the robustness of typical statistical
procedures beyond the beautiful, but limited framework available in the
literature. To close this gap, we identify $\beta$-mixing of the process and
heat kernel bounds on the transition density as a suitable combination to
obtain $\sup$-norm and $L^2$ kernel invariant density estimation rates matching
the case of reversible multidimenisonal diffusion processes and outperforming
density estimation based on discrete i.i.d. or weakly dependent data. Moreover,
we demonstrate how up to $\log$-terms, optimal $\sup$-norm adaptive invariant
density estimation can be achieved within our general framework based on tight
uniform moment bounds and deviation inequalities for empirical processes
associated to additive functionals of Markov processes. The underlying
assumptions are verifiable with classical tools from stability theory of
continuous time Markov processes and PDE techniques, which opens the door to
evaluate statistical performance for a vast amount of Markov models. We
highlight this point by showing how multidimensional jump SDEs with L\'evy
driven jump part under different coefficient assumptions can be seamlessly
integrated into our framework, thus establishing novel adaptive $\sup$-norm

paper, we present a secure two-party protocol to determine the existence of an
intersection between entities. The protocol presented in this paper allows for
intersection detection in three-dimensional spaces in geometry. Our approach is
to use an intersecting plane between two spaces to determine their separation
or intersection. For this purpose, we introduce a computational geometry
protocol to determine the existence of an intersecting plane. In this paper, we
first use the Minkowski difference to reduce the two-space problem into
one-space. Then, the separating set is obtained and the separation of two
shapes is determined based on the inclusion of the center point. We then secure
the protocol by modifying the separating set computation method as a
privacy-preserver and changing the Minkowski difference method to achieve this
goal. The proposed protocol applies to any form of convex three-dimensional
shape. The experiments successfully found a secure protocol for intersection
detection between two convex hulls in geometrical shapes such as the pyramid

It provides
information about the spatial arrangement and rate of change of objects in

scene flow directly from point clouds and have achieved state-of-the-art
performance. However, supervised learning methods are inherently domain
specific and require a large amount of labeled data. Annotation of scene flow
on real-world point clouds is expensive and challenging, and the lack of such
datasets has recently sparked interest in self-supervised learning methods. How
to accurately and robustly learn scene flow representations without labeled
real-world data is still an open problem. Here we present a simple and
interpretable objective function to recover the scene flow from point clouds.
We use the graph Laplacian of a point cloud to regularize the scene flow to be
""as-rigid-as-possible"". Our proposed objective function can be used with or
without learning---as a self-supervisory signal to learn scene flow
representations, or as a non-learning-based method in which the scene flow is
optimized during runtime. Our approach outperforms related works in many
datasets. We also show the immediate applications of our proposed method for
two applications: motion segmentation and point cloud densification.

characterizes the magnitude and sign of pairwise interactions between

considerable scientific and practical interest. Estimating the second virial
coefficient from experimental data is challenging due both to the degree of
precision required and the complexity of the error structure involved. In
contrast to conventional approaches based on heuristic OLS estimates, Bayesian
inference for the second virial coefficient allows explicit modeling of error

on the Chandra observations of Swift J1818.0-1607, which allowed for a
high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic study of the magnetar and its
environment. The 1-10 keV spectrum of the magnetar is best described by a
single blackbody model with a temperature of 1.2\pm0.1 keV and an unabsorbed
flux of 1.9e-11 ergs/cm^2/s. This implies an X-ray luminosity of ~9.6e34 ergs/s
and an efficiency of ~0.13 at a distance of 6.5 kpc. The Chandra image also
shows faint diffuse emission out to >10"" from the magnetar, with its spectrum
adequately described by a powerlaw with a photon index of 2.0\pm0.5 and a
luminosity of ~8.1e33 ergs/s. The extended emission is likely dominated by a
dust scattering halo and future observations of the source in quiescence will
reveal any underlying compact wind nebula. We conclude that Swift J1818.0-1607
is a transient source showing properties between high-B pulsars and magnetars,

different networks to be both consistent and confident, we enhance this
generalized JSD loss with an uncertainty regularizer based on entropy. The
robustness of individual models is further improved using a self-ensembling

a divisible resource that can be allocated in varying amounts to arm pulls. We
focus in particular on the allocation of distributed computing resources, where
we may obtain results faster by allocating more resources per pull, but might
have reduced throughput due to nonlinear scaling. For example, in
simulation-based scientific studies, an expensive simulation can be sped up by
running it on multiple cores. This speed-up however, is partly offset by the
communication among cores, which results in lower throughput than if fewer
cores were allocated per trial to run more trials in parallel. In this paper,
we explore these trade-offs in two settings. First, in a fixed confidence
setting, we need to find the best arm with a given target success probability
as quickly as possible. We propose an algorithm which trades off between
information accumulation and throughput and show that the time taken can be
upper bounded by the solution of a dynamic program whose inputs are the gaps
between the sub-optimal and optimal arms. We also prove a matching hardness
result. Second, we present an algorithm for a fixed deadline setting, where we
are given a time deadline and need to maximize the probability of finding the
best arm. We corroborate our theoretical insights with simulation experiments

algorithms on a variety of problem instances.

have contributed to the polarization of face masks. A typical method to

survey-based approaches have multiple limitations: biased responses, limited

determine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards
face masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data. First, we infer
several key demographics of individual Twitter users such as their age, gender,
and whether they are a college student using a multi-modal demographic
prediction framework and analyze the average sentiment for each respective
demographic. Next, we conduct topic analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA). Finally, we conduct offline change point discovery on our sentiment time

Experimental results on a large corpus of Twitter data reveal multiple insights
regarding demographic sentiment towards face masks that agree with existing
surveys. Furthermore, we find two key policy-shift events contributed to
statistically significant changes in sentiment for both Republicans and

  Modules","19 pages",,,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the structure of indecomposable $n$-dimensional persistence
modules is a difficult problem, yet is foundational for studying
multipersistence. To this end, Buchet and Escolar showed that any finitely
presented rectangular $(n-1)$-dimensional persistence module with finite
support is a hyperplane restriction of an $n$-dimensional persistence module.
We extend this result to the following: If $M$ is any finitely presented
$(n-1)$-dimensional persistence module with finite support, then there exists
an indecomposable $n$-dimensional persistence module $M'$ such that $M$ is the
restriction of $M'$ to a hyperplane. We also show that any finite zigzag
persistence module is the restriction of some indecomposable $3$-dimensional
persistence module to a path.

this work, we analyze solar activity in days of the 19th century when NESO were

largest groups observed in days when NESO were reported, we show the
uncorrected areas of these groups were below 200 millionths of solar disc (msd

recent works that, using the same NESO set, suggest the solar activity level

significant attention to estimate the depth and visual odometry (VO) from

challenging environments due to perceptual degradation, occlusions and rapid
motions. Moreover, the existing unsupervised methods suffer from the lack of
scale-consistency constraints across frames, which causes that the VO
estimators fail to provide persistent trajectories over long sequences. In this
study, we propose an unsupervised monocular deep VO framework that predicts
six-degrees-of-freedom pose camera motion and depth map of the scene from
unlabelled RGB image sequences. We provide detailed quantitative and
qualitative evaluations of the proposed framework on a) a challenging dataset
collected during the DARPA Subterranean challenge; and b) the benchmark KITTI

fixed design linear regression with Gaussian noise and a Gaussian task (or
parameter) distribution, we give distribution-dependent lower bounds on the
transfer risk of any algorithm, while we also show that a novel, weighted

that it is rich enough to unify the ""parameter sharing"" and ""representation

obtained as the special case when the covariance matrix of the task

is shown to enjoy efficient updates in our case. The paper is completed by an
empirical study of EM. In particular, our experimental results show that the EM

observations. Herschel/PACS and SPIRE observations of ESO 320-G030 show
absorption/emission in 18 lines of H2O, which we combine with the ALMA H2O
423-330 448 GHz line (Eupper~400 K) and continuum images to study the nuclear
region. Radiative transfer models indicate that 3 nuclear components are
required to account for the H2O and continuum data. An envelope, with R~130-150
pc, T_dust~50 K, and N_H2~2x10^{23} cm^{-2}, surrounds a nuclear disk with R~40
pc and tau_100um~1.5-3 (N_H2~2x10^{24} cm^{-2}) and an extremely compact (R~12
pc), warm (~100 K), and buried (tau_100um>5, N_H2>~5x10^{24} cm^{-2}) core

(SFR~16-18 Msun yr^{-1}). The nucleus is fed by a molecular inflow observed in
CO 2-1 with ALMA, which is associated with the nuclear bar. With decreasing
radius (r=450-225 pc), the mass inflow rate increases up to ~20 Msun yr^{-1},
which is similar to the nuclear SFR, indicating that the starburst is sustained
by the inflow. At lower r, the inflow is best probed by the far-infrared OH
ground-state doublets, with an estimated inflow rate of ~30 Msun yr^{-1}. The
short timescale of ~20 Myr for nuclear gas replenishment indicates quick
secular evolution, and indicates that we are witnessing an intermediate stage
(<100 Myr) proto-pseudobulge fed by a massive inflow that is driven by a strong
nuclear bar. We also apply the H2O model to the Herschel far-infrared
spectroscopic observations of H2^{18}O, OH, $^{18}OH, OH+, H2O^+, H3O^+, NH,

the electron spin. This provides an additional tool to manipulate the spin

camera intrinsic parameters into the model. Experiments show that a single
model, TartanVO, trained only on synthetic data, without any finetuning, can be
generalized to real-world datasets such as KITTI and EuRoC, demonstrating
significant advantages over the geometry-based methods on challenging

  Poststratification",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is a popular method for
addressing selection bias in subgroup estimation, with broad applications
across fields from social sciences to public health. In this paper, we examine
the inferential validity of MRP in finite populations, exploring the impact of
poststratification and model specification. The success of MRP relies heavily
on the availability of auxiliary information that is strongly related to the
outcome. To enhance the fitting performance of the outcome model, we recommend
modeling the inclusion probabilities conditionally on auxiliary variables and
incorporating flexible functions of estimated inclusion probabilities as
predictors in the mean structure. We present a statistical data integration
framework that offers robust inferences for probability and nonprobability
surveys, addressing various challenges in practical applications. Our
simulation studies indicate the statistical validity of MRP, which involves a
tradeoff between bias and variance, with greater benefits for subgroup
estimates with small sample sizes, compared to alternative methods. We have
applied our methods to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study,
which collected information on children across 21 geographic locations in the
U.S. to provide national representation, but is subject to selection bias as a
nonprobability sample. We focus on the cognition measure of diverse groups of
children in the ABCD study and show that the use of auxiliary variables affects
the findings on cognitive performance.

than 1.1 Ga to the estimates of the number of craters that could have been

elements during that time were close to the corresponding current values. The
comparison was performed for craters over the entire lunar surface and in the
region of the Oceanus Procellarum and maria on the near side of the Moon. In
these estimates, we used the values of collision probabilities of near-Earth
objects with the Moon and the dependences of the crater diameters on the
impactor sizes. According to the estimates made by different authors, the
number density of known Copernican craters with diameters D>15 km in mare
regions is at least double the corresponding number for the remaining lunar
surface. Our estimates do not contradict the growth in the number of near-Earth
objects after probable catastrophic fragmentations of large main-belt
asteroids, which may have occurred over the recent 300 Ma; however, they do not
prove this increase. Particularly, they do not conflict with the inference made
by Mazrouei et al. (2019) that 290 Ma ago the frequency of collisions of
near-Earth asteroids with the Moon increased by 2.6 times. For a probability of
a collision of an Earth-crossing object (ECO) with the Earth in a year equaled
to 10^-8, our estimates of the number of craters agree with the model,
according to which the number densities of the 15-km Copernican craters for the
whole lunar surface would have been the same as that for mare regions if the
data by Losiak et al. (2015) for D<30 km were as complete as those for D>30 km.
With this collision probability of ECOs with the Earth and for this model, the
cratering rate may have been constant over the recent 1.1 Ga.

are arguably the most employed discretization in quantum chemistry simulations,
both on quantum and classical devices. To circumvent a potentially dense
two-body interaction tensor and obtain lower asymptotic costs for quantum
simulations of chemistry, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) procedure using a
rectangular partitioning strategy was recently piloted [McClean et al, New J.
Phys. 22, 093015, 2020]. The DG approach interpolates in a controllable way
between a compact description of the two-body interaction tensor through
molecular orbitals and a diagonal characterization through primitive basis
sets, such as a planewave dual basis set. The DG procedure gives rise to a
block-diagonal representation of the two-body interaction with reduced number
of two-electron repulsion integrals, which in turn reduces the cost of quantum
simulations. In the present work we extend this approach to be applicable to
molecular and crystalline systems of arbitrary geometry. We take advantage of
the flexibility of the planewave dual basis set, and combine the discontinuous
Galerkin procedure with a general partitioning strategy based on the Voronoi
decomposition. We numerically investigate the performance, at the mean-field
and correlated levels, with quasi-1D, 2D and 3D partitions using hydrogen
chains, H$_4$, CH$_4$ as examples, respectively. We also apply the method to
graphene as a prototypical example of crystalline systems.

preventing deep neural networks from the danger of overfitting. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning regularization method named as DL-Reg, which
carefully reduces the nonlinearity of deep networks to a certain extent by
explicitly enforcing the network to behave as much linear as possible. The key
idea is to add a linear constraint to the objective function of the deep neural
networks, which is simply the error of a linear mapping from the inputs to the
outputs of the model. More precisely, the proposed DL-Reg carefully forces the
network to behave in a linear manner. This linear constraint, which is further
adjusted by a regularization factor, prevents the network from the risk of
overfitting. The performance of DL-Reg is evaluated by training
state-of-the-art deep network models on several benchmark datasets. The
experimental results show that the proposed regularization method: 1) gives
major improvements over the existing regularization techniques, and 2)
significantly improves the performance of deep neural networks, especially in
the case of small-sized training datasets.

observe a field-induced red-shift of the spectral photocurrent peak associated

the photocurrent contributions of self-trapped excitons (STXs) and self-trapped

dynamics of infectious diseases. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)
model is known to have an exact semi-analytical solution. In the current study,
the approach of Harko et al. (2014) is generalised to obtain an approximate
semi-analytical solution of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR)
model. The SEIR model curves have nearly the same shapes as the SIR ones, but
with a stretch factor applied to them across time that is related to the ratio
of the incubation to infectious periods. This finding implies an approximate
characteristic timescale, scaled by this stretch factor, that is universal to
all SEIR models, which only depends on the basic reproduction number and
initial fraction of the population that is infectious.

labels are corrupted with random noise, and where the error rates of corruption
depend both on the label class and on the membership function for a protected
subgroup. Heterogeneous label noise models systematic biases towards particular
groups when generating annotations. We begin by presenting analytical results
which show that naively imposing parity constraints on demographic disparity
measures, without accounting for heterogeneous and group-dependent error rates,
can decrease both the accuracy and the fairness of the resulting classifier.
Our experiments demonstrate these issues arise in practice as well. We address
these problems by performing empirical risk minimization with carefully defined
surrogate loss functions and surrogate constraints that help avoid the pitfalls
introduced by heterogeneous label noise. We provide both theoretical and
empirical justifications for the efficacy of our methods. We view our results
as an important example of how imposing fairness on biased data sets without
proper care can do at least as much harm as it does good.

monitoring sequential predictions generated from Bayesian Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) that can capture the inherent uncertainty in CPS, drawing on
insights from our study of real-world CPS datasets. We propose a new logic
named \emph{Signal Temporal Logic with Uncertainty} (STL-U) to monitor a

Bayesian RNNs. We define STL-U strong and weak satisfaction semantics based on

also develop methods to compute the range of confidence levels under which a
flowpipe is guaranteed to strongly (weakly) satisfy an STL-U formula.
Furthermore, we develop novel criteria that leverage STL-U monitoring results
to calibrate the uncertainty estimation in Bayesian RNNs. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed approach via experiments with real-world datasets and a simulated
smart city case study, which show very encouraging results of STL-U based

concern from clinicians is not whether the model is accurate, but whether the
model can express to a human operator when it does not know if its answer is
correct. We propose to use Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO) and the bootstrap
aggregation (bagging) technique on deep learning models to produce uncertainty
estimations for radiation therapy dose prediction. We show that both models are
capable of generating a reasonable uncertainty map, and, with our proposed
scaling technique, creating interpretable uncertainties and bounds on the
prediction and any relevant metrics. Performance-wise, bagging provides
statistically significant reduced loss value and errors in most of the metrics
investigated in this study. The addition of bagging was able to further reduce
errors by another 0.34% for Dmean and 0.19% for Dmax, on average, when compared
to the baseline framework. Overall, the bagging framework provided
significantly lower MAE of 2.62, as opposed to the baseline framework's MAE of
2.87. The usefulness of bagging, from solely a performance standpoint, does
highly depend on the problem and the acceptable predictive error, and its high
upfront computational cost during training should be factored in to deciding
whether it is advantageous to use it. In terms of deployment with uncertainty
estimations turned on, both frameworks offer the same performance time of about
12 seconds. As an ensemble-based metaheuristic, bagging can be used with
existing machine learning architectures to improve stability and performance,
and MCDO can be applied to any deep learning models that have dropout as part

interests nowadays with the popularization of smartphones. With the high
sampling rates of smartphone sensors, it is a highly long-range temporal
recognition problem, especially with the large intra-class distances such as
the smartphones carried at different locations such as in the bag or on the

address this problem, we propose a new framework of combining short-term
spatial/frequency feature extraction and a long-term Independently Recurrent

characteristics of the sensor data, short-term temporal features are first
extracted in the spatial and frequency domains. Then the IndRNN, which is able

To mitigate this requirement, it has been proposed to learn parameters for

Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning from Reinforcement, which allows existing
navigation systems to adapt to new scenarios by using a parameter selection
scheme discovered via reinforcement learning (RL) in a wide variety of

mini-pooling (MP) (Dorfman, 1943), mini-pooling with deconvolution algorithm
(MPA) (May et al., 2010), and marker-assisted MPA (mMPA) (Liu et al., 2017).
MPA and mMPA test individuals in a sequence after a positive pool and implement
a deconvolution algorithm to determine when testing can cease to ascertain all
individual statuses. mMPA uses information from other available markers to
determine an optimal order for individual testings. We derive and compare the

paper investigates the effectiveness of PAH emission as a SFR indicator on

nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M51. We present a new approach of analyzing
the spatial elements of the spectral datacube that simultaneously maximizes
spatial resolution and spatial coverage, while yielding reliable measurements
of the total, integrated $5-20\,\mu$m PAH emission. We devise a strategy of
extracting robust PAH emission using spectra with only partial spectral
coverage, complementing missing spectral regions with properly combined
mid-infrared photometry. We find that in M51 the PAH emission correlates
tightly with the extinction-corrected far-ultraviolet, near-ultraviolet, and
H$\alpha$ emission, from scales$\sim 0.4$ kpc close to the nucleus to 6 kpc out
in the disk of the galaxy, indicating that PAH serves as an excellent tracer of
SFR over a wide range of galactic environments. But regional differences exist.
Close to the active nucleus of M51 the 6.2 $\mu$m feature is weaker, and the
overall level of PAH emission is suppressed. The spiral arms and the central
star-forming region of the galaxy emit stronger 7.7 and 8.6 $\mu$m PAH features

topological states of quantum matter, which sheds new lights on solving
long-standing scientific challenges. However, the exotic quantum phenomena are
typically observable only in rare material systems under extreme experimental
conditions. The search of suitable candidate materials that are able to work at
ambient conditions is thus of crucial importance to both fundamental research
and practical applications. Here we review our recent efforts on
first-principles exploration of novel quantum physics and materials, focusing
on emergent quantum phenomena induced by spin-orbit coupling and its interplay
with magnetism, topology and superconductivity. The first-principles material
design guided by fundamental theory enables the discoveries of several key
quantum materials, including next-generation magnetic topological insulators,
high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, and
unconventional superconductors. A close collaboration with experiment not only
successfully confirmed most of our theoretical predictions, but also led to
surprising findings for further investigations, which greatly promotes
development of the research field.

on the selected strategy, a set of time-varying hyperplanes in the AV's

strategy-dependent constraints drive the vehicle towards areas where it is
likely to remain feasible. Moreover, the predicted strategy also informs
switching between a discrete set of policies, which allows for more
conservative behavior when prediction confidence is low. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed data-driven hierarchical control framework in a

1/10 scale autonomous car platform where the strategy-guided approach

virus, by predicting the number of confirmed cases. But the proposed system
focuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point
of view, by predicting the areas or regions that may become hotspots for the
virus in the near future. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by
being in close proximity to an already infected person, suggests that, the
regions that can easily be reached from an existing hotspot, have a higher
chance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover, in smaller regions, even after
strict provisions, positive cases have been found. To consider this fact, the
geographic distance between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of
likelihood of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted
graph of regions with the regions themselves as weighted nodes with weight of
the nodes as the number of active cases and the distance as edge weights. The
graph can be completely connected or connected based on a distance threshold.
The nodes are the administrative, and the distance measure tells the possible
transmission between separate communities. Using this data, the potential
regions that can become hotspots can be predicted, and preventive measures can
be devised.

propose a novel real-time model extraction status assessment scheme called
Monitor to evaluate the situation of the model. Then, we design a method to
guide the differential privacy budget allocation called APBA adaptively.
Finally, all DP-based defenses with MDP could dynamically adjust the amount of
noise added in the model response according to the result from Monitor and
effectively defends the QPD attack. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and
compare the QPD attack and MDP defense performance on real-world models with DP

downstream peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13-20% while upstream peaks

evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a
stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to
changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects,
at more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video

which comprise of behaviors that happen after the last behavior of the

diverse trends extractor and the time-aware mechanism to represent the possible
trends of preferences for a given user with multiple vectors. We leverage both
the representations of historical preference and possible future trends to

software systems. Many techniques have been proposed to infer behavioral models
of software systems from their interaction traces. The quality of the inferred
model is critical to its successful use. While generalization is necessary to
deduce concise behavioral models, existing techniques of inferring models, in
general, overgeneralize what behavior is valid. Imprecise models include many
spurious behaviors, and thus compromise the effectiveness of their use. In this
paper, we propose a novel technique that increases the accuracy of the
behavioral model inferred from interaction traces. The essence of our approach
is a heuristic-based generalization and truthful minimization. The set of
heuristics include patterns to match input traces and generalize them towards
concise model representations. Furthermore, we adopt a truthful minimization
technique to merge these generalized traces. The key insight of our approach is
to infer a concise behavioral model without compromising its accuracy. We
present an empirical evaluation of how our approach improves upon the
state-of-the-art specification inference techniques. The results show that our
approach mines model with 100% precision and recall with a limited computation
overhead.

approximation over a general region, named Lasso hyperinterpolation. This
approximation is an $\ell_1$-regularized discrete least squares approximation

uses a high-order quadrature rule to approximate the Fourier coefficients of a
given continuous function with respect to some orthonormal basis, and then it
obtains its coefficients by acting a soft threshold operator on all
approximated Fourier coefficients. Lasso hyperinterpolation is not a discrete
orthogonal projection, but it is an efficient tool to deal with noisy data. We
theoretically analyze Lasso hyperinterpolation for continuous and smooth
functions. The principal results are twofold: the norm of the Lasso
hyperinterpolation operator is bounded independently of the polynomial degree,
which is inherited from hyperinterpolation; and the $L_2$ error bound of Lasso
hyperinterpolation is less than that of hyperinterpolation when the level of
noise becomes large, which improves the robustness of hyperinterpolation.
Explicit constructions and corresponding numerical examples of Lasso
hyperinterpolation over intervals, discs, spheres, and cubes are given.

algorithm which leverages dense correspondence and sparse depth for planar
moving robot is proposed. The key component is a minimal solution which
computes the absolute camera pose with one 3D-2D correspondence and one 2D-2D
correspondence. The advantages are obvious in two aspects. First, the
robustness is enhanced as the sample set for pose estimation is maximal by
utilizing all correspondences with or without depth. Second, no extra effort
for dense map construction is required to exploit dense correspondences for
handling textureless and repetitive texture scenes. That is meaningful as
building a dense map is computational expensive especially in large scale.
Moreover, a probabilistic analysis among different solutions is presented and
an automatic solution selection mechanism is designed to maximize the success
rate by selecting appropriate solutions in different environmental
characteristics. Finally, a complete visual localization pipeline considering

preventing phase-change memory (PCM) from general commercialization, and
therefore several studies have been proposed to mitigate WDEs.
Verify-and-correction (VnC) eliminates WDEs by always verifying the data
correctness on neighbors after programming, but incurs significant performance
overhead. Encoding-based schemes mitigate WDEs by reducing the number of
WDE-vulnerable data patterns; however, mitigation performance notably
fluctuates with applications. Moreover, encoding-based schemes still rely on
VnC-based schemes. Cache-based schemes lower WDEs by storing data in a write
cache, but it requires several megabytes of SRAM to significantly mitigate
WDEs. Despite the efforts of previous studies, these methods incur either
significant performance or area overhead. Therefore, a new approach, which does
not rely on VnC-based schemes or application data patterns, is highly
necessary. Furthermore, the new approach should be transparent to processors
(i.e., in-module), because the characteristic of WDEs is determined by
manufacturers of PCM products. In this paper, we present an in-module
disturbance barrier (IMDB) that mitigates WDEs on demand. IMDB includes a
two-level hierarchy comprising two SRAM-based tables, whose entries are managed
with a dedicated replacement policy that sufficiently utilizes the
characteristics of WDEs. The naive implementation of the replacement policy
requires hundreds of read ports on SRAM, which is infeasible in real hardware;
hence, an approximate comparator is also designed. We also conduct a rigorous
exploration of architecture parameters to obtain a cost-effective design. The
proposed method significantly reduces WDEs without noticeable speed degradation
or additional energy consumption compared to previous methods.

time. We also show that modeling such topic coherence and temporal interaction
are critical to capture the repetitive characteristics of bullying behavior,
thus leading to better predicting performance. To achieve the goal, we first
construct a unified temporal graph for each social media session. Drawing on
recent advances in graph neural network, we then propose a principled
graph-based approach for modeling the temporal dynamics and topic coherence

images between passive storage and active memory when needed. The inference
process takes into account both promising images and a coarse representations
of the full database. We show that this allows constant time and space
inference for a fixed coverage area. The coarse representations can also be
updated incrementally to absorb new data. To further reduce the memory

system's transverse size is proportional to the 1/3 power of the multiplicity,
and the saturation momentum and the transverse size of the system are strongly
correlated with the hadron multiplicity in the final state. Since the
saturation momentum is proportional to the average transverse momentum of

1/6 power of the multiplicity, which is consistent with experimental results at
the LHC energy. We found that a nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$

To represent the dynamics on different scales the model combines the
description of soil as a continuous solid, as distinct particles and as rigid
multibodies. The models are dynamically coupled to each other and to the
earthmoving equipment. Agitated soil is represented by a hybrid of contacting
particles and continuum solid, with the moving equipment and resting soil as
geometric boundaries. Each zone of active soil is aggregated into distinct
bodies, with the proper mass, momentum and frictional-cohesive properties,
which constrain the equipment's multibody dynamics. The particle model
parameters are pre-calibrated to the bulk mechanical parameters for a wide
range of different soils. The result is a computationally efficient model for
earthmoving operations that resolve the motion of the soil, using a fast
iterative solver, and provide realistic forces and dynamic for the equipment,
using a direct solver for high numerical precision. Numerical simulations of
excavation and bulldozing operations are performed to validate the model and
measure the computational performance. Reference data is produced using coupled
discrete element and multibody dynamics simulations at relatively high

multiscale model agree with the reference model up to 10-25%, and run more than
three orders of magnitude faster.

computation efficiency in achieving motion planning tasks under general

possibility for incorporation of fast, efficient, and effective optimization
methods to further speed up the optimization process such that the requirements

promising approach to achieve effective outcomes, e.g., in decision-making
tasks for multi-agent systems. However, the typical deployment of such
distributed MPC frameworks would lead to the involvement of nonlinear processes
with a large number of nonconvex constraints. To address this important
problem, the development and innovation of a hierarchical three-block
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is presented in
this work to solve this nonconvex cooperative DMPC problem in multi-agent
systems. Here firstly, an additional slack variable is introduced to transform
the original large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. Then, a hierarchical
ADMM approach, which contains outer loop iteration by the augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM) and inner loop iteration by three-block semi-proximal ADMM, is
utilized to solve the resulting transformed nonconvex optimization problem.
Additionally, it is analytically shown and established that the requisite
desired stationary point exists for convergence in the algorithm. Finally, an
approximate optimization stage with a barrier method is then applied to further
significantly improve the computational efficiency, yielding the final improved
hierarchical ADMM. The effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of

is based on the assumption that the host star is far enough to be considered a

system planets and most exoplanets, must be revised for close-in exoplanets.
The objective of this work is to derive accurate instellation patterns for
close-in exoplanets, for which the effects of the spherical shape of the star
must be taken into account. First an analytical formula of the insolation as a
function of latitude was derived, taking the star and the planet as 3-D bodies,
and incorporating the limb darkening effects of the star. Then numerical
techniques were used to compute the distribution of the insolation on close-in
planets as a function of latitude for a wide range of stellar and planetary
properties.There are significant deviations in instellation values and their
distribution on close-in exoplanets, due in similar proportions to the physical
size of the star and stellar limb-darkening effects. The insolation at the
susbtellar point is always higher -- by as much as 21% for known exoplanets --
than the standard calculation. The substellar longitude of the terminator can
significantly extend on the nightside, from 90 degrees up to 110 degrees for

design a deep neural network architecture that explicitly wires lower and

of synthetic spin-orbit coupling were realized in Bose-Einstein condensates of
ultracold neutral atoms [J.-R. Li et al., Nature \textbf{543}, 91 (2017)]. The
achievement opens avenues to explore the interplay of superfluidity and
crystalline order in the search for supersolid features and materials. The
system considered is essentially made of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein
condensates, that is a pseudo-spin-$1/2$ system, subject to a spin-dependent
gauge field $\sigma_z \hbar k_\ell$. Under these conditions the stripe phase is
achieved when the linear coupling $\hbar\Omega/2$ is small against the gauge
energy $m\Omega/\hbar k_\ell^2<1$ . The resulting density stripes have been
interpreted as a standing-wave, interference pattern with approximate
wavenumber $2k_\ell$. Here, we show that the emergence of the stripe phase is
induced by an array of Josephson vortices living in the junction defined by the
linear coupling. As happens in superconducting junctions subject to external
magnetic fields, a vortex array is the natural response of the superfluid
system to the presence of a gauge field. Also similar to superconductors, the
Josephson currents and their associated vortices can be present as a metastable
state in the absence of gauge field. We provide closed-form solutions to the 1D
mean field equations that account for such vortex arrays. The underlying
Josephson currents coincide with the analytical solutions to the sine-Gordon
equation for the relative phase of superconducting junctions [C. Owen and D.

quality of a response in open-domain dialogue. Generally, the overall quality
is comprised of various aspects, such as relevancy, specificity, and empathy,
and the importance of each aspect differs according to the task. For instance,
specificity is mandatory in a food-ordering dialogue task, whereas fluency is
preferred in a language-teaching dialogue system. However, existing metrics are
not designed to cope with such flexibility. For example, BLEU score
fundamentally relies only on word overlapping, whereas BERTScore relies on
semantic similarity between reference and candidate response. Thus, they are
not guaranteed to capture the required aspects, i.e., specificity. To design a
metric that is flexible to a task, we first propose making these qualities
manageable by grouping them into three groups: understandability, sensibleness,
and likability, where likability is a combination of qualities that are
essential for a task. We also propose a simple method to composite metrics of
each aspect to obtain a single metric called USL-H, which stands for
Understandability, Sensibleness, and Likability in Hierarchy. We demonstrated
that USL-H score achieves good correlations with human judgment and maintains

framework for modeling growing elastic tissues. However, in this theory, in the
absence of additional variables, the feedback between growth and mechanical
stress leads to either a collapse or unbounded growth of the tissue, but
usually prohibits reaching a finite asymptotic size ('size control'). In this
article, we modify this classical setting to include an energetic cost
associated with growth, leading to the physical effect of size control. The
present model simultaneously provides a qualitatively correct residual stress
profile and has a naturally emerging necrotic core, all of which have

an appealing option for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems,

derive an analytic probability density function (PDF) of the SINR in terms of
the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind, for WLMMSE MIMO
systems with an arbitrary $N_r$ and $N_t=2, 3$. For a more general case in

an approximate but closed form PDF under some mild conditions, which, as
expected, is more Gaussian-like as $2N_r-N_t$ increases. The so-derived PDFs
are able to provide key insights into the WLMMSE MIMO receiver in terms of the
outage probability, the symbol error rate, and the diversity gain, all
presented in closed form. In particular, its diversity gain and the gain
improvement over the conventional LMMSE one are explicitly quantified as
$N_r-(N_t-1)/2$ and $(N_t-1)/2$, respectively. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations

performing molecular dynamics simulations. And the analytical model
(cross-interface model, CIM) is utilized to analyze and explain the
two-dimensional thermal transport mechanism at cross-interface. An order of
magnitude reduction in interfacial thermal resistance is found as the graphene
nanoribbons are bonded by just one carbon chain. Interestingly, the decreasing
rate of interfacial thermal resistance slows down gradually with the increasing
of the number of carbon chains, which can be explained by the proposed
theoretical relationship based on CIM. Moreover, by the comparison of CIM and

auctions by considering settings with correlated values; we do this via the
fundamental economic model of interdependent values (IDV). It is well-known
that in multi-item settings with private values, correlated values can lead to
bad PoA, which can be polynomially large in the number of agents $n$. In the
more general model of IDV, we show that the PoA can be polynomially large even
in single-item settings. On the positive side, we identify a natural condition
on information dispersion in the market, termed $\gamma$-heterogeneity, which
enables good PoA guarantees. Under this condition, we show that for single-item
settings, the PoA of standard mechanisms degrades gracefully with $\gamma$. For
settings with $m>1$ items we show a separation between two domains: If $n \geq
m$, we devise a new simultaneous item auction with good PoA (with respect to
$\gamma$), under limited information asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first positive PoA result for correlated values in multi-item
settings. The main technical difficulty in establishing this result is that the
standard tool for establishing PoA results -- the smoothness framework -- is
unsuitable for IDV settings, and so we must introduce new techniques to address
the unique challenges imposed by such settings. In the domain of $n \ll m$, we
establish impossibility results even for surprisingly simple scenarios.

ideas in terms of both subjective and objective collapse models is also
discussed. It is shown that energy is conserved under subjective collapse
schemes whereas, in general, under objective collapse it is not. This is
consistent with the fact that the latter is inherently non-unitary and that
energy conservation arises out of time symmetry in the first place.

fundamentally tied to the amount of acoustic crosstalk at each control point as
a result of the focusing operation inherent to the pseudoinverse. The
maximisation of the crosstalk at just one point leads to linear dependence in
the system. On the other hand, its minimisation leads to the ideal focusing

fractional cascading. This is an important data structure technique to speed up
repeated searches for the same key in multiple lists and it has numerous
applications. Specifically, the input is a ""catalog"" graph, $G$, of constant
degree together with a list of values assigned to every vertex of $G$. The goal
is to preprocess the input such that given a connected subgraph $H$ of $G$ and
a single query value $q$, one can find the predecessor of $q$ in every list
that belongs to $\scat$. The classical result by Chazelle and Guibas shows that
in a pointer machine, this can be done in the optimal time of $\O(\log n +
|\scat|)$ where $n$ is the total number of values. However, if insertion and
deletion of values are allowed, then the query time slows down to $\O(\log n +
|\scat| \log\log n)$. If only insertions (or deletions) are allowed, then once
again, an optimal query time can be obtained but by using amortization at
update time.
  We prove a lower bound of $\Omega( \log n \sqrt{\log\log n})$ on the
worst-case query time of dynamic fractional cascading, when queries are paths
of length $O(\log n)$. The lower bound applies both to fully dynamic data
structures with amortized polylogarithmic update time and incremental data
structures with polylogarithmic worst-case update time. As a side, this also
roves that amortization is crucial for obtaining an optimal incremental data
structure.
  This is the first non-trivial pointer machine lower bound for a dynamic data
structure that breaks the $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier. In order to obtain this
result, we develop a number of new ideas and techniques that hopefully can be
useful to obtain additional dynamic lower bounds in the pointer machine model.

performance degradation compared to its counterpart. However, an appropriate
beam selection is a challenge since it requires efficient channel estimation
via an extensive beam training process for perfect beam alignment. In this
paper, we propose a high mobility beam and channel tracking algorithm based on
the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to address this challenge, where the channel
changes can be monitored over a certain time. The proposed algorithm tracks the
channel changes after establishing a connection with an appropriate beam. The
algorithm is first introduced in a multi-user beamspace multiple-input

joint-tracking at the base station side in the uplink transmission. The
analysis indicates that under different channel variation conditions, the
proposed algorithm outmatches the popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) in both
single-beam and multi-beam tracking systems. While it is common to individually

domains of human life, science and technology. Polymer informatics is one such
domain where AI and machine learning (ML) tools are being used in the efficient
development, design and discovery of polymers. Surrogate models are trained on
available polymer data for instant property prediction, allowing screening of
promising polymer candidates with specific target property requirements.
Questions regarding synthesizability, and potential (retro)synthesis steps to
create a target polymer, are being explored using statistical means.
Data-driven strategies to tackle unique challenges resulting from the
extraordinary chemical and physical diversity of polymers at small and large
scales are being explored. Other major hurdles for polymer informatics are the
lack of widespread availability of curated and organized data, and approaches
to create machine-readable representations that capture not just the structure
of complex polymeric situations but also synthesis and processing conditions.
Methods to solve inverse problems, wherein polymer recommendations are made
using advanced AI algorithms that meet application targets, are being
investigated. As various parts of the burgeoning polymer informatics ecosystem
mature and become integrated, efficiency improvements, accelerated discoveries
and increased productivity can result. Here, we review emergent components of
this polymer informatics ecosystem and discuss imminent challenges and
opportunities.

a major challenge for autonomous driving. Optimisation-based motion planners
are capable of producing safe, smooth and comfortable plans, but often at the
cost of runtime efficiency. On the other hand, naively deploying trajectories
produced by efficient-to-run deep imitation learning approaches might risk
compromising safety. In this paper, we present PILOT -- a planning framework
that comprises an imitation neural network followed by an efficient optimiser
that actively rectifies the network's plan, guaranteeing fulfilment of safety
and comfort requirements. The objective of the efficient optimiser is the same
as the objective of an expensive-to-run optimisation-based planning system that
the neural network is trained offline to imitate. This efficient optimiser
provides a key layer of online protection from learning failures or deficiency
in out-of-distribution situations that might compromise safety or comfort.
Using a state-of-the-art, runtime-intensive optimisation-based method as the
expert, we demonstrate in simulated autonomous driving experiments in CARLA
that PILOT achieves a seven-fold reduction in runtime when compared to the
expert it imitates without sacrificing planning quality.

the ER graph was randomly generated, by feeding it to a non-marked GNN, the
label predictions of the graph nodes are random, resulting in a low false alarm

performance of a marked GNN on its original task will not be impaired.
Moreover, it is robust against model compression and fine-tuning, which has

Generalization is not only reflected in the actions of the agent, but also in

interpret it as consistent with one's own belief. When agents pay enough
attention to themselves, confirmation bias leads to slower learning in any
symmetric network, and it increases polarization in society. We identify a
subset of agents that become more/less influential with confirmation bias. The
socially optimal network structure depends critically on the information
available to the social planner. When she cannot observe agents' beliefs, the

based applications such as spin filters. The valence band (VB) and conduction
band (CB) in BMS approach the Fermi level through opposite spin channels, and
hence facilitate to achieve reversible spin polarization which are controllable
via applied gate voltage. We report the quaternary Heusler alloy VNbRuAl to
exactly possess the band structure of BMS. The alloy is found to crystallize in
LiMgPdSn prototype structure (space group $F\bar{4}3m$) with B$2$ disorder and
lattice parameter 6.15 \AA . The resistivity and Hall measurements show a two
channel semiconducting behavior and a quasi linear dependence of negative
magneto resistance (MR) indicating the possible semiconducting nature.
Interestingly, VNbRuAl also shows a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF)
behavior with vanishing net magnetization (m$_s$$\sim$ $10^{-3}$ $\mu_B/f.u.$)
and significantly high ordering temperature ($> 900$ K). Unlike conventional
FCF, vanishing moment in this case appears to be the result of a combination of

Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). The PMC provides a systematic method
which rigorously eliminates QCD renormalization scale ambiguities by summing
the nonconformal $\beta$ contributions into the QCD coupling constant. The PMC
predictions satisfy the requirements of renormalization group invariance,
including renormalization scheme independence, and the PMC scales accurately
reflect the virtuality of the underlying production subprocesses. By using the
PMC, an improved prediction for the $t\bar{t}$ production cross-section is
obtained without scale ambiguities, which in turn provides a precise value for
the top-quark pole mass. Moreover, the predictive power of PMC calculations
that the magnitude of higher-order PMC predictions are well within the error

This is due to the long-term memory in the response of such materials to

network of a purified protein, actin, was found to conform to the continuous
time random walk (CTRW) type in one study that focused on the ensemble average
characteristics. Here, we analyze the dynamics of two differently sized tracer
particles in actin networks of different mesh sizes. We find that the ratio of
tracer particle size to the characteristic length scale of a bio-polymer
network plays a crucial role in determining the type of diffusion the particle
performs. We find that the tracer particle diffusion has features of fBm when
the particle is large compared to the mesh size, of normal diffusion when the
particle is much smaller than the mesh size, and of CTRW in between these two
limits. Based on our findings, we propose and verify numerically a new model
for the tracer particle's motion in all regimes. Our model suggests that
diffusion in actin networks consists of fBm of the tracer particle coupled with
occasional caging events with power-law-distributed escape times.

discovered that the model produces much higher reconstruction loss with the

be utilized to recognize an intrusion to the UAV. With consideration of the

extensively studied in the literature. It models set functions that exhibit a
diminishing returns property, where the marginal value of adding an element to
a set decreases as the set expands. This notion has been generalized to
considering sequence functions, where the order of adding elements plays a
crucial role and determines the function value; the generalized notion is
called sequence (or string) submodularity. In this paper, we study a new
problem of robust sequence submodular maximization with cardinality
constraints. The robustness is against the removal of a subset of elements in
the selected sequence (e.g., due to malfunctions or adversarial attacks).
Compared to robust submodular maximization for set function, new challenges
arise when sequence functions are concerned. Specifically, there are multiple
definitions of submodularity for sequence functions, which exhibit subtle yet
critical differences. Another challenge comes from two directions of
monotonicity: forward monotonicity and backward monotonicity, both of which are
important to proving performance guarantees. To address these unique
challenges, we design two robust greedy algorithms: while one algorithm
achieves a constant approximation ratio but is robust only against the removal
of a subset of contiguous elements, the other is robust against the removal of
an arbitrary subset of the selected elements but requires a stronger assumption

existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy

first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship
between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated
backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable

a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for
all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the

scenario is currently identified, where conventional supply-side is gradually
replaced by renewable sources decoupled from the grid by electronic converters

of such renewable generation units, the conventional grid inertia is
decreasing, subsequently affecting both reliability analysis and grid
stability. As a result, concepts such as 'synthetic inertia', 'hidden inertia'
or 'virtual inertia', together with alternative spinning reserves, are
currently under discussion to ensure power system stability and reliability.
Under this new framework, an algorithm to estimate the minimum inertia needed
to fulfil the ENTSO-E requirements for ROCOF values is proposed and assessed
under a relevant variety of imbalanced conditions. The additional active power
needed to be within the frequency dynamic range is also estimated and
determined. Both inertia and additional active power can come from different

thermal, hydro-power plants, and renewable generation units, in line with most

the power imbalance, and the inertia constant of conventional power plants. In

seamlessly integrated in the simulation algorithm. We employ a special neural

fields of the coupled multiphysics system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
DeepONet by predicting five species in the non-equilibrium chemistry downstream

yield good accuracy for unseen Mach numbers within the range of training.
Outside this range, DeepONet can still predict accurately and fast if a few
