ferromagnetic (FM) quantum criticality in an itinerant magnet. By combining
thermodynamic, transport, x-ray and neutron scattering as well as $\mu$SR
measurements, we refined the temperature-pressure phase diagram of LaCrGe$_3$.
We provide thermodynamic evidence (i) for the first-order character of the FM
transition when it is suppressed to low temperatures and (ii) for the formation
of new phases at high pressures. From our microscopic data, we infer that
short-range FM ordered clusters exist in these high-pressure phases. These
results suggest that LaCrGe$_3$ is a rare example, which fills the gap between
the two extreme limits of avoided FM quantum criticality in clean and strongly

self-consistent evolution of the halo current and the origin of the wall
forces. In contrast to other reduced MHD models based on an ordering in the
aspect ratio, the ansatz based JOREK reduced MHD model allows capturing the 3D
dynamics even in the spherical tokamak limit considered here.

use a hybrid approach, generating Brownian paths only in a small region where
the spatial organization is relevant and avoiding it in the remainder of the

the context of cell sensing and guidance via external chemical gradients.
Specifically, we highlight the reconstruction of the location of a point source

the 2D or 3D half-space, on a disk in free space, inside a 2D corridor, or a 3D

region of interest. It uses the Neumann-Green's function for the mentioned
geometries to generate exact mappings exit and entry points when the trajectory
leaves the region, thus avoiding the explicit computation of Brownian paths in
an infinite domain. Matched asymptotics is used to compute the probability
fluxes to small windows and we review how such an approach can be used to
reconstruct the location of a point source and estimating the uncertainty in
the source reconstruction due to an additive perturbation present in the

method applicable to both model selection and parameter estimation. ABC
parameter estimation requires the ability to forward simulate datasets from a
candidate model, but because the sizes of the observed and simulated datasets
usually need to match, this can be computationally expensive. Additionally,
since ABC inference is based on comparisons of summary statistics computed on
the observed and simulated data, using computationally expensive summary
statistics can lead to further losses in efficiency. ABC has recently been
applied to the family of mechanistic network models, an area that has
traditionally lacked tools for inference and model choice. Mechanistic models
of network growth repeatedly add nodes to a network until it reaches the size
of the observed network, which may be of the order of millions of nodes. With
ABC, this process can quickly become computationally prohibitive due to the
resource intensive nature of network simulations and evaluation of summary
statistics. We propose two methodological developments to enable the use of ABC
for inference in models for large growing networks. First, to save time needed
for forward simulating model realizations, we propose a procedure to
extrapolate (via both least squares and Gaussian processes) summary statistics
from small to large networks. Second, to reduce computation time for evaluating
summary statistics, we use sample-based rather than census-based summary
statistics. We show that the ABC posterior obtained through this approach,
which adds two additional layers of approximation to the standard ABC, is
similar to a classic ABC posterior. Although we deal with growing network
models, both extrapolated summaries and sampled summaries are expected to be
relevant in other ABC settings where the data are generated incrementally.

Zhang and Gray-Steinberg. It is shown that the right Cayley graph $\Gamma$ of a
special monoid $M$ is a context-free graph, in the sense of Muller & Schupp, if
and only if the group of units of $M$ is virtually free. This generalises the
geometric aspect of the well-known Muller-Schupp Theorem from groups to special
monoids. Furthermore, we completely characterise when the monadic second order
theory of $\Gamma$ is decidable: this is precisely when the group of units is
virtually free. This completely answers for the class of special monoids a
question of Kuske & Lohrey from 2006. As a corollary, we obtain that the
rational subset membership problem for $M$ is decidable when the group of units
of $M$ is virtually free, extending results of Kambites & Render. We also show
that the class of special monoids with virtually free group of units is the
same as the class of special monoids with right Cayley graph quasi-isometric to
a tree as undirected graphs. The above results are proven by developing two
general constructions for graphs which preserve context-freeness, of

impose constraints on the regression parameters after taking their real-world

distribution which is often found in classical literature. With the
aforementioned change, difficulty has dramatically increased as the exact
distribution of the dependent variable becomes analytically intractable. We
then develop likelihood-based approaches to estimate the unknown model

particularly in thermohaline staircases and atmospheric layer transitions.
Non-uniform stratification, however, is often approximated by the average
ambient density change with height. This approximation is frequently made in
numerical simulations because it greatly simplifies the calculations. In this
paper, direct numerical simulations using $4096 \times 2048 \times 2048$ grid
points to resolve an idealised turbulent wake in a non-uniformly stratified
fluid are analysed to understand the consequences of assuming linear
stratification. For flows with the same average change in density with height,
but varied local stratification $d\bar \rho(z)/dz$, flow dynamics are dependent
on the ratio $\xi=\delta_{\cal U}/\delta_{\rho}$, where $\delta_{\cal U}$ and
$\delta_{\rho}$ are characteristic velocity and density vertical scale heights
of the mean flow. Results suggest that a stably stratified flow will
demonstrate characteristics similar to nonstratified flow when $\xi > 2$, even

vacuum state introduces a serious ambiguity in the Fock quantization of fields.
In this review, we study the case of fermions described by a Dirac field in
several cosmological spacetimes, and present recent results about
well-motivated criteria that ensure the uniqueness in the selection of a vacuum
up to unitary transformations. These criteria are based on two requirements.
First, the invariance of the vacuum under the symmetries of the Dirac equations
in the considered spacetime. Second, the unitary implementability of the
Heisenberg dynamics of the annihilation and creation operators when the curved
spacetime is treated as a fixed background. This last requirement not only
permits the uniqueness of the Fock quantization but, remarkably, it also
determines an essentially unique splitting between the phase space variables
assigned to the background and the fermionic annihilation and creation
variables. We first consider Dirac fields in cosmological spacetimes of 2+1
dimensions and then discuss the more relevant case of 3+1 dimensions. We use
this analysis to investigate the hybrid loop quantization of a flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background cosmology coupled to a
perturbative Dirac field. Among the Fock quantizations for the fermionic
perturbations allowed by our criteria, we further restrict the choice of vacuum
by demanding a finite fermionic backreaction and, moreover, by diagonalizing
the fermionic contribution to the total Hamiltonian in the asymptotic limit of
large wave numbers of the Dirac modes. Finally, we argue in support of the
uniquess of the vacuum state selected by the extension of this diagonalization
condition beyond the ultraviolet regime, proving that it picks out the standard
Poincar\'e and Bunch-Davies vacua for fixed flat and de Sitter background
spacetimes, respectively.

have this structure including (but not limited to) sparse and low-rank
optimization problems. By exploiting the underlying geometry of the constraint
set, NExOS finds a locally optimal point by solving a sequence of penalized
problems with strictly decreasing penalty parameters. NExOS solves each
penalized problem by applying a first-order algorithm, which converges linearly
to a local minimum of the corresponding penalized formulation under regularity
conditions. Furthermore, the local minima of the penalized problems converge to
a local minimum of the original problem as the penalty parameter goes to zero.
We implement NExOS in the open-source Julia package NExOS.jl, which has been
extensively tested on many instances from a wide variety of learning problems.

formed at the end of the 6-year period. Next, we shuffle the data creating
again 28 six-year randomized networks, in order to identify whether there is a
hidden mechanism that favors a non-random behavior. Real and shuffled data are
compared using a z-score, a measure of the differences of standard deviations

coefficient, which is the number of triangles over the number of triples
(possible triangles). The results show that triangular FP collaborations tend
to be favored over random ones, while in patents the case is strongly the
opposite. Furthermore, results using triangles tend to be more comprehensive as
opposed to those of the clustering coefficient. Finally, we identify which
NUTS2 regions frequently exhibit a high clustering coefficient in either of the

quantities, offering a tool to understand the interplay between thermal and
quantum effects. Here we set forth a theory for non-Abelian transport in the
linear response regime. Our key insight is to use generalized Gibbs ensembles
with non-commuting charges as the basic building blocks and strict
charge-preserving unitaries in a collisional setup. The linear response
framework is then built using a collisional model between two reservoirs. We
show that the transport coefficients obey Onsager reciprocity. Moreover, we
find that quantum coherence, associated to the non-commutativity, acts so as to
reduce the net entropy production, when compared to the case of commuting
transport. This therefore provides a clear connection between quantum coherent
transport and dissipation. As an example, we study heat and squeezing fluxes in
bosonic systems, characterizing a set of thermosqueezing coefficients with
potential applications in metrology and heat-to-work conversion in the quantum
regime.

A-optimal design. PVS strikes the balance between design nodes that jointly
fill the design space, while marginally staying in regions of high mass under
the solution of a relaxed convex version of the original problem. In this
paper, we examine some of the statistical implications of a new variant of PVS
for (possibly Bayesian) optimal design. Using point process machinery, we treat
the case of a generic Polish design space. We show that not only are the
A-optimality approximation guarantees preserved, but we obtain similar
guarantees for D-optimal design that tighten recent results. Moreover, we show
that PVS can be sampled in polynomial time. Unfortunately, in spite of its
elegance and tractability, we demonstrate on a simple example that the
practical implications of general PVS are likely limited. In the second part of
the paper, we focus on applications and investigate the use of PVS as a
subroutine for stochastic search heuristics. We demonstrate that PVS is a
robust addition to the practitioner's toolbox, especially when the regression
functions are nonstandard and the design space, while low-dimensional, has a
complicated shape (e.g., nonlinear boundaries, several connected components).

DRAM, have been proposed to address the growing memory demand of applications.
Emerging NVM technologies, such as phase-change memories (PCM), memristor, and
3D XPoint, have higher capacity density, minimal static power consumption and
lower cost per GB. However, NVM has longer access latency and limited write
endurance as opposed to DRAM. The different characteristics of two memory
classes point towards the design of hybrid memory systems containing multiple
classes of main memory.
  In the iterative and incremental development of new architectures, the
timeliness of simulation completion is critical to project progression. Hence,
a highly efficient simulation method is needed to evaluate the performance of
different hybrid memory system designs. Design exploration for hybrid memory
systems is challenging, because it requires emulation of the full system stack,
including the OS, memory controller, and interconnect. Moreover, benchmark
applications for memory performance test typically have much larger working
sets, thus taking even longer simulation warm-up period.
  In this paper, we propose a FPGA-based hybrid memory system emulation
platform. We target at the mobile computing system, which is sensitive to
energy consumption and is likely to adopt NVM for its power efficiency. Here,
because the focus of our platform is on the design of the hybrid memory system,
we leverage the on-board hard IP ARM processors to both improve simulation
performance while improving accuracy of the results. Thus, users can implement
their data placement/migration policies with the FPGA logic elements and
evaluate new designs quickly and effectively. Results show that our emulation
platform provides a speedup of 9280x in simulation time compared to the

Distributed design, independent design of all subcontrollers that constitute a

existing distributed design methods confine attention to the decentralized or
distributed information structures, this study addresses distributed design of
glocal-structured controllers. Glocal control exploits the nature that network
system's behavior can typically be represented as a superposition of spatially
local fluctuations and global interarea oscillations by incorporating a global
coordinating subcontroller with local decentralized subcontrollers. The key
idea to distributed design of glocal controllers is to represent the original
network system as a hierarchical cascaded system composed of reduced-order
models representing the global and local dynamics, referred to as hierarchical
model decomposition. Distributed design is achieved by independently designing
and implementing subcontrollers for the reduced-order models while preserving
the cascade structure. This paper provides a condition for existence of the
hierarchical model decomposition, a specific representation of the hierarchical
system, a clustering method appropriate for the proposed approach, and a robust
extension. Numerical examples of a power grid evidence the practical relevance

fabricate pillars and then compressed, the dramatic strain burst does not
occur, and they yield at a quarter of the strength of their pristine

size effect is apparent, where the yield strength increases as the sample size
decreases. Since dislocation starvation and the single arm source mechanisms
cannot explain a size effect on yield strength in dislocation free samples, we
investigate the dislocation nucleation mechanisms controlling the size effect
through careful experimental observations and molecular statics simulations. We
find that intrinsic or extrinsic symmetry breakers such as surface defects,

influence dislocation nucleation, and thus contribute to the size effect on

interest. A VASSB allows tokens that are themselves markings (balloons). We
show that context bounded fair termination reduces to fair termination for
VASSB. We show the latter problem is decidable by showing a series of
reductions: from fair termination to configuration reachability for VASSB and
thence to the reachability problem for VASS. For a lower bound, fair
termination is known to be non-elementary already in the special case where
threads run to completion (no context switches).
  We also show that the simpler problem of context-bounded termination is
2EXPSPACE-complete, matching the complexity bound---and indeed the
techniques---for safety verification. Additionally, we show the related problem
of fair starvation, which checks if some thread can be starved along a fair
run, is also decidable in the context-bounded case. The decidability employs an
intricate reduction from fair starvation to fair termination. Like fair
termination, this problem is also non-elementary.

interferometry or audio compression, observations are acquired indistinctly in
the time or frequency domains: temporal observations allow us to study the
spectral content of signals (e.g., audio), while frequency-domain observations
are used to reconstruct temporal/spatial data (e.g., MRI). Classical approaches
for spectral analysis rely either on i) a discretisation of the time and
frequency domains, where the fast Fourier transform stands out as the
\textit{de facto} off-the-shelf resource, or ii) stringent parametric models
with closed-form spectra. However, the general literature fails to cater for
missing observations and noise-corrupted data. Our aim is to address the lack
of a principled treatment of data acquired indistinctly in the temporal and
frequency domains in a way that is robust to missing or noisy observations, and
that at the same time models uncertainty effectively. To achieve this aim, we
first define a joint probabilistic model for the temporal and spectral
representations of signals, to then perform a Bayesian model update in the
light of observations, thus jointly reconstructing the complete (latent) time
and frequency representations. The proposed model is analysed from a classical
spectral analysis perspective, and its implementation is illustrated through
intuitive examples. Lastly, we show that the proposed model is able to perform
joint time and frequency reconstruction of real-world audio, healthcare and
astronomy signals, while successfully dealing with missing data and handling
uncertainty (noise) naturally against both classical and modern approaches for
spectral estimation.

this paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the modifications proposed

proposed, and the barriers present in current market designs hindering the

solutions proposed in the literature, which could potentially mitigate these
barriers, are extensively explored. Finally, a taxonomy of the proposed

and the associated implementation challenges. The outcomes of this analysis
show that even though each barrier is addressed by at least one proposed
solution, no single proposal is able to address all the barriers
simultaneously. In this regard, a future-proof market design must combine
different elements of proposed solutions to comprehensively mitigate market
barriers and overcome the identified implementation challenges. Thus, by
thoroughly reviewing this rich body of literature, this paper introduces key
contributions enabling the advancement of the state-of-the-art towards

all terminals at minimum cost. A state-of-the-art algorithm to solve the
Steiner tree problem by means of dynamic programming is the Dijkstra-Steiner
algorithm. The algorithm builds a Steiner tree of the entire instance by
systematically searching for smaller instances, based on subsets of the
terminals, and combining Steiner trees for these smaller instances. The search
heavily relies on a guiding heuristic function in order to prune the search
space. However, to ensure correctness, this algorithm allows only for limited
heuristic functions, namely, those that satisfy a so-called consistency
condition. In this paper, we enhance the Dijkstra-Steiner algorithm and
establish a revisited algorithm, called DS*. The DS* algorithm allows for
arbitrary lower bounds as heuristics relaxing the previous condition on the
heuristic function. Notably, we can now use linear programming based lower
bounds. Further, we capture new requirements for a heuristic function in a
condition, which we call admissibility. We show that admissibility is indeed
weaker than consistency and establish correctness of the DS* algorithm when
using an admissible heuristic function. We implement DS* and combine it with
modern preprocessing, resulting in an open-source solver (DS* Solve). Finally,
we compare its performance on standard benchmarks and observe a competitive
behavior.

machine learning (ML) applications. Recently, causality-aware predictive
modeling has been proposed as an alternative causality-inspired approach for
adjusting for confounders. The basic idea is to simulate counterfactual data
that is free from the spurious associations generated by the observed
confounders. In this paper, we compare the linear residualization approach
against the causality-aware confounding adjustment in anticausal prediction
tasks, and show that the causality-aware approach tends to (asymptotically)
outperform the residualization adjustment in terms of predictive performance in
linear learners. Importantly, our results still holds even when the true model
is not linear. We illustrate our results in both regression and classification
tasks, where we compared the causality-aware and residualization approaches
using mean squared errors and classification accuracy in synthetic data
experiments where the linear regression model is mispecified, as well as, when
the linear model is correctly specified. Furthermore, we illustrate how the
causality-aware approach is more stable than residualization with respect to
dataset shifts in the joint distribution of the confounders and outcome

dark radiation in the low redshift epoch. This class of models, dubbed DMDR,
characterizes the evolution of comoving dark matter density with two extra
parameters, and may be able to help alleviate the observed discrepancies
between early- and late-time probes of the universe. We investigate how the
conversion affects key cosmological observables such as the CMB temperature and
matter power spectra. Combining 3x2pt data from Year 1 of the Dark Energy
Survey, {\it Planck}-2018 CMB temperature and polarization data, supernovae
(SN) Type Ia data from Pantheon, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data
from BOSS DR12, MGS and 6dFGS, we place new constraints on the amount of dark
matter that has converted to dark radiation and the rate of this conversion.
The fraction of the dark matter that has converted since the beginning of the
universe in units of the current amount of dark matter, $\zeta$, is constrained
at 68\% confidence level to be $<0.32$ for DES-Y1 3x2pt data, $<0.030$ for
CMB+SN+BAO data, and $<0.037$ for the combined dataset. The probability that
the DES and CMB+SN+BAO datasets are concordant increases from 4\% for the
$\Lambda$CDM model to 8\% (less tension) for DMDR. The tension in $S_8 =
\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ between DES-Y1 3x2pt and CMB+SN+BAO is
slightly reduced from $2.3\sigma$ to $1.9\sigma$. We find no reduction in the
Hubble tension when the combined data is compared to distance-ladder

theory has known many interesting developments in terms of applications such as
space time coding, network coding or public key cryptography. These
applications raised the interest of the community for theoretical properties of
this type of codes, such as the hardness of decoding in rank metric. Among
classical problems associated to codes for a given metric, the notion of code
equivalence (to decide if two codes are isometric) has always been of the
greatest interest, for its cryptographic applications or its deep connexions to
the graph isomorphism problem.
  In this article, we discuss the hardness of the code equivalence problem in
rank metric for $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear and general rank metric codes. In the
$\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear case, we reduce the underlying problem to another one
called {\em Matrix Codes Right Equivalence Problem}. We prove the latter
problem to be either in $\mathcal{P}$ or in $\mathcal{ZPP}$ depending of the
ground field size. This is obtained by designing an algorithm whose principal
routines are linear algebra and factoring polynomials over finite fields. It
turns out that the most difficult instances involve codes with non trivial {\em
stabilizer algebras}. The resolution of the latter case will involve tools
related to finite dimensional algebras and Wedderburn--Artin theory. It is
interesting to note that 30 years ago, an important trend in theoretical
computer science consisted to design algorithms making effective major results
of this theory. These algorithmic results turn out to be particularly useful in
the present article.
  Finally, for general matrix codes, we prove that the equivalence problem
(both left and right) is at least as hard as the well--studied {\em Monomial
Equivalence Problem} for codes endowed with the Hamming metric.

setting, where systems are intrinsically dispersion-free. In many condensed
matter systems, however, dispersion is an unavoidable aspect of the description
for the short wavelength modes. For these systems, how might one expect
superradiance to be modified? In this work, an answer to this question is
provided using an illustrative example. The scattering of linear excitations of
a Bose-Einstein condensate are studied in the presence of a rotating, draining

dispersion suppresses the extraction of energy and angular momentum, firstly,
by decreasing the superradiant bandwidth, and secondly, by preventing

translocation dynamics in detail and derive a scaling form for the average
translocation time as $\tilde{\tau} \sim \tilde{L}_{\textrm{r}}^{\nu} /

combining RL with modern function approximators such as kernel functions and
deep neural networks, and indeed there have been many empirical successes that
have exploited such combinations in large-scale applications. There are
profound challenges, however, in developing a theory to support this
enterprise, most notably the need to take into consideration the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff at the core of RL in conjunction with the
computational and statistical tradeoffs that arise in modern
function-approximation-based learning systems. We approach these challenges by
studying an optimistic modification of the least-squares value iteration
algorithm, in the context of the action-value function
  represented by a kernel function or an overparameterized neural network. We
establish both polynomial runtime complexity and polynomial sample complexity
for this algorithm, without additional assumptions on the data-generating
model. In particular, we prove that the algorithm incurs an
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\delta_{\mathcal{F}} H^2 \sqrt{T})$ regret, where
$\delta_{\mathcal{F}}$ characterizes the intrinsic complexity of the function
class $\mathcal{F}$, $H$ is the length of each episode, and $T$ is the total
number of episodes. Our regret bounds are independent of the number of states,
a result which exhibits clearly the benefit of function approximation in RL.

interdependencies between multiple networks---communication systems require
electricity, while the normal functioning of the power grid relies on
communication systems. These interdependencies have inspired an extensive
literature on coupled multilayer networks, assuming that a component failure in
one network causes failures in the other network, a hard interdependence that
results in a cascade of failures across multiple systems. While empirical
evidence of such hard coupling is limited, the repair and recovery of a network
requires resources typically supplied by other networks, resulting in well
documented interdependencies induced by the recovery process. If the support
networks are not functional, recovery will be slowed. Here we collected data on
the recovery time of millions of power grid failures, finding evidence of
universal nonlinear behavior in recovery following large perturbations. We
develop a theoretical framework to address recovery coupling, predicting
quantitative signatures different from the multilayer cascading failures. We
then rely on controlled natural experiments to separate the role of recovery
coupling from other effects like resource limitations, offering direct evidence
of how recovery coupling affects a system's functionality. The resulting
insights have implications beyond infrastructure systems, offering insights on
the fragility and senescence of biological systems.

of pixel-level ground truth labels, which is time-consuming and expensive to
obtain. Recent advancements in the weakly-supervised setting show that
reasonable performance can be obtained by using only image-level labels.
Classification is often used as a proxy task to train a deep neural network
from which attention maps are extracted. However, the classification task needs
only the minimum evidence to make predictions, hence it focuses on the most
discriminative object regions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel
formulation of adversarial erasing of the attention maps. In contrast to
previous adversarial erasing methods, we optimize two networks with opposing
loss functions, which eliminates the requirement of certain suboptimal
strategies; for instance, having multiple training steps that complicate the
training process or a weight sharing policy between networks operating on
different distributions that might be suboptimal for performance. The proposed
solution does not require saliency masks, instead it uses a regularization loss
to prevent the attention maps from spreading to less discriminative object
regions. Our experiments on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that our
adversarial approach increases segmentation performance by 2.1 mIoU compared to
our baseline and by 1.0 mIoU compared to previous adversarial erasing
approaches.

a Lie algebra valued scalar with a cubic two derivative interaction. Under
symmetry reduction, these yield actions for 2d integrable systems. On the other
hand, performing the symmetry reduction directly on twistor space reduces
holomorphic Chern-Simons theory to the 4d Chern-Simons theory with disorder
defects studied by Costello & Yamazaki. Finally we show that a similar
reduction by a single translation leads to a 5d partially holomorphic

Loschmidt echo. While we may not expect such few-body systems to display
semiclassical features, we find that there are clear signatures of the
exponential growth of OTOC even in systems with as low as 4 qubits in
appropriate regimes, paving way for possible experimental measurements. We
explain qualitatively how classical phase space structures like fixed points
and periodic orbits have an influence on these quantities and how our results
compare to the large-spin kicked top model. Finally we point to a peculiar case
at the border of quantum-classical correspondence which is solvable for any
number of qubits and yet has signatures of exponential sensitivity in a
rudimentary form.

extends previous mixed attachment models by allowing the number of new edges to

may be quantified in the asymptotics by various error exponents. In the case of
simple i.i.d. hypotheses, each of these exponents is equal to a divergence
(pseudo-distance) of the two states. In the case of composite hypotheses,
represented by sets of states $R,S$, one always has the inequality
$\mathrm{e}(R\|S)\le \mathrm{E}(R\|S)$, where $\mathrm{e}$ is the exponent,
$\mathrm{E}$ is the corresponding divergence, and the question is whether
equality holds. The relation between the composite exponents and the worst
pairwise exponents may be influenced by a number of factors: the type of
exponents considered; whether the problem is classical or quantum; the
cardinality and the geometric properties of the sets representing the
hypotheses; and, on top of the above, possibly whether the underlying Hilbert
space is finite- or infinite-dimensional.
  Our main contribution in this paper is clarifying this landscape
considerably: We exhibit explicit examples for hitherto unstudied cases where
the above inequality fails to hold with equality, while we also prove equality
for various general classes of state discrimination problems. In particular, we
show that equality may fail for any of the error exponents even in the
classical case, if the system is allowed to be infinite-dimensional, and the
alternative hypothesis contains countably infinitely many states. Moreover, we
show that in the quantum case strict inequality is the generic behavior in the
sense that, starting from any pair of non-commuting density operators of any
dimension, and for any of the exponents, it is possible to construct an example
with a simple null-hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis consisting of only
two states, such that strict inequality holds for the given exponent.

star-forming galaxies do not show significant changes in their $r_{20}$,

pivot stellar mass of $\log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\simeq10.5$, $r_{80}$ evolves as

increase for the massive star-forming galaxies towards late cosmic time.
Massive quiescent galaxies show stronger size evolution at all radii, in

spectrum shows that this galaxy, hosting an AGN, formed and assembled
$\sim$2$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ shaping its morphology within the $\sim$600

a mean mass-weighted age 400$^{+30}_{-70}$ Myr and it is formed between
$\sim$600 Myr and $\sim$150 Myr before the observed epoch, this latter being
the time since quenching. Its high stellar velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_e$=409$\pm$60 km s$^{-1}$, confirms the high mass
(M$_{dyn}$=$2.2(\pm0.4)$$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and the high mass density
($\Sigma_e^{M^*}$=$\Sigma_{1kpc}=3.2(\pm0.7)\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$

points toward a supersolar metallicity, [Z/H]=0.25$^{+0.006}_{-0.10}$, in
agreement with the above picture, suggesting a star formation efficiency much
higher than the replenishment time. However, sub-solar metallicity values
cannot be firmly ruled out by our analysis. Quenching must have been extremely
efficient to reduce the star formation to SFR$<$6.5 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in less
than 150 Myr. This could be explained by the presence of the AGN, even if a
causal relation cannot be established from the data. C1-23152 has the same
stellar and physical properties of the densest ETGs in the local Universe of

characterization of the spectral structure of HD-walks on two-sided
local-spectral expanders [DK17], which offer a broad generalization of the
well-studied Johnson and Grassmann graphs. Our characterization, which shows
that the spectra of HD-walks lie tightly concentrated in a few combinatorially
structured strips, leads to novel structural theorems such as a tight
$\ell_2$-characterization of edge-expansion, as well as to a new understanding
of local-to-global algorithms on HDX.
  Towards the latter, we introduce a spectral complexity measure called
Stripped Threshold Rank, and show how it can replace the (much larger)
threshold rank in controlling the performance of algorithms on structured
objects. Combined with a sum-of-squares proof of the former
$\ell_2$-characterization, we give a concrete application of this framework to
algorithms for unique games on HD-walks, in many cases improving the state of
the art [RBS11, ABS15] from nearly-exponential to polynomial time (e.g. for
sparsifications of Johnson graphs or of slices of the $q$-ary hypercube). Our
characterization of expansion also holds an interesting connection to hardness
of approximation, where an $\ell_\infty$-variant for the Grassmann graphs was
recently used to resolve the 2-2 Games Conjecture [KMS18]. We give a reduction
from a related $\ell_\infty$-variant to our $\ell_2$-characterization, but it
loses factors in the regime of interest for hardness where the gap between
$\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ structure is large. Nevertheless, we open the door
for further work on the use of HDX in hardness of approximation and unique
games.

their projected radial light profiles. Such cores have long been thought to
form through `binary scouring' as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brought in
through mergers, form a hard binary and eject stars from the galactic centre.
However, the most massive cores, like the ~3kpc core in A2261-BCG, remain
challenging to explain in this way. In this paper, we run a suite of dry galaxy
merger simulations to explore three different scenarios for central core
formation in massive elliptical galaxies: `binary scouring', `tidal deposition'
and `gravitational wave (GW) induced recoil'. Using the Griffin code, we
self-consistently model the stars, dark matter and SMBHs in our merging
galaxies, following the SMBH dynamics through to the formation of a hard
binary. We find that we can only explain the large surface brightness core of
A2261-BCG with a combination of a major merger that produces a small ~1kpc core
through binary scouring, followed by the subsequent GW recoil of its SMBH that
acts to grow the core size. We show that this same model can also explain the
bright `knots' observed in the core region of A2261-BCG. Key predictions of
this scenario are an offset SMBH surrounded by a compact cluster of bound stars
and a non-divergent central density profile. We show that the bright `knots'
observed in the core region of A2261-BCG are best explained as stalled
perturbers resulting from minor mergers, though the brightest may also

a variety of different configurations. From the analysis of reduced 3PCF at
intermediate scales, in combination with the analysis of the two-point

of the 3PCF at larger scales, comparing them with theoretical models. The data
show clear evidence of the BAO peak in different configurations, which appears
more visible in the reduced 3PCF rather than in the connected one. From the
comparison between theoretical models considering or not the BAO peak, we
obtain a quantitative estimate of this evidence, with a $\Delta \chi^2$ between
2 and 75, depending on the considered configuration. Finally, we set up a
generic framework to estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the BAO
peak in the 3PCF exploring different possible definitions, that can be used to
forecast the most favorable configurations to be explored also in different
future surveys, and applied it to the case of the Euclid mission.

this is often done by fitting data to a simulation, which depends on many
parameters. Sometimes, when the effects of varying different parameters are
highly correlated, a large ensemble of data may be needed to resolve
parameter-space degeneracies. An important example is measuring the top-quark
mass, where other physical and unphysical parameters in the simulation must be
marginalized over when fitting the top-quark mass parameter. We compare three
different methodologies for top-quark mass measurement: a classical histogram
fitting procedure, similar to one commonly used in experiment optionally
augmented with soft-drop jet grooming; a machine-learning method called DCTR;
and a linear regression approach, either using a least-squares fit or with a
dense linearly-activated neural network. Despite the fact that individual
events are totally uncorrelated, we find that the linear regression methods
work most effectively when we input an ensemble of events sorted by mass,
rather than training them on individual events. Although all methods provide
robust extraction of the top-quark mass parameter, the linear network does
marginally best and is remarkably simple. For the top study, we conclude that
the Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty on current extractions of the top-quark mass
from LHC data can be reduced significantly (by perhaps a factor of 2) using
networks trained on sorted event ensembles. More generally, machine learning
from ensembles for parameter estimation has broad potential for collider

  In the cases where the emission in the direction perpendicular to the radio
axis is comparable to that along the radio axis, we suggest that the underlying
radiative process is thermal emission from ICM. Otherwise, the dominant
radiative process is likely non-thermal IC/CMB emission from lobes. We found
that non-thermal IC/CMB is the dominant process in $\sim$70% of the sources in

We impose boundary conditions for the spin-3/2 field that are invariant under

symmetries. The compatibility of this set of boundary conditions with the
invariance of the theory under Lorentz boosts requires the introduction of
boundary degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian action, along the lines of
electromagnetism. These boundary degrees of freedom modify the symplectic
structure by a surface contribution appearing in addition to the standard bulk
piece. The Poincar\'e transformations have then well-defined (integrable,
finite) canonical generators. Moreover, improper fermionic gauge symmetries,
which are also well-defined canonical transformations, are further enlarged and
turn out to be parametrized by two independent angle-dependent spinor functions
at infinity, which lead to an infinite-dimensional fermionic algebra endowed
with a central charge. We extend next the analysis to the supersymmetric
spin-$(1,3/2)$ and spin-$(2,3/2)$ multiplets. First, we present the canonical

carried out to obtain the canonical realization of the super-Poincar\'e

transformations of the spin-$2$ field (BMS supertranslations) and the abelian

massive disc galaxies have slightly flatter $Z_{\rm g}$ profiles than their
lower-mass counterparts in L-GALAXIES 2020, due to more efficient enrichment of
their outskirts via inside-out growth and metal-rich accretion. Such a weak,
positive correlation between stellar mass and $Z_{\rm g}$ profile slope is also
seen in our MaNGA-DR15 sample of 571 star-forming disc galaxies. Although,
below ${\rm log}(M_{*}/{\rm M}_{\odot})\sim{}10.0$ this observational result is
strongly dependent on the metallicity diagnostic and morphological selection

in which a standard candle is detectable per unit time. We provide an analytic
expression for the grasp, and also show that in the background-dominated noise
limit, the optimal exposure time is three times the dead time. We introduce a
related metric we call the information-content grasp, which summarizes the
variance of all sources observed by the telescope per unit time. For
seeing-dominated sky surveys, in terms of grasp, etendue, or collecting-area
optimization, recent technological advancements make it more cost effective to
construct multiple small telescopes rather than a single large telescope with a
similar grasp or etendue. Among these key advancements are the availability of
large-format back-side illuminated CMOS detectors with <4 micron pixels, well
suited to sample standard seeing conditions given typical focal lengths of
small fast telescopes. We also discuss the possible use of multiple small

line profiles are not associated with a single coherent velocity of the gas,
differently from the 'classical' asymmetric-line outflow observed along the

action of the jets perturbing the gas in the galaxy disc. These intense and
extended velocity spreads perpendicular to AGN jets and cones are indeed
currently only observed in galaxies hosting a low-power jet whose inclination
is sufficiently low with respect to the galaxy disc to impact on and strongly
affect its material. In line with cosmological simulations, our results
demonstrate that low-power jets are indeed capable of affecting the host

closed-form formula for the defect CFT data, which allows to write an efficient
Taylor series for the correlator in the limit when one of the operators is
close to the line. The bulk channel is technically harder and closed-form
formulae are particularly challenging to obtain, nevertheless we use our
analysis to check against well-known data of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In
particular, we recover the correct anomalous dimensions of a famous tower of
twist-two operators (which includes the Konishi multiplet), and successfully
compare the one-point function of the stress-tensor multiplet with results
obtained using matrix-model techniques.

approximation, and we have extended limiters - a slope limiter to prevent
non-physical oscillations and a bound-enforcing limiter to prevent non-physical
states - from the standard RKDG framework to be able to accommodate a tabulated
nuclear equation of state (EoS). To demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms
with a nuclear EoS, we first present numerical results from basic test problems
in idealized settings in one and two spatial dimensions, employing Cartesian,
spherical-polar, and cylindrical coordinates. Then, we apply the RKDG method to
the problem of adiabatic collapse, shock formation, and shock propagation in
spherical symmetry, initiated with a 15 solar mass progenitor. We find that the
extended limiters improve the fidelity and robustness of the RKDG method in
idealized settings. The bound-enforcing limiter improves robustness of the RKDG
method in the adiabatic collapse application, while we find that slope limiting
in characteristic fields is vulnerable to structures in the EoS - more
specifically, in the phase transition from nuclei and nucleons to bulk nuclear
matter. The success of these applications marks an important step toward
applying RKDG methods to more realistic CCSN simulations with thornado in the

a new subdominant dark-energy-like component in the pre-recombination Universe
which is traditionally termed as the Early Dark Energy (EDE). However, as shown
in Refs. \cite{Hill:2020osr,Ivanov:2020ril} the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) data impose tight constraints on this
proposal. Here, we revisit these strong bounds considering the Planck CMB
temperature anisotropy data at large angular scales and the SPTPol polarization
and lensing measurements. As advocated in Ref. \cite{Chudaykin:2020acu}, this
combined data approach predicts the CMB lensing effect consistent with the
$\Lambda$CDM expectation and allows one to efficiently probe both large and
small angular scales. Combining Planck and SPTPol CMB data with the full-shape
BOSS likelihood and information from photometric LSS surveys in the EDE
analysis we found for the Hubble constant $H_0=69.79\pm0.99\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ and for the EDE fraction $f_{\rm EDE}<0.094\,(2\sigma)$.
These bounds obtained without including a local distance ladder measurement of
$H_0$ (SH0ES) alleviate the Hubble tension to a $2.5\sigma$ level. Including
further the SH0ES data we obtain $H_0=71.81\pm1.19\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$
and $f_{\rm EDE}=0.088\pm0.034$ in full accordance with SH0ES. We also found
that a higher value of $H_0$ does not significantly deteriorate the fit to the
LSS data. Overall, the EDE scenario is (though weakly) favoured over
$\Lambda$CDM even after accounting for unconstrained directions in the
cosmological parameter space. We conclude that the large-scale Planck
temperature and SPTPol polarization measurements along with LSS data do not
rule out the EDE model as a resolution of the Hubble tension. This paper
underlines the importance of the CMB lensing effect for robust constraints on
the EDE scenario.

manifest themselves in the emission spectrum and depend nontrivially on the
associated conformal factor at future null infinity. We study Lorentz boosts
and a class of superrotations whose conformal factors do not depend on the
azimuthal angle on the celestial sphere and whose singularities at the north
and south poles have been associated to the presence of a cosmic string. In
spite of such singularities, superrotations still lead to finite spectral
emission rates of particles and energy which display a distinctive power-law
behavior at high frequencies for each angular momentum state. The integrated
particle emission rate and emitted power, on the contrary, while finite for
boosts, do exhibit ultraviolet divergences for superrotations, between
logarithmic and quadratic. Such divergences can be ascribed to modes with
support along the cosmic string. In the logarithimic case, corresponding to a
superrotation which covers the sphere twice, the total power emitted still
presents the Stefan-Boltzmann form but with an effective area which diverges
logarithmically in the ultraviolet.

handle such scenarios effectively and quickly. On the other hand, compared to

classical model many-body system. By varying temperature and dimensionality, we
can tune between settings with and without symmetry breaking and accompanying
collective modes or quasiparticles. We analyse both conventional and
out-of-time-ordered spin correlators (`decorrelators') to track the spreading
of a spatiotemporally localised perturbation -- the wingbeat of the butterfly
-- as well as transport coefficients and Lyapunov exponents. We identify a
number of qualitatively different regimes. Trivially, at $T=0$, there is no
dynamics at all. In the limit of low temperature, $T=0^+$, integrability
emerges, with infinitely long-lived magnons; here the wavepacket created by the
perturbation propagates ballistically, yielding a lightcone at the spin wave
velocity which thus subsumes the butterfly velocity; inside the lightcone, a
pattern characteristic of the free spin wave spectrum is visible at short
times. On top of this, residual interactionslead to spin wave lifetimes which,
while divergent in this limit, remain finite at any nonzero $T$. At the longest
times, this leads to a `standard' chaotic regime; for this regime, we show that
the Lyapunov exponent is simply proportional to the inverse spin-wave lifetime.
Visibly strikingly, between this and the `short-time' integrable regimes, a
scarred regime emerges: here, the decorrelator is spatiotemporally highly
non-uniform, being dominated by rare and random scattering events seeding
secondary lightcones. As the spin correlation length decreases with increasing
$T$, the distinction between these regimes disappears and at high temperature
the previously studied chaotic paramagnetic regime emerges. For this, we
elucidate how, somewhat counterintuitively, the ballistic butterfly velocity
arises from a diffusive spin dynamics.

to form ""hot halos"" with slowly-cooling gas in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium

virial shocks. The cooler phase condensing out from inflows becomes
pressure-confined to over-dense clumps, embedded in low-density, volume-filling
hot gas whose cooling time is much longer than inflow time. The gas thus
transitions sharply from cool free-falling inflow, to hot and thermal-pressure
supported at approximately the virial radius ($\approx R_{\rm vir}$), and the
shock is quasi-spherical. With CRs, we previously argued that halos in this
particular mass and redshift range build up CR-pressure-dominated gaseous

there is no significant virial shock. Instead, inflowing gas is gradually
decelerated by the CR pressure gradient and the gas is relatively subsonic out

spectrum of a translational invariant tight-binding network. The FBs occur due
to destructive interference, resulting in macroscopically degenerate
eigenstates living in a finite number of unit cells, which are called compact
localized states (CLSs). Such macroscopic degeneracy is in general highly
sensitive to perturbations, such that even slight perturbation lifts the
degeneracy and leads to various interesting physical phenomena.
  In this thesis, we develop an approach to identify and construct FB
Hamiltonians in 1D, 2D Hermitian, and 1D non-Hermitian systems. First, we
introduce a systematic classification of FB lattices by their CLS properties,
and propose a scheme to generate tight-binding Hamiltonians having FBs with
given CLS properties---a FB generator. Applying this FB generator to a 1D
system, we identify all possible FB Hamiltonians of 1D lattices with arbitrary
numbers of bands and CLS sizes. Extending the 1D approach, we establish a FB
generator for 2D FB Hamiltonians that have CLSs occupying a maximum of four
unit cells in a $2\times2$ plaquette. Employing this approach in the
non-Hermitiaon regime, we realize a FB generator for a 1D non-Hermitian lattice
with two bands. Ultimately, we apply our methods to propose a tight-binding
model that explains the spectral properties of a microwave photonic crystal.
  Our results and methods in this thesis further our understanding of the
properties of FB lattices and their CLSs, provide more flexibility to design FB
lattices in experiments, and open new avenues for future research.

electron-proton collisions. In particular, we focus on the measurements of the
rapidity gap size. The model used for the calculations is based on the
diffractive exchange of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov perturbative Pomeron.
Calculations for the cross section and the estimates for the rates assuming
integrated luminosity of $10 \, \rm fb^{-1}$ are provided. Two experimental
strategies were considered. First, measuring the rapidity gap size directly, by
observing the activity in the forward part of the central detector, and second
by putting a lower limit on the rapidity gap size in the case when the detector
cannot measure forward activity. We find that, it is possible to measure at the
EIC the dependence of the cross section on rapidity gap interval up to four
units in rapidity. This should allow to measure the change of the cross section
by a factor 1.6 expected due to the BFKL exchange. This is possible with the
present setup of the detector which projects the coverage up to 3.5 units of
rapidity. We conclude however, that the extension of the detector up to higher
rapidity, for example to 4.5 would be desirable and provide even better lever
arm for testing rapidity gap physics at the EIC.

adiabatic evolutions. This iterative adiabatic theorem reveals that
adiabaticity holds eternally, that is, the system evolves within each

$O(1/\gamma)$ uniformly in time, where $\gamma$ characterizes the strength of
the unperturbed part of the generator. We prove that the iterative adiabatic

efficient and scalable optimization schemes, its practical application is

re-drawing the random subspace at each step, which yields significantly better

efficient as network dimensionality grows. To implement these experiments, we
leverage hardware-accelerated pseudo-random number generation to construct the

tidal deformability of a white dwarf that do not depend sensitively on the
white dwarf composition. These relations allow us to rewrite the moments of
inertia and tidal deformabilities in the waveform in terms of the masses. We
then carried out a Fisher analysis to estimate how accurately one can measure
the individual masses from the chirp mass and finite-size measurements. We
found that the individual white dwarf masses can be measured with LISA for a
4-year observation if the initial frequency is high enough ($\sim 0.02$Hz) and
either the binary separation is small ($\sim 1$kpc) or the masses are
relatively large $(m \gtrsim 0.8M_\odot)$. This opens a new possibility of
measuring individual masses of binary white dwarfs with space-based

time-evolving distributions of frequencies of interactions between node-pairs.
The anomalies are then determined based on the likelihood of the observed
frequency of each incoming interaction. F-FADE is able to handle in an online
streaming setting a broad variety of anomalies with temporal and structural
changes, while requiring only constant memory. Our experiments on one synthetic

significantly influences mechanical and thermal properties of polymers and has
to be taken into consideration when planning manufacturing processes as well as
applications of the final product. In order to simultaneously capture both
kinds of effects, the model proposed starts by introducing a triple
decomposition of the deformation gradient and furthermore uses thermodynamic
framework for material modeling based on the Coleman--Noll procedure and
minimum principle of the dissipation potential, which requires suitable
assumptions for the Helmholtz free energy and the dissipation potential. The
chosen setup yields evolution equations which are able to simulate the
formation and the degradation of crystalline regions accompanied by the
temperature change during a cyclic tensile test. The boundary value problem
corresponding to the described process includes the balance of linear momentum
and balance of energy and serves as a basis for the numerical implementation
within an FEM code. The~paper closes with the numerical examples showing the

integrate learning a task space policy with a model-based inverse dynamics
controller, which translates task space actions into joint-level controls. With
this natural action space for learning locomotion, the approach is more sample
efficient and produces desired task space dynamics compared to learning purely

that the learned policies are able to transfer to the real bipedal robot
Cassie. This result encourages further research towards incorporating bipedal
control techniques into the structure of the learning process to enable dynamic

excitation propagation in the myocardium. Frequently, operator splitting is
used to decouple the stiff reaction term and the diffusion term in the
monodomain model so that they can be solved separately. Commonly, the diffusion
term is solved implicitly with a large time step while the reaction term is
solved by using an explicit method with adaptive time stepping. In this work,
we propose a fully explicit method for the solution of the decoupled monodomain

lower memory footprint and higher scalability. However, such methods are only
conditionally stable. We overcome the conditional stability limitation by
proposing a dual adaptive explicit method in which adaptive time integration is
applied for the solution of both the reaction and diffusion terms. In a set of
numerical examples where cardiac propagation is simulated under physiological

presents preserved accuracy and improved computational efficiency as compared

helps divide the task of autonomous vehicle driving into sub-goals and supports
the network to learn policies for both high-level options and low-level
trajectory planner choices. The introduction of sub-goals decreases convergence
time and enables the policies learned to be reused for other scenarios. In
addition, the proposed planner is made robust by guaranteeing smooth
trajectories and by handling the noisy perception system of the ego-car. The
PID controller is used for tracking the waypoints, which ensures smooth
trajectories and reduces jerk. The problem of incomplete observations is
handled by using a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layer in the network. Results

the first solar-dedicated instrument to utilize focusing optics to image the
Sun in the hard X-ray (HXR) regime, sensitive to the energy range 4-20 keV.
Through spectral analysis of the two microflares using an optically thin
isothermal plasma model, we find evidence for plasma heated to temperatures of
~10 MK and emissions measures down to ~$10^{44}~$cm$^{-3}$. Though nonthermal
emission was not detected for the FOXSI-2 microflares, a study of the parameter
space for possible hidden nonthermal components shows that there could be
enough energy in nonthermal electrons to account for the thermal energy in
microflare 1, indicating that this flare is plausibly consistent with the
standard thick-target model. With a solar-optimized design and improvements in
HXR focusing optics, FOXSI-2 offers approximately five times greater
sensitivity at 10 keV than the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)
for typical microflare observations and allows for the first direct imaging
spectroscopy of solar HXRs with an angular resolution at scales relevant for

Our approach yields controls in a feedback form for quick calculation and
robustness to moderate disturbances to the system. We train our model using the
objective function and optimality conditions of the control problem. Therefore,
our training algorithm neither involves a data generation phase nor solutions
from another algorithm. Our model uses empirically effective HJB penalizers for
efficient training. By training on a distribution of initial states, we ensure
the controls' optimality is achieved on a large portion of the state-space. Our
approach is grid-free and scales efficiently to dimensions where grids become
impractical or infeasible. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on a
150-dimensional multi-agent problem with obstacles.

approaches by leveraging a time integration scheme, that embeds the immersed
boundary forcing step within a semi-implicit iterative Crank-Nicolson scheme.
The overall method is robust, stable, and yields excellent results in canonical
cases with static and moving boundaries. The moving IBM allows us to reproduce
the geometry and parameters of the swirling von Karman flow experiments in (F.
Ravelet, A. Chiffaudel, and F. Daviaud, JFM 601, 339 (2008)) on a Cartesian
grid. In these DNS, the flow is driven by two-counter rotating impellers fitted
with curved inertial stirrers. We analyze the transition from laminar to
turbulent flow by increasing the rotation rate of the counter-rotating
impellers to attain the four Reynolds numbers 90, 360, 2000, and 4000. In the
laminar regime at Reynolds number 90 and 360, we observe flow features similar
to those reported in the experiments and in particular, the appearance of a
symmetry-breaking instability at Reynolds number 360. We observe transitional
turbulence at Reynolds number 2000. Fully developed turbulence is achieved at
Reynolds number 4000. Non-dimensional torque computed from simulations matches
correlations from experimental data. The low Reynolds number symmetries, lost
with increasing Reynolds number, are recovered in the mean flow in the fully
developed turbulent regime, where we observe two tori symmetrical about the
mid-height plane. We note that turbulent fluctuations in the central region of
the device remain anisotropic even at the highest Reynolds number 4000,
suggesting that isotropization requires significantly higher Reynolds numbers.

  paper was presented in part at the 2020 IEEE Intnl. Symp. Information Theory,
  Los Angeles, CA, 2020",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multiple groupcasting over the broadcast channel (BC) is studied. In
particular, an inner bound is obtained for the $K$-receiver discrete memoryless
(DM) BC for the diamond message set which consists of four groupcast messages:
one desired by all receivers, one by all but two receivers, and two more
desired by all but each one of those two receivers. The inner bound is based on
rate-splitting and superposition coding and is given in explicit form herein as
a union over coding distributions of four-dimensional polytopes. When
specialized to the so-called combination network, which is a class of
three-layer (two-hop) broadcast networks parameterized by $2^K-1$
finite-and-arbitrary-capacity noiseless links from the source node in the first
layer to as many nodes of the second layer, our top-down approach from the DM
BC to the combination network yields an explicit inner bound as a single
polytope via the identification of a single coding distribution. This inner
bound consists of inequalities which are then identified to be within the class
of a plethora of (indeed, infinitely many) generalized cut-set outer bounds
recently obtained by Salimi et al for broadcast networks. We hence establish
the capacity region of the general $K$-user combination network for the diamond
message set, and do so in explicit form. Such a result implies a certain
strength of our inner bound for the DM BC in that it (a) produces a hitherto
unknown capacity region when specialized to the combination network and (b) may
capture many combinatorial aspects of the capacity region of the $K$-receiver
DM BC itself (for the diamond message set). Moreover, we further extend that
inner bound by adding binning to it and providing that inner bound also in
explicit form as a union over coding distributions of four-dimensional
polytopes in the message rates.

experience in a variety of ways, e.g., as enemies, allies, or innocent
bystanders. A crucial component of NPCs is navigation, which allows them to
move from one point to another on the map. The most popular approach for NPC
navigation in the video game industry is to use a navigation mesh (NavMesh),
which is a graph representation of the map, with nodes and edges indicating
traversable areas. Unfortunately, complex navigation abilities that extend the
character's capacity for movement, e.g., grappling hooks, jetpacks,
teleportation, or double-jumps, increases the complexity of the NavMesh, making
it intractable in many practical scenarios. Game designers are thus constrained
to only add abilities that can be handled by a NavMesh if they want to have NPC
navigation. As an alternative, we propose to use Deep Reinforcement Learning
(Deep RL) to learn how to navigate 3D maps using any navigation ability. We
test our approach on complex 3D environments in the Unity game engine that are
notably an order of magnitude larger than maps typically used in the Deep RL
literature. One of these maps is directly modeled after a Ubisoft AAA game. We

  Slow Feature Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG math.CA math.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Sturm-Liouville problem ($\lambda wy=(ry')'+qy$) is singular if its domain
is unbounded or if $r$ or $w$ vanish at the boundary. Then it is difficult to
tell whether profound results from regular Sturm-Liouville theory apply.
Existing criteria are often difficult to apply, e.g. because they are
formulated in terms of the solution function.
  We study the special case that the potential $q$ is zero under Neumann
boundary conditions and give simple and explicit criteria, solely in terms of
the coefficient functions, to assess whether various properties of the regular
case apply. Specifically, these properties are discreteness of the spectrum
(BD), self-adjointness, oscillation ($i$th solution has $i$ zeros) and that the
$i$th eigenvalue equals the SFA delta value (the total energy) of the $i$th
solution. We further prove that stationary points of each solution strictly
interlace with its zeros (in singular or regular case, regardless of the
boundary condition, for zero potential or if $q < \lambda w$ everywhere). If
$\frac{r}{w}$ is bounded and of bounded variation, the criterion simplifies to
requiring $\frac{|w'|}{w} \to \infty$ at singular boundary points.
  This research is motivated by Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), a data processing
algorithm that extracts the slowest uncorrelated signals from a
high-dimensional input signal and has notable success in computer vision,
computational neuroscience and blind source separation. From [Sprekeler et al.,
2014] it is known that for an important class of scenarios (statistically
independent input), an analytic formulation of SFA reduces to a Sturm-Liouville
problem with zero potential and Neumann boundary conditions. So far, the
mathematical SFA theory has only considered the regular case, except for a
special case that is solved by Hermite Polynomials. This work generalizes SFA
theory to the singular case, i.e. open-space scenarios.

to control the average multiple type error rate, i.e. the probably that a
randomly selected patient will be exposed to an inefficient treatment. We call
this the population-wise error rate, exemplify it by a number of examples and
illustrate how to control it with an adjustment of critical boundaries or
adjusted p-values. We furthermore define corresponding simultaneous confidence
intervals. We finally illustrate the power gain achieved by passing from

two different types of explosion models, each with two variants: two delayed

N5def), where the N number parametrizes the ignition. The output of each SN
simulation is used as input of a SNR simulation carried on until 500 yr after
the explosion. While all SNR models become more spherical over time and overall
display the theoretical structure expected for a young SNR, clear differences
are visible amongst the models, depending on the geometry of the ignition and
on the presence or not of detonation fronts. Compared to N100 models, N5 models
have a strong dipole component, and produce asymmetric remnants. N5def produces
a regular-looking, but offset remnant, while N5ddt produces a two-sided
remnant. Pure deflagration models exhibit specific traits: a central
over-density, because of the incomplete explosion, and a network of seam lines
across the surface, boundaries between burning cells. Signatures from the SN
dominate the morphology of the SNR up to 100 yr to 300 yr after the explosion,
depending on the model, and are still measurable at 500 yr, which may provide a
way of testing explosion models.

focuses on short-term timelines and return on investment. The journey from
research to product is often tacit or ad hoc, resulting in technology
transition failures, further exacerbated when research and development is
interorganizational and interdisciplinary. Even more, much of the ability to
produce results remains locked in the private repositories and know-how of the

contributing to the ML community's challenges in reproducibility. With research
organizations focused on an exploding array of fields, opportunities for the
handover and maturation of interdisciplinary research reduce. With these

improved reproducibility, faster progress, and more trusted outcomes. We
perform a case study of the Frontier Development Lab (FDL), an AI accelerator

state space. However, for many practical planning problems in robotics, we
expect the robot to predict goals, e.g. from noisy sensors or by generalizing
learned models to novel contexts. In these cases, sets with uncertainty
naturally extend to probability distributions. While a few works have used
probability distributions as goals for planning, surprisingly no systematic
treatment of planning to goal distributions exists in the literature. This
article serves to fill that gap. We argue that goal distributions are a more
appropriate goal representation than deterministic sets for many robotics
applications. We present a novel approach to planning under uncertainty to goal
distributions, which we use to highlight several advantages of the goal
distribution formulation. We build on previous results in the literature by
formally framing our approach as an instance of planning as inference. We
additionally derive reductions of several common planning objectives as special
cases of our probabilistic planning framework. Our experiments demonstrate the
flexibility of probability distributions as a goal representation on a variety
of problems including planar navigation among obstacles, intercepting a moving

task-oracle to confer task identities to each test sample, without which the
models are entirely unable to perform. To address this shortcoming, we propose
and compare several candidate task-assigning mappers which require very little
memory overhead: (1) Incremental unsupervised prototype assignment using either
nearest means, Gaussian Mixture Models or fuzzy ART backbones; (2) Supervised
incremental prototype assignment with fast fuzzy ARTMAP; (3) Shallow perceptron
trained via a dynamic coreset. Our proposed model variants are trained either
from pre-trained feature extractors or task-dependent feature embeddings of the
main classifier network. We apply these pipeline variants to continual learning
benchmarks, comprised of either sequences of several datasets or within one

discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method. The philosophy of the DPG method
allows us to break the test space and achieve unconditionally stable FE
approximations as well as accurate a posteriori error estimators upon solution
of a saddle point system of equations. The resulting error indicators allow us
to employ mesh adaptive strategies and perform space-time mesh refinements,

  We derive a priori error estimates for the AVS-FE method and linearized SWE
and perform numerical verifications to confirm corresponding asymptotic
convergence behavior. In an effort to keep the computational cost low, we
consider an alternative space-time approach in which the space-time domain is
partitioned into finite sized space-time slices. Hence, we can perform
adaptivity on each individual slice to preset error tolerances as needed for a
particular application. Numerical verifications comparing the two alternatives
indicate the space-time slices are superior for simulations over long times,
whereas the solutions are indistinguishable for short times. Multiple numerical
verifications show the adaptive mesh refinement capabilities of the AVS-FE
method, as well the application of the method to commonly applied benchmarks

the topological surface states extend over the entire circumference of the

adjusting quartic couplings in the scalar potential or introducing an extra

where the correlation among multiple latent embeddings requires to be jointly
minimized or maximized. However, calculating precise TC values is challenging,
especially when the closed-form distributions of embedding variables are
unknown. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to estimate total
correlation values with sample-based mutual information (MI) estimators. More
specifically, we discover a relation between TC and MI and propose two types of
calculation paths (tree-like and line-like) to decompose TC into MI terms. With
each MI term being bounded, the TC values can be successfully estimated.
Further, we provide theoretical analyses concerning the statistical consistency
of the proposed TC estimators. Experiments are presented on both synthetic and
real-world scenarios, where our estimators demonstrate effectiveness in all TC
estimation, minimization, and maximization tasks. The code is available at

models that are not only more constrained, but also show qualitative
improvements in interpretability and identifiability. We validate pi-VAE using

relatively small atmospheric vortices that form mostly over the ocean in high

associated with strong surface winds and heat fluxes. Detection and tracking of
PLs are crucial for understanding the climatological dynamics of PLs and for
the analysis of their impacts on other components of the climatic system. At
the same time, visual tracking of PLs is a highly time-consuming procedure that
requires expert knowledge and extensive examination of source data.
  There are known procedures involving deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNNs) for the detection of large-scale atmospheric phenomena in reanalysis
data that demonstrate a high quality of detection. However, one cannot apply
these procedures to satellite data directly since, unlike reanalyses, satellite
products register all the scales of atmospheric vortices. It is also known that
DCNNs were originally designed to be scale-invariant. This leads to the problem
of filtering the scale of detected phenomena. There are other problems to be
solved, such as a low signal-to-noise ratio of satellite data and an unbalanced
number of negative (without PLs) and positive (where a PL is presented) classes
in a satellite dataset.
  In our study, we propose a deep learning approach for the detection of PLs

adversarial robustness and probabilistic constraint satisfaction. However,
while the former is generally computationally intractable and leads to
overconservative solutions, the latter typically relies on strong
distributional assumptions and ignores strategic coupling between agents.
  To avoid these drawbacks, we present a novel formulation of robustness within
the framework of general-sum dynamic game theory, modeled on defensive driving.
More precisely, we prepend an adversarial phase to the ego agent's cost
function. That is, we prepend a time interval during which other agents are
assumed to be temporarily distracted, in order to render the ego agent's
equilibrium trajectory robust against other agents' potentially dangerous
behavior during this time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new

We consider the case where a problem is factored, that is, the underlying

constraints, each of which depends only on some variables. Such problems are at
the core of efficient and robust sequential robot manipulation planning. Naive
sequential conditional sampling of individual variables, as well as fully joint

diverse valid robot configurations for mode-switches within sequential
manipulation tasks, which are waypoints for subsequent trajectory optimization
or sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We show that the learning method
quickly converges to the best sampling strategy for a given problem, and
outperforms user-defined orderings or fully joint optimization, while providing

estimate alignment scores. However, when the number of reads is large,
accurately estimating alignment scores for all pairs is still very costly.
Moreover, in practice, one is only interested in identifying pairs of reads
with large alignment scores. In this work, we propose a new approach to
pairwise alignment estimation based on two key new ingredients. The first
ingredient is to cast the problem of pairwise alignment estimation under a
general framework of rank-one crowdsourcing models, where the workers'
responses correspond to k-mer hash collisions. These models can be accurately
solved via a spectral decomposition of the response matrix. The second

decomposition of the response matrix for adaptively chosen subsets of the read

that could have been prevented by eradicating a certain exposure in a certain
population. It can be strongly time-dependent because either exposure incidence
or excess risk may change over time. Competing events may moreover hinder the
outcome of interest from being observed. Occurrence of either of these events
may, in turn, prevent the exposure of interest. Estimation approaches therefore
need to carefully account for the timing of potential events in such highly
dynamic settings. The use of multistate models has been widely encouraged to
meet this need so as to eliminate preventable yet common types of
time-dependent bias, such as immortal time bias. Even so, it has been pointed
out that previously proposed multistate modeling approaches for PAF estimation
fail to fully eliminate such biases. In addition, assessing whether patients
die from rather than with a certain exposure, not only requires adequate
modeling of the timing of events, but also of their confounding factors. While
proposed multistate modeling approaches for confounding adjustment may be
sufficient to accommodate baseline imbalances between infected and uninfected
patients, unlike g-methods, these proposals are not generally equipped to
handle time-dependent confounding. However, the connection between multistate
modeling and g-methods (e.g. inverse probability of censoring weighting) for
PAF estimation is not readily apparent. In this paper, we illustrate this
connection by means of a weighting-based characterization of both approaches.
This characterization aids to both pinpoint current shortcomings of these
approaches and to enhance intuition into simple modifications to overcome these
limitations. Documented R code is made available to foster the uptake of
g-methods for PAF estimation.

are rarely spherical. In this study, we numerically and theoretically
investigate the dispersion of an initially localized patch of passive elongated
Brownian particles constrained to one degree of rotational freedom in a
two-dimensional Poiseuille flow, demonstrating that elongated particles exhibit
an enhanced longitudinal dispersion. In a shear flow, the rods translate due to
advection and diffusion and rotate due to rotational diffusion and their
classical Jeffery's orbit. The magnitude of the enhanced dispersion depends on
the particle's aspect ratio and the relative importance of its shear-induced
rotational advection and rotational diffusivity. When rotational diffusion
dominates, we recover the classical Taylor dispersion result for the
longitudinal spreading rate using an orientationally averaged translational
diffusivity for the rods. However, in the high-shear limit, the rods tend to
align with the flow and ultimately disperse more due to their anisotropic
diffusivities. Results from our Monte Carlo simulations of the particle
dispersion are captured remarkably well by a simple theory inspired by Taylor's
original work. For long times and large Peclet numbers, an effective
one-dimensional transport equation is derived with integral expressions for the
particles' longitudinal transport speed and dispersion coefficient. The
enhanced dispersion coefficient can be collapsed along a single curve for
particles of high aspect ratio, representing a simple correction factor that
extends Taylor's original prediction to elongated particles.

the plane. Two well known methods are to minimize sums of squares of vertical
or horizontal distances to the line. Less known is to minimize sums of squares
of distances to the line. Concise proofs are given for each method using a
combination of the first derivative test for functions of two variables and
completing the square. The three methods are compared and the distances to the
line method appears to be favourable in most circumstances. They generally draw
different regression lines. The method of vertical displacements typically
gives a slope of too small magnitude while the method of horizontal
displacements typically gives a slope of too large magnitude. An inequality
involving the three slopes is proved. Rotating all the data points in the same
way with these two methods does not result in the regression line being rotated
the same way. However, the distance to the line method is invariant under
rotations.

several sensing modalities to increase robustness and accuracy, which makes
sensor fusion a crucial part of the perception system. In this paper, we focus
on the problem of radar and camera sensor fusion and propose a middle-fusion
approach to exploit both radar and camera data for 3D object detection. Our
approach, called CenterFusion, first uses a center point detection network to
detect objects by identifying their center points on the image. It then solves
the key data association problem using a novel frustum-based method to
associate the radar detections to their corresponding object's center point.
The associated radar detections are used to generate radar-based feature maps
to complement the image features, and regress to object properties such as
depth, rotation and velocity. We evaluate CenterFusion on the challenging
nuScenes dataset, where it improves the overall nuScenes Detection Score (NDS)
of the state-of-the-art camera-based algorithm by more than 12%. We further
show that CenterFusion significantly improves the velocity estimation accuracy

motivating application is the detection of knots in sawn timber images, which
is an important problem since the number and types of knots are visual
characteristics that adversely affect the quality of sawn timber. We
demonstrate how models can be tailored to the elliptical shape and thereby
improve on general purpose detectors; more generally, elliptical defects are
common in industrial production, such as enclosed air bubbles when casting
glass or plastic. In this paper, we adapt the Faster R-CNN with its Region
Proposal Network (RPN) to model elliptical objects with a Gaussian function,
and extend the existing Gaussian Proposal Network (GPN) architecture by adding
the region-of-interest pooling and regression branches, as well as using the
Wasserstein distance as the loss function to predict the precise locations of
elliptical objects. Our proposed method has promising results on the lumber
knot dataset: knots are detected with an average intersection over union of
73.05%, compared to 63.63% for general purpose detectors. Specific to the
lumber application, we also propose an algorithm to correct any misalignment in
the raw timber images during scanning, and contribute the first open-source

projective and affine structures on higher-dimensional varieties in positive

Frobenius-affine structures, which have been previously investigated only in
the case where the underlying varieties are curves. As the first step in
expanding the theory, we prove various basic properties on Frobenius-projective
and Frobenius-affine structures and study (the positive characteristic version
of) the classification problem, starting with S. Kobayashi and T. Ochiai, of
varieties admitting projective or affine structures. In the first half of the
present paper, we construct bijective correspondences with several types of
generalized indigenous bundles; one of them is defined in terms of Berthelot's
higher-level differential operators. We also prove the positive characteristic
version of Gunning's formulas, which give necessary conditions on Chern classes
for the existence of Frobenius-projective or Frobenius-affine structures
respectively. The second half of the present paper is devoted to studying, from
the viewpoint of Frobenius-projective and Frobenius-affine structures, some
specific classes of varieties, i.e., projective and affine spaces, abelian
varieties, curves, and surfaces. For example, it is shown that the existence of
Frobenius-projective structures of infinite level gives a characterization of
ordinariness for abelian varieties. Also, we prove that any smooth projective
curve of genus $>1$ admits a Frobenius-projective structure of infinite level,

processes such as exciton dissociation at photovoltaic heterojunctions,
photoinduced charge transfer at electrodes, and electron transfer in
photosynthetic reaction centers. Diabatic states corresponding to charge or
excitation localized species, such as locally excited and charge transfer
states, provide a physically intuitive framework to simulate and understand
these processes. However, obtaining accurate diabatic states and their
couplings from adiabatic electronic states generally leads to inaccurate
results when combined with low-tier electronic structure methods, such as time
dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and exorbitant computational cost
when combined with high-level wavefunction-based methods. Here we introduce a
DFT-based diabatization scheme, {\Delta}-ALMO(MSDFT2), which directly
constructs the diabatic states using absolutely localized molecular orbitals
(ALMOs). We demonstrate that our method, which combines ALMO calculations with
the {\Delta}SCF technique to construct electronically excited diabatic states
and obtains their couplings with charge-transfer states using our MSDFT2
scheme, gives accurate results for excited state electron and hole transfer in
both charged and uncharged systems that underlie DNA repair, charge separation
in donor-acceptor dyads, chromophore-to-solvent electron transfer, and singlet
fission. This framework for the accurate and efficient construction of excited
state diabats and evaluation of their couplings directly from DFT thus offers a
route to simulate and elucidate photoinduced electron and hole transfer in
large disordered systems, such as those encountered in the condensed phase.

a ""signal"" process, the process of interest, and ""noise"", representing nuisance
factors that obfuscate the signal. To separate signal from noise, assumptions
must be made about both parts of the system. If the signal process is
incorrectly specified, our predictions using this model may generalise poorly;
similarly, if the noise process is incorrectly specified, we can attribute too
much or too little observed variation to the signal. With little justification,
independent Gaussian noise is typically chosen, which defines a statistical
model that is simple to implement but often misstates system uncertainty and
may underestimate error autocorrelation. There are a range of alternative noise
processes available but, in practice, none of these may be entirely
appropriate, as actual noise may be better characterised as a time-varying
mixture of these various types. Here, we consider systems where the signal is
modelled with ordinary differential equations and present classes of flexible
noise processes that adapt to a system's characteristics. Our noise models
include a multivariate normal kernel where Gaussian processes allow for
non-stationary persistence and variance, and nonparametric Bayesian models that
partition time series into distinct blocks of separate noise structures. Across
the scenarios we consider, these noise processes faithfully reproduce true
system uncertainty: that is, parameter estimate uncertainty when doing
inference using the correct noise model. The models themselves and the methods
for fitting them are scalable to large datasets and could help to ensure more
appropriate quantification of uncertainty in a host of time series models.

The PPG terms are dominant at weak fields over the Lorentz force for
accumulating charge in the vortex cores, whereas the Lorentz force prevails at
higher fields to give rise to a peak structure in the core charge around $H\sim
\frac{1}{2}H_{{\rm c}2}$. We estimate the peak value of the core charge at
$T=0.2 T_{\rm c}$ using parameters appropriate for cuprates to obtain a large

people to share the news, and it spreads faster than ever before. These
platforms also have been exploited to share the rumor or fake information,
which is a threat to society. One method to reduce the impact of fake
information is making people aware of the correct information based on hard
proof. In this work, first, we propose a propagation model called Competitive
Independent Cascade Model with users' Bias (CICMB) that considers the presence
of strong user bias towards different opinions, believes, or political parties.
We further propose a method, called $k-TruthScore$, to identify an optimal set
of truth campaigners from a given set of prospective truth campaigners to
minimize the influence of rumor spreaders on the network. We compare
$k-TruthScore$ with state of the art methods, and we measure their performances
as the percentage of the saved nodes (nodes that would have believed in the
fake news in the absence of the truth campaigners). We present these results on
a few real-world networks, and the results show that $k-TruthScore$ method
outperforms baseline methods.

including non-affine elastic responses and excess vibrational states, i.e., the

be affected by the bending rigidity of the constituent polymer chains. In our

simple relationships between the variations of vibrational properties and the
global elastic properties: the response of the boson peak scales only with that
of the global shear modulus. This observation suggests that the spatial
heterogeneity of the local shear modulus distribution is insensitive to changes
in the bending rigidity. Here, we demonstrate the insensitivity of elastic
heterogeneity by directly measuring the local shear modulus distribution. We
also study transverse sound wave propagation, which is also shown to scale only
with the global shear modulus. Through these analyses, we conclude that the
bending rigidity does not alter the spatial heterogeneity of the local shear
modulus distribution, which yields vibrational and acoustic properties that are
controlled solely by the global shear modulus of a polymer glass.

redder than their surrounding disks with a median offset of 0.12$\pm$0.02 mag,
consistent with previous results. To measure mass-weighted age and metallicity
we investigate three methods: (i) one based on galaxy stellar mass weights for

Algorithms for statically inferring refinement types typically work by
reduction to solving systems of constrained Horn clauses extracted from typing
derivations. An example is Liquid type inference, which solves the extracted
constraints using predicate abstraction. However, the reduction to constraint
solving in itself already signifies an abstraction of the program semantics
that affects the precision of the overall static analysis. To better understand
this issue, we study the type inference problem in its entirety through the
lens of abstract interpretation. We propose a new refinement type system that
is parametric with the choice of the abstract domain of type refinements as
well as the degree to which it tracks context-sensitive control flow
information. We then derive an accompanying parametric inference algorithm as
an abstract interpretation of a novel data flow semantics of functional
programs. We further show that the type system is sound and complete with
respect to the constructed abstract semantics. Our theoretical development
reveals the key abstraction steps inherent in refinement type inference
algorithms. The trade-off between precision and efficiency of these abstraction
steps is controlled by the parameters of the type system. Existing refinement
type systems and their respective inference algorithms, such as Liquid types,
are captured by concrete parameter instantiations. We have implemented our
framework in a prototype tool and evaluated it for a range of new parameter
instantiations (e.g., using octagons and polyhedra for expressing type
refinements). The tool compares favorably against other existing tools. Our
evaluation indicates that our approach can be used to systematically construct
new refinement type inference algorithms that are both robust and precise.

technology that utilizes data, models, and algorithms and integrates multiple
disciplines, acts as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds for
comprehensive connectivity. In the digital space, virtual models are stablished
dynamically to simulate and describe the states, behaviors, and rules of
physical objects in the physical space. DT has been significantly developed and
widely applied in industrial and military fields. This study introduces the DT
technology to optical communication through interdisciplinary crossing and
proposes a DT framework suitable for optical communication. The intelligent
fault management model, flexible hardware configuration model, and dynamic
transmission simulation model are established in the digital space with the
help of deep learning algorithms to ensure the highreliability operation and
high-efficiency management of optical communication systems and networks.

investigated the properties of real-space polarization singularities that

We determined the topological indices and the trajectories of electric-field
polarization singularities in both the near-field and far-field regions. In the
far-field region, a total of four singularities are identified and the sum of
their polarization topological indices is two, independent of the particle's
geometric shape. In the near-field region, the polarization singularities
strongly depend on the particle's shape and the polarization of incident light,
and their index sum is not governed by the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem anymore due
to the non-transverse nature of the fields. From near field to far field, a
flipping of sign can happen to the polarization topological indices of the C
lines. The far-field properties of the singularities can be well explained by
the interference of the excited multipoles, but their near-field properties can
be strongly affected by the evanescent fields that are not captured by the
multipole expansions. Our work uncovers the important relationship between
particles' geometric properties and the polarization singularities of their

First, we integrate saliency priors into the backbone features to suppress the

architecture to explore group-wise semantic interactions and produce the
co-saliency features. In the first stage, we propose a group-attentional

the group-wise semantic representations. In the second stage, we propose a
gated group distribution module that adaptively distributes the learned group
semantics to different individuals in a dynamic gating mechanism. Finally, we
develop a group consistency preserving decoder tailored for the CoSOD task,
which maintains group constraints during feature decoding to predict more

most studies propose various schemes for relay selection and power allocation,
which are based on the assumption of channel state information (CSI). However,
it is difficult to get an accurate CSI in practice. In this paper, we study the
outage probability minimizing problem subjected to a total transmission power
constraint in a two-hop cooperative relay network. We use reinforcement
learning (RL) methods to learn strategies for relay selection and power
allocation, which do not need any prior knowledge of CSI but simply rely on the
interaction with communication environment. It is noted that conventional RL
methods, including most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, cannot
perform well when the search space is too large. Therefore, we first propose a
DRL framework with an outage-based reward function, which is then used as a
baseline. Then, we further propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
framework and training algorithm. A key difference from other RL-based methods
in existing literatures is that, our proposed HRL approach decomposes relay
selection and power allocation into two hierarchical optimization objectives,
which are trained in different levels. With the simplification of search space,
the HRL approach can solve the problem of sparse reward, while the conventional
RL method fails. Simulation results reveal that compared with traditional DRL
method, the HRL training algorithm can reach convergence 30 training iterations

explore the impact of under-reporting on COVID-19 spatiotemporal distributions,
and empirical analysis was carried out using infection data of healthcare
workers in Wuhan and Hubei (excluding Wuhan). The results show that (1) the
lognormal distribution was the most suitable to describe the evolution of

lagged the peak infection time of the healthcare worker cases, and the
estimated infection time interval of the reported cases was smaller than that
of the healthcare worker cases. (3) The impact of under-reporting cases on the
early stages of the pandemic was greater than that on its later stages, and the
impact on the early onset area was greater than that on the late onset area.
(4) Although the number of reported cases was lower than the actual number of
cases, a high spatial correlation existed between the cumulatively reported
cases and healthcare worker cases. The proposed framework of this study is
highly extensible, and relevant researchers can use data sources from other

Convolutional Neural Networks(deep CNNs). However, some previous work found
that the results of many Auto-ML pruning methods cannot even surpass the
results of the uniformly pruning method. In this paper, the ineffectiveness of
Auto-ML pruning which is caused by unfull and unfair training of the supernet
is shown. A deep supernet suffers from unfull training because it contains too
many candidates. To overcome the unfull training, a stage-wise pruning(SWP)
method is proposed, which splits a deep supernet into several stage-wise
supernets to reduce the candidate number and utilize inplace distillation to
supervise the stage training. Besides, A wide supernet is hit by unfair
training since the sampling probability of each channel is unequal. Therefore,
the fullnet and the tinynet are sampled in each training iteration to ensure
each channel can be overtrained. Remarkably, the proxy performance of the
subnets trained with SWP is closer to the actual performance than that of most
of the previous Auto-ML pruning work. Experiments show that SWP achieves the
state-of-the-art on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet under the mobile setting.

partition functions problems. Earlier methods for solving the same problem
include the one based on the correlation decay property. Remarkably, the
classes of graphs for which the two methods apply sometimes coincide or nearly
coincide. In this paper we show that this is more than just a coincidence. We
establish that if the interpolation method is valid for a family of graphs
satisfying the self-reducibility property, then this family exhibits a form of
correlation decay property which is asymptotic Strong Spatial Mixing (SSM) at
distances $\omega(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. This
applies in particular to amenable graphs, such as graphs which are finite
subsets of lattices.
  Our proof is based on a certain graph polynomial representation of the
associated partition function. This representation is at the heart of the
design of the polynomial time algorithms underlying the interpolation method
itself. We conjecture that our result holds for all, and not just amenable

Axion quasiparticles, emerging in topological insulators, were predicted to
strongly couple with the light and generate the so-called axion polariton.
Here, we demonstrate that there arises a gapless level attraction in cavity
axion polariton of antiferromagnetic topological insulators, which originates
from a nonlinear interaction between axion and the odd-order resonance of
cavity. Such a novel level attraction is essentially different from
conventional level attractions with the mechanism of either a linear coupling
or a dissipation-mediated interaction, and also different from the level
repulsion induced by the strong coupling in common polaritons. Our results
reveal a new mechanism of level attractions, and open up new roads for
exploring the axion polariton with cavity technologies. They have potential
applications for quantum information and dark matter research.

the model's predictions. To unify these approaches, we provide an
interpretation based on the actual causality framework and present two key
results in terms of their use. First, we present a method to generate feature
attribution explanations from a set of counterfactual examples. These feature
attributions convey how important a feature is to changing the classification
outcome of a model, especially on whether a subset of features is necessary
and/or sufficient for that change, which attribution-based methods are unable
to provide. Second, we show how counterfactual examples can be used to evaluate
the goodness of an attribution-based explanation in terms of its necessity and
sufficiency. As a result, we highlight the complementarity of these two
approaches. Our evaluation on three benchmark datasets - Adult-Income,
LendingClub, and German-Credit - confirms the complementarity. Feature
attribution methods like LIME and SHAP and counterfactual explanation methods
like Wachter et al. and DiCE often do not agree on feature importance rankings.
In addition, by restricting the features that can be modified for generating
counterfactual examples, we find that the top-k features from LIME or SHAP are
often neither necessary nor sufficient explanations of a model's prediction.

to have large alpha particle populations. Such experiments motivate new
attention to the theory of alpha particle confinement and transport. A key
topic is the interaction of alphas with perturbations to the tokamak fields,
including those from ripple and magnetohydrodynamic modes like Alfv\'{e}n
eigenmodes. These perturbations can transport alphas, leading to changed
localization of alpha heating, loss of alpha power, and damage to device walls.
Alpha interaction with these perturbations is often studied with single
particle theory. In contrast, we derive a drift kinetic theory to calculate the
alpha heat flux resulting from arbitrary perturbation frequency and periodicity
(provided these can be studied drift kinetically). Novel features of the theory
include the retention of a large effective collision frequency resulting from
the resonant alpha collisional boundary layer, correlated interactions over
many poloidal transits, and finite orbit effects. Heat fluxes are considered
for the example cases of ripple and the toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmode (TAE).
The ripple heat flux is small. The TAE heat flux is significant and scales with
the square of the perturbation amplitude, allowing the derivation of
constraints on mode amplitude for avoidance of significant alpha depletion. A
simple saturation condition suggests that TAEs in one upcoming experiment will
not cause significant alpha transport via the mechanisms in this theory.
However, saturation above the level suggested by the simple condition, but
within numerical and experimental experience, which could be accompanied by the
onset of stochasticity, could cause significant transport.

accelerate diamond growth. While there is no consensus for an atomistic
mechanism of this effect, existing studies have largely focused on the role of
sub-surface nitrogen and nitrogen-based adsorbates. In this work, we
demonstrate the catalytic effect of surface-embedded nitrogen in nucleating new
layers of (100) diamond. To do so we develop a model of nitrogen overgrowth
using density functional theory. Nucleation of new layers occurs through C
insertion into a C--C surface dimer. However, we find that C insertion into a
C--N dimer has substantially reduced energy requirements. In particular, the
rate of the key dimer ring-opening and closing mechanism is increased 400-fold
in the presence of nitrogen. Full incorporation of the substitutional nitrogen
defect is then facilitated through charge transfer of an electron from the
nitrogen lone pair to charge acceptors on the surface. This work provides a
compelling mechanism for the role of surface-embedded nitrogen in enhancing
(100) diamond growth through the nucleation of new layers. Furthermore, it
demonstrates a pathway for substitutional nitrogen formation during chemical
vapour deposition which can be extended to study the creation of
technologically relevant nitrogen-based defects.

worst-case cost of satisfying the second-stage demand over all scenarios is
minimized. The second-stage decisions are only assignment decisions without the

more adaptive and safe but also more difficult to accurately model and control.
The sim2real gap is the main barrier to successfully transfer policies from
simulation to a real robot. System identification can be applied to reduce this
gap but traditional identification methods require a lot of manual tuning.
Data-driven alternatives can tune dynamical models directly from data but are
often data hungry, which also incorporates human effort in collecting data.
This work proposes a data-driven, end-to-end differentiable simulator focused
on the exciting but challenging domain of tensegrity robots. To the best of the
authors' knowledge, this is the first differentiable physics engine for
tensegrity robots that supports cable, contact, and actuation modeling. The aim
is to develop a reasonably simplified, data-driven simulation, which can learn
approximate dynamics with limited ground truth data. The dynamics must be
accurate enough to generate policies that can be transferred back to the
ground-truth system. As a first step in this direction, the current work
demonstrates sim2sim transfer, where the unknown physical model of MuJoCo acts
as a ground truth system. Two different tensegrity robots are used for
evaluation and learning of locomotion policies, a 6-bar and a 3-bar tensegrity.
The results indicate that only 0.25\% of ground truth data are needed to train
a policy that works on the ground truth system when the differentiable engine
is used for training against training the policy directly on the ground truth
system.

future HPC and data centers will be like. Despite using the coarse-grained
reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) as the substrate platform, our key contribution
is not only the CGRA-cluster design itself, but also the ensemble of a new
architecture and programming model that enables asynchronous tasking across a
cluster of reconfigurable nodes, so as to bring specialized computation to the
data rather than the reverse. We presume distributed data storage without
asserting any prior knowledge on the data distribution. Hardware specialization
occurs at runtime when a task finds the majority of data it requires are
available at the present node. In other words, we dynamically generate
specialized CGRA accelerators where the data reside. The asynchronous tasking
for bringing computation to data is achieved by circulating the task token,
which describes the data-flow graphs to be executed for a task, among the CGRA
cluster connected by a fast ring network. Evaluations on a set of HPC and
data-driven applications across different domains show that ARENA can provide
better parallel scalability with reduced data movement (53.9%). Compared with
contemporary compute-centric parallel models, ARENA can bring on average 4.37x
speedup. The synthesized CGRAs and their task-dispatchers only occupy 2.93mm^2

and completely stable at $S>S_{0}$. Stable vortex solitons are constructed too.
We also consider collisions between the 3D solitons, in both axial and

Current gesture recognition methods have focused on recognising isolated

two-stage approaches where independent models are required for detection and
classification, with the performance of the latter being constrained by
detection performance. In contrast, we introduce a single-stage continuous
gesture recognition framework, called Temporal Multi-Modal Fusion (TMMF), that
can detect and classify multiple gestures in a video via a single model. This
approach learns the natural transitions between gestures and non-gestures
without the need for a pre-processing segmentation step to detect individual
gestures. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-modal fusion mechanism to
support the integration of important information that flows from multi-modal
inputs, and is scalable to any number of modes. Additionally, we propose
Unimodal Feature Mapping (UFM) and Multi-modal Feature Mapping (MFM) models to
map uni-modal features and the fused multi-modal features respectively. To
further enhance performance, we propose a mid-point based loss function that
encourages smooth alignment between the ground truth and the prediction,
helping the model to learn natural gesture transitions. We demonstrate the
utility of our proposed framework, which can handle variable-length input
videos, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets:
EgoGesture, IPN hand, and ChaLearn LAP Continuous Gesture Dataset (ConGD).
Furthermore, ablation experiments show the importance of different components

four probing methods---classifier probing, information-theoretic probing,
unsupervised relative acceptability judgment, and fine-tuning on NLU
tasks---and draw learning curves that track the growth of these different
measures of linguistic ability with respect to pretraining data volume using
the MiniBERTas, a group of RoBERTa models pretrained on 1M, 10M, 100M and 1B

representations that reliably encode most syntactic and semantic features we

commonsense knowledge and other skills required to master typical downstream
NLU tasks. The results suggest that, while the ability to encode linguistic
features is almost certainly necessary for language understanding, it is likely
that other forms of knowledge are the major drivers of recent improvements in
language understanding among large pretrained models.

small deviations from the Gaussianity of the distribution are of fundamental
importance. Analytic formulas for the expectation values of Minkowski
functionals with small non-Gaussianity have been derived in limited cases to

expectation values of Minkowski functionals up to second-order corrections of
non-Gaussianity in a space of general dimensions. The derived formula has
sufficient generality to be applied to any random fields with weak
non-Gaussianity in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic space of any

is particularly important. Because JPEG images are widely used, it is great
significance to study reversible data hiding algorithm for JEPG images. The
existing JEPG reversible data methods can be divided into two categories, one
is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients modification, the
other is based on Huffman table modification, the methods based on DCT
coefficient modification result in large file expansion and visual quality
distortion, while the methods based on entropy coding domain modification have
low capacity and they may lead to large file expansion. In order to effectively
solve the problems in these two kinds of methods, this paper proposes a
reversible data hiding in JPEG images methods based on multi-domain

Free-carrier screening from a metallic ""screener"" layer remotely suppresses
electron-phonon interactions in the current-carrying layer. This concept is
most effective in 2D semiconductors whose scattering is dominated by screenable
electron-phonon interactions, and in particular the Fr\""ohlich coupling to
polar-optical phonons. Such materials are common and characterised by overall
low mobilities in the small doping limit, and much higher ones when the 2D
material is doped enough for electron-phonon interactions to be screened by its
own free carriers. We use GaSe as a prototype and place it in a heterostructure
with doped graphene as the ""screener"" layer and BN as a separator. We develop
an approach to determine the electrostatic response of any heterostructure by
combining the responses of the individual layers computed within
density-functional perturbation theory. Remote screening from graphene can
suppress the long-wavelength Fr\""ohlich interaction, leading to a consistently
high mobility around $500$ to $600$ cm$^2$/Vs for carrier densities in GaSe
from $10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Notably, the low-doping mobility is
enhanced by a factor 2.5. This remote free-carrier screening is more efficient

  Usages",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the rise of AI applications, machine learning libraries have become
far more accessible, with Python being the most common programming language to
write them. Machine learning libraries tend to be updated periodically, which
may deprecate existing APIs, making it necessary for developers to update their
usages. However, updating usages of deprecated APIs are typically not a
priority for developers, leading to widespread usages of deprecated APIs which
expose library users to vulnerability issues. In this paper, we built a tool to
automate these updates. We first conducted an empirical study to seek a better
understanding on how updates of deprecated machine-learning API usages in
Python can be done. The study involved a dataset of 112 deprecated APIs from
Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. We found dimensions of deprecated API
migration related to its update operation (i.e., the required operation to
perform the migration), API mapping (i.e., the number of deprecated and its
corresponding updated APIs),and context dependency (i.e., whether we need to
consider surrounding contexts when performing the migration). Guided by the
findings on our empirical study, we created MLCatchUp, a tool to automate the
update of Python deprecated API usage that automatically infers the API
migration transformation through comparison of the deprecated and updated API
signatures. These transformations are expressed in a Domain Specific Language
(DSL). We evaluated MLCatchUp using test dataset containing 258 files with 514
API usages that we collected from public GitHub repositories. In this
evaluation, MLCatchUp achieves a precision of 86.19%. We further improve the
precision of MLCatchUp by adding a feature that allows it to accept additional
user input to specify the transformation constraints in the DSL for
context-dependent API migration, where MLCatchUp achieves a precision of
93.58%.

In this work, simulations based on GEANT4 are done to understand both the
radiogenic neutron background caused by natural radioactivity of the
surrounding rock and the cosmogenic neutron background due to interaction of
the deeply penetrating cosmic muons with the rock. The muon flux in the cavern

obtained are comparable with estimates and measurements done for DAMA, WIPP and

object>, requiring bounding boxes for human and object, and action between them
for the task completion. In other words, this task requires strong supervision
for training that is however hard to procure. A natural solution to overcome
this is to pursue weakly-supervised learning, where we only know the presence
of certain HOI triplets in images but their exact location is unknown. Most
weakly-supervised learning methods do not make provision for leveraging data
with strong supervision, when they are available; and indeed a na\""ive
combination of this two paradigms in HOI detection fails to make contributions
to each other. In this regard we propose a mixed-supervised HOI detection
pipeline: thanks to a specific design of momentum-independent learning that
learns seamlessly across these two types of supervision. Moreover, in light of
the annotation insufficiency in mixed supervision, we introduce an HOI element
swapping technique to synthesize diverse and hard negatives across images and
improve the robustness of the model. Our method is evaluated on the challenging
HICO-DET dataset. It performs close to or even better than many
fully-supervised methods by using a mixed amount of strong and weak
annotations; furthermore, it outperforms representative state of the art weakly
and fully-supervised methods under the same supervision.

the appropriate size of solutions is unclear a priori. The applicability of
this methodology is here investigated on the problem of designing a
nano-particle (NP) based drug delivery system targeting cancer tumours.
Utilizing a treatment comprising of multiple types of NPs is expected to be
more effective due to the higher complexity of the treatment. This paper begins
by utilizing the well-known NK model to explore the effects of fitness
landscape ruggedness upon the evolution of genome length and, hence, solution
complexity. The size of a novel sequence and the absence or presence of
sequence deletion are also considered. Results show that whilst landscape
ruggedness can alter the dynamics of the process, it does not hinder the
evolution of genome length. These findings are then explored within the
aforementioned real-world problem. In the first known instance, treatments with
multiple types of NPs are used simultaneously, via an agent-based open source
physics-based cell simulator. The results suggest that utilizing multiple types
of NPs is more efficient when the solution space is explored with the
evolutionary techniques under a predefined computational budget.

propose a novel conceptual compression framework that encodes visual data into

content manipulation, and potential support for various vision tasks. In
particular, we propose to compress images by a dual-layered model consisting of
two complementary visual features: 1) structure layer represented by structural

representations. At the encoder side, the structural maps and texture
representations are individually extracted and compressed, generating the
compact, interpretable, inter-operable bitstreams. During the decoding stage, a
hierarchical fusion GAN (HF-GAN) is proposed to learn the synthesis paradigm
where the textures are rendered into the decoded structural maps, leading to
high-quality reconstruction with remarkable visual realism. Extensive
experiments on diverse images have demonstrated the superiority of our
framework with lower bitrates, higher reconstruction quality, and increased
versatility towards visual analysis and content manipulation tasks.

Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) considering a scenario in which the lightest
neutral Higgs boson is purely CP even while the two heavier neutral Higgs
bosons are allowed to mix in the presence of nontrivial CP-violating phases in
the Higgs potential. Identifying the lightest neutral Higgs boson as the 125
GeV one discovered at the LHC, we find that the alignment of Yukawa couplings
without decoupling could be easily achieved in the type-I 2HDM with no much
conflict with the current LHC Higgs precision data. Otherwise, we observe that
the Yukawa couplings of the lightest Higgs boson could decouple much slowly
compared to the Higgs coupling to a pair of massive vector bosons and they
significantly deviate from the corresponding SM values even when the deviation
of the Higgs to vector boson coupling is below the percent level. On the other
hand, independently of 2HDM type and regardless of decoupling, we find a
wrong-sign alignment limit of the Yukawa couplings in which the Yukawa
couplings to the down-type quarks and/or those to the charged leptons are equal
in strength but opposite in sign to the corresponding SM ones. The magnitude
and sign of the up-type quark Yukawa couplings remain the same as in the SM.
Accordingly, in this limit, all four types of 2HDMs are viable against the LHC
Higgs precision data.

Our main result is a simple, closed and analytic, approximate expression for
this power spectrum. This expression has two parameters characterising
non-linear structure growth which can be calibrated within KFT itself. Using
this self-calibration, the non-linear power spectrum agrees with results
obtained from numerical simulations to within typically $\lesssim10\,\%$ up to
wave numbers $k\lesssim10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0$. Adjusting
the two parameters to optimise agreement with numerical simulations, the
relative difference to numerical results shrinks to typically $\lesssim 5\,\%$.
As part of the derivation of our mean-field approximation, we show that the
effective interaction potential between dark-matter particles relative to
Zel'dovich trajectories is sourced by non-linear cosmic density fluctuations
only, and is approximately of Yukawa rather than Newtonian shape.

and a key question is how we can use the transistors that we already have more
effectively. This is especially true for HPC, where the tendency is often to
throw computation at a problem whereas codes themselves are commonly bound,
at-least to some extent, by other factors. By redesigning an algorithm and
moving from a Von Neumann to dataflow style, then potentially there is more
opportunity to address these bottlenecks on reconfigurable architectures,
compared to more general-purpose architectures.
  In this paper we explore the porting of Nekbone's AX kernel, a widely popular
HPC mini-app, to FPGAs using High Level Synthesis via Vitis. Whilst computation
is an important part of this code, it is also memory bound on CPUs, and a key
question is whether one can ameliorate this by leveraging FPGAs. We first
explore optimisation strategies for obtaining good performance, with over a
4000 times runtime difference between the first and final version of our kernel
on FPGAs. Subsequently, performance and power efficiency of our approach on an

three quarters the GPU performance, and significantly more power efficient than
both. The result of this work is a comparison and set of techniques that both
apply to Nekbone on FPGAs specifically and are also of interest more widely in

generate insights from sensor data streaming in, but an important question
given the severe performance and power constraints that these must operate
under is that of the most suitable CPU architecture. One class of device that
we believe has a significant role to play here is that of micro-cores, which
combine many simple low-power cores in a single chip. However, there are many
to choose from, and an important question is which is most suited to what
situation.

Local Group, but their low luminosity and surface brightness make similar work
in more distant galaxy groups challenging. Modern instrumentation unlocks the
possibility of scrutinizing these faint systems in other environments,
expanding the parameter space of group properties. We use MUSE spectroscopy to
study the properties of 14 known or suspected dSph satellites of Cen A. Twelve
targets are confirmed to be group members based on their radial velocities. Two
targets are background galaxies at 50 Mpc: KK 198 is a face-on spiral galaxy,
and dw1315-45 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy with an effective radius of 2300 pc.
The 12 confirmed dSph members of the Cen A group have old and metal-poor
stellar populations and follow the stellar metallicity-luminosity relation
defined by the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. In the three brightest dwarf
galaxies (KK 197, KKs 55, and KKs 58), we identify globular clusters, as well
as a planetary nebula in KK 197, although its association with this galaxy
and/or the extended halo of Cen A is uncertain. Using four discrete tracers, we
measure the velocity dispersion and dynamical mass of KK 197. This dSph appears
dark matter dominated and lies on the radial acceleration relation of
star-forming galaxies within the uncertainties. It also is consistent with
predictions stemming from modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Surprisingly, in
the dwarf KK 203 we find an extended Halpha ring. Careful examination of Hubble
Space Telescope photometry reveals a very low level of star formation at ages
between 30-300 Myr. The Halpha emission is most likely linked to a 40 Myr old
supernova remnant, although other possibilities for its origin cannot be
entirely ruled out.

a $^{17}\text{B}+n+n$ model, triggered by a recent experiment showing that
$^{19}$B exhibits a well pronounced two-neutron halo structure. Preliminary
analysis of the experimental data was performed by employing contact $n$-$n$
interactions, which are known to underestimate the $s$-wave content in other
halo nuclei such as $^{11}$Li. In the present work, the three-body
hyperspherical formalism with finite-range two-body interactions is used to
describe $^{19}$B. In particular, two different finite-range $n$-$n$
interactions will be used, as well as a simple central Gaussian potential whose
range is progressively reduced. The purpose is to determine the main properties
of the nucleus and investigate how they change when using contact-like $n$-$n$
potentials. Special attention is also paid to the dependence on the
prescription used to account for three-body effects, i.e., a three-body force
or a density-dependent $n$-$n$ potential. We have found that the three-body
model plus finite-range potentials provide a description of $^{19}$B consistent
with the experimental data. The results are essentially independent of the
short-distance details of the two-body potentials, giving rise to an
$(s_{1/2})^2$ content of about 55%, clearly larger than the initial estimates.
Very little dependence has been found as well on the prescription used for the
three-body effects. The total computed $B(E1)$ strength is compatible with the
experimental result, although we slightly overestimate the data around the
low-energy peak of the $dB(E1)/d\varepsilon$ distribution. Finally, we show
that a reduction of the $n$-$n$ interaction range produces a significant
reduction of the $s$-wave contribution, which then should be expected in
calculations using contact interactions.

but it has systematically faded since 2007. Here, we report the discovery with
Swift of a sequence of bright and rapid X-ray flare events that reveal the
emergence of Mrk 335 from its ultra-deep multiyear low state. Results are based
on our dedicated multiyear monitoring with Swift. Unlike other bright AGN, the
optical-UV is generally not correlated with the X-rays in Mrk 335 on a
timescale of days to months. This fact either implies the absence of a direct
link between the two emission components; or else implies that the observed
X-rays are significantly affected by (dust-free) absorption along our l.o.s.
The UV and optical, however, are closely correlated at the 99.99 percent
confidence level. The UV is leading the optical by delta t = 1.5+/-1.5 d. The
Swift X-ray spectrum shows strong deviations from a single power law in all
brightness states of the outbursts, indicating that significant absorption or
reprocessing is taking place. Mrk 335 displays a softer-when-brighter
variability pattern at intermediate X-ray levels, which has been seen in our
Swift data since 2007 (based on a total of 590 observations). This pattern
breaks down at the highest and lowest count rates. We interpret the 2020
brightening of Mrk 335 as a decrease in column density and covering factor of a
partial-covering absorber along our line of sight in form of a clumpy
accretion-disk wind that reveals an increasing portion of the intrinsic
emission of Mrk 335 from the disk and/or corona region, while the optical
emission-line regions receive a less variable spectral energy distribution.
This then also explains why Mrk 335 was never seen to change its optical
Seyfert type (not 'changing look') despite its factor 50 X-ray variability with
Swift.

  an optical pattern","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can
spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as
the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a
promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various
diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the
conventionally applied 2D probes.
  Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of
PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system
and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an
optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition.
This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the
recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern.
This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one
common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of
PAT imaging data.
  Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom
data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited
for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision.
  Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT
reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware
nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a
valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.

constraints are enforced using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) regularization.
Our study is motivated by the observation that existing works on UOT have
mainly focused on regularization based on $\phi$-divergence (e.g., KL). The
role of MMD, which belongs to the complementary family of integral probability
metrics (IPMs), as a regularizer in the context of UOT seems to be less
understood. Our main result is based on Fenchel duality, using which we are
able to study the properties of MMD-regularized UOT (MMD-UOT). One interesting
outcome of this duality result is that MMD-UOT induces a novel metric over
measures, which again belongs to the IPM family. Further, we present
finite-sample-based convex programs for estimating MMD-UOT and the
corresponding barycenter. Under mild conditions, we prove that our
convex-program-based estimators are consistent, and the estimation error decays
at a rate $\mathcal{O}\left(m^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, where $m$ is the number
of samples from the source/target measures. Finally, we discuss how these
convex programs can be solved efficiently using (accelerated) projected
gradient descent. We conduct diverse experiments to show that MMD-UOT is a
promising alternative to $\phi$-divergence-regularized UOT in machine learning
applications.

saliency maps. Thus, a family of saliency methods provide an intuitive way to
identify input features with substantial influences on classifications or
latent concepts. Several modifications to conventional saliency maps, such as
Rectified Gradients and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), have been
introduced to allegedly denoise and improve interpretability. While visually
coherent in certain cases, Rectified Gradients and other modified saliency maps
introduce a strong input bias (e.g., brightness in the RGB space) because of
inappropriate uses of the input features. We demonstrate that dark areas of an
input image are not highlighted by a saliency map using Rectified Gradients,
even if it is relevant for the class or concept. Even in the scaled images, the
input bias exists around an artificial point in color spectrum. Our
modification, which simply eliminates multiplication with input features,
removes this bias. This showcases how a visual criteria may not align with true

Channel-Exchanging-Network (CEN), a parameter-free multimodal fusion framework

individual channel importance that is measured by the magnitude of
Batch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor during training. The validity of such
exchanging process is also guaranteed by sharing convolutional filters yet
keeping separate BN layers across modalities, which, as an add-on benefit,
allows our multimodal architecture to be almost as compact as a unimodal
network. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation via RGB-D data and

zero mode state, poses a fundamental problem towards the realization of
Majorana-based quantum computation. Parafermions, a natural generalization of
Majorana fermions, can encode topological qudits immune to quasiparticle
poisoning. While parafermions are expected to emerge in superconducting
fractional quantum Hall systems, they are not yet attainable with current
technology. To bypass this problem, we employ a photonic quantum simulator to
experimentally demonstrate the key components of parafermion-based universal
quantum computation. Our contributions in this article are twofold. First, by
manipulating the photonic states, we realize Clifford operator Berry phases
that correspond to braiding statistics of parafermions. Second, we investigate
the quantum contextuality in a topological system for the first time by
demonstrating the contextuality of parafermion encoded qudit states.
Importantly, we find that the topologically-encoded contextuality opens the way
to magic state distillation, while both the contextuality and the
braiding-induced Clifford gates are resilient against local noise. By
introducing contextuality, our photonic quantum simulation provides the first
step towards a physically robust methodology for realizing topological quantum
computation.

language processing and many other fields. A classic approach to sequence
labeling is linear chain conditional random fields (CRFs). When combined with
neural network encoders, they achieve very good performance in many sequence
labeling tasks. One limitation of linear chain CRFs is their inability to model
long-range dependencies between labels. High order CRFs extend linear chain
CRFs by modeling dependencies no longer than their order, but the computational
complexity grows exponentially in the order. In this paper, we propose the
Neural Latent Dependency Model (NLDM) that models dependencies of arbitrary
length between labels with a latent tree structure. We develop an end-to-end
training algorithm and a polynomial-time inference algorithm of our model. We
evaluate our model on both synthetic and real datasets and show that our model

Alperin-Goldschmidt Theorem for saturated fusion systems yields that $\mathcal

that an $\mathcal F$-essential subgroup is either an $\mathcal F$-pearl, or one

prove if $S$ is a $2$-group and can be read from the work of D'\iaz, Ruiz, and

non-exceptional maximal class $p$-groups respectively. As a corollary, we have
the easy to remember result that states that, if $O_p(\mathcal F)=1$, then
either $\mathcal F$ has $\mathcal F$-pearls or $S$ is isomorphic to a Sylow

frictional properties, and hence their mechanical stability. Such anisotropy is
only rarely studied in seismology models of fault slip, although it might be
paramount to understand the seismic rupture in particular areas, notably where
slip occurs in a direction different from that of the main striations of the
fault. To quantify how the anisotropy of fault surfaces affects the friction
coefficient during sliding, we sheared synthetic fault planes made of plaster
of Paris. These fault planes were produced by 3D-printing real striated fault
surfaces whose 3D roughness was measured in the field at spatial scales from
millimeters to meters. Here, we show how the 3D-printing technology can help
for the study of frictional slip. Results show that fault anisotropy controls
the coefficient of static friction, with the friction coefficient along the
striations being three to four times smaller than the friction coefficient
along the direction perpendicular to the striations. This is true both at the
meter and the millimeter scales. The anisotropy in friction and the average
coefficient of static friction are also shown to decrease with the normal
stress applied to the faults, as a result of the increased surface wear under
increased loading.

stars build up mass in bursts. The burst mode of star formation scenario
proposes that the stars grow in mass via episodic accretion of fragments
migrating from their gravitationally-unstable circumstellar discs and it
naturally explains the existence of observed pre-main-sequence bursts from high
mass protostars. We present a parameter study of hydrodynamical models of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) that explores the initial masses of the
collapsing clouds (Mc = 60-200Mo) and ratio of rotational-to-gravitational
energies (beta = 0:005-0:33). An increase in Mc and/or beta produces
protostellar accretion discs that are more prone to develop gravitational
instability and to experience bursts. We find that all MYSOs have bursts even
if their pre-stellar core is such that beta <= 0.01. Within our assumptions,
the lack of stable discs is therefore a major difference between low- and
high-mass star formation mechanisms. All our disc masses and disk-to-star mass
ratios Md=M* > 1 scale as a power-law with the stellar mass. Our results
confirm that massive protostars accrete about 40-60% of their mass in the burst
mode. The distribution of time periods between two consecutive bursts is
bimodal: there is a short duration (~ 1-10 yr) peak corresponding to the short,
faintest bursts and a long duration peak (at ~ 10^3-10^4 yr) corresponding to
the long, FU-Orionis-type bursts appearing in later disc evolution, i.e.,
around 30 kyr after disc formation. We discuss this bimodality in the context
of the structure of massive protostellar jets as potential signatures of
accretion burst history.

the spot models. In the former, on-demand VMs are allocated for a fixed cost
per time unit, and their availability is ensured during the whole execution. On
the other hand, in the spot market, VMs are offered with a huge discount when
compared to the on-demand VMs, but their availability fluctuates according to
the cloud's current demand that can terminate or hibernate a spot VM at any
time. Furthermore, in order to cope with workload variations, cloud providers
have also introduced the concept of burstable VMs which are able to burst up
their respective baseline CPU performance during a limited period of time with
an up to 20% discount when compared to an equivalent non-burstable on-demand
VMs. In the current work, we present the Burst Hibernation-Aware Dynamic
Scheduler (Burst-HADS), a framework that schedules and executes tasks of
Bag-of-Tasks applications with deadline constraints by exploiting spot and
on-demand burstable VMs, aiming at minimizing both the monetary cost and the

migrating tasks of a hibernated spot VM or by performing work-stealing when VMs
become idle. Performance results on Amazon EC2 cloud with different

on-demand instances, Burst-HADS reduces the monetary cost of the execution and
meet the application deadline even in scenarios with high spot hibernation
rates. It also reduces the total execution time when compared to a solution

Grounding (HC-STVG). Unlike the existing referring expression tasks in images

tube of the target person from an untrimmed video based on a given textural

security-related applications, where the surveillance videos can be extremely
long but only a specific person during a specific period of time is concerned.
HC-STVG is a video grounding task that requires both spatial (where) and
temporal (when) localization. Unfortunately, the existing grounding methods
cannot handle this task well. We tackle this task by proposing an effective
baseline method named Spatio-Temporal Grounding with Visual Transformers
(STGVT), which utilizes Visual Transformers to extract cross-modal
representations for video-sentence matching and temporal localization. To
facilitate this task, we also contribute an HC-STVG dataset consisting of 5,660
video-sentence pairs on complex multi-person scenes. Specifically, each video
lasts for 20 seconds, pairing with a natural query sentence with an average of
17.25 words. Extensive experiments are conducted on this dataset, demonstrating
the newly-proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods.

We also investigate the effects of the speed of ICMEs relative to the solar

evolution does not impact the generic features of ICMEs, there are more extreme

energy integral consists of four terms: The coupling of polarization to an

polarization. A local function of density accounts for the mechanical state of
the fluid. Viewed as a non-equilibrium free energy functional of number density
and polarization, minimization in these two densities under constraints of the
Maxwell field equations should lead the correct equilibrium state. The
alternative is a continuum mechanics approach in which the mechanical degree of

electromechanics method leads to a force balance equation which is consistent
with the density functional equilibrium equation. The continuum mechanics
procedure is significantly more demanding. The gain is a well defined pressure

In contrast to previous work, we use latent code predictions as our anomaly

prediction-based methods on different benchmark datasets both in terms of
accuracy and robustness against changing lighting and weather conditions. By
decoupling an appearance and a motion model, our model can also process 16 to
45 times more frames per second than related approaches which makes our model

challenging subjects in nuclear physics. It is necessary to evaluate the
collective potential and the collective inertia along a fission path for a
description of quantum tunneling in spontaneous or low-energy fission. In past
studies of the fission dynamics based on nuclear energy density functional
(EDF) theory, the collective inertia has been evaluated with the cranking
approximation, which neglects dynamical residual effects. Purpose: The purpose
is to provide a reliable and efficient method to include dynamical residual
effects in the collective inertia for fission dynamics. Methods: We use the
local quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA) to evaluate the
collective inertia along a fission path obtained by the constrained
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with the Skyrme EDF. The finite-amplitude method
(FAM) with a contour integration technique enables us to efficiently compute
the collective inertia in a large model space. Results: We evaluate the
FAM-QRPA collective inertia along a symmetric fission path in $^{240}$Pu and
$^{256}$Fm. The FAM-QRPA inertia is significantly larger than the one of the
cranking approximation, and shows pronounced peaks around the ground state and
the fission isomer. This is due to dynamical residual effects. Conclusions: To
describe the spontaneous or low-energy fission, we provide a reliable and
efficient method to construct the collective inertia with dynamical residual
effects that have been neglected in most of EDF-based works in the past. We
show the importance of dynamical residual effects to the collective inertia.
This work will be a starting point for a systematic study of fission dynamics
in heavy and superheavy nuclei to microscopically describe the nuclear
large-amplitude collective motions.

development of the improved model of user similarity coefficients calculation
for recommendation systems to optimize the time of forming recommendation

user preferences of a recommendation system by comparing their similarity
coefficients in time, to investigate which distribution function describes the
changes of similarity coefficients of users in time. The methods used are:
graph theory, probability theory, radioactivity theory, algorithm theory.
Conclusions. In the course of the researches, the model of user similarity
coefficients calculating for the recommendation systems has been improved. The
model differs from the known ones in that it takes into account the
recalculation period of similarity coefficients for the individual user and
average recalculation period of similarity coefficients for all users of the
system or a specific group of users. The software has been developed, in which
a series of experiments was conducted to test the effectiveness of the
developed method. The conducted experiments showed that the developed method in
general increases the quality of the recommendation system without significant
fluctuations of Precision and Recall of the system. Precision and Recall can
decrease slightly or increase, depending on the characteristics of the incoming
data set. The use of the proposed solutions will increase the application
period of the previously calculated similarity coefficients of users for the
prediction of preferences without their recalculation and, accordingly, it will
shorten the time of formation and issuance of recommendation lists up to 2
times.

extracting negative signals. However, such an optimisation strategy can lead to
biased results toward already popular items by frequently handling new items as

augments labelled samples through pseudo-labelling. Our approach aggressively
employs unobserved samples as positive instances and brings new items into the
spotlight. To avoid exhaustive label assignments to all possible pairs of users

We also utilise an improved negative sampling strategy and thereby suppress the

  Furthermore, we study \emph{bi-chromatic} variants of these parameters
defined on a graph whose vertices are colored either red or blue, and one

Motivated by applications in computational geometry, bi-chromatic diameter,
radius and eccentricities have been recently studied in the sequential setting
[Backurs et al. STOC'18, Dalirrooyfard et al. ICALP'19]. We provide the first

\emph{approximate pseudo-center}, which extends the \emph{pseudo-centers} of

calibrating a statistic by fixing the dimension $d$ while letting the sample
size $n$ increase to infinity. Recently, much effort has been dedicated towards
understanding how these methods behave in high-dimensional settings, where $d$
and $n$ both increase to infinity together. This often leads to different
inference procedures, depending on the assumptions about the dimensionality,
leaving the practitioner in a bind: given a dataset with 100 samples in 20
dimensions, should they calibrate by assuming $n \gg d$, or $d/n \approx 0.2$?
This paper considers the goal of dimension-agnostic inference; developing
methods whose validity does not depend on any assumption on $d$ versus $n$. We
introduce an approach that uses variational representations of existing test
statistics along with sample splitting and self-normalization to produce a
refined test statistic with a Gaussian limiting distribution, regardless of how
$d$ scales with $n$. The resulting statistic can be viewed as a careful
modification of degenerate U-statistics, dropping diagonal blocks and retaining
off-diagonal blocks. We exemplify our technique for some classical problems
including one-sample mean and covariance testing, and show that our tests have
minimax rate-optimal power against appropriate local alternatives. In most
settings, our cross U-statistic matches the high-dimensional power of the
corresponding (degenerate) U-statistic up to a $\sqrt{2}$ factor.

used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past
observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future
traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of
data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.

propose a new method to efficiently build a surrogate by sampling approximately
from the posterior distribution of neural network weights, which represents the
belief about the value of each parameter. Our extensive experiments on
ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and MNIST show that our approach improves the success rates
of four state-of-the-art attacks significantly (up to 83.2 percentage points),
in both intra-architecture and inter-architecture transferability. On ImageNet,
our approach can reach 94% of success rate while reducing training computations
from 11.6 to 2.4 exaflops, compared to an ensemble of independently trained
DNNs. Our vanilla surrogate achieves 87.5% of the time higher transferability
than three test-time techniques designed for this purpose. Our work
demonstrates that the way to train a surrogate has been overlooked, although it
is an important element of transfer-based attacks. We are, therefore, the first
to review the effectiveness of several training methods in increasing
transferability. We provide new directions to better understand the

dimension of $G$ is the dimension of the span of the characteristic vectors of
the minimum cuts of $G$, viewed as vectors in $\{0,1\}^m$. For every $n \ge 2$
we show that the cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is at most $2n-3$, and
construct graphs realizing this bound.
  The cut dimension was recently defined by Graur et al.\ \cite{GPRW20}, who
show that the maximum cut dimension of an $n$-vertex graph is a lower bound on
the number of cut queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to solve the
minimum cut problem on $n$-vertex graphs. For every $n\ge 2$, Graur et al.\
exhibit a graph on $n$ vertices with cut dimension at least $3n/2 -2$, giving
the first lower bound larger than $n$ on the deterministic cut query complexity
of computing mincut. We observe that the cut dimension is even a lower bound on
the number of \emph{linear} queries needed by a deterministic algorithm to
solve mincut, where a linear query can ask any vector $x \in
\mathbb{R}^{\binom{n}{2}}$ and receives the answer $w^T x$. Our results thus
show a lower bound of $2n-3$ on the number of linear queries needed by a
deterministic algorithm to solve minimum cut on $n$-vertex graphs, and imply
that one cannot show a lower bound larger than this via the cut dimension.
  We further introduce a generalization of the cut dimension which we call the
$\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension. The $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension is
also a lower bound on the number of linear queries needed by a deterministic
algorithm to compute minimum cut. It is always at least as large as the cut
dimension, and we construct an infinite family of graphs on $n=3k+1$ vertices
with $\ell_1$-approximate cut dimension $2n-2$, showing that it can be strictly
larger than the cut dimension.

when it impinges on a supersolvophobic surface. This work investigates
impacting dynamics of a droplet of dilute polymer solution depending on the
molecular weight and the concentration of the polymer by using multi-body
dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Either the longer polymer or the
high polymer concentration suppresses rebound of a droplet although its shear
viscosity and the liquid-vapor surface tension are not different from those of
a pure solvent droplet. We found a new mechanism of the anti-rebound in which
the resistance is applied against the hopping motion, while behavior of the
non-rebounding droplet at the earlier spreading and retraction stages is same
as for the rebounding droplets. Two polymer contributions to reducing the
rebound tendency are quantitatively analyzed: the alteration of the substrate
wettability by the polymer adsorption and the polymer elongation force.

high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are analyzed by a high-resolution
MAC-E filter down to 40 eV below the endpoint at 18.57 keV. We consider the
framework with three active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino of mass $m_{4}$.
The analysis is sensitive to a fourth mass state $m^2_{4} \lesssim$ 1000 eV$^2$
and to active-to-sterile neutrino mixing down to $|U_{e4}|^2 \gtrsim
2\cdot10^{-2}$. No significant spectral distortion is observed and exclusion
bounds on the sterile mass and mixing are reported. These new limits supersede
the Mainz results and improve the Troitsk bound for $m^2_{4} <$ 30 eV$^2$. The
reactor and gallium anomalies are constrained for $ 100 < \Delta{m}^2_{41} <

Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images due to the scarcity of
training data and the inference of speckle noises. The Gaofen contest has
provided open access of a high-quality PolSAR semantic segmentation dataset.
Taking this chance, we propose a Multi-path ResNet (MP-ResNet) architecture for
the semantic segmentation of high-resolution PolSAR images. Compared to
conventional U-shape encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures, the MP-ResNet learns semantic context with its parallel
multi-scale branches, which greatly enlarges its valid receptive fields and
improves the embedding of local discriminative features. In addition, MP-ResNet
adopts a multi-level feature fusion design in its decoder to make the best use
of the features learned from its different branches. Ablation studies show that
the MPResNet has significant advantages over its baseline method (FCN with
ResNet34). It also surpasses several classic state-of-the-art methods in terms
of overall accuracy (OA), mean F1 and fwIoU, whereas its computational costs
are not much increased. This CNN architecture can be used as a baseline method
for future studies on the semantic segmentation of PolSAR images. The code is
available at: https://github.com/ggsDing/SARSeg.

characterize the phonon properties of honeycomb bilayers with group theory and

Floquet quasienergy spectrum associated with the time-dependent model exactly.
We introduce a general scheme to disentangle the complex low-frequency Floquet
spectrum to elucidate the relevant Floquet bands. As a prototypical example, we
consider bilayer graphene. We find that light in the low-frequency regime can
induce a bandgap in the quasienergy spectrum in the vicinity of the K points
even if it is linearly polarized, in contrast with the expectations within the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the high-frequency regime. Finally, we
analyze the diabaticity of the driven electron and driven phonon processes and
found contrasting effects on the autocorrelation functions at the same driving
frequency: driven phonons preserve the character of the initial state while
driven electrons exhibit strong deviations within a few drive cycles. The
procedure outlined here can be applied to other materials to describe the
combined effects of low-frequency light on phonons and electrons.

high-dimensional vectors or QR factorization. The proposed process can be less
computationally expensive than the classical Gram-Schmidt process while being
at least as numerically stable as the modified Gram-Schmidt process. Our
approach is based on random sketching, which is a dimension reduction technique
consisting in estimation of inner products of high-dimensional vectors by inner
products of their small efficiently-computable random images, so-called
sketches. In this way, an approximate orthogonality of the full vectors can be
obtained by orthogonalization of their sketches. The proposed Gram-Schmidt
algorithm can provide computational cost reduction in any architecture. The
benefit of random sketching can be amplified by performing the non-dominant
operations in higher precision. In this case the numerical stability can be
guaranteed with a working unit roundoff independent of the dimension of the
problem. The proposed Gram-Schmidt process can be applied to Arnoldi iteration
and result in new Krylov subspace methods for solving high-dimensional systems
of equations or eigenvalue problems. Among them we chose randomized GMRES
method as a practical application of the methodology.

design and evaluation of AMOD systems using simulation models. This paper adds
to this growing body of literature by investigating the network impacts of AMOD
through high-fidelity activity- and agent-based traffic simulation, including
detailed models of AMOD fleet operations. Through scenario simulations of the
entire island of Singapore, we explore network traffic dynamics by employing
the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Taking into account
the spatial variability of density, we are able to capture the hysteresis
loops, which inevitably form in a network of this size. Model estimation
results at both the vehicle and passenger flow level are documented.
Environmental impacts including energy and emissions are also discussed.
Findings from the case study of Singapore suggest that the introduction of AMOD
may bring about significant impacts on network performance in terms of
increased VKT, additional travel delay and energy consumption, while reducing
vehicle emissions, with respect to the baseline. Despite the increase in
network congestion, production of passenger flows remains relatively unchanged.

searches for their origins have focused primarily at TeV-PeV energies. Compared
to sub-TeV searches, high-energy searches benefit from an increase in the
neutrino cross section, improved angular resolution on the neutrino direction,
and a reduced background from atmospheric neutrinos and muons. However, the
focus on high energy does not preclude the existence of sub-TeV neutrino
emission where IceCube retains sensitivity. Here we present the first
all-flavor search from IceCube for transient emission of low-energy neutrinos,
focusing on the energy region of 5.6-100 GeV using three years of data obtained
with the IceCube-DeepCore detector. We find no evidence of transient neutrino
emission in the data, thus leading to a constraint on the volumetric rate of
astrophysical transient sources in the range of $\sim 705-2301\,

machine learning on graphs. Inspired by the success of neural networks, a line
of research has been conducted to train GNNs to deal with various tasks, such
as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. In this
work, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have
been proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is
whether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models.
  In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet
loss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space
vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different
classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a
classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is
generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five
GNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy

(GR) are possible only if matter threading the wormhole throat is
""exotic""---i.e., violates a number of energy conditions. For this reason, it is
impossible to construct {static} wormholes supported only by dust-like matter
which satisfies all usual energy conditions. However, this is not the case for
non-static configurations. In 1934, Tolman found a general solution describing
the evolution of a spherical dust shell in GR. In this particular case,
Tolman's solution describes the collapsing dust ball; the inner space--time
structure of the ball corresponds to the Friedmann universe filled by a dust.
In the present work we use the general Tolman's solution in order to construct
a dynamic spherically symmetric wormhole solution in GR with dust-like matter.
The solution constructed represents the collapsing dust ball with the inner
wormhole space--time structure. It is worth noting that, with the dust-like
matter, the ball is made of satisfies the usual energy conditions and cannot
prevent the collapse. We discuss in detail the properties of the collapsing
dust wormhole.

can turn the topological semimetal into a topologically nontrivial Mott
insulating phase. We investigate an experimentally motivated model for Weyl
physics of cold atoms in optical lattices, with the main focus on interaction
effects and topological properties by means of dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT). We characterize topological phases by numerically evaluating the Chern
number via the Ishsikawa-Matsuyama formula for interacting phases. Within our
studies, we find that the Chern numbers become trivial when interactions lead
to insulating behavior. For a deeper understanding of the
Weyl-semimetal-to-Mott-insulator topological phase transition, we evaluate the
topological properties of quasiparticle bands as well as so-called blind bands.
Our study is complementary to recent studies of Weyl semimetals with DMFT.

limitations, and the consequent experimental trade-offs between signal-to-noise
ratio, acquisition speed, and imaging depth exacerbate the problem. Denoising
is, therefore, an essential part of any image processing pipeline, and
convolutional neural networks are currently the method of choice for this task.
One popular approach, Noise2Noise, does not require clean ground truth, and
instead, uses a second noisy copy as a training target. Self-supervised
methods, like Noise2Self and Noise2Void, relax data requirements by learning
the signal without an explicit target but are limited by the lack of
information in a single image. Here, we introduce Noise2Stack, an extension of
the Noise2Noise method to image stacks that takes advantage of a shared signal
between spatially neighboring planes. Our experiments on magnetic resonance
brain scans and newly acquired multiplane microscopy data show that learning
only from image neighbors in a stack is sufficient to outperform Noise2Noise
and Noise2Void and close the gap to supervised denoising methods. Our findings
point towards low-cost, high-reward improvement in the denoising pipeline of
multiplane biomedical images. As a part of this work, we release a microscopy

evidence from practitioners about their perception of the relevance of RE
research and at understanding the factors that influence that perception. We

primarily related to the relevance of the problem and the soundness of the

corresponding universal relation is well established. We find that the
quintessence terms play a very effective role in calculating the mass-charge
ratio and concept of weak gravity conjecture of black holes. We note here that
the added constant correction is inversely related to the entropy of the black

from the natural irreversible process of thermalization, in analogy with the

divergence of the thermodynamic equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans distribution, which
is responsible for the macroscopic population of the fundamental mode of the
system. However, achieving complete thermalization and condensation of
incoherent waves through nonlinear optical propagation is known to require
prohibitive large interaction lengths. Here, we derive a discrete kinetic
equation describing the nonequilibrium evolution of the random wave in the
presence of a structural disorder of the medium. Our theory reveals that a weak
disorder accelerates the rate of thermalization and condensation by several
order of magnitudes. Such a counterintuitive dramatic acceleration of
condensation can provide a natural explanation for the recently discovered
phenomenon of optical beam self-cleaning. Our experiments in multimode optical
fibers report the observation of the transition from an incoherent thermal
distribution to wave condensation, with a condensate fraction of up to 60% in

large number of user preferences for different items, there is a cold start
problem for a new user or item that has a significant impact on system
performance. The purpose of this paper is to design a movie recommender system
named TRSM-RS using users' demographic information (just users' gender) along
with the new weighted similarity measure. By segmenting users based on their
gender, the scalability problem is improved, and by considering the reliability
of the users' similarity as the weight in the new similarity measure (Tanimoto
Reliability Similarity Measure, TRSM), the effect of the cold-start problem is
undermined and the performance of the system is improved. Experiments were
performed on the MovieLens dataset and the system was evaluated using mean

learn graph representation without negative examples in an unsupervised manner.
In addition, we summarize three kinds of augmentation methods for

scrutinized in the hope of a quantum advantage. While graphs offer a convenient
framework for multiple real-world problems, their analytics still comes with
high computation and space. By mapping the graph data into a low dimensional
space, in which graph structural information is preserved, the eigenvectors of
the Laplacian matrix constitute a powerful node embedding, called Laplacian
Eigenmaps. Computing these embeddings is on its own an expensive task knowing
that using specific sparse methods, the eigendecomposition of a Laplacian
matrix has a cost of O($rn^2$), $r$ being the ratio of nonzero elements.
  We propose a method to compute a Laplacian Eigenmap using a quantum
variational circuit. The idea of our algorithm is to reach the eigenstates of
the laplacian matrix, which can be considered as a hamiltonian operator, by
adapting the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. By estimating the $d$
first eigenvectors of the Laplacian at the same time, our algorithm directly
generates a $d$ dimension quantum embedding of the graph. We demonstrate that
it is possible to use the embedding for graph machine learning tasks by
implementing a quantum classifier on the top of it. The overall circuit
consists in a full quantum node classification algorithm. Tests on 32 nodes
graph with a quantum simulator shows that we can achieve similar performances
as the classical laplacian eigenmap algorithm. Although mathematical properties
of this approximate approach are not fully understood, this algorithm opens
perspectives for graph pre-processing using noisy quantum computers.

consequence, our method can be easily generalized to any input image size and
pretrained CNNs. Thus, we present a detailed parameter study with respect to
the CNN base architectures and the effectiveness of different deep features. We

complexity theory which has inspired a rich body of work developed over more
than fifty years. The vast majority of this theory addresses asymptotic linear
stability around equilibrium points, but the idea of `stability' in fact has
other uses in the empirical ecological literature. The important notion of
`temporal stability' describes the character of fluctuations in population
dynamics, driven by intrinsic or extrinsic noise. Here we apply tools from
random matrix theory to the problem of temporal stability, deriving analytical
predictions for the fluctuation spectra of complex ecological networks. We show
that different network structures leave distinct signatures in the spectrum of

variability. Consequently, accurate measurements of hospital performance are
essential for various decision-makers, including patients, hospital managers
and health insurers. Hospital performance is assessed via the health outcomes
of their patients. However, as the risk profiles of patients between hospitals
vary, measuring hospital performance requires adjustment for patient risk. This
task is formalized in the state-of-the-art procedure through a hierarchical
generalized linear model, that isolates hospital fixed-effects from the effect
of patient risk on health outcomes. Due to the linear nature of this approach,
any non-linear relations or interaction terms between risk variables are
neglected.
  In this work, we propose a novel method for measuring hospital performance
adjusted for patient risk. This method captures non-linear relationships as
well as interactions among patient risk variables, specifically the effect of
co-occurring health conditions on health outcomes. For this purpose, we develop
a tailored neural network architecture that is partially interpretable: a
non-linear part is used to encode risk factors, while a linear structure models
hospital fixed-effects, such that the risk-adjusted hospital performance can be
estimated. We base our evaluation on more than 13 million patient admissions
across almost 1,900 US hospitals as provided by the Nationwide Readmissions
Database. Our model improves the ROC-AUC over the state-of-the-art by 4.1
percent. These findings demonstrate that a large portion of the variance in
health outcomes can be attributed to non-linear relationships between patient
risk variables and implicate that the current approach of measuring hospital
performance should be expanded.

Using phase Doppler interferometry, we observe that the modifications of the
settling velocity of inertial particles, under homogeneous isotropic turbulence
and dilute conditions $\phi_v\leq O(10)^{-5}$, is controlled by the
Taylor-based Reynolds number $Re_\lambda$ of the carrier flow. On the contrary,
we did not find a strong influence of the ratio between the fluid and gravity
accelerations (i.e., $\gamma\sim(\eta/\tau_\eta^2)/g$) on the particle settling
behavior. Remarkably, our results suggest that the hindering of the settling
velocity (i.e. the measured particle settling velocity is smaller than its
respective one in still fluid conditions) experienced by the particles
increases with the value of $Re_\lambda$, reversing settling enhancement found
under intermediate $Re_\lambda$ conditions. This observation applies to all
particle sizes investigated, and it is consistent with previous experimental
data in the literature. At the highest $Re_\lambda$ studied, $Re_\lambda>600$,
the particle enhancement regime ceases to exist. Our data also show that for
moderate Rouse numbers, the difference between the measured particle settling
velocity and its velocity in still fluid conditions scales linearly with Rouse,
when this difference is normalized by the carrier phase rms fluctuations, i.e.,
$(V_p-V_T)/u\sim -Ro$.

disease. From the perspective of agriculture, diagnosing plant disease is
crucial, as diseases often limit plants' production capacity. However, manual
approaches to recognize plant diseases are often temporal, challenging, and
time-consuming. Therefore, computerized recognition of plant diseases is highly
desired in the field of agricultural automation. Due to the recent improvement
of computer vision, identifying diseases using leaf images of a particular
plant has already been introduced. Nevertheless, the most introduced model can
only diagnose diseases of a specific plant. Hence, in this chapter, we
investigate an optimal plant disease identification model combining the
diagnosis of multiple plants. Despite relying on multi-class classification,
the model inherits a multilabel classification method to identify the plant and
the type of disease in parallel. For the experiment and evaluation, we
collected data from various online sources that included leaf images of six
plants, including tomato, potato, rice, corn, grape, and apple. In our
investigation, we implement numerous popular convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures. The experimental results validate that the Xception and DenseNet
architectures perform better in multi-label plant disease classification tasks.
Through architectural investigation, we imply that skip connections, spatial
convolutions, and shorter hidden layer connectivity cause better results in

supported on the graph of a function from partial knowledge of its moments, as
for instance in some problems of optimal transport or density estimation. We
show that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function, namely
linear measurements, is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other
moments by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relax-ations (viewed as moment
matrix completion problems) with a specific sparsity inducing criterion related
to a weighted 1-norm of the moment sequence of the measure. The resulting
sequence of optimal solutions converges to the whole moment sequence of the
measure which is shown to be the unique optimal solution of a certain
infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem (LP). Then one may recover the
function by a recent extraction algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux
kernel associated with the measure. Finally, the support of such a measure
supported on a graph is a meager, very thin (hence sparse) set. Therefore the
LP on measures with this sparsity inducing criterion can be interpreted as an
analogue for infinite-dimensional signals of the LP in super-resolution for
(sparse) atomic signals. In data science, it is often relevant to process
moments of a signal instead of the signal itself. For complex valued signals,
the moments are Fourier coefficients, and many filtering operations are
efficiently carried out in the sequence of moments. In numerical approximation
algorithms, many operations on real valued signals are more efficiently
implemented in their sequence of Chebyshev coefficients [19]. In the moment-SOS
hierarchy approach, many nonlinear nonconvex problems are reformulated and
solved approximately in the sequence of moments; see [13, 12] and references
therein. Once moments or approximate moments have been computed, one is faced
with the inverse problem of reconstructing the signal from its moments. The
recent work [15] describes an algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux
kernel, to recover the graph of a function from knowledge of its moments. Its
novelty (and distinguishing feature) is to approximate the graph of the
function (rather than the function itself) with a semialgebraic function
(namely a minimizer of a sum of squares of polynomials) with L 1 and pointwise
convergence guarantees for an increasing number of input moments. In

valuable. In the present article, I intend to recall the main aspects of his
work related to Wigner $3j$ symbols. It is well known that the latter can be
expressed with a hypergeometric series. The polynomial zeros of the $3j$
coefficients were initially characterized by the number of terms of the series
minus one, which is the degree of the coefficient. A detailed study of the
zeros of the $3j$ coefficient with respect to the degree $n$ for $J = a + b + c
\leq 240$ ($a$, $b$ and $c$ being the angular momenta in the first line of the
$3j$ symbol) by Raynal revealed that most zeros of high degree had small
magnetic quantum numbers. This led him to define the order $m$ to improve the
classification of the zeros of the $3j$ coefficient. Raynal did a search for
the polynomial zeros of degree 1 to 7 and found that the number of zeros of
degree 1 and 2 are infinite, though the number of zeros of degree larger than 3
decreases very quickly as the degree increases. Based on Whipple's
transformations of hypergeometric $_3F_2$ functions with unit argument, Raynal
generalized the Wigner $3j$ symbols to any arguments and pointed out that there
are twelve sets of ten formulas (twelve sets of 120 generalized $3j$ symbols)
which are equivalent in the usual case. In this paper, we also discuss other
aspects of the zeros of $3j$ coefficients, such as the role of Diophantine
equations and powerful numbers, or the alternative approach involving Labarthe
patterns.

demands in ways to compute more elaborate paths. In particular, there exists a
clear need in computing and deploying Delay-Constrained Least-Cost paths (DCLC)

However, most current DCLC solutions are heuristics not specifically tailored

The second method, which is generally more efficient than the first method, is
suitable for situations in which the number of strata is fixed with their sizes

application, the constellation provides a multi-hop backhaul that connects a

arrangement, consisting of three pairs of mutually perpendicular lines, does
not give rise to a ""very generic or sufficiently general"" discriminantal
arrangement in the sense of C. A. Athanasiadis \cite{MR1720104}. We give two
proofs of the first result. The second result is as follows. The
codimension-one boundary faces of (a region) a convex cone of a very generic
discriminantal arrangement has not been characterized and is not known even
though the intersection lattice of a very generic discriminantal arrangement is
known. So secondly, we show that the number of simplex cells of the very
generic hyperplane arrangement
$\mathcal{H}^m_n=\{H_i:\underset{j=1}{\overset{m}{\sum}}a_{ij}x_j=c_i,1\leq
i\leq n\}$ may not be not precisely equal to the number of codimension-one
boundary hyperplanes of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of the convex cone $C$ containing
$(c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n)$ in the associated very generic discriminantal
arrangement. That is, for $1\leq i_1<i_2<\ldots<i_m<i_{m+1}\leq n$, if
$\Delta^m H_{i_1}H_{i_2}\ldots H_{i_m}H_{i_{m+1}}$ is a simplex cell of the
hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{H}^m_n$ then it need not give rise to a
codimension-one boundary hyperplane of the convex cone $C$ containing
$(c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n)$ in the associated very generic discriminantal
arrangement. We finally mention an interesting open-ended remark before the
appendix section.
  In the appendix section we give a self contained exposition and describe
combinatorially the intersection lattice of a (Zariski open and dense) class of
""very generic or sufficiently general"" discriminantal arrangements. As a
consequence, we give a geometric description of the lattice elements as sets of
concurrencies of the hyperplane arrangements which give the same ""very generic

novel flux-modifiers and interface seeding routines that enable the application
of different material boundary conditions. The method allows for slip boundary

Furthermore, the new method allows for the generation of new interfaces in a

improve the system performance, in this paper, we adopt a deep transfer
learning (DTL) approach to implicitly extract the features of communication
channel and directly recover tag symbols. Inspired by the powerful capability
of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in exploring the features of data in a
matrix form, we design a novel covariance matrix aware neural network
(CMNet)-based detection scheme to facilitate DTL for tag signal detection,
which consists of offline learning, transfer learning, and online detection.
Specifically, a CMNet-based likelihood ratio test (CMNet-LRT) is derived based
on the minimum error probability (MEP) criterion. Taking advantage of the
outstanding performance of DTL in transferring knowledge with only a few
training data, the proposed scheme can adaptively fine-tune the detector for
different channel environments to further improve the detection performance.
Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the BER performance of
the proposed method is comparable to that of the optimal detection method with
perfect CSI.

vulnerable to various inference and reconstruction attacks where a malicious
entity can learn private information about the participants' training data from
the captured gradients. Differential Privacy is used to obtain theoretically
sound privacy guarantees against such inference attacks by noising the
exchanged update vectors. However, the added noise is proportional to the model
size which can be very large with modern neural networks. This can result in
poor model quality. In this paper, compressive sensing is used to reduce the
model size and hence increase model quality without sacrificing privacy. We
show experimentally, using 2 datasets, that our privacy-preserving proposal can

of the systems of computer mathematics (SCM) is considered as the special kind
of learning software. The lists of the special mathematical operations,
functions and methods used within the structure of modern SCM are examined.
Web-SCM properties are considered as general and specific. The cloud-based SCM
are taken as the special stage of Web-SCM development. The criteria for an
appropriate cloud service selection to support the process of mathematics
disciplines learning are revealed. The key features of the CoCalc cloud service
use are considered in concern to the proposed selection criteria: the available
computing capacities, the diversity of tools for training and its control, the
possibility of increasing the computing capability, the openness of the program
code, the availability of tools for joint editing. The results of the
experimental testing of CoCalc use in the process of mathematics teachers
training are described. Besides, the discussion covering the issues of
integration and compatibility with the other tools and services used for
mathematics learning (on the example of Octave) is presented. The main trends
of the CoCalc cloud service introduction into the training process and the
prospects for further research are revealed.

theoretical physics, and mathematical physics. They appeared in the nineteenth
century as solutions of equations in mathematical physics, particularly partial
differential equations of order two and four. Their knowledge is essential for
the proper handling and understanding of current problems in physics. They are
also related to the art of scientific computing in physics and mathematics.
Special functions are included in many computer algebra software such as
Matlab, Mathematica, and Maple, and students are strongly encouraged to take
part in this development which has become indispensable for the treatment of
almost all current problems in physics. The manuscript contains six chapters:
gamma and beta functions, Bessel functions, Fresnel error, and integral
function, exponential integral, sine integral, cosine integral, and logarithm
integral, orthogonal polynomials, and finally hypergeometric functions.

methods have the potential to accelerate the MRI acquisition process.
Nevertheless, the scientific community lacks appropriate benchmarks to assess
MRI reconstruction quality of high-resolution brain images, and evaluate how
these proposed algorithms will behave in the presence of small, but expected
data distribution shifts. The Multi-Coil Magnetic Resonance Image (MC-MRI)
Reconstruction Challenge provides a benchmark that aims at addressing these
issues, using a large dataset of high-resolution, three-dimensional,
T1-weighted MRI scans. The challenge has two primary goals: 1) to compare
different MRI reconstruction models on this dataset and 2) to assess the
generalizability of these models to data acquired with a different number of
receiver coils. In this paper, we describe the challenge experimental design,
and summarize the results of a set of baseline and state of the art brain MRI
reconstruction models. We provide relevant comparative information on the
current MRI reconstruction state-of-the-art and highlight the challenges of
obtaining generalizable models that are required prior to broader clinical
adoption. The MC-MRI benchmark data, evaluation code and current challenge
leaderboard are publicly available. They provide an objective performance
assessment for future developments in the field of brain MRI reconstruction.

time-consuming electronic-structure calculations, enabling accurate simulations
of greater size, time scale and complexity. Given the interpolative nature of
these models, the reliability of predictions depends on the position in phase
space, and it is crucial to obtain an estimate of the error that derives from
the finite number of reference structures included during the training of the
model. When using a machine-learning potential to sample a finite-temperature
ensemble, the uncertainty on individual configurations translates into an error
on thermodynamic averages, and provides an indication for the loss of accuracy
when the simulation enters a previously unexplored region. Here we discuss how
uncertainty quantification can be used, together with a baseline energy model,
or a more robust although less accurate interatomic potential, to obtain more
resilient simulations and to support active-learning strategies. Furthermore,
we introduce an on-the-fly reweighing scheme that makes it possible to estimate
the uncertainty in the thermodynamic averages extracted from long trajectories.
We present examples covering different types of structural and thermodynamic
properties, and systems as diverse as water and liquid gallium.

that it is extremely difficult to establish a communication link using
conventional technology due to many impairments typically associated with the
propagation medium and increased signal scattering. Specifically, underwater
and underground media are known to absorb electromagnetic radiation, which
heavily affects the overall path loss. Industrial and disaster environments can
be viewed as rich scattering environments with corresponding substantial
multipath propagation leading to intersymbol interference and deterioration of
signal quality. Although the challenges for the design of communication
networks, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), in such environments
are known, there is no common enabler or solution for all these applications.
Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced to improve the
signal propagation characteristics by focusing the signal power in the
preferred direction, thus making the communication environment 'smart'. While
the usual application of RIS is related to blockage avoidance, the very same
technique can be used to reduce the effect of multipath and even partially
compensate the signal absorption via passive beamforming. Due to the beneficial
properties of RIS, its use in challenging environments can become the
aforementioned enabler and a game changing technology. In this paper, we
discuss potential use cases, deployment strategies and design aspects for RIS
devices in underwater IoT, underground IoT as well as Industry 4.0 and
emergency networks. Furthermore, we provide a potential hardware architecture
and derive the expected signal quality. The numerical results reveal
substantial performance gains of up to 20 dB per decade. In addition, novel
research challenges to be addressed in this context are described.

few N(2D) reactions have been studied over the appropriate low temperature
range. During the present work, rate constants were measured for the N(2D) +
ethene (C2H4) reaction using a supersonic flow reactor at temperatures between
50 K and 296 K. Here, a chemical reaction was used to generate N(2D) atoms,
which were detected directly by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum
ultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants displayed very
little variation as a function of temperature, with substantially larger values
than those obtained in previous work. Indeed, considering an average
temperature of 170 K for the atmosphere of Titan leads to a rate constant that
is almost seven times larger than the currently recommended value. In parallel,
electronic structure calculations were performed to provide insight into the
reactive process. While earlier theoretical work at a lower level predicted the
presence of a barrier for the N(2D) + C2H4 reaction, the present calculations
demonstrate that two of the five doublet potential energy surfaces correlating
with reagents are likely to be attractive, presenting no barriers for the
perpendicular approach of the N atom to the carbon double bond of ethene. The
measured rate constants and new product channels taken from recent dynamical
investigations of this process are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model
