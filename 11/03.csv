critical input for various fields of physics, including nuclear physics,
nuclear astrophysics, atomic physics and their applications. In atomic nuclei,
the level density is a fundamental measure of their complex structure at
relatively high energies. Here we present the first model-independent
measurement of the absolute partial nuclear level density for a short-lived
unstable nucleus. For this purpose, we introduce the ``Shape method'' to
extract the shape of the $\gamma$-ray strength function. Combining the Shape
method with the existing $\beta$-Oslo technique allows the extraction of the
nuclear level density without the need for theoretical input. We benchmark the
Shape method using results for the stable $^{76}$Ge nucleus, finding an
excellent agreement to previous experimental results. We apply the Shape method
to new experimental data on the short-lived $^{88}$Kr nucleus. Our method opens
the door for measurements of the nuclear level density and $\gamma$-ray
strength function far away from stability, a pivotal input required to
understand the role of exotic nuclei in forming the cosmos.

illumination and can thus be used for photomechanical actuation. This is
attractive since it can be affected at a distance, different frequencies can be
used to actuate different modes and to sense, and corrosion-free lightweight
fiber optic cables can deliver significant power over long distances. The
strategy for developing new photomechanical materials is to first develop
photoactive molecules in solution, and then to incorporate these in the
solid-state either by crystallization or by inserting them into polymers. This
letter shows that the kinetics and the nature of the photo-induced phase
transitions are profoundly different in single molecules (solution) and in the
solid state using a lattice spin model. In solution, where the molecules act
independently, the photoreaction follows first-order kinetics. However, in the
solid state where the photoactive molecules interact with each other and
therefore behave collectively during reaction, photoreactions follow the
sigmoidal kinetics of nucleation and growth as in a first-order phase
transition. Further, we find that the exact nature of the photo-induced strain
has a critical effect on the kinetics, equilibrium, and microstructure
formation. These predictions agree qualitatively with experimental
observations, and provide insights for the development of new photoactive
materials.

find evidence of sub-hour variability from B2 1520+31, PKS 1502+106 and PKS
1424-41, with the remaining sources showing variability on timescales of a few
hours. These indicate gamma-ray emission from extremely compact regions in the
jet, potentially compatible with emission from within the broad line region
(BLR). The flare spectra show evidence of a spectral cut-off in 7 of the 18
flares studied, further supporting the argument for BLR emission in these

finds evidence for both BLR origin and emission from within the molecular torus

emission from all sources except 3C 279, 3C 454.3 and 4C 21.35 is incompatible

that the gamma-ray emission in the brightest FSRQs originates in multiple

the spin-orbit splitting at the nodes is larger than the nodal scattering rate,
and are complementary to vortex-induced oscillations identified previously. In
sufficiently anisotropic materials, the spin-orbit mechanism may be dominant.
As a particular application, we focus on the cuprate high-temperature

Rashba bilayers, in which individual CuO$_2$ layers lack inversion symmetry

spin-orbit coupling endows $\kappa_{xx}/T$ with a characteristic dependence on
magnetic field angle that should be easily detected experimentally, and argue
that for underdoped samples the spin-orbit contribution is larger than the

that it is a bulk probe of spin-orbit physics, and therefore not sensitive to
inversion breaking at surfaces.

It is therefore crucial to understand the disks molecular content. We aim to

In the context of the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in Taurus
(ALMA-DOT) we analyse ALMA observations of the disk of DG Tau in H2CO
3(1,2)-2(1,1), CS 5-4, and CN 2-1 at ~0.15"", i.e. ~18 au at 121 pc. H2CO and CS
originate from a disk ring at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum, with CS
probing an outer disk region with respect to H2CO (peaking at ~70 and ~60 au,
respectively). CN originates from an outermost disk/envelope region peaking at
~80 au. H2CO is dominated by disk emission, while CS probes also two streams of
material possibly accreting onto the disk with a peak of emission where the
stream connects to the disk. The ring- and disk-height- averaged column
densities are ~2.4-8.6e13 cm-2 (H2CO), ~1.7-2.5e13 cm-2 (CS), and ~1.9-4.7e13
cm-2 (CN). Unsharp masking reveals a ring of enhanced dust emission at ~40 au,
i.e. just outside the CO snowline (~30 au). CS and H2CO emissions are
co-spatial suggesting that they are chemically linked. The observed rings of
molecular emission at the edge of the 1.3mm continuum may be due to dust
opacity effects and/or continnum over-subtraction in the inner disk; as well as
to increased UV penetration and/or temperature inversion at the edge of the
mm-dust which would cause an enhanced gas-phase formation and desorption of
these molecules. Moreover, H2CO and CS originate from outside the ring of
enhanced dust emission, which also coincides with a change of the linear
polarization at 0.87mm. This suggests that outside the CO snowline there could
be a change of the dust properties which would reflect in the increase of the
intensity (and change of polarization) of continuum, and of molecular emission.

structure, and a viscous and resistive accretion disk---in order to model the
three mechanisms that contribute to the net stellar torque: accretion flow,
stellar wind, and magnetospheric ejections (periodic inflation and reconnection
events). We investigate how changes in the stellar magnetic field strength,
rotation rate, and mass accretion rate (changing the initial disk density)
affect the net stellar torque. All simulations are in a net spin-up regime. We
fit semi-analytic functions for the three stellar torque contributions,
allowing for the prediction of the net stellar torque for our parameter regime,
and the possibility of investigating spin-evolution using 1D stellar evolution
codes. The presence of an accretion disk appears to increase the efficiency of
stellar torques compared to isolated stars, for cases with outflow rates much
smaller than accretion rates, because the star-disk interaction opens more of
the stellar magnetic flux compared to that from isolated stars. In our
parameter regime, a stellar wind with a mass loss rate of $\approx 1 \%$ of the
mass accretion rate is capable of extracting $\lesssim 50 \%$ of the accreting
angular momentum. These simulations suggest that achieving spin-equilibrium in
a representative T Tauri case within our parameter regime, e.g., BP Tau, would

generalize to unseen environments, even when these share the same underlying
dynamics as the training levels. Understanding the generalization properties of
RL is one of the challenges of modern machine learning. Towards this goal, we
analyze policy learning in the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes (POMDPs) and formalize the dynamics of training levels as instances.
We prove that, independently of the exploration strategy, reusing instances
introduces significant changes on the effective Markov dynamics the agent
observes during training. Maximizing expected rewards impacts the learned
belief state of the agent by inducing undesired instance specific speedrunning
policies instead of generalizeable ones, which are suboptimal on the training
set. We provide generalization bounds to the value gap in train and test
environments based on the number of training instances, and use insights based
on these to improve performance on unseen levels. We propose training a shared
belief representation over an ensemble of specialized policies, from which we
compute a consensus policy that is used for data collection, disallowing
instance specific exploitation. We experimentally validate our theory,
observations, and the proposed computational solution over the CoinRun
benchmark.

focusing on the hardness of multiple players, we introduce a new dimension of
hardness, called attackability. All adversaries can be categorized based on the
attackability and we introduce Adversary-Adaptive Collision-Communication
(A2C2), a family of algorithms with forced-collision communication among
players. Both attackability-aware and unaware settings are studied, and
information-theoretic tools of the Z-channel model and error-correction coding
are utilized to address the challenge of implicit communication without
collision information in an adversarial environment. For the more challenging
attackability-unaware problem, we propose a simple method to estimate the
attackability enabled by a novel error-detection repetition code and randomized
communication for synchronization. Theoretical analysis proves that asymptotic
attackability-dependent sublinear regret can be achieved, with or without
knowing the attackability. In particular, the asymptotic regret does not have
an exponential dependence on the number of players, revealing a fundamental
tradeoff between the two dimensions of hardness in this problem.

Experiment (OGRE) hopes to achieve the highest resolution soft X-ray spectrum

to the success of the spectrometer are the performance of the $>250$ reflection
gratings populating its reflection grating assembly. To test current grating
fabrication capabilities, a grating prototype for the payload was fabricated
via electron-beam lithography at The Pennsylvania State University's Materials
Research Institute and was subsequently tested for performance at Max Planck
Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics' PANTER X-ray Test Facility. Bayesian
modeling of the resulting data via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
indicated that the grating achieved the OGRE single-grating resolution
requirement of $R_{g}(\lambda/\Delta\lambda)>4500$ at the 94% confidence level.
The resulting $R_g$ posterior probability distribution suggests that this
confidence level is likely a conservative estimate though, since only a finite
$R_g$ parameter space was sampled and the model could not constrain the upper
bound of $R_g$ to less than infinity. Raytrace simulations of the system found
that the observed data can be reproduced with a grating performing at
$R_g=\infty$. It is therefore postulated that the behavior of the obtained
$R_g$ posterior probability distribution can be explained by a finite
measurement limit of the system and not a finite limit on $R_g$. Implications
of these results and improvements to the test setup are discussed.

certain global properties such as whether the question can be answered by the

reinforcement learning to improve question quality. We design three different

better performance in automatic evaluation metrics. However, only the rewards
that correlate well with human judgement (e.g., relevance) lead to real

blind joint block diagonalization problem (BJBDP) is to find a full column rank
matrix $A$ such that $C_i=A\Sigma_iA^\text{T}$ for all $i$, where $\Sigma_i$'s
are all block diagonal matrices with as many diagonal blocks as possible. The
BJBDP plays an important role in independent subspace analysis (ISA). This
paper considers the identification problem for BJBDP, that is, under what
conditions and by what means, we can identify the diagonalizer $A$ and the
block diagonal structure of $\Sigma_i$, especially when there is noise in
$C_i$'s. In this paper, we propose a ``bi-block diagonalization'' method to
solve BJBDP, and establish sufficient conditions under which the method is able
to accomplish the task. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.
To the best of the authors' knowledge, existing numerical methods for BJBDP
have no theoretical guarantees for the identification of the exact solution,
whereas our method does.

expressions. Several recent works have shown the synthesis of highly
photo-realistic videos of talking faces, but they either require a source video
to drive the target face or only generate videos with a fixed head pose. This
lack of facial movement is because most of these works focus on the lip
movement in sync with the audio while assuming the remaining facial keypoints'
fixed nature. To address this, a unique audio-keypoint dataset of over 150,000
videos at 224p and 25fps is introduced that relates the facial keypoint
movement for the given audio. This dataset is then further used to train the
model, Audio2Keypoint, a novel approach for synthesizing facial keypoint
movement to go with the audio. Given a single image of the target person and an
audio sequence (in any language), Audio2Keypoint generates a plausible keypoint
movement sequence in sync with the input audio, conditioned on the input image
to preserve the target person's facial characteristics. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an audio-keypoint dataset and
learns a model to output the plausible keypoint sequence to go with audio of
any arbitrary length. Audio2Keypoint generalizes across unseen people with a
different facial structure allowing us to generate the sequence with the voice
from any source or even synthetic voices. Instead of learning a direct mapping
from audio to video domain, this work aims to learn the audio-keypoint mapping
that allows for in-plane and out-of-plane head rotations, while preserving the
person's identity using a Pose Invariant (PIV) Encoder.

this tremendous amount of energy is accumulated silently deep inside the
earth's crust? The most obvious question in seismic research remains
unanswered. We found an inherent and intriguing connection between the released
energy in an earthquake and electrochemical potential induced in an ultra-thin
metal oxide electrode immersed in an aqueous pH solution, which leads us to
understand the origin of the energy accumulation process in an earthquake. A
huge electrochemical potential is accumulated from numerous electrochemical
cells formed in a unique layer structure of hydrated clay minerals
(predominantly smectite), which resulted in a lightning-like discharge in the
lithosphere (hypocenter). The subsequent thunder-like massive shockwave is
produced, which initiates tectonic plate movement along a fault line, probably
through acoustic fluidization (AF), and resulting seismic energy is transmitted
as primary wave (P-wave), secondary wave (S-wave), and surface waves. The
presence of electrical voltage in the hypocenter directly supports the seismic
electric signal (SES), further strengthening the VAN method of earthquake
prediction. Our finding is supported by a plethora of research and observation
devoted to seismic science. This study will indeed find its significance if
immediate action is implemented to monitor the evolution of electrochemical
potential, seismic electrical signal (SES), and ionic activity in the fault
zone at lithosphere as well as in the ionosphere for predicting an impending
earthquake for saving human lives as early as possible.

$R_{\Psi_{2}}$ and $R_{\Psi_{3}}$ (convex) distributions from A Multi-Phase
Transport (AMPT) model, by contrasting data and model as well as large and
small systems and by event shape engineering (ESE), a recent preprint
(arXiv:2006.04251v1) from STAR suggests that the $R_{\Psi_{m}}$ observable is
sensitive to the CME signal and relatively insensitive to backgrounds, and
their Au+Au data are inconsistent with known background contributions.
  Purpose: We examine those claims by studying the robustness of the
$R_{\Psi_{m}}$ observable using AMPT as well as toy model simulations. We
compare $R_{\Psi_{m}}$ to the more widely used $\Delta\gamma$ azimuthal
correlator to identify their commonalities and differences.
  Methods: We use AMPT to simulate Au+Au, p+Au, and d+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$, and study the responses of $R_{\Psi_{m}}$ to
anisotropic flow backgrounds in the model. We also use a toy model to simulate
resonance flow background and input CME signal to investigate their effects in

compare to STAR data as well as predict the degree of sensitivity of

horizontal self-propelled states of a heaving foil in a quiescent fluid. Two
states are analyzed: a periodic state of unidirectional motion and a
quasi-periodic state of slow back & forth motion around a mean horizontal
position. The states emergence is explained through a fluid-solid Floquet
stability analysis of the non-propulsive symmetric base solution. Unlike a
purely-hydrodynamic analysis, our analysis accurately determine the locomotion
states onset. An unstable synchronous mode is found when the unidirectional
propulsive solution is observed. The obtained mode has a propulsive character,
featuring a mean horizontal velocity and an asymmetric flow that generates a
horizontal force accelerating the foil. An unstable asynchronous mode, also
featuring flow asymmetry and a non-zero velocity, is found when the back &
forth state is observed. Its associated complex multiplier introduces a slow
modulation of the flapping period, agreeing with the quasi-periodic nature of
the back & forth regime. The temporal evolution of this perturbation shows how
the horizontal force exerted by the flow is alternatively propulsive or
resistive over a slow period. For both modes, an analysis of the velocity and
force perturbation time-averaged over the flapping period is used to establish
physical instability criteria. The behaviour for large solid-to-fluid density
ratio of the modes is thus analyzed. The asynchronous fluid-solid mode
converges towards the purely-hydrodynamic one, whereas the synchronous mode
becomes marginally unstable in our analysis not converging to the
purely-hydrodynamic analysis where it is never destabilised.

adopt two quality measures in addition to the energy, namely fidelity and

quantum circuit ansatz, a set of general random target states. We determine the
optimal circuit depth for different types and levels of noise, and observe that
the variational algorithms mitigate the effects of noise by adapting the
optimised parameters. We find that the inclusion of redundant parameterised
gates makes the quantum circuits more resilient to noise. For such
overparameterised circuits different sets of parameters can result in the same
final state in the noiseless case, which we denote as parameter degeneracy.
Numerically, we show that this degeneracy can be lifted in the presence of
noise, with some states being significantly more resilient to noise than
others. We also show that the average deviation from the target state is linear
in the noise level, as long as this is small compared to a circuit-dependent
threshold. In this region the deviation is well described by a stochastic
model. Above the threshold, the optimisation can converge to states with
largely different physical properties from the true target state, so that for
practical applications it is critical to ensure that noise levels are below
this threshold.

quasar brightening events so far. The history of optical photometry data of
this quasar from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey and All Sky Automated
Survey for Super Novae (ASAS-SN), mid-infrared photometry data from the WISE
satellite, and the broad emission line (BEL) flux obtained by spectroscopy of
Sloan Digital Sky Survey shows their significant increases between 2003 and
2015. Investigating its CFHT photometric observations in 1983 and the USNO-B
catalog, which contains data in 1975 and 1969, we found that the source was 4
mag fainter before than the peak of the recent ASAS-SN photometry. From the
history of these data, we identified J1258 as a new Changing-State Quasar (CSQ;
or Changing-Look Quasar). We also performed follow-up spectroscopic
observations in December 2018 and May 2019, using the 2-meter telescope in
Nishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory. The results show that the continuum flux
and the BEL flux decreased to about 50 % of its peak. This indicates that J1258
is causing two changing-states for the BEL flux and continuum flux. We argue
that J1258's variability, especially its brightening event, can be explained by
the propagation of the heating front and the accretion disk state transitions
based on the timescale and Eddington ratio variations. The estimated mass of
the black hole of J1258 is about an order of magnitude larger than the CSQs
found so far. Since both the changing timescale and the size of the accretion
disk depend on the black hole mass, the J1258 brightening event can be
interpreted as a scaled version of the variability in other CSQs. This suggests
that samples of distant quasars with larger black hole masses may contain
objects with longer and severer variations.

policy iteration RL algorithm that can alleviate the requirement of known state

interference is often transferable, allowing an adversary to attack multiple

adversarial interference. Specifically, we show that adversarial attacks
crafted to fool models trained on time-domain features are not easily
transferable to models trained using frequency-domain features. In this

shown to act as a dissipation constant due to considerations of mesoscopic
scale stochastic effects. This dissipative effect arises without taking heat
flux in the fluid model and is termed as adiabatic or non-thermal for the
system under consideration. A basic formalism for introducing stochastic
effects in interiors of massive stars has recently been proposed via a
classical Einstein-Langevin equation. The origin of stochasticity is associated
with the pressure variable (due to degeneracy of constituent particles ) and
its fluctuations,and is not viable for pressureless fluids. The fluctuations
dissipate their fermi energy into perturbing the system, adiabatically. This is
shown by a fluctuation dissipation relation, and a Langevin fermi temperature
associated with these fluctuations is defined.The high magnitude of background
field fluctuations which we get here, is feasible to account for perturbing the
strong gravity regions with dense matter. Nevertheless, the perturbations
themselves are consistently and reasonably small as first order deviations from
equilibrium.

their peculiar dynamical states corresponding to the co-existence of coherent

engineered in systems of coupled oscillators by the suitable implementation of
communication delays. Here, using supervised machine learning, we predict (a)
the precise value of delay which is sufficient for engineering chimera and
solitary states for a given set of system parameters, as well as (b) the
intensity of incoherence for such engineered states. The results are
demonstrated for two different examples consisting of single layer and multi

establishing delays in the neighboring links of a node (the interlayer links)
in a 2-D lattice (multiplex network) of oscillators. Then, different machine
learning classifiers, KNN, SVM and MLP-Neural Network are employed by feeding
the data obtained from the network models. Once a machine learning model is
trained using a limited amount of data, it makes predictions for a given
unknown systems parameter values. Testing accuracy, sensitivity, and
specificity analysis reveal that MLP-NN classifier is better suited than Knn or

present AudioScope, a novel audio-visual sound separation framework that can be
trained without supervision to isolate on-screen sound sources from real
in-the-wild videos. Prior audio-visual separation work assumed artificial
limitations on the domain of sound classes (e.g., to speech or music),
constrained the number of sources, and required strong sound separation or
visual segmentation labels. AudioScope overcomes these limitations, operating
on an open domain of sounds, with variable numbers of sources, and without
labels or prior visual segmentation. The training procedure for AudioScope uses
mixture invariant training (MixIT) to separate synthetic mixtures of mixtures
(MoMs) into individual sources, where noisy labels for mixtures are provided by
an unsupervised audio-visual coincidence model. Using the noisy labels, along
with attention between video and audio features, AudioScope learns to identify
audio-visual similarity and to suppress off-screen sounds. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach using a dataset of video clips extracted from
open-domain YFCC100m video data. This dataset contains a wide diversity of

framework (CK or cKnowledge). The CK concept is to decompose research projects
into reusable components that encapsulate research artifacts and provide
unified application programming interfaces (APIs), command-line interfaces
(CLIs), meta descriptions and common automation actions for related artifacts.
The CK framework is used to organize and manage research projects as a database
of such components.
  Inspired by the USB ""plug and play"" approach for hardware, CK also helps to
assemble portable workflows that can automatically plug in compatible
components from different users and vendors (models, datasets, frameworks,
compilers, tools). Such workflows can build and run algorithms on different
platforms and environments in a unified way using the universal CK program
pipeline with software detection plugins and the automatic installation of
missing packages.
  This article presents a number of industrial projects in which the modular CK
approach was successfully validated in order to automate benchmarking,
auto-tuning and co-design of efficient software and hardware for machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of speed, accuracy,
energy, size and various costs. The CK framework also helped to automate the
artifact evaluation process at several computer science conferences as well as
to make it easier to reproduce, compare and reuse research techniques from
published papers, deploy them in production, and automatically adapt them to
continuously changing datasets, models and systems.
  The long-term goal is to accelerate innovation by connecting researchers and
practitioners to share and reuse all their knowledge, best practices,
artifacts, workflows and experimental results in a common, portable and
reproducible format at https://cKnowledge.io .

  Optimization with Constraints",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present MESMOC+, an improved version of Max-value Entropy search for
Multi-Objective Bayesian optimization with Constraints (MESMOC). MESMOC+ can be
used to solve constrained multi-objective problems when the objectives and the
constraints are expensive to evaluate. MESMOC+ works by minimizing the entropy
of the solution of the optimization problem in function space, i.e., the Pareto
frontier, to guide the search for the optimum. The cost of MESMOC+ is linear in
the number of objectives and constraints. Furthermore, it is often
significantly smaller than the cost of alternative methods based on minimizing
the entropy of the Pareto set. The reason for this is that it is easier to
approximate the required computations in MESMOC+. Moreover, MESMOC+'s
acquisition function is expressed as the sum of one acquisition per each
black-box (objective or constraint). Thus, it can be used in a decoupled
evaluation setting in which one chooses not only the next input location to
evaluate, but also which black-box to evaluate there. We compare MESMOC+ with
related methods in synthetic and real optimization problems. These experiments
show that the entropy estimation provided by MESMOC+ is more accurate than that
of previous methods. This leads to better optimization results. MESMOC+ is also
competitive with other information-based methods for constrained
multi-objective Bayesian optimization, but it is significantly faster.

successfully used for many always-on keyword spotting algorithms that detect a
wake word to trigger a device. The DNN predicts the state probabilities of a
given speech frame, while HMM decoder combines the DNN predictions of multiple
speech frames to compute the keyword detection score. The DNN, in prior
methods, is trained independent of the HMM parameters to minimize the
cross-entropy loss between the predicted and the ground-truth state
probabilities. The mis-match between the DNN training loss (cross-entropy) and
the end metric (detection score) is the main source of sub-optimal performance
for the keyword spotting task. We address this loss-metric mismatch with a
novel end-to-end training strategy that learns the DNN parameters by optimizing
for the detection score. To this end, we make the HMM decoder (dynamic
programming) differentiable and back-propagate through it to maximize the score
for the keyword and minimize the scores for non-keyword speech segments. Our
method does not require any change in the model architecture or the inference
framework; therefore, there is no overhead in run-time memory or compute
requirements. Moreover, we show significant reduction in false rejection rate
(FRR) at the same false trigger experience (> 70% over independent DNN

have been used to infer the presence of unseen companions. Some of them have

investigating the classification of the one candidate having a known X-ray

the Liverpool Telescope and a 5ks observation from the Chandra observatory to
fully constrain the orbital parameters and the X-ray emission of this system.
Results. We find the source to be an eclipsing stellar binary that can be
classified as a RS CVn. The giant star fills its Roche Lobe and the binary mass
ratio is greater than one. The system may be an example of stable mass transfer
from an intermediate-mass star with a convective envelope. Conclusions. Using
only radial velocity to identify black hole candidates can lead to many false
positives. The presence of an optical orbital modulation, such as observed for
all LAMOST candidates, will in most cases indicate that this is a stellar
binary.

already provides strong training signal to update the model parameters and
should be perturbed with mild or no augmentation. Perturbing a hard sample with
a strong augmentation may also make it too hard to learn from. Furthermore, a
sample with low training loss should be perturbed by a stronger augmentation to

on the training loss of the data samples. In the example of Gaussian noise, a
hard sample will be perturbed with a low variance noise and an easy sample with

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate remarkable full daytime sub-ambient
cooling performance with both BaSO4 nanoparticle films and BaSO4 nanocomposite

resonance at 9 um for high sky window emissivity. With an appropriate particle
size and a broad particle size distribution, BaSO4 nanoparticle film reaches an
ultra-high solar reflectance of 97.6% and high sky window emissivity of 0.96.
During field tests, BaSO4 film stays more than 4.5C below ambient temperature

with 60% volume concentration to enhance the reliability in outdoor
applications, achieving solar reflectance of 98.1% and sky window emissivity of
0.95. Field tests indicate similar cooling performance to the BaSO4 films.
Overall, our BaSO4-acrylic paint shows standard figure of merit of 0.77 which
is among the highest of radiative cooling solutions, while providing great
reliability, the convenient paint form, ease of use and the compatibility with

While canonical approaches such as bundle adjustment are predominantly

trajectory in the robot navigation, the practical implementation of bundle
adjustment in SLAM systems is intrinsically limited by the high computational
complexity, unreliable convergence and strict requirements of ideal

optimization backbone for visual SLAM systems, where we leverage rotation
averaging to improve the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of conventional

the high-dimensional non-convex nonlinear problem into tractable linear
subproblems in lower dimensions, and show that the subproblems can be solved
independently with proper constraints. We apply the scale parameter with
$l_1$-norm in the pose-graph optimization to address the rotation averaging
robustness against outliers. We further validate the global optimality of our

loss in terms of a quantum computation. We assume that there is a fine tuned
interaction between the qubits of the black hole Bell states which is the
inverse of premeasurement. Evaporation is unitary due to a projection on the
black hole state at the end of each computation whereas information comes out
of the black hole by teleportation. The model requires only four operations;
the qubit interactions, the Hadamard and CNOT gates and the projection which is
nonunitary. The model is a concrete quantum computation that realizes the final
black hole state idea with some modifications.

This approach is not only loose, in that it does not capture that EM can make
more progress than a gradient step, but the assumptions fail to hold for
textbook examples of EM like Gaussian mixtures. In this work we first show that
for the common setting of exponential family distributions, viewing EM as a

alleviate the ill-posed nature of prosody modelling, we use syntactic and

inspired by Matui's and Kerr's notions of almost finiteness. In fact, we show
that, in their respective scopes of applicability, both notions of almost
finiteness are equivalent to the conjunction of our two properties. These new
properties stem from viewing \'etale groupoids as coarse geometric objects in
the spirit of geometric group theory. Fiberwise amenability is a coarse
geometric property of \'etale groupoids that is closely related to the
existence of invariant measures on unit spaces and corresponds to the
amenability of the acting group in a transformation groupoid. Almost
elementariness may be viewed as a better dynamical analogue of the regularity
properties of C*-algebras than almost finiteness, since, unlike the latter, the
former may also be applied to the purely infinite case. To support this
analogy, we show almost elementary minimal groupoids give rise to tracially
Z-stable reduced groupoid C*-algebras. In particular, the reduced C*-algebras
of second countable amenable almost finite groupoids in Matui's sense are
Z-stable.

manipulation through systematic modification of inputs (e.g., adversarial
examples) in domains such as image recognition. Under the default threat model,
the adversary exploits the unconstrained nature of images; each feature (pixel)
is fully under control of the adversary. However, it is not clear how these
attacks translate to constrained domains that limit which and how features can
be modified by the adversary (e.g., network intrusion detection). In this
paper, we explore whether constrained domains are less vulnerable than
unconstrained domains to adversarial example generation algorithms. We create
an algorithm for generating adversarial sketches: targeted universal
perturbation vectors which encode feature saliency within the envelope of
domain constraints. To assess how these algorithms perform, we evaluate them in
constrained (e.g., network intrusion detection) and unconstrained (e.g., image
recognition) domains. The results demonstrate that our approaches generate
misclassification rates in constrained domains that were comparable to those of
unconstrained domains (greater than 95%). Our investigation shows that the
narrow attack surface exposed by constrained domains is still sufficiently
large to craft successful adversarial examples; and thus, constraints do not
appear to make a domain robust. Indeed, with as little as five randomly
selected features, one can still generate adversarial examples.

element. Recent experiments of sub-scale starshade external occulters revealed
that the inclusion of these physical properties is necessary to explain the
observed diffraction at 1e-10 of the incident light intensity. Here, we present
a methodology for implementing non-scalar diffraction while maintaining the
efficiency and ease of standard Fourier optics techniques. Our methodology is
based on that of Braunbek, in which the Kirchhoff boundary values are replaced
with the exact field in a narrow seam surrounding the edge of the diffracting
element. In this paper, we derive the diffraction equations used to implement
non-scalar diffraction and outline the computational implementation used to
solve those equations. We also provide experimental results that demonstrate
our model can replicate the observational signatures of non-scalar diffraction
in sub-scale starshades, in effect validating our model to better than 1e-10 in
relative intensity. We believe this method to be an efficient tool for
including additional physics to the models of coronagraphs and other optical
systems in which a full electromagnetic solution is intractable.

other studies, that $\sim$21\% of the sample have orbits that remain confined
to within 3~kpc of the Galactic plane, i.e., |Z$_{max}$| $\leq$ 3~kpc. Of
particular interest is a sub-sample ($\sim$11\% of the total) of low
|Z$_{max}$| stars with low eccentricities and prograde motions. The lowest
metallicity of these stars has [Fe/H] = --4.30 and the sub-sample is best
interpreted as the very low-metallicity tail of the metal-weak thick disk

energy from gravitational interactions that occur when infalling dwarf galaxies

use a given data release and have overlapping but not-identical queries. This
introduces a novel joint optimization problem in DP where the privacy budget
must be shared among different analysts.
  We initiate study into the problem of DP query answering across multiple
analysts. To capture the competing goals and priorities of multiple analysts,
we formulate three desiderata that any mechanism should satisfy in this setting
-- The Sharing Incentive, Non-Interference, and Adaptivity -- while still
optimizing for overall error. We demonstrate how existing DP query answering
mechanisms in the multi-analyst settings fail to satisfy at least one of the
desiderata. We present novel DP algorithms that provably satisfy all our
desiderata and empirically show that they incur low error on realistic tasks.

infrared limit, exhibiting the phenomenon of {\it jamming}, arise from an
underlying effective general relativistic description. The proposal stems from
the assumption (which we justify on physical grounds) that grains in granular
matter move freely in an {\it effective} curved Riemannian space. The
termination of their trajectories at the onset of jamming is obtained from the
focussing of a converging congruence of geodesics in such a space, as a
solution of the Raychaudhuri equation for such congruences. This may happen
irrespective of whether or not the curvature is sourced by external stresses
(via an effective Einstein equation), although the properties of the resultant
jammed state solution do differ in the two cases. A definite prediction of this
geometrical approach is the negative role played by those trajectories which
twist about each other, in reaching the jammed state. The local symmetries of
granular interaction, translational and rotational invariance (corresponding to
`force balance' and `torque balance' in standard force-based approaches to
jamming) are inherent in the effective general relativity framework. A
recently-proposed effective elasticity model of the jammed state, based on a
tensorial variant of standard electrostatics (Vector Charge Theory), is seen to
be entirely subsumed within the linearized version of the effective general
relativistic description.

more granular level of representation. We focus on the problem of textual
similarity from two perspectives: matching documents on a granular level
(requiring embeddings to capture fine-grained attributes in the text), and an
abstract level (requiring embeddings to capture overall textual semantics). We
empirically demonstrate, across two datasets from different domains, that
despite high performance in abstract document matching as expected, contextual
embeddings are consistently (and at times, vastly) outperformed by simple
baselines like TF-IDF for more granular tasks. We then propose a simple but
effective method to incorporate TF-IDF into models that use contextual
embeddings, achieving relative improvements of up to 36% on granular tasks.

dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) electron and hole states are spatially localized in
different layers forming long-lived interlayer excitons. Here, we have
investigated, from first principles, the influence of additional electron or
hole layers on the electronic properties of a MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayer (HBL),
which is a direct band gap material. Additional layers modify the interlayer
hybridization, mostly affecting the quasiparticle energy and real-space extend
of hole states at the G and electron states at the Q valleys. For a sufficient
number of additional layers, the band edges move from K to Q or G,
respectively. Adding electron layers to the HBL leads to more delocalized Q
states, while G states do not extend much beyond the HBL, even when more hole
layers are added. These results suggest a simple and yet powerful way to tune
band edges and the real-space extend of the electron and hole wave function in
TMDC heterostructures, strongly affecting the lifetime and dynamics of
interlayer excitons.

that under different normalizations, two distinct regimes emerge as both $n$

where the law of the properly renormalized Wishart matrices becomes close in
Wasserstein distance to that of a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble matrix. In the
second regime, a non-central convergence happens, and the law of the normalized
Wishart matrices becomes close in Wasserstein distance to that of the so-called
Rosenblatt-Wishart matrix recently introduced by Nourdin and Zheng. We then
proceed to show that the convergences stated above also hold in a functional
setting, namely as weak convergence in $C([a,b];M_n(\mathbb{R}))$. As an
application of our main result (in the central convergence regime), we show
that it can be used to prove convergence in expectation of the empirical
spectral distributions of the Wishart matrices to the semicircular law. Our

practice to ignore these correlations in the data analysis process. We develop
an empirical model for the correlations present in Very Large Telescope
Interferometer GRAVITY data and show that properly accounting for them yields
fainter detection limits and increases the reliability of potential detections.
We extracted the correlations of the (squared) visibility amplitudes and the
closure phases directly from intermediate products of the GRAVITY data
reduction pipeline and fitted our empirical models to them. Then, we performed
model fitting and companion injection and recovery tests with both simulated
and real GRAVITY data, which are affected by correlated noise, and compared the
results when ignoring the correlations and when properly accounting for them
with our empirical models. When accounting for the correlations, the faint
source detection limits improve by a factor of up to $\sim 2$ at angular
separations $> 20~\rm{mas}$. For commonly used detection criteria based on
$\chi^2$ statistics, this mostly results in claimed detections being more
reliable. Ignoring the correlations present in interferometric data is a
dangerous assumption which might lead to a large number of false detections.
The commonly used detection criteria (e.g. in the model fitting pipeline
CANDID) are only reliable when properly accounting for the correlations;
furthermore, instrument teams should work on providing full covariance matrices
instead of statistically independent error bars as part of the official data
reduction pipelines.

gravitational-wave (GW) data for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with

evaluate the near- and long-term prospects of multi-messenger cosmology in the
era of future GW observatories: Advanced LIGO Plus (A+, 2025), Voyager-like
detectors (2030s), and Cosmic Explorer-like detectors (CE, 2035 and beyond). We
show that the BNS horizon distance of $\approx 700$ Mpc for A+ is well-matched
to the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO) for kilonova

constrain the value of $H_0$ to percent-level precision, given a small
investment of VRO time dedicated to target-of-opportunity GW follow-up. In the
Voyager era, the BNS-kilonova observations begin to constrain $\Omega_m$ with
an investment of a few percent of VRO time. With the larger BNS horizon
distance in the Cosmic Explorer era, on-axis short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and
their afterglows (though accompanying only some of the GW-detected mergers)
supplant kilonovae as the most promising counterparts for redshift
identification. We show that five years of joint observations with Cosmic
Explorer-like facilities and a next-generation gamma-ray satellite with
localization capabilities similar to that presently possible with Swift could
constrain both $\Omega_m$ and $w_0$ to $15-20\%$. We therefore advocate for a

product quality. Many prediction models and approaches have been introduced
during the past decades that try to forecast bugged code elements based on
static source code metrics, change and history metrics, or both. However, there
is still no universal best solution to this problem, as most suitable features
and models vary from dataset to dataset and depend on the context in which we
use them. Therefore, novel approaches and further studies on this topic are
highly necessary. In this paper, we employ a chemometric approach - Partial
Least Squares with Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) - for predicting bug prone
Classes in Java programs using static source code metrics. To our best
knowledge, PLS-DA has never been used before as a statistical approach in the
software maintenance domain for predicting software errors. In addition, we
have used rigorous statistical treatments including bootstrap resampling and
randomization (permutation) test, and evaluation for representing the software
engineering results. We show that our PLS-DA based prediction model achieves
superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art approaches (i.e.
F-measure of 0.44-0.47 at 90% confidence level) when no data re-sampling
applied and comparable to others when applying up-sampling on the largest open
bug dataset, while training the model is significantly faster, thus finding
optimal parameters is much easier. In terms of completeness, which measures the
amount of bugs contained in the Java Classes predicted to be defective, PLS-DA
outperforms every other algorithm: it found 69.3% and 79.4% of the total bugs
with no re-sampling and up-sampling, respectively.

intra-domain or deterministic inter-domain continuous translation. In this
work, we present an effectively signed attribute vector, which enables
continuous translation on diverse mapping paths across various domains. In
particular, we introduce a unified attribute space shared by all domains that
utilize the sign operation to encode the domain information, thereby allowing
the interpolation on attribute vectors of different domains. To enhance the
visual quality of continuous translation results, we generate a trajectory
between two sign-symmetrical attribute vectors and leverage the domain
information of the interpolated results along the trajectory for adversarial

morphology is a primary factor to determine how fast a galaxy gets enriched,

of the classic ABC rejection algorithm, we estimate parameters in a

the use of ABC-IMCMC to estimate parameters in the Menter

dynamical origin. The angle variables $(\theta_\phi,\theta_R)$ -- which are
conjugates to the actions $(L_z,J_R)$, and describe a star's location along its
orbit -- are a powerful diagnostic to identify $l$:$m$ resonances via the orbit
shape relation $\Delta \theta_R / \Delta \theta_\phi = -m/l$. In the past,
angle signatures have been hidden by survey selection effects (SEs). Using test
particle simulations of a barred galaxy, we demonstrate that \emph{Gaia} should
allow us to identify the Galactic bar's Outer Lindblad Resonance ($l=+1, m=2$,
OLR) in angle space. We investigate strategies to overcome SEs. In the angle
data of the \emph{Gaia} DR2 RVS sample, we independently identify four
candidates for the OLR and therefore for the pattern speed $\Omega_\text{bar}$.
The strongest candidate, $\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.4\Omega_0$, positions the OLR
above the `Sirius' moving group, agrees with measurements from the Galactic
center, and might be supported by higher-order resonances around the
`Hercules/Horn'. But it misses the classic orbit orientation flip, as discussed
in the companion study on actions. The candidate
$\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.2\Omega_0$ was also suggested by the action-based
study, has the OLR at the `Hat', is consistent with \emph{slow bar} models, but
still affected by SEs. Weaker candidates are $\Omega_\text{bar}=1.6\Omega_0$
and $1.74\Omega_0$. In addition, we show that the stellar angles do not support
the `Hercules/Horn' being created by the OLR of a \emph{fast bar}. We conclude
that -- to resolve if `Sirius' or `Hat' is related to the bar's OLR -- more
complex dynamical explanations and more extended data with well-behaved SEs are
required.

regulated by the amount of gas present in the galaxy. However, it has recently
been shown that star formation can be suppressed by galactic dynamics in
galaxies that contain a dominant spheroidal component and a low gas fraction.
This 'dynamical suppression' is hypothesised to also contribute to quenching
gas-rich galaxies at high redshift, but its impact on the galaxy population at
large remains unclear. In this paper, we assess the importance of dynamical
suppression in the context of gas regulator models of galaxy evolution through
hydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies, with gas-to-stellar mass ratios
of 0.01-0.20 and a range of galactic gravitational potentials from
disc-dominated to spheroidal. Star formation is modelled using a
dynamics-dependent efficiency per free-fall time, which depends on the virial
parameter of the gas. We find that dynamical suppression becomes more effective
at lower gas fractions and quantify its impact on the star formation rate as a
function of gas fraction and stellar spheroid mass surface density. We combine
the results of our simulations with observed scaling relations that describe
the change of galaxy properties across cosmic time, and determine the galaxy
mass and redshift range where dynamical suppression may affect the baryon

the field-based hot Jupiter formation theory. In dense clusters, interactions
between planetary systems and flyby stars are relatively common. This has a
significant impact on planetary systems, dominating hot Jupiter formation. In
this paper, we perform high precision, few-body simulations of stellar flybys
and subsequent planet migration in clusters. A large parameter space
exploration demonstrates that close flybys that change the architecture of the
planetary system can activate high eccentricity migration mechanisms:
Lidov-Kozai and planet-planet scattering, leading to high hot Jupiter formation
rate in dense clusters. Our simulations predict that many of the hot Jupiters
are accompanied by ""ultra-cold Saturns"", expelled to apastra of thousands of
AU. This increase is particularly remarkable for planetary systems originally
hosting two giant planets with semi-major axis ratios $\sim$ 4 and the flyby
star approaching nearly perpendicular to the planetary orbital plane. The
estimated lower limit to the hot Jupiter formation rate of a virialized cluster
is $\sim 1.6\times10^{-4}({\sigma}/{\rm 1kms^{-1}})^5({a_{\rm p}}/{\rm 20
AU})({M_{\rm c}}/{\rm 1000M_\odot})^{-2}$Gyr$^{-1}$ per star, where $\sigma$ is
the cluster velocity dispersion, $a_{\rm p}$ is the size of the planetary
system and $M_{\rm c}$ is the mass of the cluster. Our simulations yield a hot
Jupiter abundance which is $\sim$ 50 times smaller than that observed in the
old open cluster M67. We expect that interactions involving binary stars, as
well as a third or more giant planets, will close the discrepancy.

partial transit taken during the commissioning of the instrument in 4-telescope
mode. We investigate the anomalous in-transit radial velocity curve and study

examining the planetary absorption signal on the stellar cross-correlation
functions we confirmed the presence of a temporal variation of its blueshift
during transit, which could be investigated spectrum-by-spectrum. We detected
significant absorption in the transmission spectrum for Na, H, K, Li, CaII, Mg,

Particularly remarkable is the detection of Li, with a line contrast of

technique we confirmed the presence of FeI, FeII, CrI and VI. H$\alpha$ and
CaII are present up to very high altitudes in the atmosphere ($\sim$1.44 Rp and
$\sim$2 Rp, respectively), and also extend beyond the transit-equivalent Roche
lobe radius of the planet. These layers of the atmosphere have a large line
broadening that is not compatible with being caused by the tidally-locked
rotation of the planet alone, and could arise from vertical winds or

theoretical models. Considering an astrophysically agnostic model we find that
the MBHB merger rate is loosely constrained to the range $10^{-11} - 2$

the Renyi entropies and find Friedel-type oscillations; these are understood in
terms of a defect operator product expansion. Furthermore, we consider the
mutual information as a measure of correlation functions between different
regions. Using a long-distance expansion previously developed by Cardy, we
argue that the mutual information detects Fermi surface correlations already at
leading order in the expansion. We also analyze the relative entropy and its
Renyi generalizations in order to distinguish states with different charge
and/or mass. In particular, we show that states in different superselection
sectors give rise to a super-extensive behavior in the relative entropy.
Finally, we discuss possible extensions to interacting theories, and argue for
the relevance of some of these measures for probing non-Fermi liquids.

there is a mismatch between where queues build and where control is most
effectively enforced; queues build at bottleneck links that are often not under

of middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a
sendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to
determine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections

bottleneck queues that would have built up from the bundle's packets now shift
from the bottleneck to the sendbox. The sendbox then exercises control over its
traffic by scheduling packets to achieve higher-level objectives. We have
implemented Bundler in Linux and evaluated it with real-world and emulation

coupler elements to tunably control two-qubit interactions has improved
operational fidelity in many-qubit systems by reducing parasitic coupling and

existing framework for tunable couplers based on the dispersive approximation

for addressing coherent leakage to the coupler and parasitic longitudinal
($ZZ$) interactions during two-qubit gates. Here, we present a systematic
approach that goes beyond the dispersive approximation to exploit the
engineered level structure of the coupler and optimize its control. Using this
approach, we experimentally demonstrate CZ and $ZZ$-free iSWAP gates with
two-qubit interaction fidelities of $99.76 \pm 0.07$% and $99.87 \pm 0.23$%,

the boring fact is that the majority of current third-party web tracking is
conducted using traditional, persistent-state identifiers. One possible
explanation for the privacy community's focus on fingerprinting is that to date
browsers have faced a lose-lose dilemma when dealing with third-party stateful
identifiers: block state in third-party frames and break a significant number
of webpages, or allow state in third-party frames and enable pervasive
tracking. The alternative, middle-ground solutions that have been deployed all
trade privacy for compatibility, rely on manually curated lists, or depend on
the user to manage state and state-access themselves. This work furthers
privacy on the web by presenting a novel system for managing the lifetime of
third-party storage, ""page-length storage"". We compare page-length storage to
existing approaches for managing third-party state and find that page-length
storage has the privacy protections of the most restrictive current option
(i.e., blocking third-party storage) but web-compatibility properties mostly
similar to the least restrictive option (i.e., allowing all third-party
storage). This work further compares page-length storage to an alternative
third-party storage partitioning scheme and finds that page-length storage
provides superior privacy protections with comparable web-compatibility. We
provide a dataset of the privacy and compatibility behaviors observed when
applying the compared third-party storage strategies on a crawl of the Tranco

approach to quantum spin systems. As a test case, we study the
spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, a prime example of
a geometrically frustrated magnet believed to host a quantum spin liquid. Our
main physical result is that, at pure nearest-neighbor coupling, the system
shows indications for an algebraic spin liquid through slower-than-exponential
decay with distance for the static spin susceptibility, while the pseudofermion
self-energy develops intriguing low-energy features. Methodologically, the
pseudofermion representation of spin models inherently yields a strongly
interacting system, and the quantitative reliability of a truncated fRG flow is
\textit{a priori} unclear. Our main technical result is the demonstration of
convergence in loop number within multiloop pffRG. Through correspondence with
the self-consistent parquet equations, this provides further evidence for the
internal consistency of the approach. The loop order required for convergence
of the pseudofermion vertices is rather large, but the spin susceptibility is
more benign, appearing almost fully converged for loop orders $\ell \geq 5$.
The multiloop flow remains stable as the infrared cutoff $\Lambda$ is reduced
relative to the microscopic exchange interaction $J$, allowing us to reach
values of $\Lambda/J$ on the subpercent level in the spin-liquid phase. By
contrast, solving the parquet equations via direct fixed-point iteration
becomes increasingly difficult for low $\Lambda/J$. We also scrutinize the
pseudofermion constraint of single occupation per site, which is only fulfilled
on average in pffRG, by explicitly computing fermion-number fluctuations.
Although the latter are not entirely suppressed, we find that they do not
affect the qualitative conclusions drawn from the spin susceptibility.

some truncation scheme to facilitate computation. Here, we report on our

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models on the pyrochlore, simple cubic and

focus on explaining part of the rapid fluctuations in DNe, following the
framework of recent studies on the monthly eruptions of DNe that use a hybrid
disk composed of an outer standard disk and an inner magnetized disk. We show
that the ionization instability, that is responsible for the monthly eruptions
of DNe, is also able to operate in the inner magnetized disk. Given the low
density and the fast accretion time scale of the inner magnetized disk, the
ionization instability generates small, rapid heating and cooling fronts
propagating back and forth in the inner disk. This leads to quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) with a period of the order of $1000$ s. A strong prediction
of our model is that these QPOs can only develop in quiescence or at the
beginning/end of an outburst. We propose that these rapid fluctuations might
explain a subclass of already observed QPOs in DNe as well as a, still to

PV has advantages of improved temperature sensitivity, enhanced diffuse and
albedo light collection, flattened energy-output, reduced soiling, etc.
Monofacial tracking already provides many of these advantages, therefore the
relative merits of bifacial tracking are not obvious. In this paper, we use a
detailed illumination and temperature-dependent bifacial solar farm model to
show that bifacial tracking PV delivers up to 45% energy gain when compared to
fixed-tilt bifacial PV near the equator, and ~10% bifacial energy gain over
tracking monofacial farm with an albedo of 0.5. An optimum pitch further
improves the gain of a tracking bifacial farm. Our results will broaden the

averaged bipartite entanglement entropy of such states admits a volume law and

generalize this setup to random mixed states by coupling the system to a bath
and use the partial transpose to study their entanglement properties. We
develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate partial transpose within random
matrix theory and formulate a perturbation theory in $1/L$, the inverse of the
Hilbert space dimension. We compute several quantities including the spectral
density of partial transpose (or entanglement negativity spectrum), two-point
correlator of eigenvalues, and the logarithmic negativity. As long as the bath
is smaller than the system, we find that upon sweeping the subregion size, the
logarithmic negativity shows an initial increase and a final decrease similar
to the Page curve, while it admits a plateau in the intermediate regime where
the logarithmic negativity only depends on the size of the system and of the
bath but not on how the system is partitioned. This intermediate phase has no
analog in random pure states, and is separated from the two other regimes by a
critical point. We further show that when the bath is larger than the system by
at least two extra qubits the logarithmic negativity is identically zero which
implies that there is no distillable entanglement. Using the diagrammatic
approach, we provide a simple derivation of the semi-circle law of the
entanglement negativity spectrum in the latter two regimes. We show that
despite the appearance of a semicircle distribution, reminiscent of Gaussian

indirectly assessed by the value of the associated energy. Novel adaptive
derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter (ADAPT) ansatz approaches and recent formal
advances now establish a clear connection between the theory of quantum
chemistry and the quantum state ansatz used to solve the electronic structure
problem. Here we benchmark the accuracy of VQE and ADAPT-VQE to calculate the

diatomic molecules, namely H$_2$, NaH, and KH. Using numerical simulation, we
find both methods provide good estimates of the energy and ground state, but
only ADAPT-VQE proves to be robust to particularities in optimization methods.
Another relevant finding is that gradient-based optimization is overall more
economical and delivers superior performance than analogous simulations carried
out with gradient-free optimizers. The results also identify small errors in
the prepared state fidelity which show an increasing trend with molecular size.

FastICA reproduce the most recent 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} <$

application of GPR. We also find that FastICA and GMCA begin to deviate from
the noise-limit at \textit{k}-scales larger than $\sim 0.1 ~h
\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. We then replicate the data via simulations to see the
source of FastICA and GMCA's limitations, by testing them against various
instrumental effects. We find that no single instrumental effect, such as
primary beam effects or mode-mixing, can explain the poorer recovery by FastICA
and GMCA at larger \textit{k}-scales. We then test scale-independence of
FastICA and GMCA, and find that lower \textit{k}-scales can be modelled by a
smaller number of independent components. For larger scales ($k \gtrsim 0.1~h
\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$), more independent components are needed to fit the
foregrounds. We conclude that, the current usage of GPR by the LOFAR

extended molecular emission (~80-90%), which is filtered out by the
interferometer and likely traces diffuse gas. We detect 111 GMCs that give a
similar mass spectrum as those in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies (a
truncated power law with slope of -1.76+/-0.13). We also study Larson's laws
over the available dynamic range of GMC properties (~2 dex in mass and ~1 dex
in size): GMCs follow the size-mass relation of the Milky Way, but their
velocity dispersion is higher such that the size-linewidth and virial relations
appear super-linear, deviating from the canonical values. The global
molecular-to-atomic gas ratio is very high (~1) while the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio
is quite low (~0.5), and both quantities vary from north to south. Star
formation is predominantly taking place in the south of the TDG, where we
observe projected offsets between GMCs and young stellar clusters ranging from
~50pc to ~200pc; the largest offsets correspond to the oldest knots, as seen in
other galaxies. In the quiescent north, we find more molecular clouds and a
higher molecular-to-atomic gas ratio (~1.5); atomic and diffuse molecular gas
also have a higher velocity dispersion there. Overall, the organisation of the
molecular ISM in this TDG is quite different from other types of galaxies on
large scales, but the properties of GMCs seem fairly similar, pointing to near
universality of the star-formation process on small scales.

learn to maximize sparse and delayed reward signals. Although RL has had many
impressive successes in complex domains, learning can take hours, days, or even
years of training data. A major challenge of contemporary RL research is to
discover how to learn with less data. Previous work has shown that domain
information can be successfully used to shape the reward; by adding additional
reward information, the agent can learn with much less data. Furthermore, if
the reward is constructed from a potential function, the optimal policy is
guaranteed to be unaltered. While such potential-based reward shaping (PBRS)
holds promise, it is limited by the need for a well-defined potential function.
Ideally, we would like to be able to take arbitrary advice from a human or
other agent and improve performance without affecting the optimal policy. The
recently introduced dynamic potential based advice (DPBA) method tackles this
challenge by admitting arbitrary advice from a human or other agent and
improves performance without affecting the optimal policy. The main
contribution of this paper is to expose, theoretically and empirically, a flaw
in DPBA. Alternatively, to achieve the ideal goals, we present a simple method

using a generative model. We show that this accelerates policy learning by
specifying high-value areas of the state and action space that are worth
exploring first. Unlike the majority of existing methods that assume optimal
demonstrations and incorporate the demonstration data as hard constraints on
policy optimization, we instead incorporate demonstration data as advice in the
form of a reward shaping potential trained as a generative model of states and
actions. In particular, we examine both normalizing flows and Generative
Adversarial Networks to represent these potentials. We show that, unlike many
existing approaches that incorporate demonstrations as hard constraints, our
approach is unbiased even in the case of suboptimal and noisy demonstrations.

constant over time but varies significantly with the solar cycle, we provide a
method for the adaptation of the incident radiation Lyman line profiles
(Lyman-alpha and higher lines) to a specific date. Moreover, we analyse how the
change in the incident radiation influences the synthetic spectra produced by
the radiative transfer modelling. To take into account the Lyman-alpha

future electronics. Although the transport properties (e.g. mobility) at low
electric field have been widely studied, there are limited studies on
high-field properties, which are important for many applications. Particularly,
there is lack of understanding of the physical origins underlying the property
differences across different MX2. Here by combining first-principles
calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, we study the high-field electron
transport in defects-free unstrained and tensilely strained MX2 (M=Mo, W and
X=S, Se). We find that WS2 has the highest peak velocity (due to its smallest
effective mass) that can be reached at the lowest electric field (owing to its
highest mobility). Strain can increase the peak velocity by increasing the
scattering energy. After reaching the peak velocity, most MX2 demonstrates
negative differential mobility (NDM). WS2 shows the largest NDM among
unstrained MX2 due to the strongest effect of electron transfer from the
low-energy small-mass valley to the high-energy large-mass valley. The tensile
strain increases the valley separation, which on one hand suppresses the
electron transfer in WS2, on the other hand allows the electrons to access the
non-parabolic band region of the low-energy valley. The latter effect leads to
an NDM for electrons in the low-energy valley, which can significantly increase
the overall NDM at moderate strain. The valley-separation induced NDM in the
low-energy valley is found to be a general phenomenon. Our work unveils the
physical factors underlying the differences in high-field transport properties

effective approach for further improvement.

light could be generated by exploiting interactions with free electrons, going
beyond their already ubiquitous use in generating classical light. This
question is motivated by developments in electron microscopy, which present a
new platform for manipulating photons through their interaction with quantum
free electrons. Here, we explore the shaping of photon statistics using the
quantum interactions of free electrons with photons in optical cavities. We
find a variety of quantum states of light that can be generated by a judicious
choice of the input light and electron states. For example, we show how shaping
an electron into an energy comb can provide an implementation of a photon
displacement operation, allowing, for instance, the generation of displaced
Fock and displaced squeezed states. We also show how one can generate a desired
Fock state by repeated interactions of electrons with a cavity, followed by
measurements. We develop the underlying theory of the interaction of both a
single and many consecutive electrons with a common cavity mode. Looking
forward, by exploiting the degrees of freedom of arbitrary electron-photon
quantum states, we may achieve complete control over the statistics and
correlations of output photonic states, leading to the generation of novel
quantum states of light.

the scale of a few parsecs, inside a larger molecular cloud. The diffuse atomic
initial condition consists of a stationary, thermally unstable, spherical cloud
in pressure equilibrium with lower density surroundings and threaded by a
uniform magnetic field. This cloud was seeded with 10% density perturbations at
the finest initial grid level around n=1.1 cm^{-3} and evolved with
self-gravity included from the outset. Several cloud diameters were considered
(100 pc, 200 pc and 400 pc) equating to several cloud masses (17,000 Msun,
136,000 Msun and 1.1x10^6 Msun). Low-density magnetic-field-aligned striations
were observed as the clouds collapse along the field lines into disc-like
structures. The induced flow along field lines leads to oscillations of the
sheet about the gravitational minimum and an integral-shaped appearance. When
magnetically supercritical, the clouds then collapse and generate hourglass
magnetic field configurations with strongly intensified magnetic fields,
reproducing observational behaviour. Resimulation of a region of the highest
mass cloud at higher resolution forms gravitationally-bound collapsing clumps
within the sheet that contain clump-frame supersonic (M~5) and super-Alfvenic
(M_A~4) velocities. Observationally realistic density and velocity power
spectra of the cloud and densest clump are obtained. Future work will use these
realistic initial conditions to study individual star and cluster feedback.

communication network, and for many algorithms $\tau_\epsilon$ depends on the
second-smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2\in[0,1]$ of the network's normalized
Laplacian matrix: $\tau_\epsilon\sim\mathcal{O}(\lambda_2^{-1})$. Here, we
analyze the effect on $\tau_\epsilon$ of network community structure, which can
arise when compute nodes/sensors are spatially clustered, for example. We study
consensus machine learning over networks drawn from stochastic block models,
which yield random networks that can contain heterogeneous communities with
different sizes and densities. Using random matrix theory, we analyze the
effects of communities on $\lambda_2$ and consensus, finding that $\lambda_2$
generally increases (i.e., $\tau_\epsilon$ decreases) as one decreases the
extent of community structure. We further observe that there exists a critical
level of community structure at which $\tau_\epsilon$ reaches a lower bound and
is no longer limited by the presence of communities. We support our findings
with empirical experiments for decentralized support vector machines.

the absence of disorder, it has long been expected that as the electron density
is lowered, the exchange energy gained by aligning the electron spins should
exceed the enhancement in the kinetic (Fermi) energy, leading to a (Bloch)
ferromagnetic transition. At even lower densities, another transition to a
(Wigner) solid, an ordered array of electrons, should occur. Experimental
access to these regimes, however, has been limited because of the absence of a
material platform that supports an electron system with very high-quality (low
disorder) and low density simultaneously. Here we explore the ground states of
interacting electrons in an exceptionally-clean, two-dimensional electron
system confined to a modulation-doped AlAs quantum well. The large electron
effective mass in this system allows us to reach very large values of the
interaction parameter $r_s$, defined as the ratio of the Coulomb to Fermi
energies. As we lower the electron density via gate bias, we find a sequence of
phases, qualitatively consistent with the above scenario: a paramagnetic phase
at large densities, a spontaneous transition to a ferromagnetic state when
$r_s$ surpasses 35, and then a phase with strongly non-linear current-voltage
characteristics, suggestive of a pinned Wigner solid, when $r_s$ exceeds
$\simeq 38$. However, our sample makes a transition to an insulating state at
$r_s\simeq 27$, preceding the onset of the spontaneous ferromagnetism, implying
that, besides interaction, the role of disorder must also be taken into account
in understanding the different phases of a realistic dilute electron system.

quantum micro- or nano-mechanical oscillator (MO) is coupled to the

precision quantum sensor for measuring very weak signals. As is well-known in
any precise quantum measurement the competition between the shot noise (SN) and
the backaction noise of measurement executes a limitation on the measurement
precision which is the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL). In the case
where the intensity of the signal is even lower than the SQL, one needs to
perform an ultra precision quantum sensing to beat the SQL. For this purpose,
we review three important methods for surpassing the SQL in a hybrid OMS: (i)
the backaction evading measurement of a quantum nondemolition (QND) variable of
the system, (ii) the coherent quantum backaction noise cancellation (CQNC), and
(iii) the so-called parametric sensing, the simultaneous signal amplification
and added noise suppression below the SQL. Furthermore, we have shown in this
article for the first time how the classical fluctuation of the driving laser
phase, the so-called laser phase noise (LPN), affects the power spectrum of the
output optical field in a standard OMS and induces an additional impression
noise which makes the total system noise increase above the SQL. Also, for the
first time in this review it has been shown that in the standard OMSs, it is
impossible to amplify signal while suppressing the noise below the SQL
simultaneously.

milliseconds. They are subsequently identified, for the most part, as emanating
from unknown objects at cosmological distances. At present, over one hundred
FRBs have been verified, classified into two groups: repeating bursts (20
samples) and apparently non-repeating bursts (91 samples). Their origins,
however, are still hotly debated. Here,we investigate the statistical
classifications for the two groups of samples to see if the non-repeating and
repeating FRBs have different origins by employing Anderson-Darling (A-D) test
and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (M-W-W) test. Firstly, by taking the pulse width as a
statistical variant, we found that the repeating samples do not follow the
Gaussian statistics (may belong to a chi-square distribution), although the
overall data and non-repeating group do follow the Gaussian. Meanwhile, to
investigate the statistical differences between the two groups, we turn to
M-W-W test and notice that the two distributions have different origins.
Secondly, we consider the FRB radio luminosity as a statistical variant, and
find that both groups of samples can be regarded as the Gaussian distributions
under the A-D test, although they have different origins according to M-W-W
tests. Therefore, statistically, we can conclude that our classifications of
both repeaters and non-repeaters are plausible, that the two FRB classes have
different origins, or each has experienced distinctive phases or been subject
to its own physical processes.

interaction between the defender and the attacker as a Stackelberg game where
the defender first chooses a set of nodes to block and then the attacker
selects a set of seeds to spread negative information from. This yields an
extremely complex bi-level optimization problem, particularly since even the
standard influence measures are difficult to compute. Our approach is to
approximate the attacker's problem as the maximum node domination problem. To
solve this problem, we first develop a method based on integer programming
combined with constraint generation. Next, to improve scalability, we develop
an approximate solution method that represents the attacker's problem as an
integer program, and then combines relaxation with duality to yield an upper
bound on the defender's objective that can be computed using mixed integer
linear programming. Finally, we propose an even more scalable heuristic method
that prunes nodes from the consideration set based on their degree. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches.

surrogate models of the formation and feedback effects of primordial stars in
hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the first galaxies. Here, we present
the surrogate model to predict localized primordial star formation; the
feedback model will be presented in a subsequent paper. The star formation
prediction model consists of two sub-models: the first is a 3D volume
classifier that predicts which (10 comoving kpc)$^3$ volumes will host star
formation, followed by a 3D Inception-based U-net voxel segmentation model that
predicts which voxels will form primordial stars. We find that the combined
model predicts primordial star forming volumes with high skill, with $F_1
>0.995$ and true skill score $>0.994$. The star formation is localized within
the volume to $\lesssim5^3$~voxels ($\sim1.6$~comoving kpc$^3$) with
$F_1>0.399$ and true skill score $>0.857$. Applied to simulations with low
spatial resolution, the model predicts star forming regions in the same
locations and at similar redshifts as sites in resolved full-physics
simulations that explicitly model primordial star formation and feedback. When
applied to simulations with lower mass resolution, we find that the model
predicts star forming regions at later redshift due to delayed structure
formation resulting from lower mass resolution. Our model predicts primordial
star formation without halo finding, so will be useful in spatially
under-resolved simulations that cannot resolve primordial star forming halos.
To our knowledge, this is the first model that can predict primordial star
forming regions that match highly-resolved cosmological simulations.

in a range of applications, but its deployment in high-stakes settings remains

learn the underlying system dynamics---existing work is focused almost
exclusively on characterizing rates, with little attention paid to the
constants multiplying those rates that can be critically important in practice.
To start to address this challenge, we study perhaps the simplest non-bandit
reinforcement learning problem: linear quadratic adaptive control (LQAC). By
carefully combining recent finite-sample performance bounds for the LQAC
problem with a particular (less-recent) martingale central limit theorem, we
are able to derive asymptotically-exact expressions for the regret, estimation
error, and prediction error of a rate-optimal stepwise-updating LQAC algorithm.
In simulations on both stable and unstable systems, we find that our asymptotic
theory also describes the algorithm's finite-sample behavior remarkably well.

to be extragalactic background sources. We discuss the possible astrophysical

However, MSPs extrapolated from the GD population are too weak to have
contributed significantly to the GCCR population that have been detected. We
also cross-correlated the GCCRs with X-ray sources in Chandra X-ray catalogs

develop an algorithm to obtain the least-cost matching sequences by

whose thickness depends on the withdrawal speed and the liquid properties. If
the coating material contains particles, they will only be entrained when the
viscous force pulling them with the substrate overcomes the opposing capillary
force at the deformable meniscus. This force threshold occurs at different
liquid thicknesses for particles of different sizes. Here, we show that this
difference can be used to separate small particles from a mixed suspension
through capillary filtration. In a bidisperse suspension, we observe three
distinct filtration regimes. At low capillary numbers, Ca, no particles are
entrained in the liquid coating. At high Ca, all particle sizes are entrained.
For a range of capillary numbers between these two extremes, only the smallest
particles are entrained while the larger ones remain in the reservoir. We
explain how this technique can be applied to polydisperse suspension. We also
provide an estimate of the range of capillary number to separate particles of
given sizes. The combination of this technique with the scalability and
robustness of dip coating makes it a promising candidate for high-throughput
separation or purification of industrial and biomedical suspensions.

full scientific capability of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs).
The current and future neutrino experiments that rely on massive LArTPCs create
a need for new ideas and reconstruction approaches. Wire-Cell, proposed in
recent years, is a novel tomographic event reconstruction method for LArTPCs.
The Wire-Cell 3D imaging approach capitalizes on charge, sparsity, time, and
geometry information to reconstruct a topology-agnostic 3D image of the
ionization electrons prior to pattern recognition. A second novel method, the
many-to-many charge-light matching, then pairs the TPC charge activity to the
detected scintillation light signal, thus enabling a powerful rejection of
cosmic-ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector. A robust processing of the
scintillation light signal and an appropriate clustering of the reconstructed
3D image are fundamental to this technique. In this paper, we describe the
principles and algorithms of these techniques and their successful application
in the MicroBooNE experiment. A quantitative evaluation of the performance of
these techniques is presented. Using these techniques, a 95% efficient
pre-selection of neutrino charged-current events is achieved with a 30-fold
reduction of non-beam-coincident cosmic-ray muons, and about 80\% of the
selected neutrino charged-current events are reconstructed with at least 70%
completeness and 80% purity.

experiment in that rings in solution blends exhibit large conformational
fluctuations, including extension overshoots in the startup of flow and
tumbling and tank-treading at steady state. Ring polymer fluctuations increase
with blend fraction of linear polymers and are peaked at a ring Weissenberg
number $\textrm{Wi}_R \approx 1.5$. On the contrary, linear and ring polymers
in pure solutions show a peak in fluctuations at the critical coil-stretch
Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi} = 0.5$. BD simulations show that extension
overshoots on startup of flow are due to flow-induced intermolecular
ring-linear polymer hooks, whereas fluctuations at steady state are dominated
by intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions (HI). This is supported by
simulations of bidisperse linear polymer solution blends, which show similar
trends in conformational dynamics between rings and linear polymers with a
matched contour length. Compared to BD simulations, single molecule experiments
show quantitatively larger fluctuations, which could arise because experiments
are performed on higher molecular weight polymers with stronger topological
constraints. To this end, we have advanced the understanding of the effects of
topological interactions and intermolecular HI on the dynamics of semidilute

learning legged locomotion is describing different gaits, via reward functions,
in a way that is intuitive for the designer and specific enough to reliably
learn the gait across different initial random seeds or hyperparameters. A
common approach is to use reference motions (e.g. trajectories of joint
positions) to guide learning. However, finding high-quality reference motions
can be difficult and the trajectories themselves narrowly constrain the space
of learned motion. At the other extreme, reference-free reward functions are
often underspecified (e.g. move forward) leading to massive variance in policy
behavior, or are the product of significant reward-shaping via trial-and-error,
making them exclusive to specific gaits. In this work, we propose a
reward-specification framework based on composing simple probabilistic periodic
costs on basic forces and velocities. We instantiate this framework to define a
parametric reward function with intuitive settings for all common bipedal gaits
- standing, walking, hopping, running, and skipping. Using this function we
demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer of the learned gaits to the bipedal
robot Cassie, as well as a generic policy that can transition between all of

examine the roles of overlap weights, matching weights, Shannon's entropy

underlying estimators, analytically and via simulations, in terms of the
accuracy, precision, and root mean squared error. Moreover, we study the
asymptotic behaviors of their augmented estimators (that mimic doubly robust

Three microscale pillars containing microstructures with different complexities
and sizes/volume fraction of SiC particles were used to study the effect of
these features on deformation. For the matrix, nanoscale intermetallic
precipitates within the Al grains contribute most to the strengthening effect,
and the Al grain boundaries are shown to be effective obstacles for preventing
strain localization by dominant shear bands and, therefore, catastrophic
failure. When shear localization occurs, SiC particles can then debond from the
matrix if the shear band and interface are aligned. To investigate whether the
interface is a weak point during catastrophic failure, a number of SiC
particles were separated from the matrix with direct debonding tests, which
yield an interface strength that is much higher than the critical resolved
shear stress for a pillar exhibiting both shear localization and interface
debonding. Therefore, the matrix-particle interface is ruled out as a possible
weak point, and instead shear localization is identified as the mechanism that
can drive subsequent interface debonding.

improving the model accuracy. Given a proper deep learning framework, it is
generally possible to increase the depth or layer width to achieve a higher
level of accuracy. However, the huge number of model parameters imposes more
computational and memory usage overhead and leads to the parameter redundancy.
In this paper, we address the parameter redundancy problem in DNNs by replacing
conventional full projections with bilinear projections. For a fully-connected
layer with $D$ input nodes and $D$ output nodes, applying bilinear projection
can reduce the model space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(2D)$, achieving a deep model with a sub-linear layer size.
However, structured projection has a lower freedom of degree compared to the
full projection, causing the under-fitting problem. So we simply scale up the
mapping size by increasing the number of output channels, which can keep and
even boosts the model accuracy. This makes it very parameter-efficient and
handy to deploy such deep models on mobile systems with memory limitations.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that applying the proposed bilinear
projection to deep neural networks can achieve even higher accuracies than
conventional full DNNs, while significantly reduces the model size.

  Semi-Supervised Learning over Large-scale Graphs","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering
  (TKDE)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have led to state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of machine learning tasks such as recommendation, node classification
and link prediction. Graph neural network models generate node embeddings by
merging nodes features with the aggregated neighboring nodes information. Most
existing GNN models exploit a single type of aggregator (e.g., mean-pooling) to
aggregate neighboring nodes information, and then add or concatenate the output
of aggregator to the current representation vector of the center node. However,
using only a single type of aggregator is difficult to capture the different
aspects of neighboring information and the simple addition or concatenation
update methods limit the expressive capability of GNNs. Not only that, existing
supervised or semi-supervised GNN models are trained based on the loss function
of the node label, which leads to the neglect of graph structure information.
In this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network architecture, Graph
Attention \& Interaction Network (GAIN), for inductive learning on graphs.
Unlike the previous GNN models that only utilize a single type of aggregation
method, we use multiple types of aggregators to gather neighboring information
in different aspects and integrate the outputs of these aggregators through the
aggregator-level attention mechanism. Furthermore, we design a graph
regularized loss to better capture the topological relationship of the nodes in
the graph. Additionally, we first present the concept of graph feature
interaction and propose a vector-wise explicit feature interaction mechanism to
update the node embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two
node-classification benchmarks and a real-world financial news dataset. The
experiments demonstrate our GAIN model outperforms current state-of-the-art
performances on all the tasks.

short-period comet nuclei, mostly Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), have bilobate
shapes (two masses connected by a narrow neck). This is in stark contrast to
the shapes of asteroids of similar sizes, of which ~14% are bilobate. This
suggests that a process or mechanism unique to comets is producing these
shapes. Here we show that the bilobate shapes of JFC nuclei are a natural
byproduct of sublimative activity during their dynamical migration from their
trans-Neptunian reservoir, through the Centaur population, and into the Jupiter
family. We model the torques resulting from volatile sublimation during this
dynamical migration and find that they tend to spin up these nuclei to
disruption. Once disrupted, the rubble pile-like material properties of comet
nuclei (tensile strengths of ~1-10 Pa and internal friction angles of
~35$^\circ$) cause them to reform as bilobate objects. We find that JFCs likely
experienced rotational disruption events prior to entering the Jupiter family,
which could explain the prevalence of bilobate shapes. These results suggest
that the bilobate shapes of observed comets developed recently in their history
(within the past ~1-10 Myr), rather than during solar system formation or
collisions during planet migration and residency in the trans-Neptunian
population.

balance of stresses, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman law. We apply dual-mixed
formulations in both domains, where the symmetry of the Stokes and poroelastic
stress tensors is imposed by setting the vorticity and structure rotation
tensors as auxiliary unknowns. In turn, since the transmission conditions
become essential, they are imposed weakly, which is done by introducing the
traces of the fluid velocity, structure velocity, and the poroelastic media
pressure on the interface as the associated Lagrange multipliers. The existence
and uniqueness of a solution are established for the continuous weak
formulation, as well as a semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation with
non-matching grids, together with the corresponding stability bounds. In

analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that the spin-orbit (SO)
coupling adds some new results to the tunneling dynamics in both multiphoton
resonance and far-off-resonance parameter regimes. When the driving frequency
is resonant with the static Zeeman field (multi-photon resonances), we obtain
an unexpected new dynamical localization (DL) phenomenon where the single
SO-coupled atom is restricted to making perfect two-site Rabi oscillation
accompanied by spin flipping.By using the unconventional DL phenomenon, we are
able to generate a ratchetlike effect which enables directed atomic motion
towards different directions and accompanies periodic spin-flipping under the
action of SO coupling. For the far-off-resonance case, we show that by
suppressing the usual inter-site tunneling alone, it is possible to realize a
type of spin-conserving second-order tunneling between next-nearest-neighboring
sites, which is not accessible in the conventional lattice system without SO
coupling. We also show that simultaneous controls of the usual inter-site
tunneling and the SO-coupling-related second-order-tunneling are necessary for
quasienergies flatness (collapse) and completely frozen dynamics to exist.
These results may be relevant to potential applications such as spin-based
quantum information processing and design of novel spintronics devices.

distance to the sensor. For example, at a range greater than 60 meters, the
sparsity of lidar pointclouds reaches to a point where even humans cannot
discern object shapes from each other. However, this distance should not be
considered very far for fast-moving vehicles: A vehicle can traverse 60 meters
under two seconds while moving at 70 mph. For safe and robust driving
automation, acute 3D object detection at these ranges is indispensable. Against
this backdrop, we introduce faraway-frustum: a novel fusion strategy for
detecting faraway objects. The main strategy is to depend solely on the 2D
vision for recognizing object class, as object shape does not change
drastically with an increase in depth, and use pointcloud data for object
localization in the 3D space for faraway objects. For closer objects, we use
learned pointcloud representations instead, following state-of-the-art. This
strategy alleviates the main shortcoming of object detection with learned
pointcloud representations. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art by a considerable margin for faraway

1/f$^{2.8}$ filtered noise images and assessed its relationship to the more
traditional location known exactly detection tasks and 2D search. We
investigated two different signal types that vary in their detectability away
from the point of fixation (visual periphery). We show that the influence of 3D
search on human performance interacts with the signal's detectability in the
visual periphery. Detection performance for signals difficult to detect in the
visual periphery deteriorates greatly in 3D search but not in 3D location known

implicitly or explicitly. Their priors are hand-designed and their
corresponding weights are heuristically assigned. Hence, deep learning methods
often produce superior image restoration quality. Deep networks are, however,
capable of inducing strong and hardly predictable hallucinations. Networks
implicitly learn to be jointly faithful to the observed data while learning an
image prior; and the separation of original data and hallucinated data
downstream is then not possible. This limits their wide-spread adoption in
image restoration. Furthermore, it is often the hallucinated part that is
victim to degradation-model overfitting.
  We present an approach with decoupled network-prior based hallucination and
data fidelity terms. We refer to our framework as the Bayesian Integration of a
Generative Prior (BIGPrior). Our method is rooted in a Bayesian framework and
tightly connected to classic restoration methods. In fact, it can be viewed as
a generalization of a large family of classic restoration algorithms. We use
network inversion to extract image prior information from a generative network.
We show that, on image colorization, inpainting and denoising, our framework
consistently improves the inversion results. Our method, though partly reliant
on the quality of the generative network inversion, is competitive with
state-of-the-art supervised and task-specific restoration methods. It also
provides an additional metric that sets forth the degree of prior reliance per

existing Erasure-coded data repair schemes are roughly classified into two
categories: 1. Designing rapid data repair (e.g., PPR) in a homogeneous
environment. 2. Constructing data repair (e.g., PPT) based on bandwidth in a
heterogeneous environment. However, these solutions are difficult to cope with
the heterogeneous and Rapidly-changing network in erasure-coded clusters. To
address this problem, a bandwidth-aware multi-level forwarding repair
algorithm, called BMFRepair, is proposed. BMFRepair monitors the network
bandwidth in real time when data is forwarded, and selects idle nodes with
high-bandwidth links to assist in forwarding. Thus, it can reduce the time
bottleneck caused by low link transmission. At the same time, multi-node repair
becomes very complicated when the bandwidth changes drastically. A multi-node
scheduling repairing algorithm, called MSRepair, is proposed for multi-node
repairing problems, which can repair multiple failed blocks in parallel by
scheduling node resources. The two algorithms can flexibly adapt to the rapidly
changing network environment and make full use of the bandwidth resources of
idle nodes. Most importantly, algorithms can continuously adjust the repair
plan according to the bandwidth change in fast and dynamic network. The
algorithms have been evaluated by both simulations on Mininet and real
experiments on Aliyun cloud platform ECS. Results show that compared with the
state-of-the-art repair schemes PPR and PPT, the algorithms can significantly
reduce the repair time in rapidly-changing network.

graph signals, respectively. To take informative measurements, we propose a new
graph neural sampling module, which aims to select those vertices that
maximally express their corresponding neighborhoods. Such expressiveness can be
quantified by the mutual information between vertices' features and
neighborhoods' features, which are estimated via a graph neural network. To
reconstruct an original graph signal from the sampled measurements, we propose
a graph neural recovery module based on the algorithm-unrolling technique.
Compared to previous analytical sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are
able to flexibly learn a variety of graph signal models from data by leveraging
the learning ability of neural networks; compared to previous
neural-network-based sampling and recovery, the proposed methods are designed
through exploiting specific graph properties and provide interpretability. We
further design a new multiscale graph neural network, which is a trainable
multiscale graph filter bank and can handle various graph-related learning
tasks. The multiscale network leverages the proposed graph neural sampling and
recovery modules to achieve multiscale representations of a graph. In the
experiments, we illustrate the effects of the proposed graph neural sampling
and recovery modules and find that the modules can flexibly adapt to various
graph structures and graph signals. In the task of active-sampling-based
semi-supervised learning, the graph neural sampling module improves the
classification accuracy over 10% in Cora dataset. We further validate the
proposed multiscale graph neural network on several standard datasets for both
vertex and graph classification. The results show that our method consistently
improves the classification accuracies.

not stable, suggesting that any bodies found in it would have very short
lifetimes. We performed 20 Myr high-precision numerical simulations of the
evolution of massless particles, initially located in the Kuiper belt but close
to Neptune, with perihelia slightly below 33 au (""Neptune crossers""). Some of
these particles quickly migrate inward, passing through the NCR before becoming
Jupiter Family Comets. We find that objects in the NCR do indeed generally
travel through it very quickly. However, our simulations reveal that resonant
behavior in this region is somewhat common and can trap objects for up to 100

fluctuations. Langevin dynamics are mapped onto an equivalent quantum
mechanical (QM) system. Borrowing ideas from supersymmetric quantum mechanics
(SUSY QM), a parameterized ground state wave function (WF) of this QM system is
used as a direct input to the model, which also fixes a non-linear Langevin
potential. Using a two-component Gaussian mixture as a ground state WF with an
asymmetric double well potential produces a tractable low-parametric model with
interpretable parameters, referred to as the NES (Non-Equilibrium Skew) model.
Supersymmetry (SUSY) is then used to find time-dependent solutions of the model
in an analytically tractable way. Additional approximations give rise to a
final practical version of the NES model, where real-measure and risk-neutral
return distributions are given by three component Gaussian mixtures. This
produces a closed-form approximation for option pricing in the NES model by a
mixture of three Black-Scholes prices, providing accurate calibration to option
prices for either benign or distressed market environments, while using only a
single volatility parameter. These results stand in stark contrast to the most
of other option pricing models such as local, stochastic, or rough volatility

description of a wide range of hadronic observables from both colliders. The
selected experimental data provide reasonable constraints on the shear and the
bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at $T\sim$ 150-250 MeV, but their
constraining power degrades at higher temperatures $T \gtrsim 250$ MeV.
Furthermore, these viscosity constraints are found to depend significantly on
how viscous corrections are handled in the transition from hydrodynamics to the
hadronic transport. Several other model parameters, including the
free-streaming time, show similar model sensitivity while the initial condition
parameters associated with the T$_\mathrm{R}$ENTo ansatz are quite robust
against variations of the particlization prescription. We also report on the
sensitivity of individual observables to the various model parameters. Finally,
Bayesian model selection is used to quantitatively compare the agreement with
measurements for different sets of model assumptions, including different
particlization models and different choices for which parameters are allowed to
vary between RHIC and LHC energies.

art results in both of the most common models: adversarial and
stochastic/random order. Here we try to provide a more unified analysis of
primal-dual algorithms to better understand the mechanisms behind this
important method. With this we are able of recover and extend in one goal
several results of the literature.
  In particular, we obtain robust online algorithm for fairly general online
convex problems: we consider the MIXED model where in some of the time steps
the data is stochastic and in the others the data is adversarial. Both the
quantity and location of the adversarial time steps are unknown to the
algorithm. The guarantees of our algorithms interpolate between the (close to)
best guarantees for each of the pure models. In particular, the presence of
adversarial times does not degrade the guarantee relative to the stochastic
part of the instance.
  Concretely, we first consider Online Convex Programming: at each time a
feasible set $V_t$ is revealed, and the algorithm needs to select $v_t \in V_t$
to minimize the total cost $\psi(\sum_t v_t)$, for a convex function $\psi$.
Our robust primal-dual algorithm for this problem on the MIXED model recovers
and extends, for example, a result of Gupta et al. and recent work on
$\ell_p$-norm load balancing by the author. We also consider the problem of
Welfare Maximization with Convex Production Costs: at each time a customer
presents a value $c_t$ and resource consumption vector $a_t$, and the goal is
to fractionally select customers to maximize the profit $\sum_t c_t x_t -
\psi(\sum_t a_t x_t)$. Our robust primal-dual algorithm on the MIXED model
recovers and extends the result of Azar et al.
  Given the ubiquity of primal-dual algorithms we hope the ideas presented here
will be useful in obtaining other robust algorithm in the MIXED or related
models.

cloud, voxel, surface mesh, and implicit function representations. We introduce
Deformable Tetrahedral Meshes (DefTet) as a particular parameterization that
utilizes volumetric tetrahedral meshes for the reconstruction problem. Unlike
existing volumetric approaches, DefTet optimizes for both vertex placement and
occupancy, and is differentiable with respect to standard 3D reconstruction
loss functions. It is thus simultaneously high-precision, volumetric, and
amenable to learning-based neural architectures. We show that it can represent
arbitrary, complex topology, is both memory and computationally efficient, and
can produce high-fidelity reconstructions with a significantly smaller grid
size than alternative volumetric approaches. The predicted surfaces are also
inherently defined as tetrahedral meshes, thus do not require post-processing.
We demonstrate that DefTet matches or exceeds both the quality of the previous
best approaches and the performance of the fastest ones. Our approach obtains
high-quality tetrahedral meshes computed directly from noisy point clouds, and
is the first to showcase high-quality 3D tet-mesh results using only a single

galaxy mergers contribute to the enhancement of the HI. Exploring the
mid-infrared properties of Choir galaxies we find possible environmental
processing in only nine Choir galaxies, which indicates that environmental
processing is more perceptible in the HI content than the mid-infrared
properties. Moreover, we find that environmental processing occurs in Choir
groups regardless of their global environment, whether they are in isolation or
in proximity to the denser structures, such as cosmic web filaments. We explore
possible scenarios of the Choirs evolution, taking into account their HI

quadrupole-strain (QS) couplings suggested for silicon vacancies, we present a
minimum model of the two-level system to investigate a magnetoacoustic
resonance (MAR) coupled to various strain modes driven by the SAW. The
longitudinal and transverse QS couplings can be changed by rotating a magnetic
field, which depends on a combination of the strain modes. Using the Floquet
theory, we elucidate each coupling effect on the time-averaged transition
probability, especially focus on a single-phonon transition process. The
important result is that the longitudinal QS coupling brings about a sharp
photon-assisted resonance and leads to an abrupt change in the field-angle
dependent transition probability. Since this phonon transition process is
always accompanied by the photon transition, the field angle for the sharp
resonance peak can be detected by the EPR measurement. The hybrid EPR-MAR
measurement is useful to confirm the existence of quadrupole degrees of freedom
strongly coupled to elastic strains, and thus it is expected to be a
complementary probe for the precise evaluation of quadrupole properties.

Processor-Aware but Cache-Oblivious (PACO). We demonstrate our approach on

further develop an analytical method with strong mixing of states with
different quantum number of angular momentum $J$ ($J$-mixing), which is caused
by strong exchange field acting on spin component of 4$f$ electrons. Comparing
our analytical results with those calculated by Boltzmann statistics, we
clarify that the previous analytical studies for Sm transition metal compounds
over-estimate the $J$-mixing effects. The present method enables us to make
quantitative analysis of temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy (MA)

that the $J$-mixing caused by exchange field increases spin angular momentum,
which enhances the absolute value of orbital angular momentum and MA constants
via spin-orbit interaction. It is also clarified that these J-mixing effects
remain even above room temperature. Magnetization of SmFe$_{12}$ shows peculiar
field dependence known as first-order magnetization process (FOMP), where the
magnetization shows an abrupt change at certain magnetic field. The result of
the analysis shows that the origin of FOMP is attributed to competitive MA
constants between positive $K_1$ and negative $K_2$. The sign of $K_{1(2)}$
appears due to an increase in CF potential denoted by the parameter

data-driven acoustic scene classification (ASC) system, a novel two-stage
system based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Our
two-stage system leverages on an ad-hoc score combination based on two CNN
classifiers: (i) the first CNN classifies acoustic inputs into one of three
broad classes, and (ii) the second CNN classifies the same inputs into one of
ten finer-grained classes. Three different CNN architectures are explored to
implement the two-stage classifiers, and a frequency sub-sampling scheme is
investigated. Moreover, novel data augmentation schemes for ASC are also
investigated. Evaluated on DCASE 2020 Task 1a, our results show that the
proposed ASC system attains a state-of-the-art accuracy on the development set,
where our best system, a two-stage fusion of CNN ensembles, delivers a 81.9%
average accuracy among multi-device test data, and it obtains a significant
improvement on unseen devices. Finally, neural saliency analysis with class
activation mapping (CAM) gives new insights on the patterns learnt by our
models.

limited battery power, energy efficient data transmission schemes with massive
connectivity capabilities are required for future wireless networks.
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one of the promising techniques that
provide such massive connectivity by allowing superposed data transmission of
multiple users over the same resource block. Unlike existing literature, this
paper presents a user pairing and power allocation technique for energy
efficient and quality of service (QoS) aware NOMA transmission for
cellular-connected mobile UAVs. The aim is to minimize the power consumption of
the mobile UAVs during uplink data transmission and guarantee their required
transmission rate by jointly optimizing the UAV pairing and power allocation.
Furthermore, the performance and pairing complexity for mobile UAVs is analyzed
to show that the proposed pairing technique efficiently fulfills their QoS
requirements. Numerical and simulation results show the performance gain of the
proposed technique compared to the conventional NOMA techniques.

modeled as a rational choice of a player. In the proposed game, players decide
both the learning parameters and the network structure. The Nash equilibrium
characterizes the tradeoff between the local performance and the global
agreement of the learned classifiers. We first introduce a commutative approach
which features a joint learning process that integrates the iterative learning
at each node and the network formation. We show that our game is equivalent to
a generalized potential game in the setting of undirected networks. We study
the convergence of the proposed commutative algorithm, analyze the network
structures determined by our game, and show the improvement of the social
welfare in comparison with standard distributed learning over fixed networks.
To adapt our framework to streaming data, we derive a distributed Kalman
filter. A concurrent algorithm based on the online mirror descent algorithm is
also introduced for solving for Nash equilibria in a holistic manner. In the
case study, we use telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease to corroborate the
results.

modified, single-paddle silicon-on-insulator resonant torque sensor. The
mechanical compliances to all three orthogonal torque components are maximized
by clamping the sensor at a single point. Mechanically-resonant AC torques are
driven by an RF field containing a frequency component for each fundamental

rotation, infall motion, and density contrast around the protostar to identify

question is how to choose the kernel bandwidth $\sigma$, and a common practice
called self-tuned kernel adaptively sets a $\sigma_i$ at each point $x_i$ by
the $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) distance. When $x_i$'s are sampled from a
$d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space, unlike
with fixed-bandwidth kernels, theoretical results of graph Laplacian
convergence with self-tuned kernels have been incomplete. This paper proves the
convergence of graph Laplacian operator $L_N$ to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian
for a new family of kNN self-tuned kernels $W^{(\alpha)}_{ij} = k_0( \frac{ \|

$\hat{\rho}$ is the estimated bandwidth function {by kNN}, and the limiting
operator is also parametrized by $\alpha$. When $\alpha = 1$, the limiting
operator is the weighted manifold Laplacian $\Delta_p$. Specifically, we prove
the point-wise convergence of $L_N f $ and convergence of the graph Dirichlet
form with rates. Our analysis is based on first establishing a $C^0$
consistency for $\hat{\rho}$ which bounds the relative estimation error
$|\hat{\rho} - \bar{\rho}|/\bar{\rho}$ uniformly with high probability, where
$\bar{\rho} = p^{-1/d}$, and $p$ is the data density function. Our theoretical
results reveal the advantage of self-tuned kernel over fixed-bandwidth kernel
via smaller variance error in low-density regions. In the algorithm, no prior
knowledge of $d$ or data density is needed. The theoretical results are
supported by numerical experiments on simulated data and hand-written digit

balancing problem that have been studied in the literature: static and dynamic.
The static interpretation leads to formulating the load balancing problem as a
case with jobs (balls) never leaving the system and accumulating at the servers
(bins) whereas the dynamic setting deals with the case when jobs arrive and
leave the system after service completion. This paper designs and evaluates
server proximity aware job allocation policies for treating load balancing
problems with a goal to reduce the communication cost associated with the jobs.
We consider a class of proximity aware Power of Two (POT) choice based
assignment policies for allocating jobs to servers, where servers are
interconnected as an n-vertex graph G(V, E). For the static version, we assume
each job arrives at one of the servers, u. For the dynamic setting, we assume G
to be a circular graph and job arrival process at each server is described by a
Poisson point process with the job service time exponentially distributed. For
both settings, we then assign each job to the server with minimum load among
servers u and v where v is chosen according to one of the following two
policies: (i) Unif-POT(k): Sample a server v uniformly at random from k-hop
neighborhood of u (ii) InvSq-POT(k): Sample a server v from k-hop neighborhood
of u with probability proportional to the inverse square of the distance
between u and v. Our simulation results show that both the policies
consistently produce a load distribution which is much similar to that of a
classical proximity oblivious POT policy.

This ultrafast operation of spin lasers relies on a large birefringence,
usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers. We introduce a
transparent description of spin lasers using intensity equations, which
elucidate the influence of birefringence on the intensity and polarization
modulation of lasers. While intensity modulation is independent of
birefringence, for polarization modulation an increase in birefringence

supremacy, usually focusing on the feasibility of looking good on paper
algorithms in realistic settings, due to the vulnerability of quantum systems
to myriad sources of noise. In this vein, an interesting example of quantum
pseudo-telepathy games that quantum mechanical resources can theoretically
outperform classical resources is the Magic Square game (MSG), in which two
players play against a referee. Due to noise, however, the unit winning
probability of the players can drop well below the classical limit. Here, we
propose a timely and unprecedented experimental setup for quantum computation
with quantum dots inside optical cavities, along with ancillary photons for
realizing interactions between distant dots to implement the MSG. Considering
various physical imperfections of our setup, we first show that the MSG can be
implemented with the current technology, outperforming the classical resources
under realistic conditions. Next, we show that our work gives rise to a new
version of the game. That is, if the referee has information on the physical
realization and strategy of the players, he can bias the game through filtered
randomness and increase his winning probability. We believe our work
contributes to not only quantum game theory, but also quantum computing with

underlying physics remains puzzling. The glitch activity may reflect a lower
limit of the crustal moment of inertia in conventional neutron star models.
Nevertheless, its statistical feature could also be reproduced in the strangeon
star model, which is focused here. We formulate the glitch activity of normal
radio pulsars under the framework of starquake of solid strangeon star model,
the shear modulus of strangeon matter is constrained to be $\mu\simeq
3\times10^{34}~\rm erg/cm^{3}$, consistent with previous work. Nevertheless,
about ten times the shift in oblateness accumulated during glitch interval is
needed to fulfill the statistical observations. The fact that typical glitch
sizes of two rapidly evolving pulsars (the Crab pulsar and PSR B0540-69) are
about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the Vela pulsar, significantly
lower than the oblateness change they can supply, indicates probably that only
a part of oblateness change is relieved when a pulsar is young. The unreleased
oblateness and stress may relax as compensation in the following evolution. The
small glitch sizes and low glitch activity of the Crab pulsar can be explained
simultaneously in this phenomenological model. Finally, we obtain energy
release to be $\Delta E\sim 2.4\times 10^{40}~\rm erg$ and $\Delta E\sim
4.2\times 10^{41}~\rm erg$ for typical glitch size of $\Delta\nu/\nu\sim
10^{-6}$ (Vela-like) and $\sim 10^{-8}$ (Crab-like). The upcoming SKA may test
this model through the energy release and the power-law relation between the

accumulative operation sequence of multivariate compositional data is defined

of the compositional data vectors. Secondly, this paper studies the least

selected as the time-response expression of the solution. Thirdly, this paper
infuses the novel model with traditional grey model to improve its robustness.
Differential Evolution algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal value
of the general matrix. Lastly, two validation examples are provided for
confirming the effectiveness of the novel model by comparing it with other
existing models, before being employed to forecast the crude oil import
structure in China. The results show that the novel model provides better
performance in all crude oil cases in short-term forecasting. Therefore, by
using the new model, China's development parameter is 0.5214 and Determination
Factor of the novel model is 0.5999, which means that the crude oil import
structure of China is being changed. Specifically, the amount of crude oil

cosmological context, via a first-principles approach to understanding the
cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure phenomenology of such a
non-standard physics scenario. Assuming an effective Lagrangian in which a
heavier standard-model neutrino $\nu_H$ couples to a lighter one $\nu_l$ and a
massless scalar particle $\phi$ via a Yukawa interaction, we derive from first
principles the complete set of Boltzmann equations, at both the spatially
homogeneous and the first-order inhomogeneous levels, for the phase space
densities of $\nu_H$, $\nu_l$, and $\phi$ in the presence of the relevant decay
and inverse decay processes. With this set of equations in hand, we perform a
critical survey of recent works on cosmological invisible neutrino decay in
both limits of decay while $\nu_H$ is ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic.
Our two main findings are: (i) in the non-relativistic limit, the effective
equations of motion used to describe perturbations in the neutrino--scalar
system in the existing literature formally violate momentum conservation and
gauge invariance, and (ii) in the ultra-relativistic limit, exponential damping
of the anisotropic stress does not occur at the commonly-used rate $\Gamma_{\rm
T} =(1/\tau_0) (m_{\nu H}/E_{\nu H})^3$, but at a rate $\sim (1/\tau_0) (m_{\nu
H}/E_{\nu H})^5$. Both results are model-independent. The impact of the former
finding on the cosmology of invisible neutrino decay is likely small. The
latter, however, implies a significant revision of the cosmological limit on
the neutrino lifetime $\tau_0$ from $\tau_0^{\rm old} \gtrsim 1.2 \times 10^9\,

finds the largest (high \textit{coverage}) axis-aligned hyper-cuboid such that

approximations to the coverage and precision measures in terms of the

integrates various modules of AutoML, including Neural Architecture Search

Compression, and Fully Train. b) To support a variety of search algorithms and
tasks, we design a novel fine-grained search space and its description language
to enable easy adaptation to different search algorithms and tasks. c) We
abstract the common components of deep learning frameworks into a unified
interface. VEGA can be executed with multiple back-ends and hardwares.
Extensive benchmark experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate that VEGA can
improve the existing AutoML algorithms and discover new high-performance models

interests as it provides fertile material to gain further insight into the
mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. A natural follow-up work was
to look into the possibility of superconductivity in MnSe. It was shown that
MnP becomes superconducting with Tc ~ 1 K under pressure. We demonstrated in
this work that high pressure can effectively suppress the complex magnetic
characters of MnSe crystal when observed at ambient condition. MnSe under
pressure is found to undergo several structural transformations: the cubic
phase first partially transforms to the hexagonal phase at about 12 GPa, the
crystal exhibits the coexistence of cubic, hexagonal and orthorhombic phases
from 16 GPa to 30 GPa, and above 30 GPa the crystal shows a single orthorhombic
phase. Superconductivity with Tc ~ 5 K was first observed at pressure ~12 GPa
by magnetic measurements (~16 GPa by resistive measurements). The highest Tc is
~ 9 K (magnetic result) at ~35 GPa. Our observations suggest the observed
superconductivity may closely relate to the pressure-induced structural change.
However, the interface between the metallic and insulating boundaries may also
play an important role to the pressure induced superconductivity in MnSe.

emerging 5G non-public networks (NPNs) need to support significant uplink
traffic to enable emerging applications such as industrial Internet of things
(IIoT). The uplink-and-downlink spectrum sharing is becoming a viable solution
to enhance the uplink throughput of NPNs, which allows the NPNs to perform the
uplink transmission over the time-frequency resources configured for downlink
transmission in coexisting public networks. To deal with the severe
interference from the downlink public base station (BS) transmitter to the
coexisting uplink non-public BS receiver, we propose an adaptive asymmetric
successive interference cancellation (SIC) approach, in which the non-public BS
receiver is enabled to have the capability of decoding the downlink signals
transmitted from the public BS and successively cancelling them for
interference mitigation. In particular, this paper studies a basic
uplink-and-downlink spectrum sharing scenario when an uplink non-public BS and
a downlink public BS coexist in the same area, each communicating with multiple
users via orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Under this
setup, we aim to maximize the common uplink throughput of all non-public users,
under the condition that the downlink throughput of each public user is above a
certain threshold. The decision variables include the subcarrier allocation and
user scheduling for both non-public (uplink) and public (downlink) BSs, the
decoding mode of the non-public BS over each subcarrier (i.e., with or without
SIC), as well as the rate and power control over subcarriers. Numerical results
show that the proposed adaptive asymmetric SIC design significantly improves
the common uplink throughput as compared to benchmark schemes without such
design.

spectrum of adversarial attacks have emerged with the goal of evading such

network protocol implementations, and the more rigorous/complete versions
implemented at end hosts. These evasion attacks largely involve subtle
manipulations of packets to cause different behaviours at DPI and end hosts, to
cloak malicious network traffic that is otherwise detectable. With recent
automated discovery, it has become prohibitively challenging to manually curate
rules for detecting these manipulations. In this work, we propose CLAP, the
first fully-automated, unsupervised ML solution to accurately detect and
localize DPI evasion attacks. By learning what we call the packet context,
which essentially captures inter-relationships across both (1) different
packets in a connection; and (2) different header fields within each packet,
from benign traffic traces only, CLAP can detect and pinpoint packets that
violate the benign packet contexts (which are the ones that are specially
crafted for evasion purposes). Our evaluations with 73 state-of-the-art DPI
evasion attacks show that CLAP achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating

shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a
respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not
yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such
as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies are critical. Here we employ
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and
account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and
aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different
ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian
statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as
there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first
experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in
contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical
view by William F. Wells (1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish
the ability of air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour
puff to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives
the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff.
To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model
for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model
correctly predicts super-saturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative
agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can
be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.

$\alpha_i= \alpha_{i0}~a^s$ where $i=M,B$, $a$ is the scale factor and
$\alpha_{i0}$ ($\alpha_{M0}, \alpha_{B0}$), $s$ are arbitrary parameters. We
show that the growth and lensing reduced (dimensionless) gravitational
couplings $\mu\equiv G_{\rm growth}/G$, $\Sigma\equiv G_{\rm lensing}/G$
exhibit the following generic properties today: $\Sigma_0 < 1$ for all viable
parameters, $\mu_0<1$ (weak gravity today) is favored for small $s$ while
$\mu_0>1$ is favored for large $s$. We establish also the relation $\mu\geq
\Sigma$ at all times. Taking into account the $f\sigma_8$ and $E_G$ data
constrains the parameter $s$ to satisfy $s\lesssim 2$. Hence these data select
essentially the weak gravity regime today ($\mu_0<1$) when $s<2$, while
$\mu_0>1$ subsists only marginally for $s\approx 2$. At least the interval
$0.5\lesssim s \lesssim 2$ would be ruled out in the absence of screening. We

signals transmitted by radio devices to isolate their fingerprint. Recently,
deep learning-based authenticators have increasingly been proposed to classify
devices using these fingerprints, as they achieve higher accuracies compared to
traditional approaches. However, it has been shown in other domains that adding
carefully crafted perturbations to legitimate inputs can fool such classifiers.
This can undermine the security provided by the authenticator. Unlike
adversarial attacks applied in other domains, an adversary has no control over
the propagation environment. Therefore, to investigate the severity of this
type of attack in wireless communications, we consider an unauthorized
transmitter attempting to have its signals classified as authorized by a deep
learning-based authenticator. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning-based
attack where the impersonator--using only the authenticator's binary
authentication decision--distorts its signals in order to penetrate the system.
Extensive simulations and experiments on a software-defined radio testbed
indicate that at appropriate channel conditions and bounded by a maximum

explored. In particular, for a finitary biframe $\mathcal{L}$ the ordered
collection of all its pointfree bisubspaces (i.e. its biquotients) is studied.
It is shown that this collection is bitopological in three meaningful ways. In
particular it is shown that, apart from the assembly $\mathsf{A}(\mathcal{L})$
of a finitary biframe $\mathcal{L}$, there are two other structures
$\mathsf{A}_{cf}(\mathcal{L})$ and $\mathsf{A}_{\pm}(\mathcal{L})$, which both
have the same main component as $\mathsf{A}(\mathcal{L})$. The main component
of both $\mathsf{A}_{cf}(\mathcal{L})$ and $\mathsf{A}_{\pm}(\mathcal{L})$ is
the ordered collection of all biquotients of $\mathcal{L}$. The structure
$\mathsf{A}_{cf}(\mathcal{L})$ being a biframe shows that the collection of all
biquotients is generated by the frame of the patch-closed biquotients together
with that of the patch-fitted ones. The structure
$\mathsf{A}_{\pm}(\mathcal{L})$ being a biframe shows the collection of all
biquotients is generated by the frame of the positive biquotients together with
that of the negative ones. Notions of fitness and subfitness for finitary
biframes are introduced, and it is shown that the analogues of both
characterization theorems for these axioms appearing in Picado and Pultr (2011)
hold. A spatial, bitopological version of these theorems is proven, in which
finitary biframes whose spectrum is pairwise $T_1$ are characterized, among
other things in terms of the spectrum of $\mathsf{A}_{cf}(\mathcal{L})$.

  text overlap with arXiv:2001.06948",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Humans, domestic animals, orchard crops, and ornamental plants are commonly
treated with antibiotics in response to bacterial infection. By curing
infectious individuals, antibiotic therapy might limit the spread of contagious
disease among hosts. But an antibiotic`s suppression of within-host pathogen
density might also reduce the probability that the host is otherwise removed
from infectious status prior to therapeutic recovery. When rates of both
recovery via treatment and other removal events (e.g., isolation or mortality)
depend directly on within-host pathogen density, antibiotic treatment can relax
the overall removal rate sufficiently to increase between-host disease
transmission. To explore this dependence, a deterministic within-host dynamics
drives the infectious host's time-dependent probability of disease
transmission, as well as the probabilistic duration of the infectious period.
At the within-host scale, the model varies (1) inoculum size, (2) bacterial
self-regulation, (3) the time between infection and initiation of therapy, and
(4) antibiotic efficacy. At the between-host scale the model varies (5) the
size/susceptibility of groups randomly encountered by an infectious host.
Results identify conditions where antibiotic treatment can increase duration of
a host`s infectiousness, and consequently increase the expected number of new
infections. At lower antibiotic efficacy, treatment might convert a rare,
serious bacterial disease into a common, but treatable infection.

Specifically, we focus on the contribution of {\it beat coupling} in the
intrinsic alignments as a part of full cosmic shear signal under flat sky
approximation. The SSC-effect grows by going to lower redshift bin and
indicates considerable footprint on the intermediate and high multipoles for
cumulative signal to noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is reduced by $\approx 10\%$ as
a consequence of including the intrinsic alignments super-sample covariance,
for the full cosmic shear signal, depending on the amplitude of intrinsic
alignments, the ellipticity dispersion and the survey redshift ranges, while
the contribution of photometric redshift error can be ignored in the cumulative
signal to noise ratio. Using the Fisher-matrix formalism, we find that the
impact of large modes beyond the volume of the surveys on the small modes
alters the intrinsic alignments. However, corresponding impact on the
cosmological parameters estimation is marginal compared to that of for
gravitational weak lensing, particularly, when all available redshift bins are
considered. Our results also demonstrate that, including SSC-effect on the
intrinsic alignments in the analytical covariance matrix of full cosmic shear
leads to increase marginally the confidence interval for $\sigma_8$ by $\approx
10\%$ for a sample with almost high intrinsic alignments amplitude.

balancing often requires finding sequences of fixed and sliding contacts and
planning the transition from one contact in the environment to another.
However, most existing algorithms concentrate on the control and learning
aspect of sliding contacts, but do not embed the problem into a principled
framework to provide guarantees on completeness or optimality. To address this
problem, we propose a method to extend constraint-based planning using contact
transitions for sliding contacts. Such transitions are elementary operations
required for whole contact sequences. To model sliding contacts, we define a
sliding contact constraint that permits the robot to slide on the surface of a
mesh-based object. To exploit transitions between sliding contacts, we develop
a contact transition sampler, which uses three constraint modes: contact with a
start surface, no contact and contact with a goal surface. We sample these
transition modes uniformly which makes them usable with sampling-based planning
algorithms. Our method is evaluated by testing it on manipulator arms of two,
three and seven internal degrees of freedom with different objects and various
sampling-based planning algorithms. This demonstrates that sliding contact
constraints could be used as an elementary method for planning long-horizon
contact sequences for high-dimensional robotic systems.

numerous short filaments connecting to the major filaments at local intensity
peaks. We estimate the local orientations of filaments, magnetic field,
gravity, and velocity gradients from observations, and we examine their
correlations based on their local properties. In the high-density areas, our
analysis shows that the filaments tend to align with the magnetic field and
local gravity. In the low-density areas, we find that the local velocity
gradients tend to be perpendicular to both the magnetic field and local
gravity, although the filaments still tend to align with local gravity. A
global virial analysis suggests that the gravitational energy overall dominates
the magnetic and kinematic energy. Combining local and global aspects, we
conclude that the formation of G33.92+0.11 is predominantly driven by gravity,
dragging and aligning the major filaments and magnetic field on the way to the
inner dense center. Traced by local velocity gradients in the outer diffuse
areas, ambient gas might be accreted onto the major filaments directly or via
the short filaments.

complexity, two low-complexity localization methods are designed. The first
method is from BS to trajectory (BST), called LCSL-BST. First, fixing the nth
BS, by exploiting multiple measurements along trajectory, the position of UAV
is computed by ML rule. Finally, all computed positions of UAV for different

joint ML and separate LCSL-BST methods have made a significant improvement over
conventional ML method without use of trajectory knowledge in terms of location

datasets for human social dynamics has been extensively studied, yet its
understanding still remains incomplete. Considering the fact that humans are
social beings, a fundamental question arises: Is the bursty human dynamics
dominated by individual characteristics or by interaction between individuals?
In this paper we address this question by analyzing the Wikipedia edit history
to see how spontaneous individual editors are in initiating bursty periods of
editing, i.e., individual-driven burstiness, and to what extent such editors'
behaviors are driven by interaction with other editors in those periods, i.e.,
interaction-driven burstiness. We quantify the degree of initiative (DoI) of an
editor of interest in each Wikipedia article by using the statistics of bursty
periods containing the editor's edits. The integrated value of the DoI over all
relevant timescales reveals which is dominant between individual-driven and
interaction-driven burstiness. We empirically find that this value tends to be
larger for weaker temporal correlations in the editor's editing behavior and/or
stronger editorial correlations. These empirical findings are successfully
confirmed by deriving an analytic form of the DoI from a model capturing the
essential features of the edit sequence. Thus our approach provides a deeper
insight into the origin and underlying mechanisms of bursts in human social
dynamics.

The main findings of our studies are as follows: T Sex, unlike all RRc stars
whose space photometry has been analysed, shows only the $0.5f_x$ frequency as
an additional pulsation frequency. With this, T Sex may be the first represent
of such rare RRc stars found from space photometry. The spectroscopic data show
a periodic distortion of the H$\alpha$ line with the pulsation phase. This
phenomenon has not been reported for any RR Lyrae stars. The characteristic
line distortion is probably caused by the turbulent convection, which resulted
in higher macroturbulent velocity for T Sex than for typical RRab stars. Line
doubling of the Na D line was observed between the 0.37 and 0.80 pulsation
phases. The explanation of this phenomenon is that the two absorption
components originate from different sources. The redder component comes from
the pulsating atmosphere of the star, while the bluer one from the interstellar
space. At phase 0.438, we detected emission on the Na D line, which may
indicate a weak shock wave.

C-rich AGBs, although its contribution to the total SiH$_4$ abundance may be
low in comparison with the suggested formation route by catalytic reactions on
the surface of dust grains. In addition, the produced a-Si:H dust analogs
decompose into SiH$_4$ and Si$_2$H$_6$ at temperatures above 500 K, suggesting
an additional mechanism of formation of these species in envelopes around
evolved stars. We have also found that the exposure of these dust analogs to
water vapor leads to the incorporation of oxygen into Si-O-Si and Si-OH groups

two being the fast subsystem bifurcation that they approach, saddle-node of
cycles for the former and subcritical Hopf for the latter. We first showcase
such dynamics in a Wilson-Cowan type elliptic bursting model, then we consider
minimal models for elliptic bursters in view of finding transitions to and from
bursting solutions via both kinds of torus canards. We first consider the
canonical model proposed by Izhikevich (ref. [22] in the manuscript) and
adapted to elliptic bursting by Ju, Neiman, Shilnikov (ref. [24] in the

to a nongeneric transition at one end of the bursting regime. We therefore
introduce a perturbative term in the slow equation, which extends this
canonical form to a new one that we call Leidenator and which supports the
right transitions to and from elliptic bursting via classical and mixed-type
torus canards, respectively. Throughout the study, we use singular flows
($\varepsilon=0$) to predict the full system's dynamics ($\varepsilon>0$ small
enough). We consider three singular flows: slow, fast and average slow, so as
to appropriately construct singular orbits corresponding to all relevant

The function $f(n, p, q)$ is the minimum number of colors needed for $K_n$ to

was studied systematically by Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s in 1997, and is now

spectroscopic analysis of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz. Our
follow-up observations started $<$10 days after the source began to brighten in
the optical and lasted for a period of six months. Our late-time host-dominated
spectrum indicates that the host galaxy likely harbors a weak active galactic
nucleus. The initial {\it Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} spectrum of AT2019qiz
exhibits an iron and low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) system that
is seen for the first time in a TDE. This spectrum also bears a striking
resemblance to that of Gaia16apd, a superluminous supernova. Our observations
provide insights into the outflow properties in TDEs and show evidence for a
connection between TDEs and engine-powered supernovae at early phase, as
originally suggested in Metzger & Stone (2016). In a time frame of 50 days, the
UV spectra of AT2019qiz started to resemble previous TDEs with only
high-ionization BALs. The change in UV spectral signatures is accompanied by a
decrease in the outflow velocity, which began at $15,000$ km s$^{-1}$ and
decelerated to $\sim10,000$ km s$^{-1}$. A similar evolution in the H$\alpha$
emission line width further supports the speculation that the broad Balmer
emission lines are formed in TDE outflows. In addition, we detect narrow
absorption features on top of the FeLoBAL signatures in the early HST UV
spectrum of AT2019qiz. The measured HI column density corresponds to a
Lyman-limit system whereas the metal absorption lines, such as NV, CIV, FeII,
and MgII, are likely probing the circumnuclear gas and interstellar medium in
the host galaxy.

which textual units are assigned to an emotion from a predefined inventory
(e.g., fear, joy, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, trust, anticipation). More
recently, semantic role labeling approaches have been developed to extract
structures from the text to answer questions like: ""who is described to feel
the emotion?"" (experiencer), ""what causes this emotion?"" (stimulus), and at
which entity is it directed?"" (target). Though it has been shown that jointly
modeling stimulus and emotion category prediction is beneficial for both
subtasks, it remains unclear which of these semantic roles enables a classifier
to infer the emotion. Is it the experiencer, because the identity of a person
is biased towards a particular emotion (X is always happy)? Is it a particular
target (everybody loves X) or a stimulus (doing X makes everybody sad)? We
answer these questions by training emotion classification models on five
available datasets annotated with at least one semantic role by masking the
fillers of these roles in the text in a controlled manner and find that across
multiple corpora, stimuli and targets carry emotion information, while the
experiencer might be considered a confounder. Further, we analyze if informing
the model about the position of the role improves the classification decision.
Particularly on literature corpora we find that the role information improves

shown to yield excellent numerical accuracy in condensed-phase systems with
large time-steps. Here, we introduce a broader class of T-RPMD numerical
integrators that exhibit strong stability and dimensionality freedom,
irrespective of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck friction schedule. In addition to
considering equilibrium accuracy and time-step stability as in previous work,
we evaluate the integrators on the basis of their rates of convergence to
equilibrium and their efficiency at evaluating equilibrium expectation values.
Within the generalized class, we find BCOCB to be superior with respect to
accuracy and efficiency for various configuration-dependent observables,
although other integrators within the generalized class perform better for
velocity-dependent quantities. Extensive numerical evidence indicates that the
stated performance guarantees hold for the strongly anharmonic case of liquid

with a simple convergence analysis, we find that certain Parareal
configurations can achieve parallel speedup on non-diffusive equations. These
stable configurations all posses low iteration counts, large block sizes, and a
large number of processors. Numerical examples using the nonlinear Schrodinger

the scale factor $a\propto (-t)^{-p}$ ($p>0$), which gives the tensor spectral
index $n_t=2/(p+1)>0$. To evade the constraint from Big Bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN), we connect the NEC-violating phase to a subsequent short slow-roll
inflationary phase which ends with standard reheating, and thereby reduce the
high frequency part of the spectrum. An explicit model is constructed within
the cubic Horndeski theory which allows for stable violation of the NEC. We
present numerical examples of the background evolution having the different
maximal Hubble parameters (which determine the peak amplitude of gravitational
waves), the different inflationary Hubble parameters (which determine the
amplitudes of high frequency gravitational waves), and different durations of
the inflationary phase (which essentially determine the peak frequency of the
spectrum). We display the spectra with $n_t=0.8$, $0.9$, and $0.95$ for
$f\lesssim 1/{\rm yr}$, which are consistent with the recent NANOGrav result.
We also check that they do not contradict the BBN constraint. We discuss how
the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations is produced in
the NEC-violating phase.

although a large portion of the static semantics (e.g., UML) seems to have
reached a consensus, the dynamic semantics of activities, interactions, and
state machines poses a major challenge. Central to semantics is the
relationship between a sentence and the (actual) world. Carefully examining
semantics-related issues in the modeling languages field to avoid problems that
may affect practical applicability is important. One effort in this direction
is OMG s release of a 2020 draft specification for Foundational UML (fUML),
with the base semantics specifying executions that are executable in the same
sense as a program in a traditional programming language. Additionally, efforts
within academia have sought to develop an alternative approach to modeling
languages using formal semantics (e.g., using Russell s theory of types and
Tarski s declarative semantics). This paper aims at a similar exploratory
venture of developing semantics, only for a much more modest diagrammatic
modeling language, called the thinging machine model. The model promotes a deep
understanding of the scrutinized modeling language and leads to considerably
fruitful questions. Constructing the thinging machine model seems to facilitate
progress in this direction, and the initial results in this paper indicate the
viability of the approach.

generalization of empirical risk minimization that accounts for the presence of
underrepresented subdomains in the training dataset. Ranger is a generalization
of the widely used Adam optimizer that is more stable with small batch size and
noisy labels. We found that each of those variations of the optimization of

dicrepancy indexes, starting from the classical Maximum Likelihood definition,
and adapting the corresponding basic principle of inference to situations where
minimization of those indexes between a model and some extension of the
empirical measure of the data appears as its natural extension. This leads to
the so called generalized bootstrap setting for which minimum divergence
inference seems to replace Maximum Likelihood one. 1 Motivation and context
Divergences between probability measures are widely used in Statistics and Data
Science in order to perform inference under models of various kinds,
paramet-ric or semi parametric, or even in non parametric settings. The
corresponding methods extend the likelihood paradigm and insert inference in
some minimum ""distance"" framing, which provides a convenient description for
the properties of the resulting estimators and tests, under the model or under
misspecifica-tion. Furthermore they pave the way to a large number of
competitive methods , which allows for trade-off between efficiency and
robustness, among others. Many families of such divergences have been proposed,
some of them stemming from classical statistics (such as the Chi-square), while
others have their origin in other fields such as Information theory. Some
measures of discrepancy involve regularity of the corresponding probability
measures while others seem to be restricted to measures on finite or countable
spaces, at least when using them as inferential tools, henceforth in situations
when the elements of a model have to be confronted with a dataset. The choice
of a specific discrepancy measure in specific context is somehow arbitrary in
many cases, although the resulting conclusion of the inference might differ
accordingly, above all under misspecification; however the need for such
approaches is clear when aiming at robustness.

disconnected regions: an exterior region and an interior region. Depending on

explainable artificial intelligence. These values are designed to attribute the
difference between a model's prediction and an average baseline to the
different features used as input to the model. Being based on solid
game-theoretic principles, Shapley values uniquely satisfy several desirable
properties, which is why they are increasingly used to explain the predictions
of possibly complex and highly non-linear machine learning models. Shapley
values are well calibrated to a user's intuition when features are independent,
but may lead to undesirable, counterintuitive explanations when the
independence assumption is violated.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing Shapley values that
generalizes recent work that aims to circumvent the independence assumption. By
employing Pearl's do-calculus, we show how these 'causal' Shapley values can be
derived for general causal graphs without sacrificing any of their desirable
properties. Moreover, causal Shapley values enable us to separate the
contribution of direct and indirect effects. We provide a practical
implementation for computing causal Shapley values based on causal chain graphs
when only partial information is available and illustrate their utility on a
real-world example.

strengths of a few microGauss obtained from Faraday Rotation. Evidence for
cluster magnetic fields is also provided by Megaparsec-scale radio emission,
namely radio halos and relics. These are commonly found in merging systems and
are characterized by a steep radio spectrum. It is widely believed that
magneto-hydrodynamical turbulence and shock-waves (re-)accelerate cosmic rays,
producing halos and relics. The origin and the amplification of magnetic fields
in clusters is not well understood. It has been proposed that turbulence drives
a small-scaledynamo that amplifies seed magnetic fields (primordial and/or
injected by galactic outflows, as active galactic nuclei, starbursts, or
winds). At high redshift, radio halos are expected to be faint, due to the
Inverse Compton losses and dimming effect with distance. Moreover, Faraday
Rotation measurements are difficult to obtain. If detected, distant radio
halosprovide an alternative tool to investigate magnetic field amplification.
Here, we report LOFAR observations which reveal diffuse radio emission in
massive clusters when the Universe was only half of its present age, with a
sample occurrence fraction of about 50%. The high radio luminosities indicate
that these clusters have similar magnetic field strengths to those in nearby
clusters, and suggest that magnetic field amplification is fast during the
first phases ofcluster formation.

most recent CMB data from Planck (2018) to infer new constraints on the decay
parameters with which we compare the constraints inferred by the previous
Planck data (2015). We hereby show that the newest CMB data constrains the
fractional amount of DCDM twice as much as the previous data in the long-lived
regime, leading to our current best 2$\sigma$ upper bound of $f_{\rm
dcdm}<2.44\%$. In the short-lived regime, we get a slightly looser 2$\sigma$
upper bound of $f_{\rm dcdm}<13.1\%$ compared to the previous CMB data. If we
include Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data from BOSS DR-12, the constraints in
both the long-lived and the short-lived regimes relax to $f_{\rm dcdm}<2.62\%$
and $f_{\rm dcdm}<1.49\%$, respectively. We also investigate how this model
impacts the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, and we find that each of the decay
regimes can slightly relieve a different one of the tensions. The model can
thus not accommodate both tensions at once, and the improvements on each are
not significant. We furthermore improve on previous work by thoroughly
analysing the impacts of short-lived DCDM on the radiation density and deriving
a mapping between short-lived DCDM and a correction, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, to

Collected data is analysed and used to offer individual discounts based on

differ only in the position of a proton and a double bond. Tautomerization
often occurs in natural substances and is a fundamental process in organic- and
biochemistry. However, studying the optical properties of tautomeric species is
challenging due to ensemble averaging. Many molecules, such as porphines,
porphycenes or phenanthroperylene quinones, exhibit a reorientation of the
transition dipole moment (TDM) during tautomerization, which can be directly
observed in a single molecule experiment. A prominent phenanthroperylene
quinone is hypericin showing antiviral, antidepressive, and photodynamical
properties. Here, we study single hypericin molecules by using confocal

the image pattern allows to draw conclusions about the coexistence of different
tautomers and their conversion path. Time-dependent density functional theory
calculations show that hypericin is cycling between the four most stable
tautomers. This approach allows to unambiguously assign a TDM orientation to a
specific tautomer and enables to determine the chemical structure in situ.
Additionally, tautomerization can not only be observed by the image pattern
orientation, but also as intermittency in the fluorescence emission of a single
molecule. Time correlated single photon counting enables to determine the
excited state lifetimes of the hypericin tautomers. Our approach is not only
limited to hypericin, but can be applied to other molecules showing a TDM
reorientation during tautomerization, helping to get a deeper understanding of
this important process.

Inductive machine learning method was used to build business process models
based on actual event log data obtained from a hotel's Property Management
System (PMS). The PMS can be considered as a Multi Agent System (MAS) because
it is integrated with a variety of external systems and IoT devices. Collected
event log combines data on guests stay recorded by hotel staff, as well as data
streams captured from telephone exchange and other external IoT devices. Next,
we performed automated analysis of the discovered process models using formal
methods. Spin model checker was used to simulate process model executions and
automatically verify the process model. We proposed an algorithm for the
automatic transformation of the discovered process model into a verification
model. Additionally, we developed a generator of positive and negative
examples. In the verification stage, we have also used Linear temporal logic
(LTL) to define requested system specifications. We find that the analysis
results will be well suited for process model repair.

propagation in modelling of flow through heterogeneous porous media is
presented. The method is also used for reducing dimensionality of model output
and consequently emulating highly complex relationship between hydrogeological
properties and reduced order fluid velocity field in a tractable manner. Deep
GPs are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of GPs with multiple,
infinitely wide hidden layers that are very efficient models for deep learning
and modelling of high-dimensional complex systems by tackling the complexity
through several hidden layers connected with non-linear mappings. According to
this approach, the hydrogeological data is modelled as the output of a
multivariate GP whose inputs are governed by another GP such that each single
layer is either a standard GP or the Gaussian process latent variable model. A
variational approximation framework is used so that the posterior distribution
of the model outputs associated to given inputs can be analytically
approximated. In contrast to the other dimensionality reduction, methods that
do not provide any information about the dimensionality of each hidden layer,
the proposed method automatically selects the dimensionality of each hidden
layer and it can be used to propagate uncertainty obtained in each layer across
the hierarchy. Using this, dimensionality of the full input space consists of
both geometrical parameters of modelling domain and stochastic hydrogeological
parameters can be simultaneously reduced without the need for any
simplifications generally being assumed for stochastic modelling of subsurface
flow problems. It allows estimation of the flow statistics with greatly reduced
computational efforts compared to other stochastic approaches such as Monte
Carlo method.

objects, showing a high level of fragmentation. We present optical Halpha and
[SII], and VLA NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) observations with an angular resolution
of ~3.5''. The observed NH$_3$ spectra have been analyzed with the HfS tool,
fitting simultaneously three different velocity components. The NH$_3$ emission
from L1287 comes from four different structures: a core associated with RNO 1,
a guitar-shaped core (the ""Guitar"") and two interlaced filaments (the Blue and
Red Filaments) roughly centered towards the binary FU Ori system RNO 1B/C and
its associated cluster. Regarding the Guitar Core, there are clear signatures
of gas infall onto a central mass that has been estimated to be ~2.1 $M_\odot$.
Regarding the two filaments, they have radii ~0.03 pc, masses per unit length
~50 $M_\odot$ pc$^{-1}$, and are near isothermal equilibrium. A central cavity,
probably related with the outflow, and also traced by the Halpha and [SII]
emission, is identified, with several young stellar objects near its inner
walls. Both filaments show clear signs of perturbation by the high-velocity gas
of the outflows driven by one or several young stellar objects of the cluster.
The Blue and Red filaments are coherent in velocity and have nearly subsonic
gas motions, except at the position of the embedded sources. Velocity gradients
across the Blue Filament can be interpreted either as infalling material onto
the filament or rotation. Velocity gradients along the filaments are
interpreted as infall motions towards a gravitational well at the intersection
of both filaments.

Machine Learning models, particularly for those that are mathematically
sophisticated. Computing Shapley Values are arguably the best approach so far
to find the importance of each feature in a model, at the row level. In other
words, Shapley values represent the importance of a feature for a particular
row, especially for Classification or Regression problems. One of the biggest
limitations of Shapley vales is that, Shapley value calculations assume all the
features are uncorrelated (independent of each other), this assumption is often
incorrect. To address this problem, we present a unified framework to calculate
Shapley values with correlated features. To be more specific, we do an
adjustment (Matrix formulation) of the features while calculating Independent
Shapley values for the rows. Moreover, we have given a Mathematical proof
against the said adjustments. With these adjustments, Shapley values
(Importance) for the features become independent of the correlations existing
between them. We have also enhanced this adjustment concept for more than
features. As the Shapley values are additive, to calculate combined effect of
two features, we just have to add their individual Shapley values. This is
again not right if one or more of the features (used in the combination) are
correlated with the other features (not in the combination). We have addressed
this problem also by extending the correlation adjustment for one feature to
multiple features in the said combination for which Shapley values are
determined. Our implementation of this method proves that our method is
computationally efficient also, compared to original Shapley method.

of two-dimensional cluster-forming monodisperse particles in presence of
pinning disorder. The pairwise interaction potential is nonmonotonic, and is
motivated by the intervortex forces in type-$1.5$ superconductors. Such systems
can form cluster glasses due to the intervortex interactions following a
thermal quench, without underlying disorder. We study the effects of vortex
pinning in these systems. We find that a small density of pinning centers of
moderate depth has limited effect on vortex glass formation, i.e., formation of
vortex glasses is dominated by intervortex interactions. At higher densities
pinning can significantly affect glass formation. The cluster glass depinning,
under a constant driving force, is found to be plastic, with features distinct
from non-cluster-forming systems such as clusters merging and breaking. We find
that in general vortices with cluster-forming interaction forces can exhibit
stronger pinning effects than regular vortices.

the spectra from the diagonalization of Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble matrices

the classical Monte-Carlo sampling and control variates techniques with two
merits: 1) The proposed stochastic rules make the dimension of the feature
mapping flexibly varying, such that we can control the discrepancy between the
original and approximate kernels by tuning the dimnension. 2) Our stochastic
rules have nice statistical properties of unbiasedness and variance reduction
with fast convergence rate. In addition, we elucidate the relationship between
our deterministic/stochastic interpolatory rules and current quadrature rules

consensus-based systems benefit from weighted replication, an approach that
utilizes extra replicas and assigns higher voting power to well connected
replicas. This enables more choice in quorum formation and replicas can
leverage proportionally smaller quorums to advance, thus decreasing consensus
latency. However, the system needs a solution to autonomously adjust to its
environment if network conditions change or faults occur. We present Adaptive
Wide-Area REplication (AWARE), a mechanism which improves the geographical

Essentially, AWARE is an automated and dynamic voting weight tuning and leader

It employs a reliable self-monitoring process and provides a prediction model

supermassive black hole, so stars follow quasi-Keplerian orbits. These orbits
are distorted by gravitational forces from other stars, leading to long-term
orbital relaxation. The direct numerical study of these processes is
challenging because the fast orbital motion imposed by the central black hole
requires very small timesteps. An alternative approach, pioneered by Gauss, is
to use the secular approximation of smearing out the $N$ stars over their
Keplerian orbits, using $K$ nodes along each orbit. In this study we propose
three novel improvements to this method. First, we re-formulate the
discretisation of the rates of change of the variables describing the orbital
states to ensure that all conservation laws are exactly satisfied. Second, we
replace the pairwise sum over nodes by a multipole expansion up to order
$\ell_{\mathrm{max}}$, reducing the overall computational costs from
$O(N^2K^2)$ to $O(NK\ell_{\mathrm{max}}^2)$. Finally, we show that the averaged
dynamical system is equivalent to $2N$ interacting unit spin vectors and
provide two time integrators: a second-order symplectic scheme and a
fourth-order Lie-group Runge-Kutta method, both of which are straightforward to
generalize to higher order. These new simulations recover the diffusion

convert the set of triples into a sequence in the training phase. To break this
bottleneck, we treat joint entity and relation extraction as a direct set
prediction problem, so that the extraction model can get rid of the burden of
predicting the order of multiple triples. To solve this set prediction problem,
we propose networks featured by transformers with non-autoregressive parallel
decoding. Unlike autoregressive approaches that generate triples one by one in
a certain order, the proposed networks directly output the final set of triples
in one shot. Furthermore, we also design a set-based loss that forces unique
predictions via bipartite matching. Compared with cross-entropy loss that
highly penalizes small shifts in triple order, the proposed bipartite matching
loss is invariant to any permutation of predictions; thus, it can provide the
proposed networks with a more accurate training signal by ignoring triple order

first step has been made to standardize consumer wireless communications in the
sub-THz frequency band. The IEEE 802.15.3d offers switched point-to-point
connectivity with the data rates of 100\,Gbit/s and higher at distances ranging
from tens of centimeters up to a few hundred meters. In this article, we
provide a detailed introduction to the IEEE 802.15.3d and the key design
principles beyond the developed standard. We particularly describe the target
applications and usage scenarios, as well as the specifics of the IEEE
802.15.3d physical and medium access layers. Later, we present the results of
the initial performance evaluation of IEEE 802.15.3d wireless communications.
The obtained first-order performance predictions show non-incremental benefits
compared to the characteristics of the fifth-generation wireless systems, thus
paving the way towards the six-generation (6G) THz networks. We conclude the
article by outlining the further standardization and regulatory activities on
wireless networking in the THz frequency band.

security of the internet. An attack targeting such devices can affect an entire
autonomous system. In recent years, malware such as VPNFilter, Navidade, and
SonarDNS has been used to compromise low-cost routers and commit all sorts of
cybercrimes from DDoS attacks to ransomware deployments. Routers of the type
concerned are used both to provide last-mile access for home users and to
manage interdomain routing (BGP). MikroTik is a particular brand of low-cost
router. In our previous research, we found more than 4 million MikroTik routers
available on the internet. We have shown that these devices are also popular in
Internet Exchange infrastructures. Despite their popularity, these devices are
known to have numerous vulnerabilities. In this paper, we extend our previous
analysis by presenting a long-term investigation of MikroTik-targeted attacks.
By using a highly interactive honeypot that we developed, we collected more
than 44 million packets over 120 days, from sensors deployed in Australia,
Brazil, China, India, the Netherlands, and the United States. The incoming
traffic was classified on the basis of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures to
detect attacks targeting MikroTik devices. That enabled us to identify a wide
range of activities on the system, such as cryptocurrency mining, DNS server
redirection, and more than 3,000 successfully established tunnels used for
eavesdropping. Although this research focuses on Mikrotik devices, both the
methodology and the publicly available scripts can be easily applied to any

  Based Model Re-initialization","To appear in ISCSLP2021",,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dysarthric speech recognition is a challenging task as dysarthric data is
limited and its acoustics deviate significantly from normal speech. Model-based
speaker adaptation is a promising method by using the limited dysarthric speech
to fine-tune a base model that has been pre-trained from large amounts of
normal speech to obtain speaker-dependent models. However, statistic
distribution mismatches between the normal and dysarthric speech data limit the
adaptation performance of the base model. To address this problem, we propose
to re-initialize the base model via meta-learning to obtain a better model
initialization. Specifically, we focus on end-to-end models and extend the
model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) and Reptile algorithms to meta update the
base model by repeatedly simulating adaptation to different dysarthric
speakers. As a result, the re-initialized model acquires dysarthric speech
knowledge and learns how to perform fast adaptation to unseen dysarthric
speakers with improved performance. Experimental results on UASpeech dataset
show that the best model with proposed methods achieves 54.2% and 7.6% relative
word error rate reduction compared with the base model without finetuning and
the model directly fine-tuned from the base model, respectively, and it is
comparable with the state-of-the-art hybrid DNN-HMM model.

Non-interacting topological materials, such as e.g., topological insulators and
superconductors, are classified by means of fundamental symmetry classes. It is
instead only partially understood how interactions affect topological
properties. Here, we discuss a model where topology emerges from the quantum
interference between single-particle dynamics and global interactions. The
system is composed by soft-core bosons that interact via global correlated
hopping in a one-dimensional lattice. The onset of quantum interference leads
to spontaneous breaking of the lattice translational symmetry, the
corresponding phase resembles nontrivial states of the celebrated
Su-Schriefer-Heeger model. Like the fermionic Peierls instability, the emerging
quantum phase is a topological insulator and is found at half fillings.
Originating from quantum interference, this topological phase is found in
""exact"" density-matrix renormalization group calculations and is entirely
absent in the mean-field approach. We argue that these dynamics can be realized
in existing experimental platforms, such as cavity quantum electrodynamics
setups, where the topological features can be revealed in the light emitted by
the resonator.

vividly illustrating how certain rotational effects, particularly those due to
non-zero angular momentum, can depend on more than just relations between
material bodies. Because of such effects, rotation has played a central role in
the absolute-relational debate and poses a particularly difficult challenge to
the relationalist. In this paper, we provide a qualified response to this
challenge that significantly weakens the absolutist position. We present a
theory that, contrary to orthodoxy, can account for all rotational effects
without introducing, as the absolutist does, a fixed standard of rotation.
Instead, our theory posits a universal SO(3) charge that plays the role of
angular momentum and couples to inter-particle relations via terms commonly
seen in standard gauge theories such as electromagnetism and the Standard Model
of particle physics. Our theory makes use of an enriched form of relationalism:
it adds an SO(3) structure to the traditional relational description. Our
construction is made possible by the modern tools of gauge theory, which reveal
a simple relational law describing rotational effects. In this way, we can save
the phenomena of Newtonian mechanics using conserved charges and relationalism.
In a second paper, we will further explore the ontological and explanatory
implications of the theory developed here.

  Neural Machine Translation","Accepted at WMT 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Zero-shot neural machine translation is an attractive goal because of the
high cost of obtaining data and building translation systems for new
translation directions. However, previous papers have reported mixed success in
zero-shot translation. It is hard to predict in which settings it will be
effective, and what limits performance compared to a fully supervised system.
In this paper, we investigate zero-shot performance of a multilingual
EN$\leftrightarrow${FR,CS,DE,FI} system trained on WMT data. We find that
zero-shot performance is highly unstable and can vary by more than 6 BLEU
between training runs, making it difficult to reliably track improvements. We
observe a bias towards copying the source in zero-shot translation, and
investigate how the choice of subword segmentation affects this bias. We find
that language-specific subword segmentation results in less subword copying at
training time, and leads to better zero-shot performance compared to jointly
trained segmentation. A recent trend in multilingual models is to not train on
parallel data between all language pairs, but have a single bridge language,
e.g. English. We find that this negatively affects zero-shot translation and
leads to a failure mode where the model ignores the language tag and instead
produces English output in zero-shot directions. We show that this bias towards
English can be effectively reduced with even a small amount of parallel data in
some of the non-English pairs.

derivations are provided under general assumptions, supporting the
identification and the interpretation of the contribution of different
variability sources. Under both homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity,
several variance estimates are proposed, investigated, and numerically tested,
showing their effectiveness in replicating the expected variance behaviours.
Finally, the feasibility of confidence intervals estimation is discussed by
adopting a critical approach, hence raising the awareness of ELM users

Because it is impossible to obtain clean and BCG-contaminated EEG signals at
the same time, BCG artifact removal is a typical unpaired signal-to-signal
problem. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a new GAN training model -
Single Shot Reversible GAN (SSRGAN). The model is allowing bidirectional input
to better combine the characteristics of the two types of signals, instead of
using two independent models for bidirectional conversion as in the past.
Furthermore, the model is decomposed into multiple independent convolutional
blocks with specific functions. Through additional training of the blocks, the
local representation ability of the model is improved, thereby improving the
overall model performance. Experimental results show that, compared with
existing methods, the method proposed in this paper can remove BCG artifacts

Descent (SGD) with MICE, which, combined with the above characteristics, yields
an efficient and robust stochastic optimizer. To assess the efficiency of MICE,

force depends on an extra parameter -- interpolating between zero and the full
strength of the csG model -- while the background expansion history is
independent of this parameter. It offers an interesting alternative to
LambdaCDM in explaining the cosmic acceleration, as well as a solution to the
tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant H_0.

to the hypothesis, the far-field image of a subwavelength scatterer strongly
coupled to a microsphere by near fields is offered by the scatterer
polarization normal to the sphere surface. The radiation of a closely located
normally oriented dipole is shaped by the microsphere so that the transmitted
wave beam has a practically flat phase front. Then this beam turns out to be
imaging -- keeping the subwavelength information about the dipole location.
However, this mechanism of subwavelength imaging was only supposed in our
previous paper. In this paper, we present a theoretical study which confirms
this hypothesis and better explains the underlying physics. In several
scenarios of the imaging beam evolution either a flat or a slightly diverging
phase front of the hollow wave beam formed by a microsphere enables the deeply
subwavelength ($0.1-0.2\lambda$) resolution of two dipole sources. We
numerically simulate one of these scenarios -- that one in which the focusing
lens is located closer than the Rayleigh diffraction length to the beam-forming
microsphere and represents a microsphere itself. In our simulations we replace
a 3D microsphere by a 2D ""sphere"" (microcylinder) so that to use an available

particles for two types of kernels with arbitrary parameters, a condensation
(or branched-chain polymerization) kernel, $K(i,j)=(A+i)(A+j)$, and a linear
combination of the constant and additive kernels, $K(i,j)=A+i+j$. They were
solved under monodisperse initial conditions in the combinatorial approach
where discreet time is counted as subsequent states of the system. A generating
function method and Lagrange inversion were used for derivations. Expressions
for an average number of clusters of a given size and its corresponding
standard deviation were obtained and tested against numerical simulation. High
precision of the theoretical predictions can be observed for a wide range of
$A$ and coagulation stages, excepting post-gel phase in the case of the
condensation kernel (a giant cluster presence is preserved). For appropriate
$A$, these two kernels reproduced known results of the constant, additive and
product kernels. Beside a previously solved linear-chain kernel, they extend
the number of arbitrary-parameter kernels solved in the combinatorial approach.

  Abstract",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical model fitting has become commonplace for case-control studies of
cognition and behaviour in mental health. However, these techniques require us
to formalise assumptions about the data-generating process at the group level,
which may not be known. Specifically, researchers typically must choose whether
to assume all subjects are drawn from a common population, or to model them as
deriving from separate populations. These assumptions have profound
implications for computational psychiatry, as they affect the resulting
inference (latent parameter recovery) and may conflate or mask true group-level
differences. To test these assumptions we ran systematic simulations on
synthetic multi-group behavioural data from a commonly used multi-armed bandit
task (reinforcement learning task). We then examined recovery of group
differences in latent parameter space under the two commonly used generative
modelling assumptions: (1) modelling groups under a common shared group-level
prior (assuming all participants are generated from a common distribution, and
are likely to share common characteristics); (2) modelling separate groups
based on symptomatology or diagnostic labels, resulting in separate group-level
priors. We evaluated the robustness of these approaches to variations in data
quality and prior specifications on a variety of metrics. We found that fitting
groups separately (assumptions 2), provided the most accurate and robust
inference across all conditions. Our results suggest that when dealing with
data from multiple clinical groups, researchers should analyse patient and
control groups separately as it provides the most accurate and robust recovery
of the parameters of interest.

behavior of all current practical graph isomorphism algorithms. Given two trees
with colored leaves, the goal is to find two leaves of matching color, one in

promises that for every pair of leaves of equal color there must be a symmetry
(or an isomorphism) that maps one leaf to the other.
  We describe a randomized algorithm with errors for which the number of
visited leaves is quasilinear in the square root of the size of the smaller of
the two trees. For inputs of bounded degree, we develop a Las Vegas algorithm
with a similar running time.
  We prove that these results are optimal up to logarithmic factors. We show a
lower bound for randomized algorithms on inputs of bounded degree that is the
square root of the tree sizes. For inputs of unbounded degree, we show a linear
lower bound for Las Vegas algorithms. For deterministic algorithms we can prove
a linear bound even for inputs of bounded degree. This shows why randomized

Considerable
attention in recent years has been devoted to analyzing and modeling signed
graphs, where the affinity measure between nodes takes either positive or
negative values. Recently, Cucuringu et al. [CDGT 2019] proposed a spectral
method, namely SPONGE (Signed Positive over Negative Generalized Eigenproblem),
which casts the clustering task as a generalized eigenvalue problem optimizing
a suitably defined objective function. This approach is motivated by social
balance theory, where the clustering task aims to decompose a given network
into disjoint groups, such that individuals within the same group are connected
by as many positive edges as possible, while individuals from different groups
are mainly connected by negative edges. Through extensive numerical
simulations, SPONGE was shown to achieve state-of-the-art empirical
performance. On the theoretical front, [CDGT 2019] analyzed SPONGE and the
popular Signed Laplacian method under the setting of a Signed Stochastic Block
Model (SSBM), for $k=2$ equal-sized clusters, in the regime where the graph is
moderately dense.
  In this work, we build on the results in [CDGT 2019] on two fronts for the
normalized versions of SPONGE and the Signed Laplacian. Firstly, for both
algorithms, we extend the theoretical analysis in [CDGT 2019] to the general
setting of $k \geq 2$ unequal-sized clusters in the moderately dense regime.
Secondly, we introduce regularized versions of both methods to handle sparse
graphs -- a regime where standard spectral methods underperform -- and provide
theoretical guarantees under the same SSBM model. To the best of our knowledge,
regularized spectral methods have so far not been considered in the setting of
clustering signed graphs. We complement our theoretical results with an
extensive set of numerical experiments on synthetic data.

localized states. For instance, a conventional $d$ dimensional topological
system hosts $d{-}1$ dimensional surface modes, which are protected by
non-spatial symmetries. Recently, this idea has been extended to higher order
topological phases with boundary modes that are localized in lower dimensions
such as in the corners or in one dimensional hinges of the system. In this
work, we demonstrate that a higher order topological phase can be engineered in
a nonequilibrium state when the time-independent model does not possess any
symmetry protected topological states. The higher order topology is protected
by an emerging chiral symmetry, which is generated through the Floquet driving.
Using both the exact numerical method and an effective high-frequency
Hamiltonian obtained from the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory, we verify

topological phase. Finally, we identify a two dimensional topological invariant
from the winding number of the corresponding sublattice symmetric one
dimensional model. The latter model belongs to class AIII of ten-fold symmetry

We recall a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a factorization
with univariate linear factors that has originally been stated by Skopenkov and
Krasauskas. Such a factorization is, in general, non-unique by known
factorization results for univariate quaternionic polynomials. We unveil
existence of bivariate polynomials with non-unique factorizations that cannot
be explained in this way and characterize them geometrically and algebraically.
Existence of factorizations is related to the existence of special rulings of
two different types (left/right) on the ruled surface parameterized by the
bivariate polynomial in the projective space over the quaternions. Special
non-uniqueness in above sense can be explained algebraically by commutation
properties of factors in suitable factorizations. A necessary geometric
condition for this to happen is degeneration to a point of at least one of the
left/right rulings.

(DIP). Deep image prior can solve inverse problems such as super-resolution,
inpainting and denoising. The main advantage of DIP over other deep learning
approaches is that it does not need access to a large dataset. However, due to
the large number of parameters of the neural network and noisy data, DIP
overfits to the noise in the image as the number of iterations grows. In the
thesis, we use hybrid deep image priors to avoid overfitting. The hybrid priors
are to combine DIP with an explicit prior such as total variation or with an
implicit prior such as a denoising algorithm. We use the alternating direction
method-of-multipliers (ADMM) to incorporate the new prior and try different
forms of ADMM to avoid extra computation caused by the inner loop of ADMM
steps. We also study the relation between the dynamics of gradient descent, and
the overfitting phenomenon. The numerical results show the hybrid priors play
an important role in preventing overfitting. Besides, we try to fit the image
along some directions and find this method can reduce overfitting when the
noise level is large. When the noise level is small, it does not considerably
reduce the overfitting problem.

(WM) implemented by the spiking neuron network (SNN) interacting with a network
of astrocytes. SNN is modelled by the synaptically coupled Izhikevich neurons
with a non-specific architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating
calcium signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings and
interact with neurons by chemicals diffused in the extracellular space. Calcium
elevations occur in response to the increase of concentration of a
neurotransmitter released by spiking neurons when a group of them fire
coherently. In turn, gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes
modulating the strengths of synaptic connections in the corresponding neuronal
group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional patterns of short
applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The output is taken from
frequencies of transient discharges of corresponding neurons. We show how a set
of information patterns with quite significant overlapping areas can be
uploaded into the neuron-astrocyte network and stored for several seconds.
Information retrieval is organised by the application of a cue pattern
representing the one from the memory set distorted by noise. We found that
successful retrieval with level of the correlation between recalled pattern and
ideal pattern more than 90% is possible for multi-item WM task. Having analysed
the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered that astrocytes
operating at a time scale of a dozen of seconds can successfully store traces
of neuronal activations corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval
stage, the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections in SNN
leading to the successful recall. Information and dynamical characteristics of
the proposed WM model agrees with classical concepts and other WM models.

structured representations can considerably improve data-efficiency for
reinforcement learning in domains with limited data such as robotics. Can a
single generally useful representation be found? In order to answer this
question, it is important to understand how the representation will be used by
the agent and what properties such a 'good' representation should have. In this
paper we systematically evaluate a number of common learnt and hand-engineered
representations in the context of three robotics tasks: lifting, stacking and
pushing of 3D blocks. The representations are evaluated in two use-cases: as
input to the agent, or as a source of auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, the value
of each representation is evaluated in terms of three properties:
dimensionality, observability and disentanglement. We can significantly improve
performance in both use-cases and demonstrate that some representations can
perform commensurate to simulator states as agent inputs. Finally, our results
challenge common intuitions by demonstrating that: 1) dimensionality strongly
matters for task generation, but is negligible for inputs, 2) observability of
task-relevant aspects mostly affects the input representation use-case, and 3)
disentanglement leads to better auxiliary tasks, but has only limited benefits
for input representations. This work serves as a step towards a more systematic
understanding of what makes a 'good' representation for control in robotics,
enabling practitioners to make more informed choices for developing new learned

on the elastic characteristics of fractured rocks. Numerical simulation as a
promising way for this issue still faces some challenges. With the rapid
development of computers and computational techniques, discrete-based numerical
approaches with desirable properties have been increasingly developed, but few
attempts to consider the particle surface roughness in a lattice type model.
For this purpose, an integrated numerical scheme accounting rough contact
deformation is developed by coupling modified LSM and DFN modeling for
predicting the effective mechanical properties of a realistic outcrop. Smooth
joint logic is introduced to consider contact and slip behaviors at fracture
surfaces and a modified contact relation to estimating the normal
force-displacement from rough contact deformation. Improved constitutive laws
are developed and employed for rock matrix and rough fracture surface and
implemented in the modified LSM. Complex fracture networks presented by DFNs
are automatically extracted based on the gradient Hough transform algorithm.
This developed framework is validated by classic equivalent medium theories. It
shows the model could be used to emulate naturally-fractured media and to
quantitatively investigate the effects of fracture attributes and micro-scale
surface roughness on the compression mechanism.

necessary to prove theorems of ordinary mathematics, usually working in the

the study of structures that are countable or can be approximated by countable
sets. Now, countable sets are represented by sequences here, because the usual
higher-order definition of `countable set'cannot be expressed in $L_{2}$.
Working in Kohlenbach's higher-order RM, we investigate various central
theorems, e.g. those due to K\""onig, Ramsey, Bolzano, Weierstrass, and Borel,
in their (often original) formulation involving the usual definition(s) of
`countable set' instead of `sequence'. This study turns out to be closely
related to the logical properties of the uncountably of $\mathbb{R}$, recently
developed by the author and Dag Normann. Now, `being countable' can be
expressed by the existence of an injection to $\mathbb{N}$ (Kunen) or the
existence of a bijection to $\mathbb{N}$ (Hrbacek-Jech). The former (and not
the latter) choice yields `explosive' theorems, i.e. relatively weak statements
that become much stronger when combined with discontinuous functionals, even up
to $\Pi_2^1$-CA$_0$. Nonetheless, replacing `sequence' by `countable set'
seriously reduces the first-order strength of these theorems, whatever the
notion of `set' used. Finally, we obtain `splittings' involving e.g. lemmas by
K\""onig and theorems from the RM zoo, showing that the latter are `a lot more
tame' when formulated with countable sets.

specifying the abundance or mass of particles for different size classes. The
fragmentation model is coupled to an environmental box model, simulating the
distributions of plastic particles in the ocean, coastal waters, and on the
beach. We compare the modelled PSDs to available observations, and use the
results to illustrate the effect of size-selective processes such as vertical
mixing in the water column and resuspension of particles from the beach into
coastal waters. The model quantifies the role of fragmentation on the marine
plastic mass budget: while fragmentation is a major source of (secondary)
plastic particles in terms of abundance, it seems to have a minor effect on the

states. Existing automatic protective behavior detection (PBD) methods rely on
pre-segmentation of activities predefined by users. However, in real life,
people perform activities casually. Therefore, where those activities present
difficulties for people with chronic pain, technology-enabled support should be
delivered continuously and automatically adapted to activity type and
occurrence of protective behavior. Hence, to facilitate ubiquitous CP
management, it becomes critical to enable accurate PBD over continuous data. In
this paper, we propose to integrate human activity recognition (HAR) with PBD
via a novel hierarchical HAR-PBD architecture comprising graph-convolution and
long short-term memory (GC-LSTM) networks, and alleviate class imbalances using
a class-balanced focal categorical-cross-entropy (CFCC) loss. Through in-depth
evaluation of the approach using a CP patients' dataset, we show that the
leveraging of HAR, GC-LSTM networks, and CFCC loss leads to clear increase in
PBD performance against the baseline (macro F1 score of 0.81 vs. 0.66 and
precision-recall area-under-the-curve (PR-AUC) of 0.60 vs. 0.44). We conclude
by discussing possible use cases of the hierarchical architecture in CP
management and beyond. We also discuss current limitations and ways forward.

To appear in COLT 2021",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many real-world data sets are sparse or almost sparse. One method to measure
this for a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is the \emph{numerical
sparsity}, denoted $\mathsf{ns}(A)$, defined as the minimum $k\geq 1$ such that
$\|a\|_1/\|a\|_2 \leq \sqrt{k}$ for every row and every column $a$ of $A$. This
measure of $a$ is smooth and is clearly only smaller than the number of
non-zeros in the row/column $a$. The seminal work of Achlioptas and McSherry
[2007] has put forward the question of approximating an input matrix $A$ by
entrywise sampling. More precisely, the goal is to quickly compute a sparse
matrix $\tilde{A}$ satisfying $\|A - \tilde{A}\|_2 \leq \epsilon \|A\|_2$
(i.e., additive spectral approximation) given an error parameter $\epsilon>0$.
The known schemes sample and rescale a small fraction of entries from $A$. We
propose a scheme that sparsifies an almost-sparse matrix $A$ -- it produces a
matrix $\tilde{A}$ with $O(\epsilon^{-2}\mathsf{ns}(A) \cdot n\ln n)$ non-zero
entries with high probability. We also prove that this upper bound on
$\mathsf{nnz}(\tilde{A})$ is \emph{tight} up to logarithmic factors. Moreover,
our upper bound improves when the spectrum of $A$ decays quickly (roughly
replacing $n$ with the stable rank of $A$). Our scheme can be implemented in
time $O(\mathsf{nnz}(A))$ when $\|A\|_2$ is given. Previously, a similar upper
bound was obtained by Achlioptas et. al [2013] but only for a restricted class
of inputs that does not even include symmetric or covariance matrices. Finally,
we demonstrate two applications of these sampling techniques, to faster
approximate matrix multiplication, and to ridge regression by using sparse
preconditioners.

paradigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model
training locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive
data. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the
bandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,
making it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the
training process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in
terms of training efficiency, the final model's quality as well as fairness. In
this paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a
Lyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for
estimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based
on which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for
problem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,
justifying its theoretical feasibility. Barring the theoretical results, more
empirical data can be derived from our real training experiments on public

they may drive the robot close to humans that need help with their work or
because they may keep the robot away from humans when it can interfere with

propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Optimization (BO) method to design globally
optimal robot trajectories using non-contextual bandit human feedback in the
form of complaints or satisfaction ratings that express how satisfactory a
trajectory is, without revealing the reason. Since trajectory planning is
typically a high-dimensional optimization problem in the space of waypoints
that define a trajectory, BO may require prohibitively many queries for human
feedback to return a good solution. To this end, we use an autoencoder to
reduce the high-dimensional problem space into a low dimensional latent space,
which we update using human feedback. Moreover, we improve the exploration
efficiency of BO by biasing the search for new trajectories towards dynamically
feasible and collision-free trajectories obtained using off-the-shelf motion
planners. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed trajectory planning
method in a scenario with humans that have diversified and unknown demands.

suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and only work for the finite-action

converge at a fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold.
Our results cover both the finite- and continuous-action scenarios. Our theory

Starting from
the second Newton's law, we show that the inertial dynamics of orientations is
ruled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This process describes the dynamics of
alignment between neighboring fish in a shoal, a dynamics already used in the
literature for mobile fish schools. Firstly, in a fluid at rest, we calculate
the global polarization (i.e. the mean orientation of the fish) which decreases
rapidly as a function of the noise. We show that the faster a fish is able to
reorient itself, the more the school can afford to reorder itself for important
noise values. Secondly, in the prescence of a stream, each fish tends to orient
itself and swims against the flow: the so-called rheotaxis. So even in the
presence of a flow, it results in an immobile fish school. By adding an
individual rheotaxis effect to alignment interaction between fish, we show that
in a noisy environment, individual rheotaxis is enhanced by alignment
interactions between fish.

about 6 GPa is accompanied by the symmetry change from R-3 to C2/m, whereas the

induced by relative displacements of phosphorus or selenium atoms along the
c-axis direction under pressure. The results of the topological analysis of the
electron density and its Laplacian demonstrate that the pressure changes not
only the interatomic distances but also the bond nature between the intralayer
and interlayer phosphorus atoms. The interlayer P-P interactions are absent in
two non-metallic FePSe3 phases while after SMT the intralayer P-P interactions
weaken and the interlayer P-P interactions appear.

3D heterostructures at atomic limit (HAL) made of a superlattice of atomic
layers with an electron spectrum made of several quantum subbands can be
amplified by a shape resonance driven by the contact exchange interaction
between different gaps. The $T_C$ amplification is achieved tuning the Fermi
level near the singular nodal point at a Lifshitz transition for opening a
neck. Recently high interest has been addressed to the breaking of inversion
symmetry which leads to a linear-in-momentum spin-orbit induced spin splitting,
universally referred to as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) also in 3D layered
metals. However the physics of multi-gap superconductivity near unconventional
Lifshitz transitions in 3D HAL with RSOC, being in a non-BCS regime, is not
known. The key result of this work getting the superconducting gaps by
Bogoliubov theory and the 3D electron wave functions by solution of the Dirac
equation is the feasibility of tuning multi-gap superconductivity by suitably
matching the spin-orbit length with the 3D superlattice period. It is found
that the presence of the RSOC amplifies both the k dependent anisotropic gap
function and the critical temperature when the Fermi energy is tuned near the
circular nodal line. Our results suggest a method to effectively vary the
effect of RSOC on macroscopic superconductor condensates via the tuning of the
superlattice modulation parameter in a way potentially relevant for spintronics

pulsar that exhibits significant short-term and long-term timing variations due
to the electromagnetic-wind interaction with its companion and geodetic
precession. Improving pulsar B's timing precision is a key step towards
improving the precision in a number of GR tests with PSR J0737-3039A/B. In this
paper, red noise signatures in the timing of pulsar B are investigated using
roughly a four-year time span, from 2004 to 2008, beyond which time the
pulsar's radio beam precessed out of view ... The timing of pulsar B presented
in this paper depends on the size of the pulsar's orbit, which was calculated
from GR, in order to precisely account for orbital timing delays. Consequently,
our timing cannot directly be used to test theories of gravity. However, our
modelling of the beam shape and radial wind of pulsar B can indirectly aid
future efforts to time this pulsar by constraining part of the additional red
noise observed on top of the orbital delays. As such, we conclude that, in the
idealised case of zero covariance between our model's parameters and those of
the timing model, our model can bring about a factor 2.6 improvement on the
measurement precision of the mass ratio, R = mA/mB, between the two pulsars: a
theory-independent parameter, which is pivotal in tests of GR.

X-ray spectrum of each quasar to measure their basic X-ray properties, such as
the X-ray flux, power law photon index ($\Gamma$), and optical-to-X-ray
spectral slope ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$). J074749+115352 at $z=5.26$ is the X-ray
brightest radio-quiet quasar at $z>5$. It may have a short timescale variation
(on a timescale of $\sim3800\rm~s$ in the observer's frame, or $\sim600\rm~s$
in the rest frame) which is however largely embedded in the statistical noise.
We extract phase folded spectra of this quasar. There are two distinguishable
states: a ""high soft"" state with an average X-ray flux $\sim2.7$ times of the
""low hard"" state, and a significantly steeper X-ray spectral slope
($\Gamma=2.40_{-0.32}^{+0.33}$ vs $1.78_{-0.24}^{+0.25}$). We also compare the
three quasars detected in this paper to other quasar samples. We find that
J074749+115352, with a SMBH mass of $M_{\rm
SMBH}\approx1.8\times10^9\rm~M_\odot$ and an Eddington ratio of $\lambda_{\rm

$\alpha_{\rm OX}=-1.46\pm0.02$ and a 2-10 keV bolometric correction factor of
$L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm2-10keV}=42.4\pm5.8$, both significantly depart from some
well defined scaling relations. We compare $\Gamma$ of the three quasars to
other samples at different redshifts, and do not find any significant redshift
evolution based on the limited sample of $z>5$ quasars with reliable
measurements of the X-ray spectral properties.

implementations of digital twins (DT) are still far from this vision. Although
successful implementations exist, sufficient implementation details are not

draw comparisons and jointly advance the DT methodology. This work explores the
various DT features and current approaches, the shortcomings and reasons behind
the delay in the implementation and adoption of digital twin. Advancements in
machine learning, internet of things and big data have contributed hugely to
the improvements in DT with regards to its real-time monitoring and forecasting
properties. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain
research gaps exist in the field, which have caused delay in the widespread
adoption of this concept. We reviewed relevant works and identified that the
major reasons for this delay are the lack of a universal reference framework,
domain dependence, security concerns of shared data, reliance of digital twin
on other technologies, and lack of quantitative metrics. We define the
necessary components of a digital twin required for a universal reference
framework, which also validate its uniqueness as a concept compared to similar
concepts like simulation, autonomous systems, etc. This work further assesses
the digital twin applications in different domains and the current state of

New York Times wrote a decade ago: ""the web means the end of forgetting"". The
reality however is that digital records suffer similar risks of access loss as
the analogue versions they replace. Often this risk is outsourced to
specialised third parties. Common use cases include Personal Information
Management (PIM): e.g. calendars, diaries, tasks, etc. Frequently these are
outsourced at two removes - firstly by the individual to their employer (e.g.
using a company system) and then by their employer to an external provider. So
enters a new risk: organisational change; by the time the information is
required the organisational chain that links user to data may be broken: the
employer transitions to a different provider, the employee leaves the company,
the IS provider pivots to new offerings. The advent of Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT) could help mitigate these risks; and has led to a
re-evaluation of the relationship between data creation and ownership. Although
DLT is an imprecise term, it typically involves data storage across
organisationally separate entities in a cryptographically secure form; and
therefore could present a partial solution to the risk. This project presents
the first research that applies DLT to the field of PIM, furthering design
science state of the art by a novel implementation of a calendar application on
the Ethereum blockchain. It also extends current research in utilising DLT in
digital preservation, namely by enacting a continuum approach within a DL that
allows for transfer of ownership of digital objects as they transition from
individual to collective relevance. Finally it provides guidelines for future
use of DLT within digital preservation.

tracking in passive sensor networks. Compared with active sensor networks,
passive sensor networks have larger uncertainty due to the nature of passive
sensing. Multi-target tracking in passive sensor networks is challenging
because the multi-sensor multi-target fusion problem is difficult and sensor
management is necessary to achieve good trade-offs between tracking accuracy
and energy consumption or other costs. To address this problem, we present an
efficient information-theoretic approach to manage the sensors for better
tracking of the unknown and time-varying number of targets. This is
accomplished with two main technical innovations. The first is a tractable
information-based multi-sensor selection solution via a partially observed
Markov decision process framework. The Cauchy-Schwarz divergence is used as the
criterion to select informative sensors sequentially from the candidates. The
second is a novel dual-stage fusion strategy based on the iterated-corrector
multi-sensor generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter. Since the performance
of the iterated-corrector scheme is greatly influenced by the order of sensor
updates, the selected sensors are first ranked in order of their abilities to
detect targets according to the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, followed the
iterated-corrector update. The computation costs of ranking the sensors are
negligible, since the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence has been computed in the
multi-sensor selection procedure. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed approach.

detect malicious UAVs. In this phase, we try to identify and remove malicious
UAVs according to the behavior of UAVs in the network in order to prevent
sending fake information to the investigating UAVs. In the second phase, a
mobile agent based on a three-step negotiation process is used to eliminate
malicious UAVs. In this way, we use mobile agents to inform our normal neighbor

promising technology for increasing the efficiency of mobile wireless networks.
This is achieved by employing a vast amount of low-cost individually adjustable
passive reflect elements, that are able to apply changes to the reflected
signal. To this end, the IRS makes the environment realtime controllable and
can be adjusted to significantly increase the received signal quality at the
users by passive beamsteering. However, the changes to the reflected signals
have an effect on all users near the IRS, which makes it impossible to optimize
the changes to positively influence every transmission, affected by the
reflections. This results in some users not only experiencing better signal
quality, but also an increase in received interference. To mitigate this
negative side effect of the IRS, this paper utilizes the rate splitting (RS)
technique, which enables the mitigation of interference within the network in
such a way that it also mitigates the increased interference caused by the IRS.
To investigate the effects on the overall power savings, that can be achieved
by combining both techniques, we minimize the required transmit power, needed
to satisfy per-user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Numerical results
show the improved power savings, that can be gained by utilizing the IRS and
the RS technique simultaneously. In fact, the concurrent use of both techniques
yields power savings, which are beyond the cumulative power savings of using

effect at the resonance frequencies is comparable with that of intra-core
cross-phase modulation due to Kerr nonlinearity. Two potential applications are
demonstrated: single-frequency opto-electronic oscillators that do not require
radio-frequency electrical filters, and point-sensing of liquids outside the
cladding of multi-core fibers, where light cannot reach.

  Neural Network With Attention",,,"10.1088/1741-4326/abe370",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a typical fusion experiment, the plasma can have several possible
confinement modes. At the TCV tokamak, aside from the Low (L) and High (H)
confinement modes, an additional mode, dithering (D), is frequently observed.
Developing methods that automatically detect these modes is considered to be
important for future tokamak operation. Previous work with deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional recurrent neural networks (Conv-RNNs),
indicates that they are a suitable approach. Nevertheless, those models are
sensitive to noise in the temporal alignment of labels, and that model in
particular is limited to making individual decisions taking into account only
its own hidden state and its input at each time step. In this work, we propose
an architecture for a sequence-to-sequence neural network model with attention
which solves both of those issues. Using a carefully calibrated dataset, we
compare the performance of a Conv-RNN with that of our proposed
sequence-to-sequence model, and show two results: one, that the Conv-RNN can be
improved upon with new data; two, that the sequence-to-sequence model can
improve the results even further, achieving excellent scores on both train and
test data.

two-level system and a quantized single mode of an electromagnetic resonator.
Issues about this model's gauge invariance have been raised. These issues
become evident when the light-matter interaction reaches the so-called
ultrastrong coupling regime. Recently, a modified quantum Rabi model able to
provide gauge-invariant physical results (e.g., energy levels, expectation
values of observables, quantum probabilities) in any interaction regime was
introduced [Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019)]. Here we provide an alternative
derivation of this result, based on the implementation in two-state systems of
the gauge principle, which is the principle from which all the fundamental
interactions in quantum field theory are derived. The adopted procedure can be
regarded as the two-site version of the general method used to implement the
gauge principle in lattice gauge theories. Applying this method, we also obtain
the gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model for asymmetric two-state systems, and
the multi-mode gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model beyond the dipole
approximation.
