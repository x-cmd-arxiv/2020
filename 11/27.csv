principle, allow for examining microscopic mechanisms associated with
decoherence. These experiments can be interpreted as a quantum-mechanical
version of non-equilibrium mixing between two volumes separated by a thin
interface. One of the principal goals of such experiments is in identifying
non-equilibrium conditions when time-symmetric laws give way to
time-directional, irreversible processes, which are represented by decoherence
at the quantum level. The rate of decoherence is suggested to be examined
indirectly, with minimal intrusions -- this can be achieved by measuring
tunnelling rates that, in turn, are affected by decoherence. Decoherence is
understood here as a general process that does not involve any significant
exchanges of energy and governed by a particular class of the Kraus operators.
The present work analyses different regimes of tunnelling in the presence of
decoherence and obtains formulae that link the corresponding rates of
tunnelling and decoherence under different conditions. It is shown that the
effects on tunnelling of intrinsic decoherence and of decoherence due to
unitary interactions with the environment are similar but not the same and can
be distinguished in experiments.

  (L4DC 2021)",,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In control applications there is often a compromise that needs to be made
with regards to the complexity and performance of the controller and the
computational resources that are available. For instance, the typical hardware
platform in embedded control applications is a microcontroller with limited
memory and processing power, and for battery powered applications the control
system can account for a significant portion of the energy consumption. We
propose a controller architecture in which the computational cost is explicitly
optimized along with the control objective. This is achieved by a three-part
architecture where a high-level, computationally expensive controller generates
plans, which a computationally simpler controller executes by compensating for
prediction errors, while a recomputation policy decides when the plan should be
recomputed. In this paper, we employ model predictive control (MPC) as the
high-level plan-generating controller, a linear state feedback controller as
the simpler compensating controller, and reinforcement learning (RL) to learn
the recomputation policy. Simulation results for two examples showcase the
architecture's ability to improve upon the MPC approach and find reasonable
compromises weighing the performance on the control objective and the
computational resources expended.

  canopy flow","13 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1017/jfm.2021.33",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interaction of fluids with surface-mounted obstacles in canopy flows
leads to strong turbulence that dominates dispersion and mixing in the
neutrally stable atmospheric surface layer. This work focuses on intermittency
in the Lagrangian velocity statistics in a canopy flow, which is observed in
two distinct forms. The first, small scale intermittency, is expressed by
non-Gaussian and not self-similar statistics of the velocity increments. The
analysis shows an agreement in comparison with previous results from
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) using the multifractal model, extended
self-similarity, and acceleration autocorrelations. These observations suggest
that the picture of small-scale Lagrangian intermittency in canopy flows is
similar to that in HIT, and therefore, they extend the idea of universal
Lagrangian intermittency to certain inhomogeneous and anisotropic flows.
Second, it is observed that the RMS of energy increments along Lagrangian
trajectories depend on the direction of the trajectories' time-averaged
turbulent velocity. Subsequent analysis suggests that the flow is attenuated by
the canopy drag while leaving the structure function's scaling unchanged. This
observation implies the existence of large-scale intermittency in Lagrangian
statistics. Thus, this work presents a first empirical evidence of intermittent
Lagrangian velocity statistics in a canopy flow that exists in two distinct
senses and occurs due to different mechanisms.

uncertainties has been performed for the first time in the framework of
covariant density functional theory (CDFT). These results provide a necessary
theoretical input for the r-process modeling in heavy nuclei and, in
particular, for the study of fission recycling. Four state-of-the-art globally
tested covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs), namely, DD-PC1, DD-ME2,
NL3* and PC-PK1, representing the major classes of the CDFT models are employed
in the present study. Ground state deformations, binding energies, two neutron
separation energies, $\alpha$-decay $Q_{\alpha}$ values and half-lives and the
heights of fission barriers have been calculated for all these nuclei.
Theoretical uncertainties in these physical observables and their evolution as
a function of proton and neutron numbers have been quantified and their major
sources have been identified. Spherical shell closures at $Z=120$, $N=184$ and
$N=258$ and the structure of the single-particle (especially, high-$j$) states
in their vicinities as well as nuclear matter properties of employed CEDFs are
two major factors contributing into theoretical uncertainties. However,
different physical observables are affected in a different way by these two
factors. For example, theoretical uncertainties in calculated ground state
deformations are affected mostly by former factor, while theoretical
uncertainties in fission barriers depend on both of these factors.

method for high-quality, non-invasive blood cell imaging in human capillaries.
To make this technique practical for clinical blood cell counting, solutions
for automatic processing of acquired videos are needed. Here, we take the first
step towards this goal, by introducing a deep learning multi-cell tracking
model, named CycleTrack, which achieves accurate blood cell counting from
capillaroscopic videos. CycleTrack combines two simple online tracking models,
SORT and CenterTrack, and is tailored to features of capillary blood cell flow.
Blood cells are tracked by displacement vectors in two opposing temporal
directions (forward- and backward-tracking) between consecutive frames. This
approach yields accurate tracking despite rapidly moving and deforming blood
cells. The proposed model outperforms other baseline trackers, achieving 65.57%
Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy and 73.95% ID F1 score on test videos.
Compared to manual blood cell counting, CycleTrack achieves 96.58 $\pm$ 2.43%
cell counting accuracy among 8 test videos with 1000 frames each compared to
93.45% and 77.02% accuracy for independent CenterTrack and SORT almost without
additional time expense. It takes 800s to track and count approximately 8000
blood cells from 9,600 frames captured in a typical one-minute video. Moreover,
the blood cell velocity measured by CycleTrack demonstrates a consistent,
pulsatile pattern within the physiological range of heart rate. Lastly, we
discuss future improvements for the CycleTrack framework, which would enable
clinical translation of the oblique back-illumination microscope towards a
real-time and non-invasive point-of-care blood cell counting and analyzing

targeted misclassifications on a state-of-the-art ImageNet deep learning model.
Concretely, we exploit the radiometric rolling shutter effect in commodity

capture the observed speeds by combining the calculated forms based on

effective for burrowing in non-cohesive sediments which fill in rapidly behind

We introduce an extended spin-star model where the system is coupled to $N$

of the environment, and hence we term this the ""onion"" model. We fix the
system-environment interaction such that classical objectivity is guaranteed if
the environment consists of a single layer. Considering a fully factorized
initial state for all constituent sub-systems, we then examine how the
emergence and proliferation of signatures of quantum Darwinism are delicately
dependent on the chain interaction, establishing that when the chains are
considered as indivisible fragments to be interrogated, characteristic
redundancy plateaux are always observed at least transiently. In contrast,
observing a redundant encoding in a specific layer is highly sensitive to the
nature of the interaction. Finally, we consider the case in which each chain is
initialized in the ground state of the interaction Hamiltonian, establishing
that this case shares the qualitative features of the factorized initial state
case, however now the strength of the applied magnetic field has a significant
impact on whether quantum Darwinism can be observed. We demonstrate that the
presence or absence of quantum Darwinistic features can be understood by
analysing the correlations within a layer using total mutual information and
global quantum discord.

the 1st and the 3rd laws, to be explained ""later on"" as a consequence of
angular momentum conservation. The 1st and 3rd laws receive the bulk of
attention; the 1st law because of the paradigm shift significance in
overhauling the previous circular models with epicycles of both Ptolemy and
Copernicus, the 3rd because of its convenience to the standard curriculum in
having a simple mathematical statement that allows for quantitative homework
assignments and exams. In this work I advance a method for teaching the 2nd law
that combines the paradigm-shift significance of the 1st and the mathematical
proclivity of the 3rd. The approach is rooted in the historical method, indeed,
placed in its historical context, Kepler's 2nd is as revolutionary as the 1st:
as the 1st law does away with the epicycle, the 2nd law does away with the
equant. This way of teaching the 2nd law also formulates the ""time=area""
statement quantitatively, in the way of Kepler's equation, M = E - e sin E
(relating mean anomaly M, eccentric anomaly E, and eccentricity e), where the
left-hand side is time and the right-hand side is area. In doing so, it
naturally paves the way to finishing the module with an active learning
computational exercise, for instance, to calculate the timing and location of
Mars' next opposition. This method is partially based on Kepler's original
thought, and should thus best be applied to research-oriented students, such as
junior and senior physics/astronomy undergraduates, or graduate students.

However, they are vulnerable to input adversarial attacks preventing them from
being autonomously deployed in critical applications. Several
algorithm-centered works have discussed methods to cause adversarial attacks
and improve adversarial robustness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). In this
work, we elicit the advantages and vulnerabilities of hybrid 6T-8T memories to
improve the adversarial robustness and cause adversarial attacks on DNNs. We
show that bit-error noise in hybrid memories due to erroneous 6T-SRAM cells
have deterministic behaviour based on the hybrid memory configurations (V_DD,
8T-6T ratio). This controlled noise (surgical noise) can be strategically
introduced into specific DNN layers to improve the adversarial accuracy of
DNNs. At the same time, surgical noise can be carefully injected into the DNN
parameters stored in hybrid memory to cause adversarial attacks. To improve the
adversarial robustness of DNNs using surgical noise, we propose a methodology
to select appropriate DNN layers and their corresponding hybrid memory
configurations to introduce the required surgical noise. Using this, we achieve
2-8% higher adversarial accuracy without re-training against white-box attacks
like FGSM, than the baseline models (with no surgical noise introduced). To
demonstrate adversarial attacks using surgical noise, we design a novel,
white-box attack on DNN parameters stored in hybrid memory banks that causes
the DNN inference accuracy to drop by more than 60% with over 90% confidence
value. We support our claims with experiments, performed using benchmark
datasets-CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 on VGG19 and ResNet18 networks.

studied in the framework of the $k_T$-factorization approach. Our consideration
is based on the non-relativistic QCD formalism for a bound states formation and
off-shell production amplitudes for hard partonic subprocesses. The direct
production mechanism, feed-down contributions from radiative $\chi_b(mP)$
decays and contributions from $\Upsilon(3S)$ and $\Upsilon(2S)$ decays are
taken into account. The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon densities in
a proton were derived from the Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution
equation and the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. Treating the
non-perturbative color octet transitions in terms of multipole radiation
theory, we extract the corresponding non-perturbative matrix elements for
$\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\chi_b(1P)$ mesons from a combined fit to transverse
momenta distributions measured at various LHC experiments. Then we apply the
extracted values to investigate the polarization parameters $\lambda_\theta$,
$\lambda_\phi$ and $\lambda_{\theta\phi}$, which determine the $\Upsilon(1S)$
spin density matrix. Our predictions have a reasonably good agreement with the
currently available Tevatron and LHC data within the theoretical and

features low inelastic absorption in the visible and infrared (vis-IR) spectral

vis-IR plasmons in long copper nanowires (NWs) with quality factors that exceed
a value of 60, as determined by spatially resolved, high-resolution electron
energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. We explain this counterintuitive
result by the fact that plasmons in these metal wires have most of their
electromagnetic energy outside the metal, and thus, they are less sensitive to
inelastic losses in the material. We present an extensive set of data acquired
on long silver and copper NWs of varying diameters supporting this conclusion
and further allowing us to understand the relative roles played by radiative
and nonradiative losses in plasmons that span a wide range of energies down to
$<20\,$meV. At such small plasmon energies, thermal population of these modes
becomes significant enough to enable the observation of electron energy gains

compact manifold admitting a free action of a torus of rank $r$ is bounded from
below by $2^r$. Clearly, such an action yields a torus bundle, and, more
generally, the same cohomological bound is conjectured for total spaces of
suitable topological torus fibrations by F\'elix--Oprea--Tanr\'e.
  In this article we show that this generalised toral rank conjecture cannot
hold by providing various different counter-examples to it (for each rank
$r\geq 5$). In particular, we show that there are sequences of smooth nilpotent
fibre bundles of nilmanifolds with fibre a torus of rank $r$ such that the
quotient of the total dimensions of the cohomologies of total space and fibre
even converges to $0$ with $r$ tending to infinity.
  We moreover prove that none of our torus fibrations can be realised by almost
free torus actions. More precisely, in the depicted sequence the difference of
the ranks of the torus fibres in the bundle and the toral ranks (which are
constant one) even tends to infinity.
  Similar to recent examples by Walker (of a completely different nature) this
shows that the toral rank conjecture is not likely to follow from ""weaker
conjectures or structures"".

spintronic devices. Notably, strong current pulses have been shown to induce
magnetoresistance changes attributed to domain reorientation in
antiferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers and non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.
In such cases, nonmagnetic resistivity changes may dominate over signatures of
antiferromagnetic switching. We report systematic measurements of the
current-induced changes of the transverse and longitudinal resistance of Pt and
Pt/NiO layers deposited on insulating substrates, namely Si/SiO$_2$,
Si/Si$_3$N$_4$, and Al$_2$O$_3$. We identify the range of pulse amplitude and
length that can be used without affecting the resistance and show that it
increases with the device size and thermal diffusivity of the substrate. No
significant difference is observed in the resistive response of Pt and NiO/Pt
devices, thus precluding evidence on the switching of antiferromagnetic domains
in NiO. The variation of the transverse resistance is associated to a
thermally-activated process in Pt that decays following a double exponential
law with characteristic timescales of a few minutes to hours. We use a
Wheatstone bridge model to discriminate between positive and negative
resistance changes, highlighting competing annealing and electromigration
effects. Depending on the training of the devices, the transverse resistance
can either increase or decrease between current pulses. Further, we elucidate
the origin of the nonmonotonic resistance baseline, which we attribute to
training effects combined with the asymmetric distribution of the current.
These results provide insight into the origin of current-induced resistance
changes in metal layers and a guide to minimize nonmagnetic artifacts in
switching experiments of antiferromagnets.

However, as researchers, practitioners and system designers, a key challenge to
anticipating risks is overcoming what Clarke (1962) called 'failures of
imagination.' The growing research on bias, fairness, and transparency in
computational systems aims to illuminate and mitigate harms, and could thus
help inform reflections on possible negative impacts of particular pieces of
technical work. The prevalent notion of computational harms -- narrowly
construed as either allocational or representational harms -- does not fully
capture the open, context dependent, and unobservable nature of harms across
the wide range of AI infused systems.The current literature focuses on a small
range of examples of harms to motivate algorithmic fixes, overlooking the wider
scope of probable harms and the way these harms might affect different
stakeholders. The system affordances may also exacerbate harms in unpredictable
ways, as they determine stakeholders' control(including of non-users) over how
they use and interact with a system output. To effectively assist in
anticipating harmful uses, we argue that frameworks of harms must be
context-aware and consider a wider range of potential stakeholders, system
affordances, as well as viable proxies for assessing harms in the widest sense.

a suitable testbed for assessing the potential benefit of hybrid algorithm: We
use the simulation algorithm to perform large-scale simulation of level-$1$
QAOA and RQAOA with up to $300$ qutrits applied to ensembles of randomly
generated $3$-colorable constant-degree graphs. We find that level-$1$ RQAOA is
surprisingly competitive: for the ensembles considered, its approximation
ratios are often higher than those achieved by the best known generic classical
algorithm based on rounding an SDP relaxation. This suggests the intriguing
possibility that higher-level RQAOA may be a potentially useful algorithm for
NISQ devices.

balance of forces and thermodynamics in an evolving magnetic topology. How this
relatively cool material comes to reside at coronal heights, and what drives
its evolution prior to, during, and after its appearance remains an area full
of open questions. We deliberately focus on the levitation-condensation
scenario, where a coronal flux rope forms and eventually demonstrates in-situ
condensations, revisiting it at extreme resolutions down to order 6 km in
scale. We perform grid-adaptive numerical simulations in a 2.5D translationally
invariant setup, where we can study the distribution of all metrics involved in
advanced magnetohydrodynamic stability theory for nested flux rope equilibria.
We quantify in particular Convective Continuum Instability (CCI), Thermal
Instability (TI), baroclinicity, and mass-slipping metrics within a series of
numerical simulations of prominences formed via levitation-condensation.
Overall, we find that the formation and evolution of prominence condensations
happens in a clearly defined sequence regardless of resolution or background
field strength between 3 and 10 Gauss. The CCI governs the slow evolution of
plasma prior to the formation of distinct condensations found to be driven by
the TI. Evolution of the condensations towards the topological dips of the
magnetic flux rope is a consequence of these condensations forming initially
outside of pressure balance with their surroundings. From the baroclinicity
distributions, smaller-scale rotational motions are inferred within forming and
evolving condensations. Upon the complete condensation of a prominence
`monolith', the slow descent of this plasma towards lower heights appears
consistent with the mass-slippage mechanism driven by episodes of both local
current diffusion and magnetic reconnection.

opens a new spectrum of possibilities for memory management. Transparent data
movement between different memory devices based on access patterns of
applications is a desired feature to make optimal use of such devices and to
hide the complexity of memory management to the end-user. However, capturing
memory access patterns of an application at runtime comes at a cost, which is
particularly challenging for large scale parallel applications that may be
sensitive to system noise.
  In this work, we focus on the access pattern profiling phase prior to the
actual memory relocation. We study the feasibility of using Intel's Processor
Event-Based Sampling (PEBS) feature to record memory accesses by sampling at
runtime and study the overhead at scale. We have implemented a custom PEBS
driver in the IHK/McKernel lightweight multi-kernel operating system, one of
whose advantages is minimal system interference due to the lightweight kernel's
simple design compared to other OS kernels such as Linux. We present the PEBS
overhead of a set of scientific applications and show the access patterns
identified in noise-sensitive HPC applications. Our results show that clear
access patterns can be captured with a 10% overhead in the worst-case and 1% in
the best case when running on up to 128k CPU cores (2,048 Intel Xeon Phi
Knights Landing nodes). We conclude that online memory access profiling using

high redshifts over the past decades. The [C II] emission line at 158 $\mu$m is
an important observable as it provides constraints on the interstellar medium
(ISM) cooling processes. We develop a physically motivated framework to
simulate the production of far-infrared line emission from galaxies in a
cosmological context. This first paper sets out our methodology and describes
its first application, simulating the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line emission in the
local Universe. We combine the output from EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations with a multi-phase model of the ISM. Gas particles are divided into
three phases: dense molecular gas, neutral atomic gas and diffuse ionised gas
(DIG). We estimate the [C II] line emission from the three phases using a set
of Cloudy cooling tables. Our results agree with previous findings regarding
the contribution of these three ISM phases to the [C II] emission. Our model
shows good agreement with the observed ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$-star formation rate
(SFR) relation in the local Universe within 0.4 dex scatter. The fractional
contribution to the [C II] line from different ISM phases depends on the total
SFR and metallicity. The neutral gas phase dominates the [C II] emission in
galaxies with $\rm{SFR}\sim0.01$-$1\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$, but the
ionised phase dominates at lower SFRs. Galaxies above solar metallicity exhibit
lower ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$/SFR ratios for the neutral phase. In comparison, the
${\rm L_{[C II]}}$/SFR ratio in the DIG is stable when metallicity varies. We
suggest that the reduced size of the neutral clouds, caused by increased SFRs,
is the likely cause for the ${\rm L_{[C II]}}$ deficit at high infrared
luminosities, although EAGLE simulations do not reach these luminosities at
$z=0$.

extensive 4-year Keck/HIRES radial-velocity (RV) follow-up program of the

accretion of its gas envelope. We reveal that WASP-107b's mass is only 1.8
Neptune masses ($M_b = 30.5 \pm 1.7$ $M_\oplus$). The resulting extraordinarily
low density suggests that WASP-107b has a H/He envelope mass fraction of $>
85$% unless it is substantially inflated. The corresponding core mass of $<4.6$
$M_\oplus$ at 3$\sigma$ is significantly lower than what is traditionally
assumed to be necessary to trigger massive gas envelope accretion. We
demonstrate that this large gas-to-core mass ratio most plausibly results from
the onset of accretion at $\gtrsim 1$ AU onto a low-opacity, dust-free
atmosphere and subsequent migration to the present-day $a_b = 0.0566 \pm
0.0017$ AU. Beyond WASP-107b, we also detect a second more massive planet ($M_c
\sin i = 0.36 \pm 0.04$ $M_{J}$) on a wide eccentric orbit ($e_c = 0.28 \pm
0.07$) which may have influenced the orbital migration and spin-orbit

accretion modeling provide crucial insights into the intriguing nature of
WASP-107b and the system's formation history. Looking ahead, WASP-107b will be
a keystone planet to understand the physics of gas envelope accretion.

focus of intense research interest. The main task of HUSPM is to find all
subsequences, within a quantitative sequential database, that have high utility
with respect to a user-defined minimum utility threshold. However, it is
difficult to specify the minimum utility threshold, especially when database
features, which are invisible in most cases, are not understood. To handle this

improvement in terms of running time, memory consumption, unpromising candidate
filtering, and scalability. Moreover, no systematic problem statement has been

wide application and considerable popularity. However, conventional utility
mining methods have a bias toward items that have longer on-shelf time as they
have a greater chance to generate a high utility. To eliminate the bias, the
problem of on-shelf utility mining (OSUM) is introduced. In this paper, we
focus on the task of OSUM of sequence data, where the sequential database is
divided into several partitions according to time periods and items are
associated with utilities and several on-shelf time periods. To address the
problem, we propose two methods, OSUM of sequence data (OSUMS) and OSUMS+, to
extract on-shelf high-utility sequential patterns. For further efficiency, we
also designed several strategies to reduce the search space and avoid redundant
calculation with two upper bounds time prefix extension utility (TPEU) and time
reduced sequence utility (TRSU). In addition, two novel data structures were
developed for facilitating the calculation of upper bounds and utilities.
Substantial experimental results on certain real and synthetic datasets show
that the two methods outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm. In conclusion,
OSUMS may consume a large amount of memory and is unsuitable for cases with
limited memory, while OSUMS+ has wider real-life applications owing to its high
efficiency.

Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient

in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores
with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We
show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based

a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the

experience a contact phase, in which both stars overflow their Roche lobes
simultaneously. We perform the first dedicated study of the evolution of
massive contact binaries and provide a comprehensive prediction of their
observed properties. We compute 2790 detailed binary models for the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds each, assuming a conservative mass transfer. The
initial parameter space for both grids span total masses from 20 to
80$\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, orbital periods of 0.6 to 2 days and mass ratios of
0.6 to 1.0. We find that models that remain in contact over nuclear timescales
evolve towards equal masses, echoing the mass ratios of their observed
counterparts. Ultimately, the fate of our nuclear-timescale models is to merge
on the main sequence. Our predicted period-mass ratio distributions of O-type
contact binaries are similar for both galaxies, and we expect 10 such systems
together in both Magellanic Clouds. While we can largely reproduce the observed
distribution, we over-estimate the population of equal-mass contact binaries.
This situation is somewhat remedied if we also account for binaries that are
approaching contact. Our theoretical distributions work particularly well for
contact binaries with periods $<$2 days and total masses
$\lessapprox45\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$. We expect stellar winds, non-conservative
mass transfer and envelope inflation to have played a role in the formation of
the more massive and longer-period contact binaries.

Lagrange-Newton-Krylov-Schur (LNKS) approach couples the design and flow
iteration by simultaneously minimizing the objective function and improving
feasibility of the PDE constraints, which requires less iterations of the

discuss the necessary ingredients to build an efficient LNKS ASO framework as

cell-based molography as a biosensor for the analysis of specific molecular

expand this assay to cytosolic protein-protein interactions. First, we created
a biomimetic membrane receptor by tethering one cytosolic interaction partner
to the plasma membrane. The artificial construct is then coherently arranged
into a two-dimensional pattern within the cytosol of living cells. Thanks to
the molographic sensor, the specific interactions between the coherently
arranged protein and its endogenous interaction partners become visible in
real-time without the use of a fluorescent label. This method turns out to be
an important extension of cell-based molography because it expands the range of
interactions that can be analyzed by molography to those in the cytosol of
living cells.

partially ionized plasmas, we use a two-fluid computational model that treats
neutrals and charged particles (electrons and ions) as two separate fluids.
This two-fluid model takes into account the ion-neutral collisions, ionization,
and recombination, allowing us to investigate both the collisional and reactive
interactions between uncoupled ions and neutrals in the plasmas. In the present
numerical simulations, the initial density is specified to reach hydrostatic
equilibrium, and as a comparison, chemical equilibrium is also taken into
account to provide a density profile that differs from typical hydrostatic
equilibrium profiles. External velocity drivers are then imposed to generate
monochromatic acoustic waves. As is well known, the upward propagating acoustic
waves steepen in gravitationally stratified plasmas due to the exponentially
decreasing density, and they heat the plasmas in the nonlinear regimes where
kinetic energy is dissipated by shock waves and collisional interactions. In
particular, the lower ionization fraction resulting from the present initial
chemical equilibrium significantly enhances the heating efficiency. Moreover,
the ionization process absorbs a significant amount of energy, and the
decoupling between ions and neutrals is also enhanced while considering
ionization and recombination. Therefore, simulations without considering
ionization and recombination may overestimate the overall heating effects but
also underestimate the energy dissipation. The results also suggest that a more
accurate ionization and recombination model could be essential for improving
the modeling of partially ionized plasmas.

attracted great attention in the literature. It is based on the assumption that
complex traits or characters can only be gained once and lost once in the
course of evolution. Here, we consider a generalization of this model, namely
Dollo parsimony, that allows for multiple character losses. More precisely, we
take a combinatorial perspective on the notion of Dollo-$k$ characters, i.e.
traits that are gained at most once and lost precisely $k$ times throughout
evolution. We first introduce an algorithm based on the notion of spanning
subtrees for finding a Dollo-$k$ labeling for a given character and a given
tree in linear time. We then compare persistent characters (consisting of the
union of Dollo-0 and Dollo-1 characters) and general Dollo-$k$ characters.
While it is known that there is a strong connection between Fitch parsimony and
persistent characters, we show that Dollo parsimony and Fitch parsimony are in
general very different. Moreover, while it is known that there is a direct
relationship between the number of persistent characters and the Sackin index
of a tree, a popular index of tree balance, we show that this relationship does
not generalize to Dollo-$k$ characters. In fact, determining the number of
Dollo-$k$ characters for a given tree is much more involved than counting
persistent characters, and we end this manuscript by introducing a recursive
approach for the former. This approach leads to a polynomial time algorithm for
counting the number of Dollo-$k$ characters, and both this algorithm as well as
the algorithm for computing Dollo-$k$ labelings are publicly available in the
Babel package for BEAST 2.

field and charge density distributions. The 2D layer is described by the
Lorentz-type conductivities in one or both directions, which is realistic for
natural anisotropic 2D materials and resonant hyperbolic metasurfaces. We
demonstrate that, due to anisotropy, the edge mode exists only at wave vectors
exceeding the nonzero threshold value if the edge is tilted with respect to the
direction of the resonant conductivity. The dominating contribution to field
and charge density spatial profiles is provided by evanescent 2D waves, which
are confined both in space near the 2D layer and along the layer near its edge.
The degree of field confinement along the layer is determined by wave vector or
frequency mismatch between the edge mode and continuum of freely propagating 2D
modes. Our analysis is suitable for various types of polaritons (plasmon-,
phonon-, exciton-polaritons etc.) at large enough wave vectors. Thanks to
superior field confinement in all directions perpendicular to the edge these

the closest min-cut in $G$ for every partition $(A,B)$, which was not

the Local Group to study the recent accretion of massive satellites into the
halo of Milky Way (MW)-sized galaxies. These systems are selected to be close
analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of
the MW. The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, the
impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic
satellites to the MW satellite population, and the constraints placed on the
Galactic potential by the motion of the LMC. We show that LMC-like satellites
are twice more common around Local Group-like primaries than around isolated
halos of similar mass; these satellites come from large turnaround radii and
are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are
comparable with the primary's escape velocity. This implies $V_{\rm esc}^{\rm
MW} (50 $ kpc$)\sim 365$ km/s, a strong constraint on Galactic potential
models. LMC analogues contribute about 2 satellites with $M_*>10^5\, M_\odot$,
having thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their
hosts. At first pericentre, LMC-associated satellites are close to the LMC in
position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital plane. Their
orbital angular momenta roughly align with the LMC's, but, interestingly, they
may appear to ""counter-rotate"" the MW in some cases. These criteria refine
earlier estimates of the LMC association of MW satellites: only the SMC,
Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2 and Phoenix2 are compatible with all criteria.
Carina, Grus2, Hor2 and Fornax are less probable associates given their large
LMC relative velocity.

equation with subcritical semilinearities and locally distributed nonlinear
dissipation. The novelty of this paper is that we deal with the difficulty that
the main equation does not have good nonlinear structure amenable to a direct
proof of a priori bounds and a desirable observability inequality. It is well
known that observability inequalities play a critical role in characterizing
the long time behaviour of solutions of evolution equations, which is the main
goal of this study. In order to address this, we truncate the nonlinearities,
and thereby construct approximate solutions for which it is possible to obtain
a priori bounds and prove the essential observability inequality. The treatment
of these approximate solutions is still a challenging task and requires the use
of Strichartz estimates and some microlocal analysis tools such as microlocal
defect measures. We include an appendix on the latter topic here to make the
article self contained and supplement details to proofs of some of the theorems
which can be found in the lecture notes of Burq and G\'erard (2001). Once we
establish essential observability properties for the approximate solutions, it
is not difficult to prove that the solution of the original problem also
possesses a similar feature via a delicate passage to limit. In the last part
of the paper, we establish various decay rate estimates for different growth
conditions on the nonlinear dissipative effect. We in particular generalize the
known results on the subject to a considerably larger class of dissipative
effects.

module of Pop III stars in which the escape fractions of ionizing photons and
Lyman-Werner (LW) photons, photo-heating by UV radiation, and LW feedback are
consistently incorporated. By implementing the module into a public 21-cm
semi-numerical simulation code, 21CMFAST, we demonstrate 21-cm signal
calculations and investigate the importance of Pop III star modelling. What we
find is that the contribution from Pop III stars to cosmic reionization
significantly depends on the treatment of the escape fraction. With our escape
fraction model, Pop III stars hardly contribute to reionization because less
massive halos, whose escape fraction are high, cannot host Pop III stars due to
LW feedback. On the other hand, Pop III stars well contribute to reionization
with the conventional constant escape fraction. We also find that UV
photo-heating has non-negligible impact on the 21-cm global signal and the
21-cm power spectrum if the ionization fraction of the Universe is higher than
roughly 1 percent. In this case, the strength of the 21-cm global signal
depends on the photo-heating efficiency and thus on the Pop III star mass. We
conclude that detailed modelling of Pop III stars is imperative to predict
21-cm observables accurately for future observations.

  networks","19 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain networks can be defined and explored through their connectivity. Here,
we analyzed the relationship between structural connectivity (SC) across 2,514
regions that cover the entire brain and brainstem, and their dynamic functional
connectivity (DFC). To do so, we focused on a combination of two metrics: the
first assesses the degree of SC-DFC similarity and the second is the intrinsic
variability of the DFC networks over time. Overall, we found that cerebellar
networks have a smaller DFC variability than other networks in the brain.
Moreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in
two distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the
brainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the DFC in the
posterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings,
namely, that this structure exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity relative to
the other networks studied. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum
also exhibits small DFC variability but it has the lowest SC-DFC similarity,
suggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to
the brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory
functioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low
variability in the DFC. Overall, the low variability detected in DFC expands
our current knowledge of cerebellar networks, which are extremely rich and
complex, participating in a wide range of cognitive functions, from movement
control and coordination to executive function or emotional regulation.
Moreover, the association between such low variability and structure suggests
that differentiated computational principles can be applied in the cerebellum
as opposed to other structures, such as the cerebral cortex.

simulation of compressible flows. The FCFV method defines the unknowns at the
face barycentre and uses a hybridisation procedure to eliminate all the degrees
of freedom inside the cells. In addition, Riemann solvers are defined
implicitly within the expressions of the numerical fluxes. The resulting
methodology provides first-order accurate approximations of the conservative
quantities, i.e. density, momentum and energy, as well as of the viscous stress
tensor and of the heat flux, without the need of any gradient reconstruction
procedure. Hence, the FCFV solver preserves the accuracy of the approximation
in presence of distorted and highly stretched cells, providing a solver
insensitive to mesh quality. In addition, FCFV is capable of constructing
non-oscillatory approximations of sharp discontinuities without resorting to
shock capturing or limiting techniques. For flows at low Mach number, the
method is robust and is capable of computing accurate solutions in the
incompressible limit without the need of introducing specific pressure
correction strategies. A set of 2D and 3D benchmarks of external flows is
presented to validate the methodology in different flow regimes, from inviscid
to viscous laminar flows, from transonic to subsonic incompressible flows,
demonstrating its potential to handle compressible flows in realistic

parallel finite difference framework suitable for distributed memory computing
architectures to simulate non-periodic systems embedded in a bulk environment.
Choosing examples from magnesium-aluminum alloys, we first demonstrate the
convergence of energies and forces with respect to spectral quadrature
polynomial order, and the width of the spatially truncated Hamiltonian. Next,
we demonstrate the parallel scaling of our framework, and show that the
computation time and memory scale linearly with respect to the number of atoms.
Next, we use the developed framework to simulate isolated point defects and
their interactions in magnesium-aluminum alloys. Our findings conclude that the
binding energies of divacancies, Al solute-vacancy and two Al solute atoms are
anisotropic and are dependent on cell size. Furthermore, the binding is
favorable in all three cases.

graphs~(TVGs) is a challenging task with many real-world applications. There
are several ways to model this spatio-temporal influence maximization problem,
but the ultimate goal is to determine the best moment for a node to start the
diffusion process. In this context, we propose Spatio-Temporal Influence
Maximization~(STIM), a model trained with Reinforcement Learning and Graph
Embedding over a set of artificial TVGs that is capable of learning the
temporal behavior and connectivity pattern of each node, allowing it to predict
the best moment to start a diffusion through the TVG. We also develop a special
set of artificial TVGs used for training that simulate a stochastic diffusion
process in TVGs, showing that the STIM network can learn an efficient policy
even over a non-deterministic environment. STIM is also evaluated with a
real-world TVG, where it also manages to efficiently propagate information
through the nodes. Finally, we also show that the STIM model has a time
complexity of $O(|E|)$. STIM, therefore, presents a novel approach for
efficient information diffusion in TVGs, being highly versatile, where one can
change the goal of the model by simply changing the adopted reward function.

there is at most a one dimensional space at each threshold. We show that, in
the presence of a threshold resonance, the Dirac evolution satisfies the
natural decay rate, and satisfies the faster weighted bound except for a piece

Schr\""odinger operators. This method has never been used before to obtain $L^1

  in Uncertain Heterogeneous Reservoir with Improved Efficiency",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The history of oil and gas well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing is
characterized by a pursuit of optimal designs tailored to reservoir properties.
However, as with many engineering systems, the impact of variability and
uncertainty (in this case of reservoir properties) is not accounted in these
deterministic approaches. We propose an expansion of the principle of design
diversity wherein the focus becomes developing optimal portfolio combinations
of multiple designs rather than repeated application of a single design. This
approach can substantially increase efficiency and decrease risk when designing
systems where outcome desirability is definable as a smoothly-varying
efficiency and where risk is related to the variance of outcomes tied to
uncertain variability of the design environment. For the case of oil/gas wells,
we demonstrate diverse portfolios of designs can improve stimulation efficiency
by nearly a factor of four and cut risk associated with variability and
uncertainty of outcomes by over 80%. Hydraulic fracturing optimization is
therefore fundamentally dependent upon uncertainty, and a change of approach
toward the pursuit of design diversity can have a profound impact on efficiency
and risk, and in turn cost and environmental impacts, in oil and gas
development.

to the Rashba-type spin splitting, which is observed in the valence bands,
being different from common conduction bands. Calculated results show valley
polarization at the edge of the conduction bands due to SOC together with
inversion symmetry breaking. It is found that $\mathrm{MSiGeN_4}$ (M=Mo and W)

  Unlabeled Data for Class-Mismatched Semi-Supervised Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with mismatched classes deals with the problem
that the classes-of-interests in the limited labeled data is only a subset of
the classes in massive unlabeled data. As a result, the classes only possessed
by the unlabeled data may mislead the classifier training and thus hindering
the realistic landing of various SSL methods. To solve this problem, existing
methods usually divide unlabeled data to in-distribution (ID) data and
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and directly discard or weaken the OOD data to
avoid their adverse impact. In other words, they treat OOD data as completely
useless and thus the potential valuable information for classification
contained by them is totally ignored. To remedy this defect, this paper
proposes a ""Transferable OOD data Recycling"" (TOOR) method which properly
utilizes ID data as well as the ""recyclable"" OOD data to enrich the information
for conducting class-mismatched SSL. Specifically, TOOR firstly attributes all
unlabeled data to ID data or OOD data, among which the ID data are directly
used for training. Then we treat the OOD data that have a close relationship
with ID data and labeled data as recyclable, and employ adversarial domain
adaptation to project them to the space of ID data and labeled data. In other
words, the recyclability of an OOD datum is evaluated by its transferability,
and the recyclable OOD data are transferred so that they are compatible with
the distribution of known classes-of-interests. Consequently, our TOOR method
extracts more information from unlabeled data than existing approaches, so it
can achieve the improved performance which is demonstrated by the experiments
on typical benchmark datasets.

manner: 1 {\mu}M to 5 {\mu}M propofol destabilize nanodomains; however,
propofol concentrations higher than 5 {\mu}M stabilize nanodomains with time.

parton distribution functions (PDFs) directly on a Euclidean lattice through a
factorization theorem that relates the computed quasi-PDFs to PDFs. We apply
chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) to LaMET to further separate soft scales,
such as light quark masses and lattice size, to obtain leading model
independent extrapolation formulas for extrapolations to physical quark masses
and infinite volume. We find that the finite volume effect is reduced when the
nucleon carries a finite momentum. For nucleon momentum greater than $1$ GeV
and the lattice size $L$ and pion mass $ m_\pi $ satisfying $m_\pi L\geq 3$,
the finite volume effect is less than $1\%$ and is negligible for the current
precision of lattice computations. This can be interpreted as a Lorentz
contraction of the nucleon size in the $z$-direction which makes the lattice
size effectively larger in that direction. We also find that the quark mass
dependence in the infinite volume limit computed with non-zero nucleon momentum
reproduces the previous result computed at zero momentum, as expected. Our

  Robustness",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be prone to adversarial attacks, for
which many remedies are proposed. While adversarial training (AT) is regarded
as the most robust defense, it suffers from poor performance both on clean
examples and under other types of attacks, e.g. attacks with larger
perturbations. Meanwhile, regularizers that encourage uncertain outputs, such
as entropy maximization (EntM) and label smoothing (LS) can maintain accuracy
on clean examples and improve performance under weak attacks, yet their ability
to defend against strong attacks is still in doubt. In this paper, we revisit
uncertainty promotion regularizers, including EntM and LS, in the field of
adversarial learning. We show that EntM and LS alone provide robustness only
under small perturbations. Contrarily, we show that uncertainty promotion
regularizers complement AT in a principled manner, consistently improving
performance on both clean examples and under various attacks, especially
attacks with large perturbations. We further analyze how uncertainty promotion
regularizers enhance the performance of AT from the perspective of Jacobian
matrices $\nabla_X f(X;\theta)$, and find out that EntM effectively shrinks the
norm of Jacobian matrices and hence promotes robustness.

paper evaluates the performance of precise point positioning (PPP) service
using a software-defined receiver (SDR). An experiment was carried out tu
verify the feasibility of the SDR. The PPP-B2b signal was processed to obtain
PPP service information, including orbit corrections, clock corrections, and
differential code bias corrections. The time-varying attributes of these
corrections of BDS and GPS are evaluated, and the integrity and stability of
the PPP service were analyzed. The results show the PPP-B2b signal can stably
provide PPP services for staellites in the Asia-Pacific region, including
centimeter to decimeter-level orbit corrections and meter-level clock

interacting shell model, while the studies from the single particle viewpoint
is relatively lacking or neglected. In particular, the isospin dependence of
spin-orbit splitting has become increasingly important as $N/Z$ increases in
neutron-rich nuclei. Following the initial independent-particle strategy
towards explaining the occurrence of magic numbers, we have systematically
investigated the isospin effect on the shell evolution of neutron-rich nuclei
within the Woods-Saxon (WS) mean-field potential plus the spin-orbit term. It
is found that new magic numbers $N = 14$ and $N =16$ may emerge in neutron-rich
nuclei if one changes the sign of the isospin-dependent term in the spin-orbit
coupling while the traditional magic number $N = 20$ may disappear. The magic
number $N = 28$ is expected to be destroyed despite the sign choice of the
isospin part in spin-orbit splitting, while $N = 50$ may disappear and $N = 82$
persists within the single particle scheme. Besides, an appreciable amount of
energy gap appears at $N = 32$ and 34 in neutron-rich Ca isotopes. All these
results are more consistent with those of the interacting shell model, when the
sign of the isospin term of the WS potential is different from that of the
corresponding spin-orbit coupling part. The present study may provide a more
reasonable starting point for not only the interacting shell but also other
nuclear many-body calculations towards the neutron-dripline.

prove that this problem is NP-hard already for a network with a single ReLU. We
also prove NP-hardness for outputting a weighted sum of $k$ ReLUs minimizing
the squared error (for $k>1$) even in the realizable setting (i.e., when the
labels are consistent with an unknown depth-2 ReLU network). We are also able
to obtain lower bounds on the running time in terms of the desired additive
error $\epsilon$. To obtain our lower bounds, we use the Gap Exponential Time
Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) as well as a new hypothesis regarding the hardness of
approximating the well known Densest $\kappa$-Subgraph problem in
subexponential time (these hypotheses are used separately in proving different
lower bounds). For example, we prove that under reasonable hardness
assumptions, any proper learning algorithm for finding the best fitting ReLU
must run in time exponential in $1/\epsilon^2$. Together with a previous work
regarding improperly learning a ReLU (Goel et al., COLT'17), this implies the
first separation between proper and improper algorithms for learning a ReLU. We
also study the problem of properly learning a depth-2 network of ReLUs with
bounded weights giving new (worst-case) upper bounds on the running time needed
to learn such networks both in the realizable and agnostic settings. Our upper
bounds on the running time essentially matches our lower bounds in terms of the

three-dimensional (3D) structure. Determining this structure computationally
remains an unsolved grand challenge. A major bottleneck involves selecting the
most accurate structural model among a large pool of candidates, a task
addressed in model quality assessment. Here, we present a novel deep learning
approach to assess the quality of a protein model. Our network builds on a
point-based representation of the atomic structure and rotation-equivariant
convolutions at different levels of structural resolution. These combined
aspects allow the network to learn end-to-end from entire protein structures.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in scoring protein models
submitted to recent rounds of CASP, a blind prediction community experiment.
Particularly striking is that our method does not use physics-inspired energy
terms and does not rely on the availability of additional information (beyond
the atomic structure of the individual protein model), such as sequence
alignments of multiple proteins.

their routine photos online. However, undesirable privacy leakages occur due to
such online photo sharing behaviors. Advanced deep neural network (DNN) based
object detectors can easily steal users' personal information exposed in shared
photos. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial example based
privacy-preserving technique for social images against object detectors based
privacy stealing. Specifically, we develop an Object Disappearance Algorithm to
craft two kinds of adversarial social images. One can hide all objects in the
social images from being detected by an object detector, and the other can make
the customized sensitive objects be incorrectly classified by the object
detector. The Object Disappearance Algorithm constructs perturbation on a clean
social image. After being injected with the perturbation, the social image can
easily fool the object detector, while its visual quality will not be degraded.
We use two metrics, privacy-preserving success rate and privacy leakage rate,
to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show
that, the proposed method can effectively protect the privacy of social images.
The privacy-preserving success rates of the proposed method on MS-COCO and
PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets are high up to 96.1% and 99.3%, respectively, and the
privacy leakage rates on these two datasets are as low as 0.57% and 0.07%,
respectively. In addition, compared with existing image processing methods (low
brightness, noise, blur, mosaic and JPEG compression), the proposed method can
achieve much better performance in privacy protection and image visual quality
maintenance.

either frequent channel tracking or complicated signaling schemes such as
orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. In this paper, we propose
low-complexity frequency domain equalizations to combat fast fading, based on
novel discrete delay-time and frequency-Doppler channel models. Exploiting the
circular stripe diagonal nature of the frequency-Doppler channel matrix, we
introduce low-complexity frequency domain minimum mean square error (MMSE)
equalization for OTFS systems with fully resolvable Doppler spreads. We also
demonstrate that the proposed MMSE equalization is applicable to conventional
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single carrier frequency
domain equalization (SC-FDE) systems with short signal frames and partially
resolvable Doppler spreads. After generalizing the input-output data symbol
relationship, we analyze the equalization performance via channel matrix
eigenvalue decomposition and derive a closed-form expression for the
theoretical bit-error-rate. Simulation results for OTFS, OFDM, and SC-FDE
modulations verify that the proposed low-complexity frequency domain
equalization methods can effectively exploit the time diversity over fast
fading channels. Even with partially resolvable Doppler spread, the
conventional SC-FDE can achieve performance close to OTFS, especially in fast

new medium-deep adaptive optics aided MUSE observations of fields selected from

facilitate a direct comparison with Integral Field Spectroscopy surveys of the
nearby Universe, such as SAMI and MaNGA, and at higher redshifts using adaptive

dust growth and destruction processes using a 64-bin discrete grain size
evolution model without spatially resolving each galaxy. Our model broadly
reproduces the observed dust--metallicity scaling relation in nearby galaxies.
The grain size distribution is dominated by large grains at $z\gtrsim 3$ and
the small-grain abundance rapidly increases by shattering and accretion (dust
growth) at $z\lesssim 2$. The grain size distribution approaches the so-called
MRN distribution at $z\sim 1$, but a suppression of large-grain abundances
occurs at $z<1$. Based on the computed grain size distributions and grain
compositions, we also calculate the evolution of the extinction curve for each
Milky Way analogue. Extinction curves are initially flat at $z>2$, and become
consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve at $z\lesssim 1$ at $1/\lambda <
6~\rm \mu m^{-1}$. However, typical extinction curves predicted by our model
have a steeper slope at short wavelengths than is observed in the Milky Way.
This is due to the low-redshift decline of gas-phase metallicity and the dense
gas fraction in our TNG Milky Way analogues that suppresses the formation of
large grains through coagulation.

flow path networks with parametric weights. We are given a dynamic flow network
consisting of an undirected path with positive edge lengths, positive edge
capacities, and nonnegative vertex weights. A path can be considered as a road,
an edge length as the distance along the road and a vertex weight as the number
of people at the site. An edge capacity limits the number of people that can
enter the edge per unit time. We consider the problem of locating a sink in the
network, to which all the people evacuate from the vertices as quickly as
possible. In our model, each weight is represented by a linear function in a
common parameter $t$, and the decision maker who determines the location of a
sink does not know the value of $t$. We formulate the sink location problem
under such uncertainty as the minmax regret problem. Given $t$ and a sink
location $x$, the cost of $x$ under $t$ is the sum of arrival times at $x$ for
all the people determined by $t$. The regret for $x$ under $t$ is the gap
between the cost of $x$ under $t$ and the optimal cost under $t$. The task of
the problem is formulated as the one to find a sink location that minimizes the
maximum regret over all $t$. For the problem, we propose an $O(n^4
2^{\alpha(n)} \alpha(n) \log n)$ time algorithm where $n$ is the number of
vertices in the network and $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
Also for the special case in which every edge has the same capacity, we show
that the complexity can be reduced to $O(n^3 2^{\alpha(n)} \alpha(n) \log n)$.

to draw inferences from visual, language and acoustic sequences. A majority of
existing works generally focus on aligned fusion, mostly at word level, of the
three modalities to accomplish this task, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To overcome this issue, we seek to address the task of multimodal
sequence analysis on unaligned modality sequences which is still relatively
underexplored and also more challenging. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and its
variants are widely used in multimodal sequence analysis, but they are
susceptible to the issues of gradient vanishing/explosion and high time
complexity due to its recurrent nature. Therefore, we propose a novel model,
termed Multimodal Graph, to investigate the effectiveness of graph neural
networks (GNN) on modeling multimodal sequential data. The graph-based
structure enables parallel computation in time dimension and can learn longer
temporal dependency in long unaligned sequences. Specifically, our Multimodal
Graph is hierarchically structured to cater to two stages, i.e., intra- and
inter-modal dynamics learning. For the first stage, a graph convolutional
network is employed for each modality to learn intra-modal dynamics. In the
second stage, given that the multimodal sequences are unaligned, the commonly
considered word-level fusion does not pertain. To this end, we devise a graph
pooling fusion network to automatically learn the associations between various
nodes from different modalities. Additionally, we define multiple ways to
construct the adjacency matrix for sequential data. Experimental results
suggest that our graph-based model reaches state-of-the-art performance on two

prototypesfrom unlabeled texts, to facilitate the long-tail relation extraction
by transferring knowledge from the relation types with sufficient trainingdata.
We learn relation prototypes as an implicit factor between entities, which
reflects the meanings of relations as well as theirproximities for transfer
learning. Specifically, we construct a co-occurrence graph from texts, and
capture both first-order andsecond-order entity proximities for embedding
learning. Based on this, we further optimize the distance from entity pairs
tocorresponding prototypes, which can be easily adapted to almost arbitrary RE
frameworks. Thus, the learning of infrequent or evenunseen relation types will
benefit from semantically proximate relations through pairs of entities and
large-scale textual information.We have conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets: New York Times and Google Distant
Supervision.Compared with eight state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed model
achieves significant improvements (4.1% F1 on average). Furtherresults on
long-tail relations demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned relation
prototypes. We further conduct an ablation study toinvestigate the impacts of
varying components, and apply it to four basic relation extraction models to
verify the generalization ability.Finally, we analyze several example cases to
give intuitive impressions as qualitative analysis. Our codes will be released
later.

$n$-ic forms having any fixed odd leading coefficient. Specifically, we compute
upper bounds on the average size of the $2$-torsion in the class groups of such

of these upper bounds is in fact an equality.
  Our theorems extend recent work of Bhargava-Hanke-Shankar in the cubic case
and of Siad in the monic case to binary forms of any degree with any fixed odd
leading coefficient. When $n$ is odd, we find that fixing the leading
coefficient increases the average $2$-torsion in the class group, relative to
the prediction of Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet-Malle. When $n$ is even, such
predictions are yet to be formulated; along with Siad's results in the monic

parametrizing square roots of the class of the inverse different of a ring cut

analysis (TDA) and sheaf theory. Topological data analysis, a rising field in
mathematics and computer science, concerns the shape of the data and has been
proven effective in many scientific disciplines. Sheaf theory, a mathematics
subject in algebraic geometry, provides a framework for describing the local
consistency in geometric objects. Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main
driving forces in TDA, and the idea is to track changes of geometric objects at
different scales. The persistence diagram (PD) summarizes the information of PH
in the form of a multi-set. While PD provides useful information about the
underlying objects, it lacks fine relations about the local consistency of
specific pairs of generators in PD, such as the merging relation between two
connected components in the PH. The sheaf structure provides a novel point of
view for describing the merging relation of local objects in PH. It is the goal
of this paper to establish a theoretic framework that utilizes the sheaf theory
to uncover finer information from the PH. We also show that the proposed theory

resonators under a synthetic phononic gauge field. The tunable gauge phase is
mediated by the phase difference between the $\mathcal{PT}$- and
anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mechanical couplings in a multimode
optomechanical system. The transmission spectrum then exhibits the asymmetric
Fano line shape or double optomechanically induced transparency by modulating
the gauge phase. Moreover, the eigenvalues will collapse and become degenerate
although the mechanical coupling is continuously increased. Such
counterintuitive energy-attraction, instead of anti-crossing, attributes to
destructive interferences between $\mathcal{PT}$- and
anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric couplings. We find that the energy-attraction, as
well as the accompanied exceptional points (EPs), can be more intuitively
observed in the cavity output power spectrum where the mechanical eigenvalues
correspond to the peaks. For mechanical cooling, the average phonon occupation
number becomes minimum at these EPs. Especially, phonon transport becomes
nonreciprocal and even ideally unidirectional at the EPs. Finally, we propose a
heating-resistant ground-state cooling based on the nonreciprocal phonon
transport, which is mediated by the gauge field. Towards the quantum regime of
macroscopic mechanical resonators, most optomechanical systems are ultimately
limited by their intrinsic cavity or mechanical heating. Our work revealed that
the thermal energy transfer can be blocked by tuning the gauge phase, which
supports a promising route to overpass the notorious heating limitations.

reference model to produce multiple synthetic datasets. Each is run with a
different weather dataset from a single location and serves for the calibration

parity-check matrix and use the weights of NBP as a measure of the importance
of the check nodes (CNs) to decoding. The unimportant CNs are then pruned. In
contrast to NBP, which performs decoding on a given fixed parity-check matrix,
the proposed pruning-based neural belief propagation (PB-NBP) typically results
in a different parity-check matrix in each iteration. For a given complexity in
terms of CN evaluations, we show that PB-NBP yields significant performance
improvements with respect to NBP. We apply the proposed decoder to the decoding
of a Reed-Muller code, a short low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, and a
polar code. PB-NBP outperforms NBP decoding over an overcomplete parity-check
matrix by 0.27-0.31 dB while reducing the number of required CN evaluations by
up to 97%. For the LDPC code, PB-NBP outperforms conventional belief
propagation with the same number of CN evaluations by 0.52 dB. We further
extend the pruning concept to offset min-sum decoding and introduce a
pruning-based neural offset min-sum (PB-NOMS) decoder, for which we jointly
optimize the offsets and the quantization of the messages and offsets. We

keeps evolving under numerous constraints. Two key dimensions have recently
achieved prominence in characterizing this diversity: heterogeneity and
spreading. However, modern settlements do not fill the entire
heterogeneity--spreading space. Yet, the dynamic mechanisms leading to
emergence of the observed layouts are unclear. Here, we assess the
heterogeneity and spreading of population density in 25 Australian and 175 US
cities. We observe that larger cities tend to form a cluster with a low degree
of spreading and a high degree of heterogeneity, and relate this observation to
the dynamic properties of intra-urban migration in these cities. In doing so,
we introduce a model consistent with the relocation data which predicts such
highly compact and heterogeneous structure for the majority of cities, in
concordance with the actual layout data. In addition, we analyze the stability
of the long-term dynamics of urban configurations with respect to changes in
the mobility characteristics, such as social disposition and relocation
impedance near their equilibrium states. As a result, we report three
qualitatively distinct feasible phases of urban structures: uniform,
monocentric, and polycentric. These phases are shown to be separated by either
smooth or sharp transitions, observed in the space of suitably chosen
configurational parameters. Finally, this analysis reveals that the set of all
possible equilibrium configurations (""configurational attractors"") form a
narrow region in the heterogeneity--spreading space, thus explaining the

stringent requirements on latency and reliability, ultra-reliability and low
latency communication (uRLLC) has become one of the three key communication
scenarios for the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G communication systems. In
this paper, we focus on the beamforming design problem for the downlink
multiuser uRLLC systems. Since the strict demand on the reliability and
latency, in general, short packet transmission is a favorable form for uRLLC
systems, which indicates the literature Shannon's capacity formula is no longer
applicable. With the finite blocklength transmission, the achievable delivery
rate is greatly influenced by the reliability and latency. Using the developed
achievable delivery rate formula for finite blocklength transmission, we
respectively formulate the problems of interest as the weighted sum rate
maximization, energy efficiency maximization, and user fairness optimization by
considering the maximum allowable transmission power and minimum rate
requirement. It's worthy pointing out that this is the first work to design the
beamforming vectors for the downlink multiuser uRLLC systems. To address these
non-convex problems, some important insights have been discovered by analyzing
the function of achievable delivery rate. For example, the minimum rate
requirement can be realized by low bounded the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Based on the discovered results, we
provide algorithms to optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation,
which are guaranteed to converge to a local optimum solution of the formulated
problems with low computational complexity. Our simulation results reveal that
our proposed beamforming algorithms outperform the zero-forcing beamforming
algorithm with equal power allocation widely used in the existing literatures.

utilizes the Riemannian geometry of the approximation space, followed by an

stellar population parameters for galaxies spanning $0<z<9$ from the Deep
Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). DEVILS is a deep spectroscopic
redshift survey with very high completeness, covering several premier deep
fields including COSMOS (D10). Our stellar mass and star formation rate
estimates are self-consistently derived using the spectral energy distribution
(SED) modelling code ProSpect, using well-motivated parameterisations for dust
attenuation, star formation histories, and metallicity evolution. We show how
these improvements, and especially our physically motivated assumptions about
metallicity evolution, have an appreciable systematic effect on the inferred
stellar masses, at the level of $\sim$\,0.2 dex. To illustrate the scientific
value of these data, we map the evolving galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) and
the SFR-$M_\star$ relation for $0<z<4.25$. In agreement with past studies, we
find that most of the evolution in the SMF is driven by the characteristic
density parameter, with little evolution in the characteristic mass and
low-mass slopes. Where the SFR-$M_\star$ relation is indistinguishable from a
power-law at $z>2.6$, we see evidence of a bend in the relation at low
redshifts ($z<0.45$). This suggests evolution in both the normalisation and
shape of the SFR-$M_\star$ relation since cosmic noon. It is significant that
we only clearly see this bend when combining our new DEVILS measurements with
consistently derived values for lower redshift galaxies from the Galaxy And
Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey: this shows the power of having consistent
treatment for galaxies at all redshifts.

architectures - it is one of the reasons why they work so well on images where
relevant information is, to a large extent, local. However, perspective effects
stemming from the projection in a conventional camera vary for different global
positions in the image. We introduce Perspective Crop Layers (PCLs) - a form of
perspective crop of the region of interest based on the camera geometry - and
show that accounting for the perspective consistently improves the accuracy of
state-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction methods. PCLs are modular neural
network layers, which, when inserted into existing CNN and MLP architectures,
deterministically remove the location-dependent perspective effects while
leaving end-to-end training and the number of parameters of the underlying
neural network unchanged. We demonstrate that PCL leads to improved 3D human
pose reconstruction accuracy for CNN architectures that use cropping
operations, such as spatial transformer networks (STN), and, somewhat
surprisingly, MLPs used for 2D-to-3D keypoint lifting. Our conclusion is that
it is important to utilize camera calibration information when available, for
classical and deep-learning-based computer vision alike. PCL offers an easy way
to improve the accuracy of existing 3D reconstruction networks by making them

dynamical phase transitions combine aspects of symmetry, topology, and
non-equilibrium physics, however, progress has been hindered by the notorious
difficulties of predicting the time evolution of large, interacting quantum
systems. Here, we tackle this outstanding problem by determining the critical
times of interacting many-body systems after a quench using Loschmidt
cumulants. Specifically, we investigate dynamical topological phase transitions
in the interacting Kitaev chain and in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. To this
end, we map out the thermodynamic lines of complex times, where the Loschmidt
amplitude vanishes, and identify the intersections with the imaginary axis,
which yield the real critical times after a quench. For the Kitaev chain, we
can accurately predict how the critical behavior is affected by strong
interactions, which gradually shift the time at which a dynamical phase
transition occurs. We also discuss the experimental perspectives of predicting
the first critical time of a quantum many-body system by measuring the energy
fluctuations in the initial state, and we describe the prospects of
implementing our method on a near-term quantum computer with a limited number
of qubits. Our work demonstrates that Loschmidt cumulants are a powerful tool
to unravel the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated many-body
systems, and our approach can immediately be applied in higher dimensions.

requires I) faithful translation of domain-invariant features (e.g. shape

target-domain features (e.g. tissue appearance in MR). In this work, we propose
Manifold Disentanglement Generative Adversarial Network (MDGAN), a novel image
translation framework that explicitly models these two types of features. It
employs a fully convolutional generator to model domain-invariant features, and
it uses style codes to separately model target-domain features as a manifold.
This design aims to explicitly disentangle domain-invariant features and
domain-specific features while gaining individual control of both. The image
translation process is formulated as a stylisation task, where the input is
""stylised"" (translated) into diverse target-domain images based on style codes
sampled from the learnt manifold. We test MDGAN for multi-modal medical image
translation, where we create two domain-specific manifold clusters on the
manifold to translate segmentation maps into pseudo-CT and pseudo-MR images,
respectively. We show that by traversing a path across the MR manifold cluster,
the target output can be manipulated while still retaining the shape

the standard terms of the expansion over P and director gradients) includes,
also standard for liquid crystals, director flexoelectric coupling term f and
often overlooked in the literature (although similar by its symmetry to the

the easy-plane anisotropy case the uniform N_F state loses its stability with
respect to one-dimensional or two-dimensional modulation. For non-zero f the 2D
modulation threshold is always higher than its 1D counterpart. No any
instability at all if one neglects the dipole-flexoelectric coupling. In the
easy-axis case the both instability thresholds are the same, and the
instability can occur even without flexo-dipolr coupling. We speculate that the

interest in 3D object detection and resulted in many excellent 3D object
detection algorithms. However, the vast majority of algorithms only model
single-frame data, ignoring the temporal information of the sequence of data.
In this work, we propose a new transformer, called Temporal-Channel
Transformer, to model the spatial-temporal domain and channel domain
relationships for video object detecting from Lidar data. As a special design
of this transformer, the information encoded in the encoder is different from
that in the decoder, i.e. the encoder encodes temporal-channel information of
multiple frames while the decoder decodes the spatial-channel information for
the current frame in a voxel-wise manner. Specifically, the temporal-channel
encoder of the transformer is designed to encode the information of different
channels and frames by utilizing the correlation among features from different
channels and frames. On the other hand, the spatial decoder of the transformer
will decode the information for each location of the current frame. Before
conducting the object detection with detection head, the gate mechanism is
deployed for re-calibrating the features of current frame, which filters out
the object irrelevant information by repetitively refine the representation of
target frame along with the up-sampling process. Experimental results show that
we achieve the state-of-the-art performance in grid voxel-based 3D object

scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small
divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new transfer model called
Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM) to handle such small divergence of
domains. Specifically, we work on the new source and target data learned from
existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source
training data populations by randomly corrupting the new source data using some
noises, and then train a transfer model $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ that performs
well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more
corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the new target data can be
covered by the constructed source data populations, and thus better transfer
performance can be achieved by $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$. An ideal case is with
infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a
marginalized solution that enables to train an $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$
without conducting any corruption but equivalent to be trained using infinite
source noisy data populations. We further propose two instantiations of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$, which theoretically show the transfer superiority
over the conventional transfer model $\mathcal{M}$. More importantly, both
instantiations have closed-form solutions, leading to a fast and efficient
training process. Experiments on various real-world transfer tasks show that
RTM is a promising transfer model.

framework for refuting the solvability of a given distributed task by means of
logical obstruction: One just needs to devise a formula, in the formal language
of epistemic logic, that describes a discrepancy between the model of
computation and that of the task. However, few instances of logical obstruction
were presented in their paper and specifically logical obstruction to the
wait-free 2-set agreement task was left as an open problem. Soon later, Nishida
affirmatively answered to the problem by providing inductively defined logical
obstruction formulas to the wait-free $k$-set agreement tasks.
  The present paper refines Nishida's work and devises logical obstruction

supersede the wait-free model. These instances of logical obstruction formulas
exemplify that the logical framework can provide yet another feasible method

language processing tasks and attracted great attentions. Despite its accuracy
gains, the BERT model generally involves a huge number of parameters and needs
to be trained on massive datasets, so training such a model is computationally
very challenging and time-consuming. Hence, training efficiency should be a
critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-refined training
framework named CoRe to speed up the training of BERT. Specifically, we
decompose the training process of BERT into two phases. In the first phase, by
introducing fast attention mechanism and decomposing the large parameters in
the feed-forward network sub-layer, we construct a relaxed BERT model which has
much less parameters and much lower model complexity than the original BERT, so
the relaxed model can be quickly trained. In the second phase, we transform the
trained relaxed BERT model into the original BERT and further retrain the
model. Thanks to the desired initialization provided by the relaxed model, the
retraining phase requires much less training steps, compared with training an
original BERT model from scratch with a random initialization. Experimental
results show that the proposed CoRe framework can greatly reduce the training

wireless setting is considered here. In our setup, the available limited
bandwidth resources are allocated in order to serve randomly arriving service
demands, which in turn belong to different classes in terms of payload data
requirement, delay tolerance, and importance/priority. In addition to
heterogeneous traffic, another major challenge stems from random service rates
due to time-varying wireless communication channels. Various approaches for
scheduling and resource allocation can be used, ranging from simple greedy
heuristics and constrained optimization to combinatorics. Those methods are
tailored to specific network or application configuration and are usually
suboptimal. To this purpose, we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and
propose a distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm
combined with Deep Sets to tackle the aforementioned problem. Furthermore, we
present a novel way to use a Dueling Network, which leads to further
performance improvement. Our proposed algorithm is tested on both synthetic and
real data, showing consistent gains against state-of-the-art conventional
methods from combinatorics, optimization, and scheduling metrics.

gain in many natural language processing tasks. Despite its effectiveness, the
huge number of parameters makes training a BERT model computationally very
challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage layerwise
training (MSLT) approach to reduce the training time of BERT. We decompose the
whole training process into several stages. The training is started from a
small model with only a few encoder layers and we gradually increase the depth
of the model by adding new encoder layers. At each stage, we only train the top
(near the output layer) few encoder layers which are newly added. The
parameters of the other layers which have been trained in the previous stages
will not be updated in the current stage. In BERT training, the backward
computation is much more time-consuming than the forward computation,
especially in the distributed training setting in which the backward
computation time further includes the communication time for gradient
synchronization. In the proposed training strategy, only top few layers
participate in backward computation, while most layers only participate in
forward computation. Hence both the computation and communication efficiencies
are greatly improved. Experimental results show that the proposed method can
achieve more than 110% training speedup without significant performance
degradation.

portfolio weights scale like performance to the power of $1/3$, as opposed to
linear scaling of Kelly portfolios; such portfolio construction significantly
reduces portfolio concentration, and the winner-takes-all problem inherent in
Kelly portfolios. For hybrid portfolios, the variance is diversified at the

Different methods are nowadays used either model dependent or based on
calibrated empirical relations. The most reliable results are generally
obtained when different methods are used in complementary way. We propose a new
method for the age determination of young stellar associations and open
clusters (ages < 125 Myr), which can allow to further constrain the age when
used together with other methods. We explore the amplitude of the photometric
variability in bins of color and rotation period of five young associations and
clusters spanning an interval of ages from 1-3 Myr to 625 Myr (Taurus, rho
Ophiuchi, Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, and Praesepe), which all have high-quality
time-series photometry from Kepler K2 campaigns. In the low-mass regime, we
find that stars with similar color and rotation period but different ages
exhibit different amplitudes of their photometric variability, with younger
stars showing a larger photometric variability than older stars. The decline of
photometric variability amplitude versus age in stars with similar color and
rotation period can be in principle calibrated and be adopted as an additional
empirical relation to constrain the age of young associations and open
clusters, provided that time-series photometry is available for their low-mass
members.

noise in the system, it can severely affect the life quality of people that
reside in the buildings. Our simulation shows that turbulence kinetic energy
(TKE) is unevenly distributed around the rotation axis. Large TKE exists near
the shroud at the pressure sides of the blades. It is caused by the
recirculating flow. Moreover, the position of the largest TKE periodically
varies among the blades. The period corresponds to approximately 4 times the

of the tonal noise at the blade passing frequencies agrees well with

this issue, we first reformulate the district heating network model through
equivalent transformation and variable substitution. It shows that the
reformulated model has only one set of nonconvex constraints with reduced

storage in the real-time electricity market under a stochastic renewable

not be assessable for a strategic participant, hence we propose a paradigm that
uses partial information including the forecast of real-time prices and slopes
of the aggregate supply curve to model the price impact of storage use in the
price-maker storage management problem. As a price maker, the community energy
storage can not only earn profits through energy arbitrage but also smooth
price trajectories and further influence social welfare. We formulate the
problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process that aims to maximize the
energy arbitrage and social welfare of the prosumer-based community. The
advance of the management scheme is that the optimal policy has a threshold
structure. The structure has an analytic form that can guide the energy storage
to charge/discharge by comparing its current marginal value and the expected
future marginal value. Case studies indicate that welfare-maximizing storage
earns more benefits than profit-maximizing storage. The proposed
threshold-based algorithm can guarantee optimality and largely decrease the
computational complexity of standard stochastic dynamic programming.

phases. This dissipation enhancement has been rationalized by invoking either a
geometrical confinement of the shear in the liquid phase, or the influence of
the interface viscosity. However, a precise localization of the dissipation,
and its mechanism, at the bubble scale is still lacking. To this aim, we
simultaneously monitored the evolution of the local flow velocity, film
thickness and surface tension of a five films assembly, induced by different
controlled deformations. These measurements allow us to build local
constitutive relations for this foam elementary brick. We first show that, for
our millimetric foam films, the main part of the film has a purely elastic,
reversible behavior, thus ruling out the interface viscosity to explain the
observed dissipation. We then highlight a generic frustration at the menisci,
controlling the interface transfer between neighbor films and resulting in the
localization of a bulk shear flow close to the menisci. A model accounting for
surfactant transport in these small sheared regions is developed. It is in good
agreement with the experiment, and demonstrate that most of the dissipation is
localized in these domains. The length of these sheared regions, determined by
the physico-chemical properties of the solution, sets a transition between a
large bubble regime in which the films are mainly stretched and compressed, and
a small bubble regime in which they are sheared. Finally, we discuss the
parameter range where a model of foam viscosity could be built on the basis of
these local results.

combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum for high-precision
measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity. In turn, these measurements will
allow us to distinguish between various models of inflation. However, precision
observations require theoretical precision at least at the same level. We
extend the theoretical understanding of the galaxy bispectrum by incorporating
a consistent general relativistic model of galaxy bias at second order, in the
presence of local primordial non-Gaussianity. The influence of primordial
non-Gaussianity on the bispectrum extends beyond the galaxy bias and the dark
matter density, due to redshift-space effects. The standard redshift-space
distortions at first and second order produce a well-known primordial
non-Gaussian imprint on the bispectrum. Relativistic corrections to
redshift-space distortions generate new contributions to this primordial
non-Gaussian signal, arising from: (1)~a coupling of first-order
scale-dependent bias with first-order relativistic observational effects, and
(2)~linearly evolved non-Gaussianity in the second-order velocity and metric
potentials which appear in relativistic observational effects. Our analysis
allows for a consistent separation of the relativistic `contamination' from the
primordial signal, in order to avoid biasing the measurements by using an
incorrect theoretical model. We show that the bias from using a Newtonian
analysis of the squeezed bispectrum could be $\Delta \fnl\sim 5$ for a Stage IV

occurred in a spiral arm of NGC 5806, where a star-forming complex is apparent
with a giant H II region. By modelling the ionised gas, a compact star cluster
and the resolved stars, we derive the ages and extinctions of stellar
populations in the vicinity of the SNe. The various components are consistent
with a sequence of triggered star formation as the spiral density wave swept
through their positions. For SNe 2004dg and 2012P, we identify their host
stellar populations and derive initial masses of $10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2}~M_\odot$

results are consistent with those from pre-explosion images or nebular-phase

  We slightly generalize $s$-configurations to {\em extended

accretion has long been recognized. However, the precise nature of the Moon's
accretional history remains enigmatic. There exists a significant mismatch of
HSE budgets between the Earth and Moon, with the Earth disproportionally
accreted far more HSEs than the Moon did. Several scenarios have been proposed
to explain this conundrum, including the delivery of HSEs to Earth by a few big
impactors, the accretion of pebble-sized objects on dynamically cold orbits
that enhanced the Earth's gravitational focusing factor, and the ""sawtooth
model"" with much reduced impact flux before ~4.10 Gyr. However, most of these
models assume a high impactor retention ratio f (fraction of impactor mass
retained on the target) for the Moon. Here, we performed a series of impact
simulations to quantify the f-value, followed by a Monte Carlo procedure
enacting a monotonically decaying impact flux, to compute the mass accreted
into lunar crust and mantle over their histories. We found that the average
f-value for the Moon's entire impact history is about 3 times lower than
previously estimated. Our results indicate that, to match the HSE budget of
lunar crust and mantle, the retention of HSEs should have started ~ 4.35 Gyr
ago, when most of lunar magma ocean was solidified. Mass accreted prior to 4.35
Gyr must have lost its HSE to the lunar core, presumably during the lunar
mantle crystallization. The combination of a low impactor retention ratio and a
late retention of HSEs in the lunar mantle provide a realistic explanation for
the apparent deficit of Moon's late accreted mass relative to the Earth.

thickness, and composition between its nearside and farside. Although several
scenarios have been proposed to explain these asymmetries, their origin remains
debated. Recent remote sensing observations suggest that (1) the crust on the
farside highlands consists of two layers: a primary anorthositic layer with
thickness of ~30-50 km and on top a more mafic-rich layer ~10 km thick; and (2)
the nearside exhibits a large area of low-Ca pyroxene that has been interpreted
to have an impact origin. These observations support the idea that the lunar
nearside-farside asymmetries may be the result of a giant impact. Here, using
quantitative numerical modeling, we test the hypothesis that a giant impact on
the early Moon can explain the striking differences in elevation, crustal
thickness, and composition between the nearside and farside of the Moon. We
find that a large impactor, impacting the current nearside with a low velocity,
can form a mega-basin and reproduce the characteristics of the crustal
asymmetry and structures comparable to those observed on the current Moon,
including the nearside lowlands and the farside's mafic-rich layer on top of a
primordial anorthositic crust. Our model shows that the excavated deep-seated
KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) material, deposited
close to the basin rim, slumps back into the basin and covers the entire basin
floor; subsequent large impacts can transport the shallow KREEP material to the
surface, resulting in its observed distribution. In addition, our model
suggests that prior to the asymmetry-forming impact, the Moon may have had an
182W anomaly compared to the immediate post-giant impact Earth's mantle, as
predicted if the Moon was created through a giant collision with the
proto-Earth.

different laser fluence on the exfoliation process of graphene. The variations

attack method targeting object detectors under real-world conditions. The
generated adversarial examples are robust to various physical constraints and
visually look similar to the original images, thus these adversarial examples
are natural to humans and will not cause any suspicions. First, to ensure the
robustness of the adversarial examples in real-world conditions, the proposed
method exploits different image transformation functions, to simulate various
physical changes during the iterative optimization of the adversarial examples
generation. Second, to construct natural adversarial examples, the proposed
method uses an adaptive mask to constrain the area and intensities of the added
perturbations, and utilizes the real-world perturbation score (RPS) to make the
perturbations be similar to those real noises in physical world. Compared with
existing studies, our generated adversarial examples can achieve a high success
rate with less conspicuous perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate
that, the generated adversarial examples are robust under various indoor and
outdoor physical conditions, including different distances, angles,
illuminations, and photographing. Specifically, the attack success rate of
generated adversarial examples indoors and outdoors is high up to 73.33% and
82.22%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method ensures the naturalness of
the generated adversarial example, and the size of added perturbations is much
smaller than the perturbations in the existing works. Further, the proposed
physical adversarial attack method can be transferred from the white-box models
to other object detection models.

shifts of various vibrational Raman modes across the heterointerface and along
the entire depth of the 4H- and 6H-SiC layers. Using the earlier experimental
prediction for the phonon-deformation potential constants, we determine the
stress tensor components in SiC as a function of the distance from the AlN/SiC

that of AlN, the SiC layers are compressively strained at the heterointerface.
This counterintuitive behavior is explained by different coefficients of
thermal expansion of SiC and AlN when the heterostructures are cooled from
growth to room temperature. The compressive stress values are maximum at the
heterointerface, approaching one GPa, and relaxes to the equilibrium value on
the scale of several tens of microns from the heterointerface.

privacy of confidential training data of machine learning models. This paper
proposes a novel adversarial example based privacy-preserving technique
(AEPPT), which adds the crafted adversarial perturbations to the prediction of
the target model to mislead the adversary's membership inference model. The
added adversarial perturbations do not affect the accuracy of target model, but
can prevent the adversary from inferring whether a specific data is in the
training set of the target model. Since AEPPT only modifies the original output
of the target model, the proposed method is general and does not require
modifying or retraining the target model. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can reduce the inference accuracy and precision of the
membership inference model to 50%, which is close to a random guess. Further,
for those adaptive attacks where the adversary knows the defense mechanism, the
proposed AEPPT is also demonstrated to be effective. Compared with the
state-of-the-art defense methods, the proposed defense can significantly
degrade the accuracy and precision of membership inference attacks to 50%
(i.e., the same as a random guess) while the performance and utility of the
target model will not be affected.

galaxy evolution, and crucial insights may be obtained by studying quenched
galaxies at high redshifts, at epochs when the Universe and the galaxies were
younger and simpler to model. However, establishing the degree of quiescence in
high redshift galaxies is a challenging task. One notable example is Hyde, a
recently discovered galaxy at z=3.709. As compact (r~0.5 kpc) and massive
(M*~1e11 Msun) as its quenched neighbor Jekyll, it is also extremely obscured
yet only moderately luminous in the sub-millimeter. Panchromatic modeling
suggested it could be the first galaxy found in transition to quenching at z>3,
however the data were also consistent with a broad range of star-formation
activity, including moderate SFR in the lower scatter of the galaxy
main-sequence (MS). Here, we describe ALMA observations of the [CII] 157um and
[NII] 205um far-infrared emission lines. The [CII] emission within the
half-light radius is dominated by ionized gas, while the outskirts are
dominated by PDRs or neutral gas. This suggests that the ionization in the
center is not primarily powered by on-going star formation, and could come
instead from remnant stellar populations formed in an older burst, or from a
moderate AGN. Accounting for this information in the multi-wavelength modeling
provides a tighter constraint on the star formation rate of
SFR=$50^{+24}_{-18}$ Msun/yr. This rules out fully quenched solutions, and
favors SFRs more than factor of two lower than expected for a galaxy on the MS,
confirming the nature of Hyde as a transition galaxy. Theses results suggest
that quenching happens from inside-out, and starts before the galaxy expels or
consumes all its gas reservoirs. Similar observations of a larger sample would
determine whether this is an isolated case or the norm for quenching at
high-redshift. [abriged]

due to their role as subproblems in various more complex and notoriously hard

  Our techniques lead to the first near-optimal data structures for these

vertices in the graph and by $m$ the maximum number of edges in any version of
the graph, we obtain
  - the first randomized data structure to maintain SSR and SCCs in

  - the first randomized data structure to maintain SSSP in partially dynamic
graphs in total update time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ which is near-optimal in dense

has motivated research on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with discrete
latents. However, standard VAE training is not possible in this case, which has
motivated different strategies to manipulate discrete distributions in order to
train discrete VAEs similarly to conventional ones. Here we ask if it is also
possible to keep the discrete nature of the latents fully intact by applying a
direct discrete optimization for the encoding model. The approach is
consequently strongly diverting from standard VAE-training by sidestepping
sampling approximation, reparameterization trick and amortization. Discrete
optimization is realized in a variational setting using truncated posteriors in
conjunction with evolutionary algorithms. For VAEs with binary latents, we (A)
show how such a discrete variational method ties into gradient ascent for
network weights, and (B) how the decoder is used to select latent states for
training. Conventional amortized training is more efficient and applicable to
large neural networks. However, using smaller networks, we here find direct
discrete optimization to be efficiently scalable to hundreds of latents. More
importantly, we find the effectiveness of direct optimization to be highly
competitive in `zero-shot' learning. In contrast to large supervised networks,
the here investigated VAEs can, e.g., denoise a single image without previous
training on clean data and/or training on large image datasets. More generally,
the studied approach shows that training of VAEs is indeed possible without
sampling-based approximation and reparameterization, which may be interesting
for the analysis of VAE-training in general. For `zero-shot' settings a direct
optimization, furthermore, makes VAEs competitive where they have previously
been outperformed by non-generative approaches.

EM hot-spots requires access to the gaps, which in turn depends on the size of
the analyte in relation to gap distances. Herein we leverage a well-calibrated
process based on self-assembly of block copolymer colloids on full-wafer level
to produce high density plasmonic nanopillar arrays exhibiting large number (>
10^10 /cm^2) of uniform inter-pillar EM hot-spots. The approach allows
convenient handles to systematically vary the inter-pillar gap distances down
to sub-10 nm regime. The results show compelling trends of the impact of
analyte dimensions in relation to the gap distances towards their leverage over
inter-pillar hot-spots, and the resulting sensitivity in SERS based molecular
assays. Comparing the detection of labelled proteins in surface-enhanced Raman
and metal-enhanced Fluorescence configurations further reveal the relative
advantage of Fluorescence over Raman detection while encountering the spatial
limitations imposed by the gaps. Quantitative assays with limits of detection
down to picomolar concentrations is realized for both the small organic
molecules and the proteins. The well-defined geometries delivered by
nanofabrication approach is critical to arriving at realistic geometric models
to establish meaningful correlation between structure, optical properties and
sensitivity of nanopillar arrays in plasmonic assays. The findings emphasize
the need for the rational design of EM hot-spots that take into account the
analyte dimensions to drive ultra-high sensitivity in plasmon-enhanced
spectroscopies.

temperature (T) variation of magnetization (M) with SQUID magnetometer
indicates that undoped ZnO exhibits diamagnetic property but all Li-doped

that, for some languages, one can bypass these bounds using approximate

the number of errors can be controlled. We focus on circuits in deterministic

of professional tournaments, has attracted generations of players and fans, and
also, intense attentions in artificial intelligence research. Recently,
Google's DeepMind announced AlphaStar, a grandmaster level AI in StarCraft II
that can play with humans using comparable action space and operations. In this
paper, we introduce a new AI agent, named TStarBot-X, that is trained under
orders of less computations and can play competitively with expert human
players. TStarBot-X takes advantage of important techniques introduced in
AlphaStar, and also benefits from substantial innovations including new league
training methods, novel multi-agent roles, rule-guided policy search,
stabilized policy improvement, lightweight neural network architecture, and
importance sampling in imitation learning, etc. We show that with orders of
less computation scale, a faithful reimplementation of AlphaStar's methods can
not succeed and the proposed techniques are necessary to ensure TStarBot-X's
competitive performance. We reveal all technical details that are complementary
to those mentioned in AlphaStar, showing the most sensitive parts in league
training, reinforcement learning and imitation learning that affect the
performance of the agents. Most importantly, this is an open-sourced study that
all codes and resources (including the trained model parameters) are publicly
accessible via \url{https://github.com/tencent-ailab/tleague_projpage}. We
expect this study could be beneficial for both academic and industrial future
research in solving complex problems like StarCraft, and also, might provide a
sparring partner for all StarCraft II players and other AI agents.

along with explicit performance bounds for a class of nonlinear dynamical
systems. We consider the presence of additive and multiplicative faults,
occurring simultaneously and through an identical dynamical relationship, which
represents a relevant case in several application domains. The proposed filter
architecture combines tools from model-based approaches in the control
literature and regression techniques from machine learning. To this end, we
view the regression operator through a system-theoretic perspective to develop
operator bounds that are then utilized to derive performance bounds for the
proposed estimation filter. In the case of constant, simultaneously and
identically acting additive and multiplicative faults, it can be shown that the
estimation error converges to zero with an exponential rate. The performance of
the proposed estimation filter in the presence of incipient faults is validated
through an application on the lateral safety systems of SAE level 4 automated
vehicles. The numerical results show that the theoretical bounds of this study
are indeed close to the actual estimation error.

the second observation run, O2. We trained a newly developed Mini-Inception
Resnet neural network using time-frequency images corresponding to injections
of simulated phenomenological signals, which mimic the waveforms obtained in 3D
numerical simulations of CCSNe. With this algorithm we were able to identify
signals from both our phenomenological template bank and from actual numerical
3D simulations of CCSNe. We computed the detection efficiency versus the source
distance, obtaining that, for signal to noise ratio higher than 15, the
detection efficiency is 70 % at a false alarm rate lower than 5%. We notice
also that, in the case of O2 run, it would have been possible to detect signals
emitted at 1 kpc of distance, whilst lowering down the efficiency to 60%, the
event distance reaches values up to 14 kpc.

on the observed size and position of radio sources in the solar corona. The
scattering and refraction is thought to be due to fluctuations in electron
density caused by turbulence. Hence, determining the true radio source size can
provide information on the turbulence in coronal plasma. However, the lack of
high spatial resolution radio interferometric observations at low frequencies,
such as with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), has made it difficult to
determine the true radio source size and level of radio wave scattering. Here
we directly fit the visibilities of a LOFAR observation of a Type IIIb radio
burst with an elliptical Gaussian to determine its source size and position.
This circumvents the need to image the source and then de-convolve LOFAR's
point spread function, which can introduce spurious effects to the source size
and shape. For a burst at 34.76 MHz, we find full width at half maximum (FWHM)
heights along the major and minor axes to be $18.8^\prime$ $\pm~0.1^\prime$ and
$10.2^\prime$ $\pm~0.1^\prime$, respectively, at a plane of sky heliocentric
distance of 1.75 R$_\odot$. Our results suggest that the level of density
fluctuations in the solar corona is the main cause of the scattering of radio
waves, resulting in large source sizes. However, the magnitude of $\varepsilon$
may be smaller than what has been previously derived in observations of radio
wave scattering in tied-array images.

used as a fast, one shot imaging method for the simultaneous collection of all
spectra composing a Raman image. For the suppression of autofluorescence and
background signals such as room light, shifted excitation Raman difference
spectroscopy (SERDS) was applied to remove background artifacts in Raman
spectra. To reduce acquisition times in wide field SERDS imaging, we adapted
the nod and shuffle technique from astrophysics and implemented it into a wide
field SERDS imaging setup. In our adapted version, the nod corresponds to the
change in excitation wavelength, whereas the shuffle corresponds to the
shifting of charges up and down on a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) chip
synchronous to the change in excitation wavelength. We coupled this improved
wide field SERDS imaging setup to diode lasers with 784.4/785.5 and 457.7/458.9
nm excitation and applied it to samples such as paracetamol and aspirin
tablets, polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate beads, as well as pork meat
using multiple accumulations with acquisition times in the range of 50 to 200
ms. The results tackle two main challenges of SERDS imaging: gradual
photobleaching changes the autofluorescence background, and multiple readouts
of CCD detector prolong the acquisition time.

\in \{0,1\}^n$ given a number of independent ""traces"", i.e., subsequences of
$x$ obtained by randomly and independently deleting every symbol of $x$ with
some probability $p$. The information-theoretic limit of the number of traces
needed to recover a string of length $n$ is still unknown. This limit is
essentially the same as the number of traces needed to determine, given strings
$x$ and $y$ and traces of one of them, which string is the source. The
most-studied class of algorithms for the worst-case version of the problem are
""mean-based"" algorithms. These are a restricted class of distinguishers that
only use the mean value of each coordinate on the given samples. In this work
we study limitations of mean-based algorithms on strings at small Hamming or
edit distance. We show that, on the one hand, distinguishing strings that are
nearby in Hamming distance is ""easy"" for such distinguishers. On the other
hand, we show that distinguishing strings that are nearby in edit distance is
""hard"" for mean-based algorithms. Along the way, we also describe a connection
to the famous Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem, which shows a barrier to
finding explicit hard-to-distinguish strings: namely such strings would imply
explicit short solutions to the PTE problem, a well-known difficult problem in
number theory. Furthermore, we show that the converse is also true, thus,
finding explicit solutions to the PTE problem is equivalent to the problem of
finding explicit strings that are hard-to-distinguish by mean-based algorithms.
  Our techniques rely on complex analysis arguments that involve careful
trigonometric estimates, and algebraic techniques that include applications of
Descartes' rule of signs for polynomials over the reals.

a frequency-dependent propagation delay. Variations in the magnitude of this
effect lead to an additional source of red noise in pulsar timing experiments,
including pulsar timing arrays that aim to detect nanohertz gravitational
waves.
  We aim to quantify the time-variable dispersion with much improved precision
and characterise the spectrum of these variations.
  We use the pulsar timing technique to obtain highly precise dispersion
measure (DM) time series. Our dataset consists of observations of 36
millisecond pulsars, which were observed for up to 7.1 years with the LOFAR
telescope at a centre frequency of ~150 MHz. Seventeen of these sources were
observed with a weekly cadence, while the rest were observed at monthly
cadence.
  We achieve a median DM precision of the order of 10^-5 cm^-3 pc for a
significant fraction of our sources. We detect significant variations of the DM
in all pulsars with a median DM uncertainty of less than 2x10^-4 cm^-3 pc. The
noise contribution to pulsar timing experiments at higher frequencies is
calculated to be at a level of 0.1-10 us at 1.4 GHz over a timespan of a few
years, which is in many cases larger than the typical timing precision of 1 us
or better that PTAs aim for. We found no evidence for a dependence of DM on
radio frequency for any of the sources in our sample.
  The DM time series we obtained using LOFAR could in principle be used to
correct higher-frequency data for the variations of the dispersive delay.
However, there is currently the practical restriction that pulsars tend to
provide either highly precise times of arrival (ToAs) at 1.4 GHz or a high DM
precision at low frequencies, but not both, due to spectral properties.
Combining the higher-frequency ToAs with those from LOFAR to measure the
infinite-frequency ToA and DM would improve the result.

scheduling of manufacturing systems based on their degradation level. The
manufacturing system consists of several units with a defined capacity and an
individual dynamic degradation model, seeking to optimize their reward. The
units sell their production capacity, while maintaining the systems based on
the degradation state to prevent failures. The manufacturing units are jointly
responsible for fulfilling the demand of the system. This induces a coupling
constraint among the agents. Hence, we face a large-scale mixed-integer dynamic
maintenance scheduling problem. In order to handle the dynamic model of the
system and large-scale optimization, we propose a distributed algorithm using
model predictive control (MPC) and Benders decomposition method. In the
proposed algorithm, first, the master problem obtains the maintenance
scheduling for all the agents, and then based on this data, the agents obtain
their optimal production using the distributed MPC method which employs the
dual decomposition approach to tackle the coupling constraints among the
agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on a case

recently. Especially when it comes to the realm of Internet of Things, the UAVs

planning method for a cellular-connected UAV is proposed that will enable the
UAV to plan its path in an area much larger than its battery range by getting
recharged in certain positions equipped with power stations (PSs). In addition
to the energy constraint, there are also no-fly zones; for example, due to Air
to Air (A2A) and Air to Ground (A2G) interference or for lack of necessary
connectivity that impose extra constraints in the trajectory optimization of
the UAV. No-fly zones determine the infeasible areas that should be avoided. We
have used a reinforcement learning (RL) hierarchically to extend typical
short-range path planners to consider battery recharge and solve the problem of

directly with its age and metallicity. Using this knowledge, we derive ages for
a sample of 250,000 stars taken from GALAH DR3 using only their overall
metallicity and chemical abundances. Stellar ages are estimated via the machine
learning algorithm $XGBoost$, using main sequence turnoff stars with precise
ages as our input training set. We find that the stellar ages for the bulk of
the GALAH DR3 sample are accurate to 1-2 Gyr using this method. With these
ages, we replicate many recent results on the age-kinematic trends of the
nearby disk, including the age-velocity dispersion relationship of the solar
neighborhood and the larger global velocity dispersion relations of the disk
found using $Gaia$ and GALAH. The fact that chemical abundances alone can be
used to determine a reliable age for a star have profound implications for the
future study of the Galaxy as well as upcoming spectroscopic surveys. These
results show that the chemical abundance variation at a given birth radius is
quite small, and imply that strong chemical tagging of stars directly to birth
clusters may prove difficult with our current elemental abundance precision.
Our results highlight the need of spectroscopic surveys to deliver precision
abundances for as many nucleosynthetic production sites as possible in order to
estimate reliable ages for stars directly from their chemical abundances.
Applying the methods outlined in this paper opens a new door into studies of
the kinematic structure and evolution of the disk, as ages may potentially be
estimated for a large fraction of stars in existing spectroscopic surveys. This
would yield a sample of millions of stars with reliable age determinations, and
allow precise constraints to be put on various kinematic processes in the disk,
such as the efficiency and timescales of radial migration.

stellar metallicities, large Mgb/Fe ratios indicating fast formation, and
little stellar dust attenuation. In contrast, although blue spirals also formed
their central regions $>$10 Gyrs ago, both their central regions and outer

massive red spirals are likely to share some common processes of formation (and

a series of equidistant side-band resonances, related to interference of the
impurity spin dynamics and the sound waves of the bath. In all cases, we enter
the diabatic transfer regime for an increasing bare Rabi frequency of the rf

  Unconventional Degrees of Freedom in Molecular Frameworks",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The structural degrees of freedom of a material are the various distortions
most straightforwardly activated by external stimuli. A highly successful
design strategy in materials chemistry involves controlling these individual
distortions to produce useful functional responses. In a ferroelectric such as
lead titanate, for example, the key degree of freedom involves displacements of
Pb$^{2+}$; by coupling these together, the system interacts with electric
fields. An exciting development has been to exploit the interplay between
different distortions: $e.g.$ generating polarisation by combining different
polyhedral rotations. Thus, degrees of freedom act as geometric `elements' that
can be combined to engineer materials with interesting properties. Just as the
discovery of new elements diversified chemical space, identifying new types of
structural degrees of freedom is a key strategy for developing new functional
materials. In this context, molecular frameworks are a fertile source of
unanticipated distortion types, many of which have no parallel in conventional
solid-state chemistry. Framework materials are solids whose structures are
assembled from nodes and linkers to form scaffolding-like networks. These
structures usually contain cavities, which may host additional ions for charge
balance. In the well-established systems---such as lead titanate---these
components are all atomic, but in molecular frameworks, at least one ion is
molecular. Here, we survey the unconventional degrees of freedom introduced
through the replacement of atoms by molecules. Our motivation is to understand
the role these new distortions play in different materials properties. The
various degrees of freedom are summarised and described in the context of
experimental examples. We highlight a number of directions for future research,
which demonstrate the extraordinary possibilities for this nascent field.

  Bias towards Low Rank",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In deep learning, it is common to use more network parameters than training
points. In such scenarioof over-parameterization, there are usually multiple
networks that achieve zero training error so that thetraining algorithm induces
an implicit bias on the computed solution. In practice, (stochastic)
gradientdescent tends to prefer solutions which generalize well, which provides
a possible explanation of thesuccess of deep learning. In this paper we analyze
the dynamics of gradient descent in the simplifiedsetting of linear networks
and of an estimation problem. Although we are not in an
overparameterizedscenario, our analysis nevertheless provides insights into the
phenomenon of implicit bias. In fact, wederive a rigorous analysis of the
dynamics of vanilla gradient descent, and characterize the dynamicalconvergence
of the spectrum. We are able to accurately locate time intervals where the
effective rankof the iterates is close to the effective rank of a low-rank
projection of the ground-truth matrix. Inpractice, those intervals can be used
as criteria for early stopping if a certain regularity is desired. Wealso
provide empirical evidence for implicit bias in more general scenarios, such as
matrix sensing andrandom initialization. This suggests that deep learning
prefers trajectories whose complexity (measuredin terms of effective rank) is
monotonically increasing, which we believe is a fundamental concept for
thetheoretical understanding of deep learning.

observations from 8 to 12um. We compare the data to model predictions using the
THEMIS model with the radiative transfer code POLARIS calculating heating of
micro- and nanometric dust grains for a given disk structure. The aromatic
features at 3.3, 8.6 and 11.3um, as well as, the aliphatic ones from 3.4 to
3.5um are spatially extended with band morphologies dependong on local physical
conditions. The aliphatic-to-aromatic band ratio 3.4/3.3 increases with the
distance from the star suggesting UV processing. In the 8-12um observed
spectra, features characteristic of aromatic particles and crystalline
silicates are detected with their relative contribution changing with distance
to the star. The model predicts that the features and adjacent continuum are
due to different combinations of grain sub-populations, with a dependence on
the UV field intensity. Shorter wavelength features are dominated by the
smallest grains (< 0.7nm) throughout the disk, while at longer wavelengths what
dominates the emission close to the star is a mix of several grain populations,
and far away from the star is the largest nano-grain population.

However, during the training, self-ensembled teacher-student networks quickly

possibility of using an asymmetric structure inside neural network to address
this problem. First, asymmetric branches are proposed to extract features in
different manners, which enhances the feature diversity in appearance
signatures. Then, our proposed cross-branch supervision allows one branch to
get supervision from the other branch, which transfers distinct knowledge and

is an integral part of cognition. A widely accepted fact about cognitive
control is that it is context-sensitive: Adults and children alike infer
information about a task's demands from contextual cues and use these
inferences to learn from ambiguous cues. However, the precise way in which
people use contextual cues to guide adaptation to a new task remains poorly
understood. This work connects the context-sensitive nature of cognitive
control to a method for meta-learning with context-conditioned adaptation. We
begin by identifying an essential difference between human learning and current
approaches to meta-learning: In contrast to humans, existing meta-learning
algorithms do not make use of task-specific contextual cues but instead rely
exclusively on online feedback in the form of task-specific labels or rewards.
To remedy this, we introduce a framework for using contextual information about
a task to guide the initialization of task-specific models before adaptation to
online feedback. We show how context-conditioned meta-learning can capture
human behavior in a cognitive task and how it can be scaled to improve the
speed of learning in various settings, including few-shot classification and
low-sample reinforcement learning. Our work demonstrates that guiding
meta-learning with task information can capture complex, human-like behavior,
thereby deepening our understanding of cognitive control.

extraction operator improves the accuracy of the network and reduces the

and proposes the self-learned distance-feature density by combining the
distance and the feature correlation. The proposed method makes the feature
extraction of spherical interpolated convolution network more rational and
effective. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated on the 3D
semantic segmentation task of point clouds. Experiments show that the proposed
method achieves good performance on the ScanNet dataset and Paris-Lille-3D

we predicted that 180-degree domain walls in a strained ferroelectric film can
induce p-n junctions in a graphene channel and lead to the unusual temperature
and gate voltage dependences of the perpendicular modes {\nu} of the integer
quantum Hall effect. The non-integer numbers and their irregular sequence
principally differ from the conventional sequence {\nu}= 3/2, 5/3. The unusual
v-numbers originate from significantly different numbers of the edge modes,
{\nu}1 and {\nu}2, corresponding to different concentration of carriers in the
left (n1) and right (n2) ferroelectric domains of p-n junction boundary. The
difference between n1 and n2 disappears with the vanishing of the film
spontaneous polarization in a paraelectric phase, which can be varied in a wide
temperature range by an appropriate choice of misfit strain originated from the
film-substrate lattice mismatch. Next we studied the electric conductivity of
the system ferromagnetic dielectric - graphene channel - ferroelectric
substrate. The magnetic dielectric locally transforms the band spectrum of
graphene by inducing an energy gap in it and making it spin-asymmetric with
respect to the free electrons. It was demonstrated, that if the Fermi level in
the graphene channel belongs to energy intervals, where the graphene band
spectrum, modified by EuO, becomes sharply spin-asymmetric, such a device can
be an ideal non-volatile spin filter. The practical application of the system

four-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbf{R}^4$. This states that two-valued
functions defined on the entire $\mathbf{R}^3$, and whose graph is a minimal
surface, must necessarily be linear. This is a two-valued analogue of the
classical Bernstein theorem, which asserts that in dimensions up to $n+1 \leq
8$, an entire single-valued minimal graph is linear. The main contrast with the
single-valued theory is the presence of a large set of singularities in the
graphs of two-valued functions. Indeed two-valued minimal graphs are neither
area-minimising, nor is the regularity theory of elliptic PDE directly
available in this setting. We obtain structure results for the blowdown cones
of two-valued minimal graphs, valid in dimension $n+1 \leq 7$, proving in
particular that they are smoothly immersed away from an $(n-2)$-rectifiable set
that includes its branch points. In dimension four we go further, and
completely classify the possible blowdown cones using a combinatorial argument.
We show that they must be a union of two three-dimensional planes: this is the
key to the proof of the Bernstein theorem.

crucial in understanding the fundamental mechanism controlling the

magnetization hysteresis response of the FM. Similarly, in the recently
reported monolayer molecular exchange-bias effect requiring no AFM layer,
probing magnetic-disorder at the FM/molecule interface or inside the FM layer
can provide new insights into the origin of molecular exchange-bias and the
associated physics. In this article, by cooling the Fe/metal-phthalocyanine
devices in oscillating magnetic field, we demonstrate a characteristic
temperature dependent response of exchange-bias shift and ferromagnet
coercivity that is supportive of a spin-glass behavior. Here, the origin of
spin-glass is attributed to the spin frustration created in the magnetic

highly probable that ultra-relativistic particles interact with photons in
their environment through scattering. As long as the energy of the particle is
greater than the energy of the interacting photon, the (classical) scattering
is known to be in the Thomson regime. Otherwise, quantum effects will affect
the scattering cross section, and we enter into the so-called Klein-Nishina
regime. It is well known that radiative cooling in the Thomson regime is very
efficient, leading to soft high-energy spectra. However, observations have
shown that, in many cases, the high energy spectrum of some objects is rather
hard. This has led to think that maybe particles are not being cooled down
efficiently. Asymptotic approximations of the Klein-Nishina regime have been
formulated in the last decades in order to account for these corrections in the
distribution of particles responsible for the observed spectrum of high energy
sources. In this work we presenta a numerical approach of the Klein-Nishina
corrections to the radiative cooling. It has been developed to simulate the
evolution of a distribution of particles interacting with photons in their

training. Many CNN architectures require hundreds of thousands parameters to

allowing standard mini-batch gradient descent to be employed. The ISLES2015

recover a clean image from a noisy one. In this paper a novel structure is
proposed based on training multiple specialized networks as opposed to existing
structures that are base on a single network. The proposed model is an
alternative for training a very deep network to avoid issues like vanishing or
exploding gradient. By dividing a very deep network into two smaller networks
the same number of learnable parameters will be available, but two smaller
networks should be trained which are easier to train. Over smoothing and waxy
artifacts are major problems with existing methods; because the network tries
to keep the Mean Square Error (MSE) low for general structures and details,
which leads to overlooking of details. This problem is more severe in the
presence of strong noise. To reduce this problem, in the proposed structure,
the image is decomposed into its low and high frequency components and each
component is used to train a separate denoising convolutional neural network.
One network is specialized to reconstruct the general structure of the image
and the other one is specialized to reconstruct the details. Results of the
proposed method show higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and structural
similarity index (SSIM) compared to a popular state of the art denoising method

(MANETs). Due to the nature of MANETs, P2P mobile systems brought up many new
thriving challenges, in particular with regard to the content discovery issue.
Thus, the design of an efficient content discovery protocol has been of
paramount importance. The thriving challenge is to (i) locate relevant peers
sharing pertinent resources for users queries and then (ii) to ensure that
those peers would be reached by considering different MANET constraints (e.g.,
peer mobility, battery energy, peer load, to cite a few). Even though the
literature witnesses a wealthy number of content discovery protocols, only few
of them have considered the above-mentioned requirements. To overcome this
shortage, we introduce in this paper an efficient Content Discovery Protocol

users queries to relevant peers that are (1) more suitable to answer the user
query according to its content, (2) more stable to relay query hits, (3) less
loaded to avoid the network congestion issue and (4) having more battery
lifetime to avoid the network partitioning issue. The performed experiments
show that CDP outperforms its competitor in terms of effectiveness and
efficiency.

  news media",,,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  While it remains a taboo topic, gender-based violence (GBV) undermines the
health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims. Many factors have been
studied to generate or maintain this kind of violence, however, the influence
of the media is still uncertain. Here, we use Machine Learning tools to
extrapolate the effect of the news in GBV. By feeding neural networks with
news, the topic information associated with each article can be recovered. Our
findings show a relationship between GBV news and public awareness, the effect
of mediatic GBV cases, and the intrinsic thematic relationship of GBV news.
Because the used neural model can be easily adjusted, this also allows us to
extend our approach to other media sources or topics

originally proposed for feed-forward neural networks, namely Input Mixup (Zhang
et al., 2017) and Manifold Mixup (Verma et al., 2018), to the realm of
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Our proposed methods are easy to implement and
have a low computational complexity, while leverage the performance of simple
neural architectures in a variety of tasks. We have validated our claims
through several experiments on real-world datasets, and also provide an
asymptotic theoretical analysis to further investigate the properties and
potential impacts of our proposed techniques. Applying sequence mixup to
BiLSTM-CRF model (Huang et al., 2015) to Named Entity Recognition task on
CoNLL-2003 data (Sang and De Meulder, 2003) has improved the F-1 score on the
test stage and reduced the loss, considerably.

  weak labels","11 pages, 2 figures, Paper accepted at the ""Machine Learning in
  Clinical Neuroimaging"" (MLCN) MICCAI workshop 2020 (https://mlcnws.com/)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A commonly adopted approach to carry out detection tasks in medical imaging
is to rely on an initial segmentation. However, this approach strongly depends
on voxel-wise annotations which are repetitive and time-consuming to draw for
medical experts. An interesting alternative to voxel-wise masks are so-called
""weak"" labels: these can either be coarse or oversized annotations that are
less precise, but noticeably faster to create. In this work, we address the
task of brain aneurysm detection as a patch-wise binary classification with
weak labels, in contrast to related studies that rather use supervised
segmentation methods and voxel-wise delineations. Our approach comes with the
non-trivial challenge of the data set creation: as for most focal diseases,
anomalous patches (with aneurysm) are outnumbered by those showing no anomaly,
and the two classes usually have different spatial distributions. To tackle
this frequent scenario of inherently imbalanced, spatially skewed data sets, we
propose a novel, anatomically-driven approach by using a multi-scale and
multi-input 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We apply our model to 214
subjects (83 patients, 131 controls) who underwent Time-Of-Flight Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (TOF-MRA) and presented a total of 111 unruptured
cerebral aneurysms. We compare two strategies for negative patch sampling that
have an increasing level of difficulty for the network and we show how this
choice can strongly affect the results. To assess whether the added spatial
information helps improving performances, we compare our anatomically-informed
CNN with a baseline, spatially-agnostic CNN. When considering the more
realistic and challenging scenario including vessel-like negative patches, the
former model attains the highest classification results (accuracy$\simeq$95\%,
AUROC$\simeq$0.95, AUPR$\simeq$0.71), thus outperforming the baseline.

our approach uses several techniques to address various challenges in SFDA and
improve performance, including online generation of pseudo-labels and
self-attention as well as use of curriculum learning, entropy minimization and
model distillation. We have evaluated the performance on $6$ datasets
corresponding to real and synthetic adverse weather conditions. Our method
outperforms all prior works on unsupervised road segmentation and SFDA by at
least 10.26%, and improves the training time by 18-180x. Moreover, our
self-supervised algorithm exhibits similar accuracy performance in terms of
mIOU score as compared to prior supervised methods.

Internet-distributed applications like P2P file sharing are nowadays deployed
over MANET (i.e., P2P mobile systems). These applications allow users to search
and share diverse multimedia resources over MANET. Due the nature of MANET, P2P
mobile systems brought up many new thriving challenges regarding the query
routing issue. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel context-aware query
routing protocol for unstructured P2P mobile file sharing systems. Our protocol
(i) locates relevant peers sharing pertinent resources for user's query and
(ii) ensures that those peers would be reached by considering different MANET
constraints (e.g., query content, peer mobility, battery energy, peer load). In
order to consider all these constraints for choosing the relevant peers, we are
based on the technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution
(TOPSIS). We implemented the proposed protocol and compared its routing
efficiency and retrieval effectiveness with another protocol taken from the
literature. Experimental results show that our scheme carries out better than
the baseline protocol with respect to accuracy
