energy gaps amid the spectrum. Identifying order parameters for ESQPTs poses
however a major challenge. We introduce spinor Bose-Einstein condensates as a

define a topological order parameter that distinguishes between excited-state

regions of NGC 7130, an archetypical composite Seyfert and nuclear starburst
galaxy. We achieve an angular resolution of 0.17$^{\prime\prime}$ (50 pc). We
performed a multi-component analysis of the main ISM lines and identified nine
kinematic components, six of which correspond to the outflow. The outflow is
biconic and has velocities of a few $100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ with respect to the
disc. We decompose the approaching side of the outflow into a broad and a
narrow component with typical velocity dispersions below and above
$\sim200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, respectively. The blueshifted narrow component has
substructure, in particular a collimated plume aligned with the radio jet,
indicating that it may be jet-powered. The redshifted lobe is composed of two
Narrow Components and a Broad Component. An additional redshifted component is
seen outside the main outflow axis. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that the
outflow gas in the main axis is AGN-powered whereas the off-axis component has
LINER properties. The ionised gas mass outflow rate is
$\dot{M}=1.2\pm0.7\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and the kinetic power is
$\dot{E}_{\rm kin}=(2.7\pm2.0)\times10^{41}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, which
corresponds to $F_{\rm kin}=0.12\pm0.09\%$ of the bolometric AGN power. The
combination of high angular resolution integral field spectroscopy and a
careful multi-component decomposition allows a uniquely detailed view of the

outburst; however, recent observations have required that alternative scenarios
be considered. Long slit infrared spectroscopy of a forbidden line of iron
reported here has revealed high line-of-sight velocities
($\sim\pm900$~km~s$^{-1}$) of the ansae at the tips of the bipolar lobes imaged
in H$\alpha$ in 2010. The deprojected velocities of the tips are approximately
$\pm2130$~km~s$^{-1}$ assuming the previously derived inclination angle of
$65^\circ$ for the axis of cylindrical symmetry of the bipolar nebula. Such
high velocities are in stark contrast to previous reports of much lower
expansion velocities in CK~Vul. Based on the deprojected velocities of the tips
and their angular expansion measured over a 10-year baseline, we derive a
revised estimate, with estimated uncertainties, of $3.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$~kpc for
the distance to CK~Vul. This implies that the absolute visual magnitude at the
peak of the 1670 explosion was $M_V = -12.4^{+1.3}_{-2.4}$, indicating that the
1670 event was far more luminous than previous estimates and brighter than any
classical nova or any Galactic stellar merger. We propose that CK~Vul belongs
to the class of Intermediate Luminosity Optical Transients (ILOTs), objects
which bridge the luminosity gap between novae and supernovae. While eruptions
in lower luminosity ILOTs are attributed to merger events, the origin of the
highly luminous ILOT outbursts is currently not known.

motions in the upper part of the prominence. These apparent rotating motions
might play an important role for the evolution and growth of the filament by
transferring cool plasma and magnetic twist. The large-scale vortex motion is
evident in the upper part of the prominence, and consists of a swirl-like
structure within it. The slow motion of the footpoint twists the legs of the
prominence due to magnetic shear, causing two different kinds of magnetic
reconnection. The internal reconnection is initiated by a resistive
tearing-mode instability, which leads to the formation of multiple plasmoids in
the elongated current sheet. The estimated growth rate was found to be
0.02--0.05. The magnetic reconnection heats the current sheet for a small
duration. However, most of the energy release due to magnetic reconnection is
absorbed by the surrounding cool and dense plasma and used to accelerate the
plasmoid ejection. The multiple plasmoid ejections destroy the current sheet.
Therefore, the magnetic arcades collapse near the X-point. Oppositely directed
magnetic arcades may reconnect with the southern segment of the prominence and
an elongated thin current sheet is formed. This external reconnection drives

that the algorithm's error can be decomposed into its bias and variance. Both
quantities are often opposed to each other and ensembles offer an effective way
to manage them as they reduce the variance through a diverse set of base
learners while keeping the bias low at the same time. Even though there have
been numerous works on decomposing other loss functions, the exact mathematical
connection is rarely exploited explicitly for ensembling, but merely used as a
guiding principle. In this paper, we formulate a generalized bias-variance
decomposition for arbitrary twice differentiable loss functions and study it in

flare, occurred in NOAA AR 12740 on May 6, 2019. The rise, peak and decay
phases of the flare were recorded continuously and quasi-simultaneously in the
Ca II K line with the CHROMIS instrument, the Ca II 8542 and Fe I 6173 \AA
lines with the CRISP instrument at the SST. The observations in the
chromospheric Ca II lines exhibit intense brightening near the flare
footpoints. At these locations, a non-LTE inversion code was employed to infer
the temperature, magnetic field, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and
microturbulent velocity stratification in the flaring atmosphere. During the
flare peak time, the LOS velocity shows both upflows and downflows around the
flare footpoints in the upper chromosphere and lower chromosphere,
respectively. Moreover, the temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic field at the
flarepoints exhibits a maximum change of ~600 G. After the flare, the LOS
magnetic field decreases to the non-flaring value, exhibiting no permanent or
step-wise change. The analysis of response functions to the temperature, LOS
magnetic field and velocity shows that the Ca II lines exhibit enhanced
sensitivity to the deeper layers (i.e., log_t ~ -3) of the flaring atmosphere,
whereas for the non-flaring atmosphere they are mainly sensitive around log_t ~
-4. We suggest that a fraction of the apparent increase in the LOS magnetic
field at the flare footpoints may be due to the increase in the sensitivity of
the Ca II 8542 \AA line in the deeper layers, where the field strength is
relatively stronger. The rest can be due to magnetic field reconfiguration
during the flare. Our observations illustrate that even a less intense C-class
flare can heat the deeper layers of the solar chromosphere, mainly at the flare
footpoints, without affecting the photosphere.

these findings, a novel algorithm is introduced to remove performance
decreasing layers automatically. Architectures found by this algorithm achieve

  Glasses are interesting materials because they allow us to explore the
puzzling properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. One of them is the Kovacs
effect in which a glass, brought to an out-of-equilibrium state in which all
its thermodynamic variables are identical to those of an equilibrium state,
nevertheless evolves, showing a hump in some global variable before the
thermodynamic variables come back to their starting point. We show that a
simple three-state system is sufficient to study this phenomenon using
numerical integrations and exact analytical calculations. It also brings some
light on the concept of fictive temperature, often used to extend standard
thermodynamics to the out-of-equilibrium properties of glasses. We confirm that
the concept of a unique fictive temperature is not valid, an show it can be
extended to make a connection with the various relaxation processes in the
system. The model also brings further insights on the thermodynamics of
out-of-equilibrium systems. Moreover we show that the three-state model is able
to describe various effects observed in glasses such as the asymmetric
relaxation to equilibrium discussed by Kovacs, or the reverse crossover
measured on $B_2O_3$.

transportation model, we obtain a power law for the HS transport properties.
Then a relation between the geometric free volume and thermodynamic free volume

are very satisfactory. Using the power law we are able to reproduce several

governing the interaction between the drug candidate and its target. Here, we
propose to calculate electric fields to explicitly link structure to function

within the rational drug discovery workflow. By projecting the electric fields
onto specific bonds, we can identify the system components that are at the
origin of stabilizing intermolecular interactions (covalent and non-covalent)
in the active site. This helps to significantly narrow the exploration space
when predicting new inhibitors. To illustrate this method, we characterize the
binding of the non-covalent inhibitor X77 to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a
particularly time-sensitive drug discovery problem. With electric field
calculations, we were able to identify 3 key residues (Asn-142, Met-165 and

nearly 20 residues reported in previous studies as being in close contact with
inhibitors in the active site of the protease. As a result, the search for new

into directed motion locally on the level of the individual constituents. In
the spirit of a minimal description, active matter is often modeled by
so-called active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs), an extension of passive
Brownian motion where activity is represented by an additional fluctuating
non-equilibrium ""force"" with simple statistical properties (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process). While in passive Brownian motion, entropy production along
trajectories is well-known to relate to irreversibility in terms of the
log-ratio of probabilities to observe a certain particle trajectory forward in
time in comparison to observing its time-reversed twin trajectory, the
connection between these concepts for active matter is less clear. It is
therefore of central importance to provide explicit expressions for the
irreversibility of active particle trajectories based on measurable quantities
alone, such as the particle positions. In this technical note, we derive a
general expression for the irreversibility of AOUPs in terms of path
probability ratios (forward versus backward path), extending recent results

such a phenomenon naturally arises: the DGP model with two parallel 3-branes,
each endowed with a localized curvature term. In that model, the UV modes of
the 5-dimensional graviton are suppressed on the branes, while the IR modes can
penetrate them freely. First, we find that the DGP branes act as ""effective""
(momentum-dependent) boundary conditions for the gravitational field, so that
the (gravitational) Casimir force between them emerges. Second, we discover
that the presence of an IR transparency region for the discrete modes modifies
the standard Casimir force -- as derived for ideal Dirichlet boundary
conditions -- in two competing ways: i) The exclusion of soft modes from the
discrete spectrum leads to an increase of the Casimir force. ii) The non-ideal
nature of the boundary conditions gives rise to a ""leakage"" of hard modes. As a
result of i) and ii), the Casimir force becomes weaker. Since the derivation of
this result involves only the localized kinetic terms of a quantum field on
parallel surfaces (with codimension one), the derived Casimir force is expected
to be present in a variety of setups in arbitrary dimensions.

suggests a reevaluation of the phase diagram of other manganites in that doping
region. Rather than an orbital ordered phase reaching up to high temperatures
of approximately 800-1100 K, we propose a loss of spontaneous orbital order
already near room temperature. Above this temperature, the phase is
characterized by a finite orbital polarization and octahedral tilt pattern. The
tilt pattern couples to the Jahn-Teller distortion and thus induces a remaining
orbital order, which persists up to high temperatures, where the tilt order is
lost as well. This explains the experimental observation of orbital order up to
high temperatures. The reevaluation of the orbital order transition is based on
observed anomalies of various physical properties at a temperatures of 220-260
K in epitaxial thin films of $Pr_{1-x}Ca_xMnO_3$ x=0.1, i.e.in the photovoltaic
effect, electric transport, magnetization, optical and ultrafast transient pump
probe studies. Finite-temperature simulations based on a tight-binding model
with carefully adjusted parameters from first-principles calculations exhibit
an orbital order phase transition at $T_{OO} \approx$ 300 K for x=0.1. This is
consistent with the experimental observation of a temperature dependent change
in lattice parameter for bulk samples of the same doping at 300 K for x=0.1 and
350 K for x=0, typical for a second order phase transition. Since our
reassignment of the orbital order phase transition towards lower temperatures

quantum variational algorithms. Classically simulating the algorithm running on
near-future quantum hardware is paramount in its study, as it is for all
variational algorithms. In this case, state-vector simulation of the
P-parameter/gate ansatz circuit does not dominate the runtime; instead,
calculation of the Fisher information matrix becomes the bottleneck, involving
O(P^3) gate evaluations, though this can be reduced to O(P^2) gates by using
O(P) temporary state-vectors. This is similar to the gradient calculation
subroutine dominating the simulation of quantum gradient descent, which has
attracted HPC strategies and bespoke simulation algorithms with asymptotic
speedups. We here present a novel simulation strategy to precisely calculate
the quantum natural gradient in O(P^2) gates and O(1) state-vectors. While more
complicated, our strategy is in the same spirit as that presented for gradients
in Reference 6, and involves iteratively evaluating recurrent forms of the
Fisher information matrix. Our strategy uses only ""apply gate"", ""clone state""
and ""inner product"" operations which are present in practically all quantum
computing simulators. It is furthermore compatible with parallelisation
schemes, like hardware acceleration and distribution. Since our scheme
leverages a form of the Fisher information matrix for strictly unitary ansatz
circuits, it cannot be simply extended to density matrix simulation of quantum
natural gradient with non-unitary circuits.

with their asymptotic versions as the field size tends to infinity. We then use
these bounds to describe the general behaviour of common complements with
respect to sparseness and density, showing that the decisive property is
whether or not the number of spaces to be complemented is negligible with
respect to the field size. By specializing our results to matrix spaces, we
obtain upper and lower bounds for the number of MRD codes in the rank metric.
In particular, we answer an open question in coding theory, proving that MRD
codes are sparse for all parameter sets as the field size grows, with only very
few exceptions. We also investigate the density of MRD codes as their number of
columns tends to infinity, obtaining a new asymptotic bound. Using properties
of the Euler function from number theory, we then show that our bound improves
on known results for most parameter sets. We conclude the paper by establishing
general structural properties of the density function of rank-metric codes.

emphasis on the regime in which every second island is switched into its normal
state, thus forming a superconductor-insulator-normal metal (S-I-N) repetition
pattern. As is known since Giaever tunneling experiments, tunneling charge
transport between a superconductor and a normal metal becomes exponentially
suppressed, and zero-bias resistance diverges, as the temperature is reduced
and the energy gap of the superconductor grows larger than the thermal energy.
Here we demonstrate that this physical phenomenon strongly impacts transport
properties of inhomogeneous superconductors made of weakly coupled islands with
fluctuating values of the critical temperature. We observe a non-monotonous
dependence of the chain resistance on both temperature and magnetic field, with
a pronounced resistance peak at temperatures at which some but not all islands
are superconducting. We explain this phenomenon by the inhomogeneity of the
chains, in which neighboring superconducting islands have slightly different
critical temperatures. We argue that the Giaever's resistance divergence can
also occur in the zero-temperature limit. Such quantum transition can occur if
the magnetic field is tuned such that it suppresses superconductivity in the
islands with the weaker critical field, while the islands with stronger energy
gap remain superconducting. In such a field, the system acts as a chain of
S-I-N junctions.

treatment planning for focused ultrasound (FUS) therapies. However, the large
domain sizes and generation of higher harmonics at the focus make these
problems extremely computationally demanding. Numerical methods typically
employ a uniform mesh fine enough to resolve the highest harmonic present in
the problem, leading to a very large number of degrees of freedom. This paper
proposes a more efficient strategy in which each harmonic is approximated on a
separate mesh, the size of which is proportional to the wavelength of the
harmonic. The increase in resolution required to resolve a smaller wavelength
is balanced by a reduction in the domain size. This nested meshing is feasible
owing to the increasingly localised nature of higher harmonics near the focus.
  Numerical experiments are performed for FUS transducers in homogeneous media
in order to determine the size of the meshes required to accurately represent
the harmonics. In particular, a fast \emph{volume potential} approach is
proposed and employed to perform convergence experiments as the computation
domain size is modified. This approach allows each harmonic to be computed via
the evaluation of an integral over the domain. Discretising this integral using
the midpoint rule allows the computations to be performed rapidly with the FFT.
It is shown that at least an order of magnitude reduction in memory consumption
and computation time can be achieved with nested meshing. Finally, it is
demonstrated how to generalise this approach to inhomogeneous propagation
domains.

state-of-the-art performance. Common augmentation strategies work by drawing
random samples from a space of transformations. Unfortunately, such sampling
approaches are limited in expressivity, as they are unable to scale to rich
transformations that depend on numerous parameters due to the curse of
dimensionality. Adversarial examples can be considered as an alternative scheme
for data augmentation. By being trained on the most difficult modifications of
the inputs, the resulting models are then hopefully able to handle other,
presumably easier, modifications as well. The advantage of adversarial
augmentation is that it replaces sampling with the use of a single, calculated
perturbation that maximally increases the loss. The downside, however, is that
these raw adversarial perturbations appear rather unstructured; applying them
often does not produce a natural transformation, contrary to a desirable data
augmentation technique. To address this, we propose a method to generate
adversarial examples that maintain some desired natural structure. We first
construct a subspace that only contains perturbations with the desired
structure. We then project the raw adversarial gradient onto this space to
select a structured transformation that would maximally increase the loss when
applied. We demonstrate this approach through two types of image
transformations: photometric and geometric. Furthermore, we show that training
on such structured adversarial images improves generalization.

In this work we present a novel method towards automatically identifying and

words to ""clean"" words with no hidden meaning. Our method makes use of
interpretable representations of dark and clean words in the form of
probability distributions over a shared vocabulary. In our experiments we show
our method to be effective in terms of dark jargon identification, as it
outperforms another related method on simulated data. Using manual evaluation,
we show that our method is able to detect dark jargons in a real-world

strong coupling between excitons and photons confined in a semiconductor
microcavity. They typically operate at visible or near visible wavelengths.
They combine the properties of confined electromagnetic fields, including a
sizeable spin-orbit coupling, and the sensitivity to external magnetic fields
and particle interactions inherited from their partly matter nature. These
features make polaritons an excellent platform to study topological phases in
photonics in one and two dimensional lattices, which band properties can be
directly accessed using standard optical tools. In this review we describe the
main properties of microcavity polaritons and the main observations in the
field of topological photonics, which include, among others, lasing in
topological edge states, the implementation of a polariton Chern insulator
under an external magnetic field and the direct measurement of fundamental
quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor and winding numbers in one- and
two-dimensional lattices. Polariton interactions open exciting perspectives for
the study of nonlinear topological phases.

or voices. The degree to which this happens depends on the position along a
voice-leading continuum, ranging from monophonic, to homophonic, to polyphonic,
which complicates the design of automatic voice separation models. We address
this continuum by defining voice separation as the task of decomposing music
into streams that exhibit both a high degree of external perceptual separation
from the other streams and a high degree of internal perceptual consistency.
The proposed voice separation task allows for a voice to diverge to multiple
voices and also for multiple voices to converge to the same voice. Equipped
with this flexible task definition, we manually annotated a corpus of popular
music and used it to train neural networks that assign notes to voices either
separately for each note in a chord (note-level), or jointly to all notes in a
chord (chord-level). The trained neural models greedily assign notes to voices
in a left to right traversal of the input chord sequence, using a diverse set
of perceptually informed input features. When evaluated on the extraction of
consecutive within voice note pairs, both models surpass a strong baseline
based on an iterative application of an envelope extraction function, with the
chord-level model consistently edging out the note-level model. The two models
are also shown to outperform previous approaches on separating the voices in

deducing the fidelity of produced states with respect to a two-qubit maximally

show how the self-testing of two-qubit maximally entangled states is improved

higher fidelities than ones previously known. In particular, nontrivial
self-testing statements can be obtained from correlations that cannot be

distribution of eigenstate coefficients with respect to the Hamming distance in
the Fock space from the wave function maximum and relate the cumulants of this
distribution to the properties of the quasi-local integrals of motion in the
MBL phase. We demonstrate non-self-averaging property of the many-body fractal
dimension $D_q$ and directly relate it to the jump of $D_q$ as well as of the
localization length of the integrals of motion at the MBL transition. We
provide an example of the continuous many-body transition confirming the above
relation via the self-averaging of $D_q$ in the whole range of parameters.
Introducing a simple toy-model, which hosts ergodic thermal bubbles, we give
analytical evidences both in standard probes and in terms of newly introduced
radial probability distribution that the MBL transition in the Fock space is
consistent with the avalanche mechanism for delocalization, i.e., the
Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario. Thus, we show that the MBL transition can been
seen as a transition between ergodic states to non-ergodic extended states and
put the upper bound for the disorder scaling for the genuine Anderson

it is measured by BOSS. We show that, by marginalizing over the model
parameters that capture the impact of the intergalactic medium, the flux power
spectrum from both simulations and observations can be described with high
precision. The model displays a degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the
(unknown, in our formalism) normalization of the flux power spectrum. This
degeneracy can be lifted by calibrating one of the model parameters with
simulation data, and using input from Planck CMB data. We demonstrate that this
approach can be used to extract bounds on the sum of neutrino masses with
comparably low numerical effort, while allowing for a conservative treatment of
uncertainties from the dynamics of the intergalactic medium. An explorative

answer to these questions, so crucial to astrophysics and cosmology, requires
the full reconstruction of the so called cosmic star formation rate density
(SFRD), i.e. the evolution of the average star formation rate per unit volume
of the universe. While the SFRD has been reliably traced back to 10-11 billion
years ago, its evolution is still poorly constrained at earlier cosmic epochs,
and its estimate is mainly based on galaxies luminous in the ultraviolet and
with low obscuration by dust. This limited knowledge is largely due to the lack
of an unbiased census of all types of star-forming galaxies in the early
universe. We present a new approach to find dust-obscured star-forming galaxies
based on their emission at radio wavelengths coupled with the lack of optical
counterparts. Here, we present a sample of 197 galaxies selected with this
method. These systems were missed by previous surveys at optical and
near-infrared wavelengths, and 22 of them are at very high redshift (i.e. z >
4.5). The contribution of these elusive systems to the SFRD is substantial and
can be as high as 40% of the previously known SFRD based on UV-luminous
galaxies. The mere existence of such heavily obscured galaxies in the first two
billion years after the Big Bang opens new avenues to investigate the early
phases of galaxy formation and evolution, and to understand the links between
these systems and the massive galaxies which ceased their star formation at
later cosmic times.

multiplanet systems found via transit surveys such as those conducted by Kepler
and TESS. Our method depends on quantifying a system's dynamical packing in
terms of the dynamical spacing $\Delta$, the number of mutual Hill radii
between adjacent planets (""planet pair""). The method determines if a planet
pair within a multi-planet system is dynamically unpacked and thus capable of
hosting an additional intermediate planet. If a planet pair is found to be
unpacked, our method constrains the potential planet's mass and location. We
apply our method to the Kepler primary mission's population of 691
multi-candidate systems, first via direct calculations and then via Monte Carlo
(MC) analysis. The analysis was repeated with three proposed values from the
literature for minimum $\Delta$ required for planet pair orbital stability
($\Delta = 10$, $12.3$, and $21.7$). Direct calculations show that as many as
$560$ planet pairs in $691$ Kepler multi-candidate systems could contain
additional planets ($\Delta = 12.3$). The MC analysis shows that $164$ of these
pairs have a probability $\geq 0.90$ of being unpacked. Furthermore, according
to calculated median mass efficiencies calculated from packed Kepler systems,
$28.2\%$ of these potential planets could be Earths and Sub-Earths. If these
planets exist, the masses and semimajor axes predicted here could facilitate
detection by characterizing expected detection signals. Ultimately,
understanding the dynamical packing of multi-planet systems could help
contribute to our understanding of their architectures and formation.

intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters or dwarf galaxies. The mass
ratio in this case is lower, and hence we refer to the system as an

brown dwarf, with masses much lighter than our Sun, can inspiral into
supermassive black holes such as Sgr A* at our Galactic centre. In this case,
the mass ratio is extremely large and, hence, we call this system ab

is not detected at the exact location of NGC 4725 B, there is molecular gas in
the immediate vicinity (i.e., $\lesssim 100$ pc) along with associated diffuse
8 $\mu$m emission. When combined with existing Very Large Array continuum data
at 1.5, 3, 5.5, 9, 14, 22, 33, and 44 GHz, the spectrum is best fit by a
combination of AME, synchrotron, and free-free emission that is free-free
absorbed below $\sim6$ GHz. Given the strength of the AME, there is
surprisingly no indication of millimeter dust emission associated with NGC 4725
B on $\lesssim$6\arcsec~spatial scales at the sensitivity of the ALMA

complex and the inferred star formation rate, NGC 4725 B is consistent with
being an extremely young ($\sim 3-5$ Myr) massive ($\lesssim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$)
cluster that is undergoing active cluster feedback. However, the lack of
millimeter thermal dust emission is difficult to reconcile with a spinning dust
origin of the 30 GHz emission. On the other hand, modeling NGC 4725 B as a new
class of background radio galaxy is also unsatisfactory.

Boolean algebras introduced by Kochen and Specker in their seminal work. These
contrast with traditional quantum logic \`a la Birkhoff and von Neumann in that
operations such as conjunction and disjunction are partial, only being defined
in the domain where they are physically meaningful.
  We study how this setting relates to current work on contextuality such as
the sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic approaches. We introduce a general free
construction extending the commeasurability relation on a partial Boolean
algebra, i.e. the domain of definition of the binary logical operations. This
construction has a surprisingly broad range of uses. We apply it in the study
of a number of issues, including:
  - establishing the connection between the abstract measurement scenarios
studied in the contextuality literature and the setting of partial Boolean
algebras;
  - formulating various contextuality properties in this setting, including
probabilistic contextuality as well as the strong, state-independent notion of
contextuality given by Kochen-Specker paradoxes, which are logically
contradictory statements validated by partial Boolean algebras, specifically
those arising from quantum mechanics;
  - investigating a Logical Exclusivity Principle, and its relation to the
Probabilistic Exclusivity Principle widely studied in recent work on
contextuality as a step towards closing in on the set of quantum-realisable

ASASSN-19tr), one of the best-observed members of the peculiar SN Iax class.
Ultraviolet and optical photometric and optical and near-infrared spectroscopic
follow-up started from $\sim$5 days before maximum light ($t_{max}(B)$ on
$58707.8$ MJD) and covers the photospheric phase. The early observations allow
us to estimate the physical properties of the ejecta and characterize the
possible divergence from a uniform chemical abundance structure. The estimated
bolometric light curve peaks at 1.05 $\times$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and
indicates that only 0.031 $M_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni was produced, making SN
2019muj a moderate luminosity object in the Iax class with peak absolute
magnitude of $M_{V}$ = -16.4 mag. The estimated date of explosion is $t_0 =
58698.2$ MJD and implies a short rise time of $t_{rise}$ = 9.6 days in
$B$-band. We fit of the spectroscopic data by synthetic spectra, calculated via
the radiative transfer code TARDIS. Adopting the partially stratified abundance
template based on brighter SNe Iax provides a good match with SN 2019muj.
However, without earlier spectra, the need for stratification cannot be stated
in most of the elements, except carbon, which is allowed to appear in the outer
layers only. SN 2019muj provides a unique opportunity to link extremely
low-luminosity SNe Iax to well-studied, brighter SNe Iax.

potentially jeopardizes later descriptions of late-time cosmology by
introducing uncontrolled trans-Planckian theoretical errors into all
calculations. Recent speculations, such as the Trans-Planckian Censorship
Conjecture (TCC), have been developed to avoid this problem. We revisit old
arguments why the consistency of (and control over) the Effective Field Theory
(EFT) governing late-time cosmology is not necessarily threatened by the
descent of modes due to universal expansion, even if EFT methods may break down
at much earlier times. Failure of EFT methods only poses a problem if late-time
predictions rely on non-adiabatic behaviour at these early times (such as is
often true for bouncing cosmologies, for example). We illustrate our arguments
using simple non-gravitational examples such as slowly rolling scalar fields
and the spacing between Landau levels for charged particles in slowly varying
magnetic fields, for which similar issues arise and are easier to understand.
We comment on issues associated with UV completions. Our arguments need not
invalidate speculative ideas like the TCC but suggest they are not required by
the present evidence.

material properties along many complicated light paths. We present a method
that learns a simple geometric approximation of random paths in a homogeneous

the absorption along the path as well as a direct lighting contribution, which
is representative of all scattering events along the path. A sequence of
conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAEs) is trained to model the
statistical distribution of the photon paths inside a spherical region in
presence of multiple scattering events. A first CVAE learns to sample the
number of scattering events, occurring on a ray path inside the sphere, which
effectively determines the probability of the ray being absorbed. Conditioned
on this, a second model predicts the exit position and direction of the light
particle. Finally, a third model generates a representative sample of photon
position and direction along the path, which is used to approximate the
contribution of direct illumination due to in-scattering. To accelerate the
tracing of the light path through the volumetric medium toward the solid
boundary, we employ a sphere-tracing strategy that considers the light
absorption and is able to perform statistically accurate next-event estimation.
We demonstrate efficient learning using shallow networks of only three layers
and no more than 16 nodes. In combination with a GPU shader that evaluates the
CVAEs' predictions, performance gains can be demonstrated for a variety of
different scenarios. A quality evaluation analyzes the approximation error that
is introduced by the data-driven scattering simulation and sheds light on the

literature on such vehicles has addressed energy-efficient trajectory

application of trajectory optimization techniques which include refueling stops

open challenge by formulating the trajectory design problem as a nonconvex
mixed-integer optimization program with a multi-objective cost function. Then,
we apply dynamic programming to solve this optimization program for fuel and
time optimal trajectories. We synthesize these results into a series of Pareto
fronts which demonstrates the tradeoff between fuel consumption and trip time
for a prototypical route with direction-dependent ocean currents. Furthermore,
the optimal trajectories for which we solve illustrate the changes in the
vehicle's behavior as the fuel level becomes low, and as the vehicle encounters
counterproductive ocean currents. Our results indicate several meaningful

  (SLT), 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models with a single neural
network have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art results compared to
conventional hybrid speech recognizers. Specifically, recurrent neural network
transducer (RNN-T) has shown competitive ASR performance on various benchmarks.
In this work, we examine ways in which RNN-T can achieve better ASR accuracy
via performing auxiliary tasks. We propose (i) using the same auxiliary task as
primary RNN-T ASR task, and (ii) performing context-dependent graphemic state
prediction as in conventional hybrid modeling. In transcribing social media
videos with varying training data size, we first evaluate the streaming ASR
performance on three languages: Romanian, Turkish and German. We find that both
proposed methods provide consistent improvements. Next, we observe that both
auxiliary tasks demonstrate efficacy in learning deep transformer encoders for
RNN-T criterion, thus achieving competitive results - 2.0%/4.2% WER on
LibriSpeech test-clean/other - as compared to prior top performing models.

recognition (ASR) has attracted much interest. While promising results have
been reported for various tasks, past studies on its meeting transcription
application were limited to small scale experiments. It is still unclear
whether such a joint framework can be beneficial for a more practical setup
where a massive amount of single channel training data can be leveraged for
building a strong ASR back-end. In this work, we present our investigation on
the joint modeling of a mask-based beamformer and
Attention-Encoder-Decoder-based ASR in the setting where we have 75k hours of
single-channel data and a relatively small amount of real multi-channel data
for model training. We explore effective training procedures, including a
comparison of simulated and real multi-channel training data. To guide the
recognition towards a target speaker and deal with overlapped speech, we also
explore various combinations of bias information, such as direction of arrivals
and speaker profiles. We propose an effective location bias integration method
called deep concatenation for the beamformer network. In our evaluation on
various meeting recordings, we show that the proposed framework achieves a
substantial word error rate reduction.

model that has found wide application in a range of inference problems. It has
a simple analytic form and the posterior computation boils down to
beta-binomial conjugate updates along a partition tree over the sample space.
Recent development in PT models shows that performance of these models can be
substantially improved by (i) allowing the partition tree to adapt to the
structure of the underlying distributions and (ii) incorporating latent state
variables that characterize local features of the underlying distributions.
However, important limitations of the PT remain, including (i) the sensitivity
in the posterior inference with respect to the choice of the partition tree,
and (ii) the lack of scalability with respect to dimensionality of the sample
space. We consider a modeling strategy for PT models that incorporates a
flexible prior on the partition tree along with latent states with Markov
dependency. We introduce a hybrid algorithm combining sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) and recursive message passing for posterior sampling that can scale up to
100 dimensions. While our description of the algorithm assumes a single
computer environment, it has the potential to be implemented on distributed
systems to further enhance the scalability. Moreover, we investigate the large
sample properties of the tree structures and latent states under the posterior
model. We carry out extensive numerical experiments in density estimation and
two-group comparison, which show that flexible partitioning can substantially
improve the performance of PT models in both inference tasks. We demonstrate an

generalization of the causal transportability problem. To address this
challenge, we extend the recently introduced synthetic interventions (SI)

Here, using of Raman scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopies, we report
a comprehensive characterization of a molybedenum diselenide (MoSe$_2$)
monolayer deposited onto hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and capped by mono- and
bilayer graphene. Along with the atomically flat hBN susbstrate, a single
graphene epilayer is sufficient to passivate the MoSe$_2$ layer and provides a
homogenous environment without the need for an extra capping layer. As a
result, we do not observe photo-induced doping in our heterostructure and the
MoSe$_2$ excitonic linewidth gets as narrow as 1.6~meV, hence approaching the
homogeneous limit. The semi-metallic graphene layer neutralizes the 2D
semiconductor and enables picosecond non-radiative energy transfer that
quenches radiative recombination from long-lived states. Hence, emission from
the neutral band edge exciton largely dominates the photoluminescence spectrum
of the MoSe$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Since this exciton has a picosecond
radiative lifetime at low temperature, comparable with the energy transfer
time, its low-temperature photoluminescence is only quenched by a factor of
$3.3 \pm 1$ and $4.4 \pm 1$ in the presence of mono- and bilayer graphene,
respectively. Finally, while our bare MoSe$_2$ on hBN exhibits negligible
valley polarization at low temperature and under near-resonant excitation, we
show that interfacing MoSe$_2$ with graphene yields a single-line emitter with
degrees of valley polarization and coherence up to $\sim 15\,\%$.

continental shelves even at slopes as low as 1{\deg} and can cause significant
casualty and damage to infrastructure. The run-out mechanism in a submarine
landslide is affected by factors such as the initial packing density,
permeability, slope angle, and initial volume. While past studies have focused
on the influence of density, permeability, and slope angle on the granular
column collapse, the impact of volume on the run-out characteristics has not
been investigated. This study aims to understand how the initial volume affects
the run-out using a two-dimensional coupled lattice Boltzman and discrete
element (LBM-DEM) method. The coupled LBM-DEM approach allows simulating fluid
flow at the pore-scale resolution to understand the grain-scale mechanisms
driving the complex continuum-scale response in the granular column collapse.
For submerged granular column collapse, the run-out mechanism is heavily
influenced by the interaction between the grains and the surrounding fluid. The
development of negative pore pressures during shearing and hydrodynamic drag
forces inhibit the flow. On the other hand, entrainment of water resulting in
hydroplaning enhances the flow. With an increase in volume, the interaction
between the grains and the surrounding fluid varies, causing changes in the
run-out behavior. For smaller volumes, the forces inhibiting the underwater
flow predominates, resulting in shorter run-outs than their dry counterparts.
At large volumes, hydroplaning results in larger run-out than the dry cases,
despite the inhibiting effects of drag forces and negative pore pressures.

  We present Sandslash, an in-memory Graph Pattern Mining (GPM) framework that
uses a novel programming interface to support productive, expressive, and

only a specification of the GPM problem, and it implements fast subgraph

expert-optimized implementations, Sandslash also provides a low-level API that
allows users to express algorithm-specific optimizations. This enables
Sandslash to support both high-productivity and high-efficiency without losing
expressiveness. We evaluate Sandslash on shared-memory machines using five GPM
applications and a wide range of large real-world graphs. Experimental results
demonstrate that applications written using Sandslash high-level or low-level

encoding $\hat{f}$ of a function $f$ is another function such that $f(x)$ can
be recovered from $\hat{f}(x)$, and nothing except for $f(x)$ is leaked from
$\hat{f}(x)$. Its quantum version, quantum randomized encoding, has been
introduced recently [Brakerski and Yuen, arXiv:2006.01085]. Intuitively,
quantum randomized encoding $\hat{F}$ of a quantum operation $F$ is another
quantum operation such that, for any quantum state $\rho$, $F(\rho)$ can be

two-round verification of quantum computing is possible with a classical
verifier who can additionally do the operation $E$. One of the most important
goals in the field of the verification of quantum computing is to construct a
verification protocol with a verifier as classical as possible. This result
therefore demonstrates a potential application of quantum randomized encoding
to the verification of quantum computing: if we can find a good quantum
randomized encoding (in terms of the encoding complexity), then we can
construct a good verification protocol of quantum computing. We, however, also
show that too good quantum randomized encoding is impossible: if quantum
randomized encoding with a classical encoding operation is possible, then the
no-cloning is violated. We finally consider a natural modification of blind

localize contacts of robot arms in motion without joint torque observations.
Our method uses a novel cylindrical projection encoding of the robot arm

annotated with a single click. This labeling process requires significantly
less manual intervention, averaging roughly one second per fish. Our approach
uses a fully convolutional neural network with one branch that outputs

electric field are studied using large-scale numerical simulations in the limit
of zero-shear-rate flow. Under the action of an electric field, the particles
undergo the nonlinear electrokinetic phenomenon termed as dipolophoresis, which
is the combination of dielectrophoresis and induced-charge electrophoresis. For
ideally conductive particles, the dynamics of the suspension are primarily
controlled by induced-charge electrophoresis. To characterize the rheological
properties of the suspension, the particle stress tensor and particle pressure
are calculated in a range of volume fraction up to almost random close packing.
The particle normal stress and particle pressure are shown to behave
non-monotonically with volume fraction, especially in concentrated regimes. In
particular, the particle pressure is positive for volume fraction up to 30\%,
after which it becomes negative, indicating a change in the nature of the
particle pressure. The microstructure expressed by pair distribution function
and suspension entropy is also evaluated. Visible variations in the local
microstructure seem to correlate with the non-monotonic variation in the
particle normal stresses and particle pressure. These non-monotonic behaviors
are also correlated with the change in the dominant mechanism of particle
pairing dynamics observed in our recent study [Mirfendereski \& Park, J. Fluid
Mech. \textbf{875}, R3 (2019)]. Lastly, the effects of confinement on the
particle stress and particle pressure are investigated. It is found that the
particle pressure changes its nature very quickly at high volume fractions as
the level of confinement increases. This study should motivate control
strategies to fully exploit the distinct changing nature of the pressure for
rheological manipulation of such suspension system.

non-linear mappings between the inputs and outputs. Rectified Linear Unit

community. However, ReLU contains several shortcomings that can result in
inefficient training of the deep neural networks, these are: 1) the negative
cancellation property of ReLU tends to treat negative inputs as unimportant
information for the learning, resulting in a performance degradation; 2) the
inherent predefined nature of ReLU is unlikely to promote additional
flexibility, expressivity, and robustness to the networks; 3) the mean
activation of ReLU is highly positive and leads to bias shift effect in network
layers; and 4) the multilinear structure of ReLU restricts the non-linear
approximation power of the networks. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper
introduced Parametric Flatten-T Swish (PFTS) as an alternative to ReLU. By
taking ReLU as a baseline method, the experiments showed that PFTS improved

films is leakage currents. Using the example of Al-Al2O3-Al, we show that there
are two main contributions, namely the cold field emission effect and the
hopping conductivity through the dielectric. Our main finding is that an
application of a high electric field, ~0.6-0.7 GV/m, causes electrons to
penetrate the dielectric. If the temperature is sufficiently low, such
electrons become permanently trapped in the dielectric. To achieve a strong
charging of the dielectric, the voltage needs to be high enough, so that a
field emission occurs from the cathode into the dielectric. Such a strongly
charged dielectric layer generates a Coulomb barrier and leads to a suppression
of the leakage current. Thus, after the dielectric nanolayer of the capacitor
is charged, the field emission and the hopping conductivity are both
suppressed, and the hysteresis of the I-V curve disappears. The phenomenon is
observed at temperatures up to ~225 K. It would be advantageous to identify
insulators in which the phenomenon of the Coulomb barriers persists even up to
the room temperature, but at this time it is not known whether such dielectrics
exist and/or can be designed.

enables such a non-convex problem to be implemented in real-time. When channels
are time-varying, the deep neural networks (DNNs) need to be re-trained
frequently, which calls for low training complexity. To reduce the number of
training samples and the size of DNN required to achieve good performance, a
promising approach is to embed the DNNs with priori knowledge. Since cellular
networks can be modelled as a graph, it is natural to employ graph neural
networks (GNNs) for learning, which exhibit permutation invariance (PI) and
equivalence (PE) properties. Unlike the homogeneous GNNs that have been used
for wireless problems, whose outputs are invariant or equivalent to arbitrary
permutations of vertexes, heterogeneous GNNs (HetGNNs), which are more
appropriate to model cellular networks, are only invariant or equivalent to
some permutations. If the PI or PE properties of the HetGNN do not match the
property of the task to be learned, the performance degrades dramatically. In
this paper, we show that the power control policy has a combination of
different PI and PE properties, and existing HetGNN does not satisfy these
properties. We then design a parameter sharing scheme for HetGNN such that the
learned relationship satisfies the desired properties. Simulation results show
that the sample complexity and the size of designed GNN for learning the
optimal power control policy in multi-user multi-cell networks are much lower

hyperbolic pants decomposition of $X$ we obtain sufficient conditions for
parabolicity of $X$ in terms of the Fenchel-Nielsen parameters of the
decomposition. In particular, we initiate the study of the effect of twist
parameters on parabolicity. A key ingredient in our work is the notion of
\textit{non standard half-collar} about a hyperbolic geodesic. We show that the
modulus of such a half-collar is much larger than the modulus of a standard
half-collar as the hyperbolic length of the core geodesic tends to infinity.
Moreover, the modulus of the annulus obtained by gluing two non standard
half-collars depends on the twist parameter, unlike in the case of standard
collars. Our results are sharp in many cases. For instance, for zero-twist
flute surfaces as well as half-twist flute surfaces with concave sequences of
lengths our results provide a complete characterization of parabolicity in
terms of the length parameters. It follows that parabolicity is equivalent to
completeness in these cases. Applications to other topological types such as

large-scale applications such as oil-field management (e.g., $74\times 8$km$^2$
East Texas Oil-field), smart farming, smart manufacturing, smart grid, and data

provide a scalable, reliable, low-power and low-latency communication. To
realize a predictable and reliable communication in a highly unreliable
wireless environment, industrial wireless standards use a centralized wireless
stack design. In a centralized wireless stack design, a central manager
generates routes and a communication schedule for a multi-channel time division
multiple access communication (TDMA) based medium access control (MAC).
However, a centralized wireless stack design is highly energy consuming, not
scalable, and does not support frequent changes to networks or workloads. To
address these challenges, the following contributions are made in this
dissertation: (1) A scalable and distributed routing algorithm for industrial
IoT which generates graph routes, which offer a high degree of redundancy, (2)
A local and online scheduling algorithm that is scalable, energy-efficient, and
supports network/workload dynamics while ensuring reliability and real-time
performance, (3) An approach to minimize latency for in-band integration of
multiple low-power networks, (4) A fast and efficient test of schedulability

enabling the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in resource-limited

and stops updating them, thus reducing the search space of the model. On the
contrary, Soft Filter Pruning (SFP) simply zeroizes pruned filters, keeping
updating them in the following training epochs, thus maintaining the capacity
of the network. However, SFP, together with its variants, converges much slower
than HFP due to its larger search space. Our question is whether SFP-based
methods and HFP can be combined to achieve better performance and speed up
convergence. Firstly, we generalize SFP-based methods and HFP to analyze their
characteristics. Then we propose a Gradually Hard Filter Pruning (GHFP) method
to smoothly switch from SFP-based methods to HFP during training and pruning,
thus maintaining a large search space at first, gradually reducing the capacity
of the model to ensure a moderate convergence speed. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10/100 show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

transductive active learning (TAL). We find that TAL makes better use of

as a benchmark for evaluating Bayesian models. Since TAL is too expensive and
indirect to guide development of algorithms, we introduce two metrics which
more directly evaluate the predictive correlations and which can be computed
efficiently: meta-correlations (i.e. the correlations between the models
correlation estimates and the true values), and cross-normalized likelihoods

Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that enable training ML models over data

Existing FL and SL approaches work on horizontally or vertically partitioned
data and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data where segments of
multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across clients. In this paper,
we propose a novel federated split learning framework, FedSL, to train models
on distributed sequential data. The most common ML models to train on
sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since the proposed
framework is privacy-preserving, segments of multiple-segment sequential data
cannot be shared between clients or between clients and server. To circumvent
this limitation, we propose a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. A RNN is
split into sub-networks, and each sub-network is trained on one client
containing single segments of multiple-segment training sequences. During local
training, the sub-networks on different clients communicate with each other to
capture latent dependencies between consecutive segments of multiple-segment
sequential data on different clients, but without sharing raw data or complete
model parameters. After training local sub-networks with local sequential data
segments, all clients send their sub-networks to a federated server where
sub-networks are aggregated to generate a global model. The experimental
results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method successfully trains models on distributed sequential data, while
preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning
approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds.

difficult to solve. While there has been extensive previous work on efficient

obstacle, we develop a quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic
$n$-dimensional ordinary differential equations. Assuming $R < 1$, where $R$ is
a parameter characterizing the ratio of the nonlinearity and forcing to the
linear dissipation, this algorithm has complexity $T^2 q~\mathrm{poly}(\log T,
\log n, \log 1/\epsilon)/\epsilon$, where $T$ is the evolution time, $\epsilon$
is the allowed error, and $q$ measures decay of the solution. This is an
exponential improvement over the best previous quantum algorithms, whose
complexity is exponential in $T$. While exponential decay precludes efficiency,
driven equations can avoid this issue despite the presence of dissipation. Our
algorithm uses the method of Carleman linearization, for which we give a novel
convergence theorem. This method maps a system of nonlinear differential
equations to an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations,
which we discretize, truncate, and solve using the forward Euler method and the
quantum linear system algorithm. We also provide a lower bound on the

fully vaporized by the detonation wave. However, when the droplet diameter is

basic RDC flow structures. Inside the refill zone, three droplet categories are
qualitatively identified. Droplets injected at the right end of the refill zone
directly interact with the deflagration surface and meanwhile have relatively
long residence time. However, droplets injected closer to the travelling
detonation front have insufficient time to be heated and vaporized. Our results
also demonstrate that when pre-vaporization level is low and initial droplet
diameter is large, the liquid fuel droplets may disperse towards the combustor
exit. Furthermore, the droplet dispersion height decreases with liquid fuel
pre-vaporization, while increases with droplet diameter.

properties of molecules can be modified inside an optical Fabry-Perot

such modification is currently not well understood by theory. In an effort to
understand the origin of such cavity induced phenomena, some recent studies
have focused on the effect of the cavity environment on the nonlinear optical
response of the molecular subsystem. Here, we use a recently proposed protocol
for classical cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulations to numerically
investigate the linear and nonlinear response of liquid carbon dioxide under
such VSC conditions following an optical pulse excitation. We find that
applying a strong pulse of excitation to the lower hybrid light-matter state,
i.e., the lower polariton (LP), can lead to an overall molecular nonlinear
absorption which is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the
excitation outside the cavity. This polariton-enhanced multiphoton absorption
also causes an ultrashort LP lifetime (0.2 ps) under strong illumination.
Unlike usual polariton relaxation processes -- whereby polaritonic energy
transfers directly to the manifold of singly excited vibrational dark states --
under the present mechanism, the LP transfers energy directly to the manifold
of higher vibrationally excited dark states; these highly excited dark states
subsequently relax to the manifold of singly excited states with a lifetime of
tens of ps. Because the present mechanism is generic in nature, we expect these
numerical predictions to be experimentally observed in different molecular
systems and in cavities with different volumes.

very difficult as the estimation of a single number for the probabilities and
performance levels are not always possible, because it is affected by many
factors such as inaccuracy and insufficiency of data, manufacturing process,
environment in which the system is running, evaluation done by multiple
experts, etc. To cope with impreciseness, we model component reliabilities as
interval type-2 fuzzy numbers (IT2 FNs), which is more suitable to represent
uncertainties than usual or type-1 fuzzy numbers. To solve the problem with
interval type-2 fuzzy parameters, we first apply various type-reduction and
defuzzification techniques, and obtain corresponding defuzzified values. As
maximization of system reliability and minimization of system cost are
conflicting to each other, so to obtain compromise solution of the MORRAP with
defuzzified parameters, we apply five different multi-objective optimization
methods, and then corresponding solutions are analyzed. The problem is
illustrated numerically for a real-world MORRAP on pharmaceutical plant, and
solutions are obtained by standard optimization solver LINGO, which is based on

we propose a framework with simple $\alpha$-weighted federated aggregation of
scores which leverages overlapping information gain across labels, while saving
bandwidth costs in the process. Empirical evaluation on Animals-10 dataset
(with 4 labels for effective elucidation of results) indicates an average
deterministic accuracy increase of at least ~16.7%. We also demonstrate the
on-device capabilities of our proposed framework by experimenting with
federated learning and inference across different iterations on a Raspberry Pi
2, a single-board computing platform.

  via Gradient Field and Contrastive Loss","IEEE ICRA 2021 accepted",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Estimating a depth map from a single RGB image has been investigated widely
for localization, mapping, and 3-dimensional object detection. Recent studies
on a single-view depth estimation are mostly based on deep Convolutional neural
Networks (ConvNets) which require a large amount of training data paired with
densely annotated labels. Depth annotation tasks are both expensive and
inefficient, so it is inevitable to leverage RGB images which can be collected
very easily to boost the performance of ConvNets without depth labels. However,
most self-supervised learning algorithms are focused on capturing the semantic
information of images to improve the performance in classification or object
detection, not in depth estimation. In this paper, we show that existing
self-supervised methods do not perform well on depth estimation and propose a
gradient-based self-supervised learning algorithm with momentum contrastive
loss to help ConvNets extract the geometric information with unlabeled images.
As a result, the network can estimate the depth map accurately with a
relatively small amount of annotated data. To show that our method is
independent of the model structure, we evaluate our method with two different
monocular depth estimation algorithms. Our method outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithms and shows the efficiency
of labeled data in triple compared to random initialization on the NYU Depth v2

(e.g., traffic and environment monitoring) with the prevalence of smart mobile

by individuals, privacy protection is one of the key issues in crowdsensing
systems. Traditionally, to alleviate users' privacy concerns, noises are added
to participants' sensitive data (e.g., participants' locations) through
techniques such as differential privacy. However, this inevitably results in
quality loss to the crowdsensing task. Recently, federated learning paradigm
has been proposed, which aims to achieve privacy preservation in machine
learning while ensuring that the learning quality suffers little or no loss.
Inspired by the federated learning paradigm, this article studies how federated
learning may benefit crowdsensing applications. In particular, we first propose
a federated crowdsensing framework, which analyzes the privacy concerns of each
crowdsensing stage (i.e., task creation, task assignment, task execution, and
data aggregation) and discuss how federated learning techniques may take
effect. Finally, we summarize key challenges and opportunities in federated

guarantees are two critical goals. However, either of them requires a
concession on the transmission rate. In this paper, we consider a visible light
network consisting of multiple access points and multiple users. Our first
objective is to mathematically evaluate the achievable rate under constraints
on delay and security. The second objective is to provide a cell formation with
customized statistical delay and security guarantees for each user. First, we
propose a user-centric design called secure cell formation, in which artificial
noise is considered, and flexible user scheduling is determined. Then, based on
the effective capacity theory, we derive the statistical-delay-constrained
secrecy rate and formulate the cell formation problem as a stochastic
optimization problem (OP). Further, based on the Lyapunov optimization theory,
we transform the stochastic OP into a series of evolutionary per-slot
drift-plus-penalty OPs. Finally, a modified particle swarm optimization
algorithm and an interference graph-based user-centric scheduling algorithm are
proposed to solve the OPs. We obtain a dynamic independent set of scheduled
users as well as secure cell formation parameters. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithm can achieve a better delay-constrained secrecy rate than
the existing cell formation approaches.

caching, where different queries (tasks), each containing $l\ge 1$ files,
sequentially arrive. An online algorithm that does not know the sequence of
queries ahead of time must adaptively decide on what files to keep in the cache
to incur the minimum number of cache misses. Here a cache miss refers to the
case where at least one file in a query is missing among the cache files. In
the special case where $l=1$, this problem reduces to the standard cache
problem. We first analyze the performance of the classic least recently used
(LRU) algorithm in this setting and show that LRU is a near-optimal online
deterministic algorithm for file-bundle caching with regard to competitive
ratio. We then extend our results to a generalized $(h,k)$-paging problem in
this file-bundle setting, where the performance of the online algorithm with a
cache size $k$ is compared to an optimal offline benchmark of a smaller cache
size $h<k$. In this latter case, we provide a randomized $O(l \ln
\frac{k}{k-h})$-competitive algorithm for our generalized $(h,k)$-paging
problem, which can be viewed as an extension of the classic marking algorithm.
We complete this result by providing a matching lower bound for the competitive
ratio, indicating that the performance of this modified marking algorithm is
within a factor of two of any randomized online algorithm. Finally, we look at
the distributed version of the file-bundle caching problem where there are
$m\ge 1$ identical caches in the system. In this case we show that for $m=l+1$
caches, there is a deterministic distributed caching algorithm which is
$(l^2+l)$-competitive and a randomized distributed caching algorithm which is
$O(l\ln(2l+1))$-competitive when $l\ge 2$.

environment at $z\!=\!0$, assessing central/satellite status and host halo
mass. We make close comparisons with the carbon monoxide (CO) emission survey
xCOLD GASS where possible, having mock-observed TNG100 galaxies to match the
survey's specifications. For a representative sample of host haloes across
$10^{11}\!\lesssim\!M_{\rm 200c}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\!<\!10^{14.6}$, TNG100
predicts that satellites with $m_*\!\geq\!10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ should have a
median deficit in their H$_2$ fractions of $\sim$0.6 dex relative to centrals
of the same stellar mass. Once observational and group-finding uncertainties
are accounted for, the signature of this deficit decreases to $\sim$0.2 dex.
Remarkably, we calculate a deficit in xCOLD GASS satellites' H$_2$ content
relative to centrals of 0.2--0.3 dex, in line with our prediction. We further
show that TNG100 and SDSS data exhibit continuous declines in the average star
formation rates of galaxies at fixed stellar mass in denser environments, in
quantitative agreement with each other. By tracking satellites from their
moment of infall in TNG100, we directly show that atomic hydrogen (HI) is
depleted at fractionally higher rates than H$_2$ on average. Supporting this
picture, we find that the H$_2$/HI mass ratios of satellites are elevated
relative to centrals in xCOLD GASS. We provide additional predictions for the
effect of environment on H$_2$ -- both absolute and relative to HI -- that can
be tested with spectral stacking in future CO surveys.

behavior data, financial transactions, and medical health records. Modeling
such data can be very challenging, in particular for applications with many
different types of events, since it requires a model to predict the event types
as well as the time of occurrence. Recurrent neural networks that parameterize
time-varying intensity functions are the current state-of-the-art for
predictive modeling with such data. These models typically assume that all
event sequences come from the same data distribution. However, in many
applications event sequences are generated by different sources, or users, and
their characteristics can be very different. In this paper, we extend the broad
class of neural marked point process models to mixtures of latent embeddings,
where each mixture component models the characteristic traits of a given user.
Our approach relies on augmenting these models with a latent variable that
encodes user characteristics, represented by a mixture model over user behavior
that is trained via amortized variational inference. We evaluate our methods on
four large real-world datasets and demonstrate systematic improvements from our
approach over existing work for a variety of predictive metrics such as

retrieval using multiple neural hash codes and limiting the number of queries
using bloom filters by identifying false positives beforehand. Traditional
approaches involving neural networks for image retrieval tasks tend to use
higher layers for feature extraction. But it has been seen that the activations
of lower layers have proven to be more effective in a number of scenarios. In
our approach, we have leveraged the use of local deep convolutional neural
networks which combines the powers of both the features of lower and higher
layers for creating feature maps which are then compressed using PCA and fed to
a bloom filter after binary sequencing using a modified multi k-means approach.
The feature maps obtained are further used in the image retrieval process in a
hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner by first comparing the images in the higher
layers for semantically similar images and then gradually moving towards the
lower layers searching for structural similarities. While searching, the neural
hashes for the query image are again calculated and queried in the bloom filter
which tells us whether the query image is absent in the set or maybe present.
If the bloom filter doesn't necessarily rule out the query, then it goes into
the image retrieval process. This approach can be particularly helpful in cases
where the image store is distributed since the approach supports parallel
querying.

however, can maintain relatively stable performance across the entire range of
UAV heights, suggesting that UAV users can successfully connect to small cells

parametric regimes motivated by recent magnetized dusty plasma (MDP)
experiments. This analysis has shown that shear in the ${\bf B}$ can produce a
shear internal field (${\bf E_a}$) in between electrons and ions due to the
${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ and ${\nabla {\bf B}}\times {\bf B}$-drifts that cause
rotation of dust cloud levitated in the plasma. The flow solution demonstrates
that neutral pressure decides the dominance between the ions-drag and the ${\bf
E_a}$-force. The shear ions-drag generates an anti-clockwise circular vortical
structure, whereas the shear ${\bf E_a}$-force is very localized and gives rise
to a clockwise $D$-shaped elliptical structure which turns into a meridional
structure with decreasing ${\bf B}$. Effect of system parameters including the
strength of ${\bf B}$ by varying its magnitude and shear mode numbers and the
sheath field are analyzed within the weak MDP regime, showing noticeable
changes in the flow structure and its momentum. In the parametric regime of
high pressure and lower ${\bf B}$, the ${\bf E_a}$-force becomes comparable or
dominant over the ion drag and peculiar counter-rotating vortex pairs are
developed in the domain. Further, when the ${\bf B}$ is flipped by
$180^0$-degree, both the drivers act together and give rise to a single strong
meridional structure, showing the importance of ${\bf B}$-direction in MDP
systems. It further discussed similar elliptical/meridional structures reported

induced quadrupole deformation is observed in the crust during the evolution.
Generally, the ellipticity decreases as the magnetic energy decreases. In a
toroidal-field-dominated model, the sign of the ellipticity changes. Namely,
the initial prolate shape tends to become oblate. This occurs because the
toroidal component decays rapidly on a smaller timescale than the poloidal
dipole component. We find that the magnetic dipole component does not change
significantly on the Hall timescale of $\sim 1$Myr for the considered simple

In many related arts, the importance of an output feature map is only
determined by its associated filter. However, these methods ignore a small part
of weights in the next layer which disappears as the feature map is removed.
They ignore the phenomenon of weight dependency. Besides, many pruning methods
use only one criterion for evaluation and find a sweet spot of pruning
structure and accuracy in a trial-and-error fashion, which can be
time-consuming. In this paper, we proposed a channel pruning algorithm via
multi-criteria based on weight dependency, CPMC, which can compress a
pre-trained model directly. CPMC defines channel importance in three aspects,
including its associated weight value, computational cost, and parameter
quantity. According to the phenomenon of weight dependency, CPMC gets channel
importance by assessing its associated filter and the corresponding partial
weights in the next layer. Then CPMC uses global normalization to achieve
cross-layer comparison. Finally, CPMC removes less important channels by global
ranking. CPMC can compress various CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet, and
DenseNet on various image classification datasets. Extensive experiments have
shown CPMC outperforms the others significantly.

traditional SVMs and One Class SVMs or even other One class classifiers. This
paper proposes fast training method for One Class Slab SVMs using an updated
Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) which divides the multi variable
optimization problem to smaller sub problems of size two that can then be
solved analytically. The results indicate that this training method scales
better to large sets of training data than other Quadratic Programming (QP)
solvers.

magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) in chiral conductors, touches the most
important elements of modern condensed matter physics. Here, we have
investigated the EMCA in Pt/PtMnGa (PMG) bilayers with the assitance of
nonequilibrium fluctuation theorems. Large EMCA in the Pt/PMG bilayers can be
attributed to nonreciprocal response of an interface-driven chiral transport
channel. Due to the presence of large charge fluctuations for small current
region, higher order EMCA coefficients should be added and they are all
functions of current. A combination of asymmetrical electron scattering and
spin-dependent scattering furnish the PMG thickness dependent chiral transport
behaviors in Pt/PMG bilayers. The dramatically enhanced anomalous Hall angle of
PMG further demonstrates the modified surface state properties by strong
spin-orbit coupling.

facilitates lattice motion induced spin current via spin orbit interaction
(SOI). Under excitation of surface acoustic wave (SAW), we find a spin current
flows orthogonal to the propagation direction of a surface acoustic wave (SAW)
in non-magnetic metals. The acoustic spin Hall effect manifests itself in a
field-dependent acoustic voltage in non-magnetic metal (NM)/ferromagnetic metal
(FM) bilayers. The acoustic voltage takes a maximum when the NM layer thickness
is close to its spin diffusion length, vanishes for NM layers with weak SOI and
increases linearly with the SAW frequency. To account for these results, we
find the spin current must scale with the SOI and the time derivative of the
lattice displacement. Such form of spin current can be derived from a Berry
electric field associated with time varying Berry curvature and/or an
unconventional spin-lattice interaction mediated by SOI. These results, which
imply the strong coupling of electron spins with rotating lattices via the SOI,
show the potential of lattice dynamics to supply spin current in strong spin
orbit metals.

multi-temporal images. In this paper, we propose a large scale benchmark
dataset, termed Hi-UCD. This dataset uses aerial images with a spatial
resolution of 0.1 m provided by the Estonia Land Board, including three-time
phases, and semantically annotated with nine classes of land cover to obtain
the direction of ground objects change. It can be used for detecting and
analyzing refined urban changes. We benchmark our dataset using some classic

that Hi-UCD is challenging yet useful. We hope the Hi-UCD can become a strong

advantage of graph data. The success of GNN models always depends on rich
features and adjacent relationships. However, in practice, such data are
usually isolated by different data owners (clients) and thus are likely to be
Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID). Meanwhile, considering
the limited network status of data owners, hyper-parameters optimization for
collaborative learning approaches is time-consuming in data isolation
scenarios. To address these problems, we propose an Automated
Separated-Federated Graph Neural Network (ASFGNN) learning paradigm. ASFGNN
consists of two main components, i.e., the training of GNN and the tuning of
hyper-parameters. Specifically, to solve the data Non-IID problem, we first
propose a separated-federated GNN learning model, which decouples the training
of GNN into two parts: the message passing part that is done by clients
separately, and the loss computing part that is learnt by clients federally. To
handle the time-consuming parameter tuning problem, we leverage Bayesian
optimization technique to automatically tune the hyper-parameters of all the
clients. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets and the results
demonstrate that ASFGNN significantly outperforms the naive federated GNN, in
terms of both accuracy and parameter-tuning efficiency.

number of local gradient steps and occasionally exchange information with their
neighbors. Previous algorithmic analysis efforts have focused on the specific
network topology (star topology) where a leader node aggregates all agents'
information. We generalize that setting to an arbitrary network by analyzing
the trade-off between the number of communication rounds and the computational
effort of each agent. We bound the expected optimality gap in terms of the
number of iterates $T$, the number of workers $n$, and the spectral gap of the
underlying network. Our main results show that by using only $R=\Omega(n)$
communication rounds, one can achieve an error that scales as $O({1}/{nT})$,
where the number of communication rounds is independent of $T$ and only depends
on the number of agents. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of our

20180916B is 250 pc away (in projected distance) from the brightest pixel of

neutron stars in binaries (60-750 km s$^{-1}$), FRB 20180916B would need 800

This timescale is inconsistent with the active ages of magnetars ($\lesssim10$

ages of high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray binaries, and their separations
from the nearest OB associations.

challenge in the field of epidemiology. The SIR Model proposed by Kermack and
McKendrick in 1927 is a prototypical model of epidemiology. However, it has its
limitations. In this paper, we show two independent ways of generalizing this
model, the first one if the vaccine isn't discovered or ready to use and the
next one, if the vaccine is discovered and ready to use. In the first part, we
have pointed out a major over-simplification, i.e., assumption of variation of
the time derivatives of the variables with the linear or quadratic powers of
the individual variables and introduce two new parameters to incorporate
further nonlinearity in the number of infected people in the model. As a result
of this, we show how this additional nonlinearity, in the newly introduced
parameters, can bring a significant shift in the peak time of infection, i.e.,
the time at which the infected population reaches maximum. We show that in
special cases, even we can get a transition from epidemic to a non-epidemic
stage of a particular infectious disease. We further study one such special
case and treat it as a problem of phase transition. Then, we investigate all
the necessary parameters of this phase transition, like the order parameter and
critical exponent. We observe that $O_p \sim (q_c-q)^{\beta}$. {\it As far as
we know the phase transition and its quantification in terms of the scaling
behaviour is not yet know in the context of pandemic}. In the second part, we
incorporate in the model, a consideration of artificial herd immunity and show
how we can decrease the peak time of infection with a subsequent decrease in
the maximum number of infected people.

consumption due to parallel execution of tasks with maximum frequency,
specially in the overload situation, may lead to thermal issues, which may
affect the reliability and timeliness of MC systems. Therefore, managing peak
power consumption has become imperative in multi-core MC systems. In this
regard, we propose an online peak power and thermal management heuristic for
multi-core MC systems. This heuristic reduces the peak power consumption of the
system as much as possible during runtime by exploiting dynamic slack and
per-cluster Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Specifically, our
approach examines multiple tasks ahead to determine the most appropriate one
for slack assignment, that has the most impact on the system peak power and
temperature. However, changing the frequency and selecting a proper task for
slack assignment and a proper core for task re-mapping at runtime can be
time-consuming and may cause deadline violation which is not admissible for
high-criticality tasks. Therefore, we analyze and then optimize our run-time
scheduler and evaluate it for various platforms. The proposed approach is
experimentally validated on the ODROID-XU3 (DVFS-enabled heterogeneous
multi-core platform) with various embedded real-time benchmarks. Results show
that our heuristic achieves up to 5.25% reduction in system peak power and
20.33\% reduction in maximum temperature compared to an existing method while
meeting deadline constraints in different criticality modes.

large ($>1$ kpc) scale is still debated. The scenario that invokes the inverse
Compton scattering of the CMB by electrons is challenged by the lack of
gamma-ray emission in the GeV band. An alternative assumes synchrotron emission
by a distinct population of ultra-high energy electrons. Here we present a
concrete attempt to apply this scenario, exploring the specific model in which
the ultra-high energy electrons are accelerated in a shear layer surrounding
the jet. We limit the study to non-relativistic flows and particle acceleration
is treated by a Fokker-Planck equation. The observed relation between low
energy (radio, optical) and X-ray emission prompts us to assume that the
required population of pre-accelerated particles is provided by a shock
responsible for the acceleration of the electrons emitting at low frequencies.
We apply the model to the emission of the principal knots of the jets of PKS
0637-752 and PKS 1136-135, two of the best studied objects. For the set of
fiducial parameters adopted, the condition that the jet power does not exceeds
a limiting value of $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ constrains the magnetic field above
$10$ $\mu$G and indicates moderate beaming ($\delta\simeq 2$) for PKS 0637-752.
For both sources, the requirement that acceleration of the electrons proceeds
faster than radiative cooling can be met if the magnetic turbulence in the
shear layer follows a Kolmogorov spectrum, $I(k)\propto k^{-q}$ with $q=5/3$,
but cannot satisfied in the Bohm-like case ($q=1$).

dissipation or noise can be neglected or do not play a crucial role. In
contrast, here we discuss a setup where dissipative interactions do amplify a
photonic Josephson current, opening a doorway to dissipation-enhanced
sensitivity of quantum-optical interferometry devices. In particular, we study
two coupled nanolasers subjected to phase coherent drivings and coupled by a
coherent photon tunneling process. We describe this system by means of a
Fokker-Planck equation and show that it exhibits an interesting non-equilibrium
phase diagram as a function of the coherent coupling between nanolasers. As we
increase that coupling, we find a non-equilibrium phase transition between a
phase-locked and a non-phase-locked steady-state, in which phase coherence is
destroyed by the photon tunneling process. In the coherent, phase-locked
regime, an imbalanced photon number population appears if there is a phase
difference between the nanolasers, which appears in the steady-state as a
result of the competition between competing local dissipative dynamics and the
Josephson photo-current. The latter is amplified for large incoherent pumping
rates and it is also enchanced close to the lasing phase transition. We show
that the Josephson photocurrent can be used to measure optical phase
differences. In the quantum limit, the accuracy of the two nanolaser
interferometer grows with the square of the photon number and, thus, it can be
enhanced by increasing the rate of incoherent pumping of photons into the
nanolasers.

Galactic GCs with similar masses, thus suggesting that the environment affects
the MP phenomenon. We compared and combined our population fractions based on
HB with previous estimates from MS and RGB, and we used ground-based UBVI
photometry (available for NGC 104, NGC 5927, NGC 6366, NGC 6838) to extend the
investigation over a wide field of view. All studied GCs are consistent with
flat distributions of 1G and 2G stars within ~1 arcmin from the cluster center
except NGC 416, where the 2G is more centrally concentrated. 2G stars of NGC
104 and NGC 5927 are more centrally-concentrated than the 1G, whereas the
distribution is flat for NGC 6366 and NGC 6838. We discover that most of the
analyzed GCs exhibit extended sequences of 1G stars along the red HB, not
consistent with a simple population. The comparison between appropriate
synthetic and observed CMDs reveals that these extended distributions are
consistent with either star-to-star variation in helium or with an internal
metallicity spread, recalling the inhomogeneity of 1G stars along the ChMs.

few years. A multitude of experimental observations suggest that chemical
properties can be fundamentally altered and novel physical states appear when
matter is strongly coupled to resonant cavity modes, i.e. when hybrid
light-matter states emerge. Up until now, theoretical approaches to explain and
predict these observations were either limited to phenomenological quantum
optical models, suited to describe collective polaritonic effects, or
alternatively to ab initio approaches for small system sizes. The later methods
were particularly controversial since collective effects could not be
explicitly included due to the intrinsically low particle numbers, which are
computationally accessible. Here, we demonstrate for a nitrogen dimer chain of
variable size that any impurity present in a collectively coupled chemical
ensemble (e.g. temperature fluctuations or reaction process) induces local
modifications in the polaritonic system. From this we deduce that a novel dark
state is formed, whose local chemical properties are modified considerably at
the impurity due to the collectively coupled environment. Our simulations unify
theoretical predictions from quantum optical models (e.g. formation of
collective dark states and different polaritonic branches) with the single
molecule quantum chemical perspective, which relies on the (quantized)
redistribution of local charges. Moreover, our findings suggest that the
recently developed QEDFT method is suitable to access these locally scaling
polaritonic effects and it is a useful tool to better understand recent
experimental results and to even design novel experimental approaches. All of
which paves the way for many novel discoveries and applications in polaritonic
chemistry.

edges. We address the problem of sensitivity oracle for all-pairs mincuts in

  Build a compact data structure that, on receiving any pair of vertices
$s,t\in V$ and failure (or insertion) of any edge as query, can efficiently
report the mincut between $s$ and $t$ after the failure (or the insertion).
  To the best of our knowledge, there exists no data structure for this problem
which takes $o(mn)$ space and a non-trivial query time. We present the
following results.
  - Our first data structure occupies ${\cal O}(n^2)$ space and guarantees
${\cal O}(1)$ query time to report the value of resulting $(s,t)$-mincut upon
failure (or insertion) of any edge. Moreover, the set of vertices defining a
resulting $(s,t)$-mincut after the update can be reported in ${\cal O}(n)$ time
which is worst-case optimal.
  - Our second data structure optimizes space at the expense of increased query
time. It takes ${\cal O}(m)$ space -- which is also the space taken by $G$. The
query time is ${\cal O}(\min(m,n c_{s,t}))$ where $c_{s,t}$ is the value of the
mincut between $s$ and $t$ in $G$. This query time is faster by a factor of
$\Omega(\min(m^{1/3},\sqrt{n}))$ compared to the best known deterministic
algorithm to compute a $(s,t)$-mincut from scratch.
  - If we are only interested in knowing if failure (or insertion) of an edge
changes the value of $(s,t)$-mincut, we can distribute our ${\cal O}(n^2)$
space data structure evenly among $n$ vertices. For any failed (or inserted)
edge we only require the data structures stored at its endpoints to determine
if the value of $(s,t)$-mincut has changed for any $s,t \in V$.

  2021, https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-1259.html",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the optimization landscape and the stability properties of training
problems with squared loss for neural networks and general nonlinear conic
approximation schemes. It is demonstrated that, if a nonlinear conic
approximation scheme is considered that is (in an appropriately defined sense)
more expressive than a classical linear approximation approach and if there
exist unrealizable label vectors, then a training problem with squared loss is
necessarily unstable in the sense that its solution set depends discontinuously
on the label vector in the training data. We further prove that the same
effects that are responsible for these instability properties are also the
reason for the emergence of saddle points and spurious local minima, which may
be arbitrarily far away from global solutions, and that neither the instability
of the training problem nor the existence of spurious local minima can, in
general, be overcome by adding a regularization term to the objective function
that penalizes the size of the parameters in the approximation scheme. The
latter results are shown to be true regardless of whether the assumption of
realizability is satisfied or not. We demonstrate that our analysis in
particular applies to training problems for free-knot interpolation schemes and
deep and shallow neural networks with variable widths that involve an arbitrary
mixture of various activation functions (e.g., binary, sigmoid, tanh, arctan,
soft-sign, ISRU, soft-clip, SQNL, ReLU, leaky ReLU, soft-plus, bent identity,
SILU, ISRLU, and ELU). In summary, the findings of this paper illustrate that
the improved approximation properties of neural networks and general nonlinear
conic approximation instruments are linked in a direct and quantifiable way to
undesirable properties of the optimization problems that have to be solved in
order to train them.

important astrophysical implications such as triggering strong interactions and
producing, e.g., Type Ia supernovae and gravitational wave sources. When
considering analytic properties of ZLK oscillations at the lowest (quadrupole)
expansion order, as well as complications due to higher-order terms, one
usually assumes the test particle limit, in which one of the bodies in the
inner binary is massless. Although this approximation holds well for, e.g.,
planetary systems, it is less accurate for systems with more comparable masses
such as stellar triples. Whereas non-test-particle effects are usually taken
into account in numerical simulations, a more analytic approach focusing on the
differences between the test particle and general case (at quadrupole order)
has, to our knowledge, not been presented. Here, we derive several analytic
properties of secular oscillations in triples at the quadruple expansion order.
The latter applies even to relatively compact triples, as long as the inner
bodies are similar in mass such that octupole-order effects are suppressed. We
consider general conditions for the character of the oscillations (circular
versus librating), minimum and maximum eccentricities, and timescales, all as a
function of $\gamma \equiv (1/2) L_1/G_2$, a ratio of inner-to-outer orbital
angular momenta variables ($\gamma=0$ in the test particle limit). In
particular, eccentricity oscillations are more effective at retrograde
orientations for non-zero $\gamma$; assuming zero initial inner eccentricity,
the maximum eccentricity peaks at $\cos(i_\mathrm{rel,0}) = -\gamma$, where
$i_\mathrm{rel,0}$ is the initial relative inclination. We provide a Python
script which can be used to quickly compute these properties.

to many Computer Vision and Robotics applications. This task is commonly
addressed by handcrafted algorithms exploiting geometric cues deemed as
distinctive and robust by the designer. Yet, one might conjecture that humans
learn the notion of the inherent orientation of 3D objects from experience and
that machines may do so alike. In this work, we show the feasibility of
learning a robust canonical orientation for surfaces represented as point

canonical orientation is equivariance to 3D rotations, we propose to employ
Spherical CNNs, a recently introduced machinery that can learn equivariant
representations defined on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3). Specifically,
spherical correlations compute feature maps whose elements define 3D rotations.
Our method learns such feature maps from raw data by a self-supervised training
procedure and robustly selects a rotation to transform the input point cloud
into a learned canonical orientation. Thereby, we realize the first end-to-end
learning approach to define and extract the canonical orientation of 3D shapes,
which we aptly dub Compass. Experiments on several public datasets prove its
effectiveness at orienting local surface patches as well as whole objects.

generalizations of the Grushin plane. They are generalized Riemannian
structures for which the vectors of a local orthonormal frame can become
parallel. Under the 2-step assumption the singular set $Z$, where the structure
is not Riemannian, is a 1D embedded submanifold. While approaching the singular
set, all Riemannian quantities diverge. A remarkable property of these
structures is that the geodesics can cross the singular set without
singularities, but the heat and the solution of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation
(with the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$) cannot. This is due to the fact
that (under a natural compactness hypothesis), the Laplace-Beltrami operator is
essentially self-adjoint on a connected component of the manifold without the

studied in a neighborhood of its symmetric heteroclinic connection made up of a
symmetric saddle-center, a symmetric orientable saddle periodic orbit lying in
the same level of a Hamiltonian and two non-symmetric heteroclinic orbits
permuted by the involution. This is a codimension one structure and therefore
it can be met generally in one-parameter families of reversible Hamiltonian
systems. There exist two possible types of such connections in dependence on
how the involution acts near the equilibrium. We prove a series of theorems
which show a chaotic behavior of the system and those in its unfoldings, in
particular, the existence of countable sets of transverse homoclinic orbits to
the saddle periodic orbit in the critical level, transverse heteroclinic
connections involving a pair of saddle periodic orbits, families of elliptic
periodic orbits, homoclinic tangencies, families of homoclinic orbits to
saddle-centers in the unfolding, etc. As a byproduct, we get a criterion of the
existence of homoclinic orbits to a saddle-center.

exoplanets and their atmospheres by exploring our models as virtual

(eROSITA) aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission on October 11, 2019,
for about 60,000 seconds as one of the first calibration and pointed
verification phase (CalPV) observations. The eROSITA light curves show
significant variability in the form of a flux decrease by a factor of 58 with a
1 sigma error confidence interval between 31 and 235. This variability is
primarily in the soft band, and is much less extreme in the hard band. No
strong ultraviolet variability has been detected in simultaneous XMM-Newton
Optical Monitor observations. The UV emission is about 10^44 erg s^-1, close to
the Eddington limit. 1H 0707-495 entered the lowest hard flux state seen in 20
years of XMM-Newton observations. In the eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS)
observations taken in April 2020, the X-ray light curve is still more variable
in the ultra-soft band, but with increased soft and hard band count rates more
similar to previously observed flux states. A model including relativistic
reflection and a variable partial covering absorber is able to fit the spectra
and provides a possible explanation for the extreme light-curve behaviour. The
absorber is probably ionised and therefore more transparent to soft X-rays.
This leaks soft X-rays in varying amounts, leading to large-amplitude
soft-X-ray variability.

prohibitive which renders it unsuitable for high resolution imagery. In this
paper, we explore the efficiency of context graph reasoning and propose a novel
framework called Squeeze Reasoning. Instead of propagating information on the
spatial map, we first learn to squeeze the input feature into a channel-wise
global vector and perform reasoning within the single vector where the
computation cost can be significantly reduced. Specifically, we build the node
graph in the vector where each node represents an abstract semantic concept.
The refined feature within the same semantic category results to be consistent,
which is thus beneficial for downstream tasks. We show that our approach can be
modularized as an end-to-end trained block and can be easily plugged into
existing networks. {Despite its simplicity and being lightweight, the proposed
strategy allows us to establish the considerable results on different semantic
segmentation datasets and shows significant improvements with respect to strong
baselines on various other scene understanding tasks including object
detection, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation.} Code is available

wavelength-dependent, being maximum in the V band with an average value of

linear polarization of starlight toward the direction of NGC 1817. The average
value of the position angle in the V band of 119.2 degree is found to be less
than the direction of the Galactic parallel in the region, indicating that the
dust grains in the direction are probably not yet relaxed. Spatial distribution
of dust appears to be more diverse in the coronal region than the core region
of the cluster. The maximum value of the degree of polarization is estimated to
be 0.93% for members of the cluster using the Serkowski relation. The average
value of wavelength corresponding to the maximum polarization of 0.54+/-0.02
micron indicates that the size distribution of dust grains in the line of sight
is similar to that of the general interstellar medium. Several variable stars
in the cluster were also observed for polarimetrically and pulsating variables
appear to have a slightly lower value of polarization from other nonvariable
member stars of the cluster. There are indications of the existence of dust
layers existence in front of those clusters which are located close to galactic
plane while for clusters located away from galactic plane no major dust layers

inflationary gravitational waves (IGWs) with a blue-tilted primordial spectrum.
Although such IGWs can account for the NANOGrav signal without contradicting
the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio at the cosmic microwave
background scale, the predicted spectrum is in strong tension with the upper
bound on the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background by
big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the second LIGO-Virgo observation run.
However, the thermal history of the Universe, such as reheating and late-time
entropy production, affects the spectral shape of IGWs at high frequencies and
permits evading the upper bounds. We show that, for the standard reheating
scenario, when the reheating temperature is relatively low, a blue tensor
spectrum can explain the recent NANOGrav signal without contradicting the BBN
and the LIGO-Virgo constraints. We further find that, when one considers a
late-time entropy production, the NANOGrav signal can be explained even for an

excess in the H${\alpha}$ band. For the galaxy NGC1672, we measured the
distance for the first time by the TRGB method, which made it possible to
determine the luminosities of the brightest stars, likely hypergiants, in the
young star formation region. So far we have performed stellar photometry of HST
images of 320 northern sky galaxies located at a distance below 12Mpc. This
allowed us to identify 53 galaxies with probable hypergiants. Further
photometric and spectral observations of these galaxies are planned to search
for massive stars.

the possibility for use on sub-1 kg class of drones. The Compton camera uses
the MiniPIX TPX3 CdTe event camera to measure Compton scattering products of
incoming high-energy gamma photons. The 3D position and the sub-nanosecond time
delay of the measured scattering products are used to reconstruct sets of
possible directions to the source. The proposed method utilizes a filter for
fusing the measurements and estimating the radiation source position during the
flight. The computations are executed in real-time onboard and allow
integration of the detector info into a fully-autonomous system. Moreover, the
real-time nature of the estimator potentially allows estimating states of a
moving radiation source. The proposed method was validated in simulations and
demonstrated in a real-world experiment with a Cs137 radiation source. The
approach can localize a gamma source without estimating the gradient or

two correlated models after they have been changed concurrently and
independently. To determine whether such concurrent model changes conflict with
each other and to resolve these conflicts taking domain- or user-specific
preferences into account is highly challenging. In this paper, we present a
framework for concurrent model synchronization algorithms based on Triple Graph
Grammars (TGGs). TGGs specify the consistency of correlated models using
grammar rules; these rules can be used to derive different consistency
restoration operations. Using TGGs, we infer a causal dependency relation for
model elements that enables us to detect conflicts non-invasively. Different
kinds of conflicts are detected first and resolved by the subsequent conflict
resolution process. Users configure the overall synchronization process by
orchestrating the application of consistency restoration fragments according to
several conflict resolution strategies to achieve individual synchronization
goals. As proof of concept, we have implemented this framework in the model
transformation tool eMoflon. Our initial evaluation shows that the runtime of
our presented approach scales with the size of model changes and conflicts,
rather than model size.

diagnoses of complex systems. It performs well for industry system such as
nuclear power plants, chemical system and spacecrafts. However, the variable
state combination explosion in some cases is still a problem that may result in
inefficiency or even disability in DUCG inference. In the situation of clinical
diagnoses, when a lot of intermediate causes are unknown while the downstream
results are known in a DUCG graph, the combination explosion may appear during
the inference computation. Monte Carlo sampling is a typical algorithm to solve
this problem. However, we are facing the case that the occurrence rate of the
case is very small, e.g. $10^{-20}$, which means a huge number of samplings are
needed. This paper proposes a new scheme based on conditional stochastic
simulation which obtains the final result from the expectation of the
conditional probability in sampling loops instead of counting the sampling
frequency, and thus overcomes the problem. As a result, the proposed algorithm
requires much less time than the DUCG recursive inference algorithm presented
earlier. Moreover, a simple analysis of convergence rate based on a designed
example is given to show the advantage of the proposed method. % In addition,
supports for logic gate, logic cycles, and parallelization, which exist in
DUCG, are also addressed in this paper. The new algorithm reduces the time
consumption a lot and performs 3 times faster than old one with 2.7% error
ratio in a practical graph for Viral Hepatitis B.

challenges, this paper proposes a coupling optimization method including the
Domain-Invariant Mapping (DIM) method and the Global-Local distance
Optimization (GLO), respectively. Different from previous methods that transfer
knowledge in two stages, the DIM achieves a more efficient one-stage knowledge
transfer by mapping images in labeled and unlabeled datasets to a shared
feature space. GLO is designed to train the ReID model with unsupervised
setting on the target domain. Instead of relying on existing optimization
strategies designed for supervised training, GLO involves more images in
distance optimization, and achieves better robustness to noisy label
prediction. GLO also integrates distance optimizations in both the global
dataset and local training batch, thus exhibits better training efficiency.
Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets, i.e., Market-1501,
DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17, show that our coupling optimization outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our method also works well in
unsupervised training, and even outperforms several recent domain adaptive

topic of enduring interest, dating back at least to the invention in the 1940s
of the microwave travelling wave tube amplifier and culminating in contemporary
studies of chiral metamaterials, metasurfaces, and photonic crystal fibers
(PCFs). Optical fibers with chiral microstructures, drawn from a spinning
preform, have many useful properties, exhibiting for example circular
birefringence and circular dichroism. It has recently been shown that chiral
fibers with N fold rotationally symmetric (symmetry group CN) transverse
microstructures support families of helical Bloch modes (HBMs), each of which
consists of a superposition of azimuthal Bloch harmonics (or optical vortices).
An example is a fiber with N coupled cores arranged in a ring around its
central axis (N core single ring fiber). Although this type of fiber can be
readily modelled using scalar coupled mode theory, a full description of its
optical properties requires a vectorial analysis that takes account of the
polarization state of the light particularly important in studies of circular
and vortical birefringence. In this paper we develop, using an orthogonal two
dimensional helicoidal coordinate system embedded in a cylindrical surface at
constant radius, a rigorous vector coupled mode description of the fields using
local Frenet Serret frames that rotate and twist with each of the N cores. The
analysis places on a firm theoretical footing a previous HBM theory in which a
heuristic approach was taken, based on physical intuition of the properties of
Bloch waves. We believe this study provides clarity in what can sometimes be a
rather difficult field, and will facilitate further exploration of real-world

movements between those cities and regions, while taking into account that each

combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region' specificity

joint time-frequency domain representation of the sensor data, which is
provided as the input to the neural network classifier. Our exploration is
based on a real-world data set with over 3 million samples, collected from
sensors with a tri-axial accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope, attached to
collar tags of 10 dairy cows and collected over a one month period. The key
results of this paper is that the joint time-frequency data representation,
even when used in conjunction with a relatively basic neural network
classifier, can outperform the best cattle activity classifiers reported in the
literature. With a more systematic exploration of neural network classifier
architectures and hyper-parameters, there is potential for even further
improvements. Finally, we demonstrate that the time-frequency domain data
representation allows us to efficiently trade-off a large reduction of model
size and computational complexity for a very minor reduction in classification
accuracy. This shows the potential for our classification approach to run on
resource-constrained embedded and IoT devices.

Velocity Planet Searcher), measuring its variation with position across the

profile and its variations are important for achieving the precision of the
wavelength scales of 10^{-10} or 3.0 cm/s necessary to detect Earth-twins in
the habitable zone around solar-like stars. Methods. We used a laser frequency
comb (LFC) with unresolved and unblended lines to probe the instrument line
profile. We injected the LFC light (attenuated by various neutral density
filters) into both the object and the reference fibres of HARPS, and we studied
the variations of the line profiles with the line intensities. We applied
moment analysis to measure the line positions, widths, and skewness as well as
to characterize the line profile distortions induced by the spectrograph and
detectors. Based on this, we established a model to correct for point spread
function distortions by tracking the beam profiles in both fibres. Results. We
demonstrate that the line profile varies with the position on the detector and
as a function of line intensities. This is consistent with a charge transfer
inefficiency (CTI) effect on the HARPS detector. The estimate of the line
position depends critically on the line profile, and therefore a change in the
line amplitude effectively changes the measured position of the lines,
affecting the stability of the wavelength scale of the instrument. We deduce
and apply the correcting functions to re-calibrate and mitigate this effect,
reducing it to a level consistent with photon noise.

Hurricane Katrina improved the eight-year survival rate of elderly and disabled
residents of New Orleans by 3% and that most of this decline in mortality was
due to declines in mortality among those who moved to places with lower
mortality. In this article, I provide a critical assessment of the evidence
provided by DM to support their conclusions. There are three main problems.
First, DM generally fail to account for the fact that people of different ages,
races or sex will have different probabilities of dying as time goes by, and
when they do allow for this, results change markedly. Second, DM do not account
for the fact that residents in New Orleans are likely to be selected
non-randomly on the basis of health because of the relatively high mortality
rate in New Orleans compared to the rest of the country. Third, there is
considerable evidence that among those who moved from New Orleans, the
destination chosen was non-random. Finally, DM never directly assessed changes
in mortality of those who moved, or stayed, in New Orleans before and after
Hurricane Katrina. These problems lead me to conclude that the evidence

Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow

in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can
successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under
outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow
through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the
energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large
distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial

quantum properties such as population inversion and electron transfer in
molecular photo-systems composed of fulleroisoxazoline, fulleropyrrolidine,
BODIPY and Zn-porphyrin, as well as their system-solvent ultrafast dynamics.
The molecular complexes are modelled as two- and three-site systems, and we use
the density functional theory (DFT) for obtaining the site energies required in
the construction of the open system diabatic Hamiltonians relevant to the
computation of the electron transfer. The site energies and electronic
couplings are calculated by using a continuous polarizable model that allow for
the analysis of different solvent environments, and the site-to-site couplings
are computed by means of the generalized Mulliken Hush method at the DFT level.
We find that the stabilization energy of the charge transfer states exhibit a
significant variation for a compound embedded in different polar environments,
and thus the effect due to the solvent has been analyzed for the specific cases
of Methanol, THF and Toluene. We show that the incorporation of a molecular
bridge generates the creation of an intermediate state that plays a crucial
role in the charge transfer process by defining $\Lambda$ or cascaded-type
energy schemes; this affects the asymptotic value of the transfer rate and
favors the cascaded-type configuration.

treatments. In particular, the translational diffusion in the RC systems is
surprisingly close to the free (single RC) diffusion, mainly due to a
cancellation of crowding and size compression effects. We show that an
effective monodisperse pair potential can be constructed that describes the
many-body correlations reasonably well by convoluting the RC pair potential
with the density-dependent emergent size distributions and using a mean
effective diffusion constant.

and reducing the mean-free-path of phonons across the spectrum. In nanoporous
Si materials, for example, boundary scattering reduces thermal conductivity
drastically. In this work, we identify an unusual anticorrelated specular
phonon scattering effect which can result in additional reductions in thermal
conductivity of up to ~ 80% for specific nanoporous geometries. We further find
evidence that this effect has its origin in heat trapping between large pores
with narrow necks. As the heat becomes trapped between the pores, phonons
undergo multiple specular reflections such that their contribution to the
thermal conductivity is partly undone. We find this effect to be wave-vector
dependent at low temperatures. We use large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations, wave packet analysis, as well as an analytical model to illustrate
the anticorrelation effect, evaluate its impact on thermal conductivity, and
detail how it can be controlled to manipulate phonon transport in nanoporous
materials.

value notation in Mesopotamia? This chapter examines a group of five tablets
containing tables for surfaces of squares and rectangles dated to the Early
Dynastic period (ca. 2600-2350 BCE) and unearthed in southern Mesopotamia. In
order to capture the methods used by ancient scribes to quantify surfaces,
special attention is paid to the layout and organization of the tables, as well
as to the way in which measurement values are written down. It is argued that
these methods vary according to the dimensions of the squares or rectangles
concerned: the quantification of small surfaces does not use the same
mathematical tools as the quantification of large parcels of land. The chapter
shows a reciprocal influence between the metrological systems adopted by the
ancient scribes and the methods of calculation of surface they implemented.
Some methods may reflect ancient land-surveying practices, and others may
testify the emergence of new mathematical concepts applied to all kinds of
surfaces, large or small. Ultimately, several different conceptualizations of
the notion of surface emerge from the examination of these tables.

depth reaching S/N ~ 10 for extended objects up to $i_{AB}\sim 23.0$, and
top-of-the-atmosphere photometric uniformity $< 3$ mmag. Compared to DR1,
photometric residuals with respect to Gaia are reduced by $50\%$, and
per-object chromatic corrections are introduced. Y3 Gold augments DES DR1 with
simultaneous fits to multi-epoch photometry for more robust galaxy color
measurements and corresponding photometric redshift estimates. Y3 Gold features
improved morphological star-galaxy classification with efficiency $>98\%$ and
purity $>99\%$ for galaxies with $19 < i_{AB} < 22.5$. Additionally, it
includes per-object quality information, and accompanying maps of the footprint
coverage, masked regions, imaging depth, survey conditions, and astrophysical

cosmological data set to appear inconsistent when analyzed assuming
$\Lambda$CDM. We present an application of internal consistency tests to
measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) joint probes analysis.
Our analysis relies on computing the posterior predictive distribution (PPD)
for these data under the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the DES Y1
data have an acceptable goodness of fit to $\Lambda$CDM, with a probability of
finding a worse fit by random chance of ${p = 0.046}$. Using numerical PPD
tests, supplemented by graphical checks, we show that most of the data vector
appears completely consistent with expectations, although we observe a small
tension between large- and small-scale measurements. A small part (roughly
1.5%) of the data vector shows an unusually large departure from expectations;
excluding this part of the data has negligible impact on cosmological
constraints, but does significantly improve the $p$-value to 0.10. The
methodology developed here will be applied to test the consistency of DES Year
3 joint probes data sets.

combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing by optimizing the
lens galaxy sample selection using information from Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Year 3 data and assuming the DES Year 1 Metacalibration sample for the sources.
We explore easily reproducible selections based on magnitude cuts in $i$-band
as a function of (photometric) redshift, $z_{\rm phot}$, and benchmark the
potential gains against those using the well established redMaGiC sample. We
focus on the balance between density and photometric redshift accuracy, while
marginalizing over a realistic set of cosmological and systematic parameters.
Our optimal selection, the MagLim sample, satisfies $i < 4 \, z_{\rm phot} +
18$ and has $\sim 30\%$ wider redshift distributions but $\sim 3.5$ times more
galaxies than redMaGiC. Assuming a wCDM model and equivalent scale cuts to
mitigate nonlinear effects, this leads to $40\%$ increase in the figure of
merit for the pair combinations of $\Omega_m$, $w$, and $\sigma_8$, and gains
of $16\%$ in $\sigma_8$, $10\%$ in $\Omega_m$, and $12\%$ in $w$. Similarly, in
LCDM we find an improvement of $19\%$ and $27\%$ on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$,
respectively. We also explore flux-limited samples with a flat magnitude cut
finding that the optimal selection, $i < 22.2$, has $\sim 7$ times more
galaxies and $\sim 20\%$ wider redshift distributions compared to MagLim, but
slightly worse constraints. We show that our results are robust with respect to
the assumed galaxy bias and photometric redshift uncertainties with only
moderate further gains from increased number of tomographic bins or the
inclusion of bin cross-correlations, except in the case of the flux-limited
sample, for which these gains are more significant.

planets and stars. The choice of thermal boundary conditions in such models is
not always straightforward. To understand the implications of this choice, we
report on the effects of the thermal boundary condition on thermal convection,
in terms of instability onset, fully developed transport properties and flow
structure. We use the Boussinesq approximation, and impose a Robin boundary
condition at the top. This enforces the temperature anomaly and its radial
derivative to be linearly coupled with a proportionality factor $\beta$. Using
the height H of the fluid layer, we introduce the non-dimensional Biot number
Bi* = $\beta$H. Varying Bi* allows us to transition from fixed temperature for
Bi* = +$\infty$, to fixed thermal flux for Bi* = 0. The bottom boundary of the
shell is kept isothermal. We find that the onset of convection is only affected
by Bi* in the non-rotating case. Far from onset, considering an effective
Rayleigh number and a generalized Nusselt number, we show that the Nusselt and
P{\'e}clet numbers follow standard universal scaling laws, independent of Bi*
in all cases considered. However, the large-scale flow structure keeps the
signature of the boundary condition with more vigorous large scales for smaller
Bi* , even though the global heat transfer and kinetic energy are the same.
Finally, for all practical purposes, the Robin condition can be safely replaced
by a fixed flux when Bi* < 0.03 and by a fixed temperature for Bi* > 30.

from real-world audio recordings, featuring multi-tone ENF harmonic enhancement
and graph-based optimal harmonic selection. Specifically, We first extend the
recently developed single-tone ENF signal enhancement method to the multi-tone
scenario and propose a harmonic robust filtering algorithm (HRFA). It can
respectively enhance each harmonic component without cross-component
interference, thus further alleviating the effects of unwanted noise and audio
content on the much weaker ENF signal. In addition, considering the fact that
some harmonic components could be severely corrupted even after enhancement,
disturbing rather than facilitating ENF estimation, we propose a graph-based
harmonic selection algorithm (GHSA), which finds the optimal combination of
harmonic components for more accurate ENF estimation. Noticeably, the harmonic
selection problem is equivalently formulated as a maximum weight clique (MWC)
problem in graph theory, and the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm (BKA) is adopted in
the GHSA. With the enhanced and optimally selected harmonic components, both
the existing maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and weighted MLE (WMLE) are
incorporated to yield the final ENF estimation results. The proposed framework
is extensively evaluated using both synthetic signals and our ENF-WHU dataset
consisting of $130$ real-world audio recordings, demonstrating substantially
improved capability of extracting the ENF from realistically noisy observations

improves the applicability of the ENF as a forensic criterion in real-world

HPVs can be detected in cancer samples, their relative contribution remains

session-based recommendation algorithms and trivial extensions thereof. Our
comparison, to some surprise, revealed that (i) item simple techniques based on
nearest neighbors consistently outperform recent neural techniques and that
(ii) session-aware models were mostly not better than approaches that do not
use long-term preference information. Our work therefore not only points to
potential methodological issues where new methods are compared to weak
baselines, but also indicates that there remains a huge potential for more
sophisticated session-aware recommendation algorithms.

acoustic sensor networks (ASNs) using a promising, learning-based technique
that adapts to the acoustic environment. In particular, we look at the scenario
when a node in the ASN is displaced from its position during training. As the
mismatch between the ASN used for learning the localization model and the one
after a node displacement leads to erroneous position estimates, a displacement
has to be detected and the displaced nodes need to be identified. We propose a
method that considers the disparity in position estimates made by
leave-one-node-out (LONO) sub-networks and uses a Markov random field (MRF)
framework to infer the probability of each LONO position estimate being
aligned, misaligned or unreliable while accounting for the noise inherent to
the estimator. This probabilistic approach is advantageous over naive detection
methods, as it outputs a normalized value that encapsulates conditional
information provided by each LONO sub-network on whether the reading is in
misalignment with the overall network. Experimental results confirm that the
performance of the proposed method is consistent in identifying compromised

structure. An associated tail structure is also observed in the HI and
H$\alpha$ emission distributions. Previous dynamical modeling showed that the
galaxy is approaching the cluster center and is therefore undergoing increasing
ram pressure stripping. Recent stellar population fitting of deep optical
spectra together with multiband photometry lead to the determination of the
time when star formation was quenched in the galactic disk. We introduce a new
version of the dynamical model that includes the diffuse ionized gas and aim to
reproduce the HI, H$\alpha$, UV distributions together with the star formation
histories of the outer gas-free parts of the galactic disk. The results of 50
simulations with five different Lorentzian temporal ram-pressure profiles and
five different delays between the simulation onset and peak ram pressure are
presented. The inclusion of diffuse gas stripping changes significantly the HI,
UV, and H$\alpha$ emission distributions. The simulations with diffuse gas
stripping naturally lead to vertical low surface density filaments in the
downwind region of the galactic disk. These filaments occur less frequently in
the simulations without diffuse gas stripping. The simulations with diffuse gas
stripping lead to better joint fits to the SEDs and optical spectra. The HI,
NUV, and H$\alpha$ morphologies of the model snapshots which best reproduce the
SEDs and optical spectra are sufficiently different to permit a selection of
best-fit models. We conclude that the inclusion of diffuse gas stripping
significantly improves the resemblance between the model and observations. Our
preferred model yields a time to peak ram pressure of 140 Myr in the future.
The spatial coincidence of the radio continuum and diffuse H$\alpha$ tails
suggests that both gas phases are stripped together.

modes, commonly known as -pinch modes-. These involve the oscillation of only a
couple of adjacent cavity cells that are relatively insensitive to

can help developers to focus on fixing probable buggy files rather than
searching the entire source code repository. While existing research uses
information retrieval (IR) and/or combination of machine learning (ML) or deep
learning (DL) approaches, they focus primarily on benchmark Java projects, and
also motivate the need for multi-language bug localization approach. Objective:
To create a novel bug localization approach that leverages the syntactic
structure of source code, bug report information and which can support
multi-language projects along with a new dataset of C projects. Method: The
proposed DRAST approach represents source code as code vectors by using its
high-level AST and combines rVSM, an IR technique with ML/DL models such as
Random Forest and Deep Neural Network regressor to rank the list of buggy
files. We also use features such as textual similarity using IR techniques,
lexical mismatch using DNNs, and history of the project using the metadata of
BugC dataset. Results: We tested DRAST on seven projects from the BugC dataset,
which consists of 2462 bug reports from 21 open-source C projects. The results
show that DRAST can locate correct buggy files 90% of the time from top 1, 5,
and 10 suggested files with MAP and MRR scores of above 90% for the randomly
selected seven projects. We also tested DRAST on Tomcat and AspectJ, projects
from benchmark dataset with better results at accuracy@1, MAP and MRR when
compared with state-of-the-art. Conclusions: This paper presents a novel bug
localization approach that works on C and Java projects and a bug localization
C dataset along with a novel source code representation. The results for C
projects using DRAST are promising and could motivate researchers/practitioners
to focus on developing and creating multi-language bug localization approaches.

the statistical structure of the environment in which an organism lives. We
apply biologically based constraints on elements of the model.
  The thesis begins by surveying the relevant literature from the fields of
neurobiology, theoretical neuroscience, and machine learning. After this review
we present our main theoretical and algorithmic developments: we propose a
class of probabilistic models, which we refer to as ""energy-based models"", and
show equivalences between this framework and various other types of
probabilistic model such as Markov random fields and factor graphs; we also
develop and discuss approximate algorithms for performing maximum likelihood
learning and inference in our energy based models. The rest of the thesis is

performing constrained optimisation of model parameters to maximise the

performance of complex bandstructure thermoelectric materials. Half-Heuslers
are good candidates for band convergence studies because they have multiple
bands near the valence bad edge that can be converged through various band
engineering approaches providing power factor improvement opportunities.
Theoretical calculations to identify the outcome of band convergence employ
various approximations for the carrier scattering relaxation times (the most
common being the constant relaxation time approximation) due to the high
computational complexity involved in extracting them accurately. Here, we
compare the outcome of strain-induced band convergence under two such
scattering scenarios: i) the most commonly used constant relaxation time
approximation and ii) energy dependent inter- and intra-valley scattering
considerations for the half-Heuslers NbCoSn and TiCoSb. We show that the
outcome of band convergence on the power factor depends on the carrier
scattering assumptions, as well as the temperature. For both materials
examined, band convergence improves the power factor. For NbCoSn, however, band
convergence becomes more beneficial as temperature increases, under both
scattering relaxation time assumptions. In the case of TiCoSb, on the other
hand, constant relaxation time considerations also indicate that the relative
power factor improvement increases with temperature, but under the energy
dependent scattering time considerations, the relative improvement weakens with
temperature. This indicates that the scattering details need to be accurately
considered in band convergence studies to predict more accurate trends.

that is maintained within a narrow range of values. Here we consider
homeostasis as a phenomenon of network dynamics. In this context, we improve a
general theory for the analysis of homeostasis in network dynamical systems
with distinguished input and output nodes, called `input-output networks'. The
theory allows one to define `homeostasis types' of a given network in a `model
independent' fashion, in the sense that the classification depends on the
network topology rather than on the specific model equations. Each `homeostasis
type' represents a possible mechanism for generating homeostasis and is
associated with a suitable `subnetwork motif' of the original network. Our
contribution is an extension of the theory to the case of networks with
multiple input nodes. To showcase our theory, we apply it to bacterial
chemotaxis, a paradigm for homeostasis in biochemical systems. By considering a
representative model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis, we verify that the
corresponding abstract network has multiple input nodes. Thus showing that our
extension of the theory allows for the inclusion of an important class of
models that were previously out of reach. Moreover, from our abstract point of
view, the occurrence of homeostasis in the studied model is caused by a new
mechanism, called input counterweight homeostasis. This new homeostasis
mechanism was discovered in the course of our investigation and is generated by
a balancing between the several input nodes of the network -- therefore, it
requires the existence of at least two input nodes to occur. Finally, the
framework developed here allows one to formalize a notion of `robustness' of
homeostasis based on the concept of `genericity' from the theory dynamical
systems. We discuss how this kind of robustness of homeostasis appears in the
chemotaxis model.

  disease","26 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Access",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that
progressively destroys memory and other cognitive domains of the brain. While
effective therapeutic management of AD is still in development, it seems
reasonable to expect their prospective outcomes to depend on the severity of
baseline pathology. For this reason, substantial research efforts have been
invested in the development of effective means of non-invasive diagnosis of AD
at its earliest possible stages. In pursuit of the same objective, the present
paper addresses the problem of the quantitative diagnosis of AD by means of
Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI). In particular, the paper
introduces the notion of a pathology specific imaging contrast (PSIC), which,
in addition to supplying a valuable diagnostic score, can serve as a means of
visual representation of the spatial extent of neurodegeneration. The values of
PSIC are computed by a dedicated deep neural network (DNN), which has been
specially adapted to the processing of dMRI signals. Once available, such
values can be used for several important purposes, including stratification of
study subjects. In particular, experiments confirm the DNN-based classification
can outperform a wide range of alternative approaches in application to the
basic problem of stratification of cognitively normal (CN) and AD subjects.
Notwithstanding its preliminary nature, this result suggests a strong rationale
for further extension and improvement of the explorative methodology described
in this paper.

compare the results from our vector assortativity measure and averaged scalar
assortativity in the Indian context, relying on NSSO 68th round on employment

into natural and expressive speech. In this paper, we propose to use the text
embeddings of the neighboring sentences to improve the prosody generation for
each utterance of a paragraph in an end-to-end fashion without using any
explicit prosody features. More specifically, cross-utterance (CU) context
vectors, which are produced by an additional CU encoder based on the sentence
embeddings extracted by a pre-trained BERT model, are used to augment the input
of the Tacotron2 decoder. Two types of BERT embeddings are investigated, which
leads to the use of different CU encoder structures. Experimental results on a
Mandarin audiobook dataset and the LJ-Speech English audiobook dataset
demonstrate the use of CU information can improve the naturalness and
expressiveness of the synthesized speech. Subjective listening testing shows
most of the participants prefer the voice generated using the CU encoder over
that generated using standard Tacotron2. It is also found that the prosody can
be controlled indirectly by changing the neighbouring sentences.

alerts rely on live analytics of video from surveillance cameras in public
spaces. However, a growing number of government regulations stipulate how data
collected from these cameras must be handled in order to protect citizens'
privacy. This paper describes Amadeus, which balances privacy and utility by
redacting video in near realtime for smart-city applications. Our main insight
is that whitelisting objects, or blocking by default, is crucial for scalable,
privacy-preserving video analytics. In the context of modern object detectors,
we prove that whitelisting reduces the risk of an object-detection error
leading to a privacy violation, and helps Amadeus scale to a large and diverse
set of applications. In particular, Amadeus utilizes whitelisting to generate
composable encrypted object-specific live streams, which simultaneously meet
the requirements of multiple applications in a privacy-preserving fashion,
while reducing the compute and streaming-bandwidth requirements at the edge.
Experiments with our Amadeus prototype show that compared to blacklisting
objects, whitelisting yields significantly better privacy (up to ~28x) and
bandwidth savings (up to ~5.5x). Additionally, our experiments also indicate
that the composable live streams generated by Amadeus are usable by real-world
applications with minimum utility loss.

evolutionary systems, from games to economies. They however suffer from high

representation of the solutions. Recent developments such as GPU, parallel and

approaches in representation strategies, may be keys to overcome those

interaction with the crystal ions, leading to the formation of a quasiparticle:
the polaron. Such polarons are often described using the Fr\""ohlich
Hamiltonian, which assumes the underlying lattice phonons to be harmonic.
However, this approximation is invalid in several interesting materials,
including the recently discovered high-pressure hydrides which superconduct at
temperatures above $200$K. In this paper, we show that Fr\""ohlich theory can be
extended to eliminate this problem. We derive four additional terms in the
Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian to account for anharmonicity up to third order. We
calculate the energy and effective mass of the new polaron, using both
perturbation theory and Feynman's path integral formalism. It is shown that the
anharmonic terms lead to significant additional trapping of the electron. The
derived Hamiltonian is well-suited for analytical calculations, due to its
simplicity and since the number of model parameters is low. Since it is a
direct extension of the Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian, it can readily be used to
investigate the effect of anharmonicity on other polaron properties, such as
the optical conductivity and the formation of bipolarons.

algorithm for predicting NOx emissions from natural gas electrical generation
turbines. The process of producing electricity is dynamic and rapidly changing
due to many factors such as weather and electrical grid requirements. Gas
turbine equipment are also a dynamic part of the electricity generation since
the equipment characteristics and thermodynamics behavior change as the
turbines age. Regular maintenance of turbines are also another dynamic part of
the electrical generation process, affecting the performance of equipment. This
analysis discovered using KNN, trained on relatively small dataset produces the
most accurate prediction rates. This statement can be logically explained as
KNN finds the K nearest neighbor to the current input parameters and estimates
a rated average of historically similar observations as prediction.
  This paper incorporates ambient weather conditions, electrical output as well
as turbine performance factors to build a machine learning model to predict NOx
emissions. The model can be used to optimize the operational processes for
reduction in harmful emissions and increasing overall operational efficiency.
Latent algorithms such as Principle Component Algorithms (PCA) have been used
for monitoring the equipment performance behavior change which deeply
influences process paraments and consequently determines NOx emissions. Typical
statistical methods of machine learning performance evaluations such as
multivariate analysis, clustering and residual analysis have been used
throughout the paper.

works have found that these networks systematically fail to recognise new

not 'architecturally invariant' to translation, they can indeed 'learn' to be
invariant to translation. We verified that this can be achieved by pretraining
on ImageNet, and we found that it is also possible with much simpler datasets
in which the items are fully translated across the input canvas. We
investigated how this pretraining affected the internal network
representations, finding that the invariance was almost always acquired, even
though it was some times disrupted by further training due to catastrophic
forgetting/interference. These experiments show how pretraining a network on an
environment with the right 'latent' characteristics (a more naturalistic
environment) can result in the network learning deep perceptual rules which
would dramatically improve subsequent generalization.

undertook were dependent on the type of mechanism used to provide the movement.
The first concept was to provide the movement with the help of Pneumatics. The
idea of pneumatics did provide a feasible movement but I had to overcome the
barrier of the weight as the weight of either the storage of gas or the air
compressor would have affected the usage evidently. Similarly, in the second
concept, I dealt with the forces of Hydraulics. The forces exerted by
hydraulics, not only restricted the movement, but also annexed a certain amount
of delay in the time period in which the movement had to be done. In, the third
concept, I tried to provide the necessary movement with the help of Servo
Motors. The results achieved with servo motors in replacement of pneumatics and
hydraulics were impeccable. The motors not only provided the movement with
minimal lag but also did not impede the movement of the hand.
