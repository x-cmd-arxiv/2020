  presented. The version to appear in ApJL",,"10.3847/2041-8213/abd628",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, one fast radio burst, FRB 200428, was detected from the Galactic
magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars
can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR
J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason for such rarity of
FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly
beamed than the SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is correct, one
would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angles somewhat outside the
narrow emission beam. These ""slow"" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader
widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. We
derive two ""closure relations"" to judge whether a long, less luminous radio
burst could be an SRB. The 2.2-s, 308 Jy ms, 111 MHz radio burst detected from
SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB. The 2-ms, 60
mJy ms faint burst detected by FAST from the same source could be also an SRB
if the corresponding FRB has a narrow spectrum. If the FRB beam is narrow,
there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. The lack of
detection of abundant SRBs from magnetars would disfavor the hypothesis that
all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.

curvature bounded in $L^p$, $p>m$, are regular almost everywhere in every
dimension and codimension. This provides partial or full answers to multiple
open questions arising in the literature. The anisotropic energy is required to
satisfy a novel ellipticity condition, which holds for instance in a $C^2$
neighborhood of the area functional. This condition is proved to imply the
atomic condition. In particular we provide the first non-trivial class of
examples of anisotropic energies in high codimension satisfying the atomic
condition, addressing an open question in the field. As a byproduct, we deduce
the rectifiability of varifolds (resp. of the mass of varifolds) with locally
bounded anisotropic first variation for a $C^2$ (resp. $C^1$) neighborhood of
the area functional. In addition to these examples, we also provide a class of
anisotropic energies in high codimension, far from the area functional, for
which the rectifiability of the mass of varifolds with locally bounded
anisotropic first variation holds. To conclude, we show that the atomic
condition excludes non-trivial Young measures in the case of anisotropic
stationary graphs.

investigate when this quantity is well defined. For stationary spacetimes, this
quantity is known to exactly equal the physical (ADM) mass. However, it remains
an open question whether these two masses are equal in the absence of a
timelike Killing vector. This is especially apropos since our universe has an
`origin' and hence no such Killing vector. Further, if these masses failed to
agree then composite systems could behave as if they had a `dark component,'
whose gravitating mass would not equal the physical mass-energy present. The
existence of such an apparent discrepancy is indeed ubiquitous in galaxies and
galaxy clusters, though currently it is attributed to the presence of dark
matter. We conclude that the theoretical question of the relation between these
masses for dynamical spacetimes is ripe for attention.

diagram, we found 91 HII, 17 composite, and 7 active galactic nucleus-like
regions in SQ. Several regions are compatible with fast shocks models without a
precursor for solar metallicity and low density (n=0.1 cm$^{-3}$), with
velocities between 175 - 300 km s$^{-1}$. We derived the total SFR in SQ
(log(SFR/M$_\odot\,yr^{-1}$=0.496); starburst A and B provide 28% and 9% of the
total SFR, and 45% comes from the regions with a radial velocity lower than
6160 km s$^{-1}$. For this reason, we assume that the material prior to the
collision with the new intruder (NI) does not show a high SFR, and therefore SQ
was apparently quenched. When considering the integrated SFR for the whole SQ
and the NI, we found that both zones have a SFR consistent with those obtained
in the SDSS star-forming galaxies. At least two chemically different gas
components cohabit in SQ where, on average, the regions with high radial
velocities (v$>$6160 km s$^{-1}$) have lower values of O/H and N/O than those
with low radial velocities (v$\leq$6160 km s$^{-1}$). The values found for the
line ratios, O/H, and N/O for the southern debris region and the northernmost
tidal tail, are compatible with regions belonging to the outer part of the
galaxies. We highlight the presence of inner-outer variation for O/H and some
emission line ratios along the NI strands and the young tidal tail south
strand. Finally, the SQ H$\alpha$ regions are outside the galaxies because the
interactions have dispersed the gas to the peripheral zones.

secondary gravitational waves (GWs) due to enhanced scalar power on small
scales have garnered considerable attention in the literature. Often, the
mechanism considered to arrive at such enhanced power involves a modification
of the standard slow roll inflationary dynamics, achieved with the aid of
fine-tuned potentials. In this work, we investigate another well known method
to generate features in the power spectrum wherein the initial state of the
perturbations is assumed to be squeezed states. This approach is technically
straightforward to implement since the Bogoliubov coefficients characterizing
the squeezed initial states, can be immediately determined from the desired
form of the power spectrum. It is known that, for squeezed initial states, the
scalar bispectrum is strongly scale dependent and the consistency condition
governing the scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit is violated. In fact, the
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ characterizing the scalar bispectrum
proves to be inversely proportional to the squeezed mode and this dependence
enhances its amplitude at large wave numbers making it highly sensitive to even
a small deviation from the standard Bunch-Davies vacuum. These aspects can
possibly aid in leading to enhanced formation of PBHs and generation of
secondary GWs. However, we find that: (i) the desired form of the squeezed
initial states may be challenging to achieve from a dynamical mechanism, and
(ii) the backreaction due to the excited states severely limits the extent of
deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum at large wave numbers. We argue that,
unless the issue of backreaction is circumvented, squeezed initial states
cannot lead to a substantial increase in power on small scales that is required
for enhanced formation of PBHs and generation of secondary GWs.

Firstly, the design of day-ahead solar radiation predictors is investigated
with different setups of time series models, and with their combinations with
the weather forecast services using ensemble methods. Support Vector Machine
methods are also adopted in this stage, to cluster data. Secondly, under a
similar ensemble framework, the generated power prediction is investigated. The
whole generated power and solar radiation prediction tasks are then implemented
on a low-cost, embedded mini PC module Raspberry Pi 3. As an application, the

decomposition strategy for online vehicle routing. In this framework,
assignments are done in batches in order to exploit any shareability among
vehicles and incoming travel requests. We study a natural ILP formulation and
its LP relaxation. Our main result is an LP-based randomized rounding algorithm
that, whenever the instance is feasible, leverages mild assumptions to return
an assignment whose: i) expected cost is at most that of an optimal solution,
and ii) expected fraction of unassigned requests is at most $1/e$. If
trip-vehicle assignment costs are $\alpha$-approximate, we pay an additional
factor of $\alpha$ in the expected cost. We can relax the feasibility
requirement by considering the penalty version of the problem, in which a
penalty is paid for each unassigned request. We find that, whenever a request
is repeatedly unassigned after a number of rounds, with high probability it is
so in accordance with the sequence of LP solutions and not because of a
rounding error. We additionally introduce a deterministic rounding heuristic
inspired by our randomized technique. Our computational experiments show that
our rounding algorithms achieve a performance similar to that of the ILP at a
reduced computation time, far improving on our theoretical guarantee. The
reason for this is that, although the assignment problem is hard in theory, the
natural LP relaxation tends to be very tight in practice.

suboptimal and prone to errors. Recently, it was shown that the increments

the principle of maximum likelihood. Taking advantage of an efficient
real-space formulation, we extend the model to mixtures of subpopulations
differing in their diffusion coefficients, which we estimate with the help of
the expectation-maximization algorithm. This formulation naturally leads to a
probabilistic assignment of trajectories to subpopulations. We employ the
theory to analyze experimental tracking data that cannot be explained with a
single diffusion coefficient. We test how well a dataset conforms to the
assumptions of a diffusion model and determine the optimal number of
subpopulations with the help of a quality factor of known analytical
distribution. To facilitate use by practitioners, we provide a fast open-source
implementation of the theory for the efficient analysis of multiple
trajectories in arbitrary dimensions simultaneously.

additional powerful probe helping to resolve the puzzle of the electric

a reversed photoeffect. Namely, at sufficiently high bias voltages the current
through the dielectric film decreases as the light intensity increases.
Moreover, higher photon energies correlate with stronger decreases of the

potential neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidate, GW190426_152155.
Together with GW190814, these two events belong to a class of binaries with a
secondary mass less than $3 \, M_{\odot}$. While the secondary system in
GW190426_152155 is consistent with being a neutron star with a mass of
$1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.5} \, M_{\odot}$, that of GW190814 is a $2.59^{+0.08}_{-0.09}
\, M_{\odot}$ object and counts as the first confirmed detection of a mass-gap
object. Here we argue that these two events could have a common origin as
follows: both are formed as NSBH systems; however, the larger escape velocity
of a system with more massive primary BH increases the bound fraction of the
ejecta material from the supernova explosion leading to the formation of a NS.
This bound material forms a disk, which is preferentially accreted onto the NS.
This scenario predicts the secondary component mass should correlate with the
primary component mass, which is consistent with GW190426_152155 and GW190814.
If this hypothesis is corroborated by upcoming observations, GW190814-like
events can be excluded from the binary black hole population when inferring
their global characteristics.

$^{26}$Al in the Galaxy and typical star-forming environments to estimate the
likelihood of $^{26}$Al enrichment during planet formation. I do not assume
Solar-System-specific constraints as I am interested in enrichment for
exoplanets generally. Observations indicate that high-mass stars dominate the
production of $^{26}$Al with nearly equal contributions from their winds and
supernovae. $^{26}$Al abundances are comparable to those in the early Solar
System in the high-mass star-forming regions where most stars (and thereby most
planets) form. These high abundances appear to be maintained for a few Myr,
much longer than the 0.7 Myr half-life. Observed bulk $^{26}$Al velocities are
an order of magnitude slower than expected from winds and supernovae. These
observations are at odds with typical model assumptions that $^{26}$Al is
provided instantaneously by high velocity mass loss from supernovae and winds.
Regular replenishment of $^{26}$Al especially when coupled with the small age
differences that are common in high-mass star-forming complexes, may
significantly increase the number of star/planet-forming systems exposed to
$^{26}$Al. Exposure does not imply enrichment, but the order of magnitude
slower velocity of $^{26}$Al may alter the fraction that is incorporated into
planet-forming material. Together, this suggests that the conditions for rocky
planet formation are not rare, nor are they ubiquitous, as small regions like
Taurus that lack high-mass stars to produce $^{26}$Al may be less likely to
form rocky planets. I conclude with suggested directions for future studies.

appropriate node for onward transport of the freight package. This paper
evolved the state of research concept as an artifact that considers the
$\pi$-nodes as routers in a way that it distributes and replicates real-time
data to the $\pi$-nodes in order to enable more effective routing decisions.
This real-time data is provided by vehicles, or so-called $\pi$-transporters,
on the road. Therefore, a second artifact will be designed in which
$\pi$-transporters take over the routing role. In order to be able to take a
holistic perspective on the routing topic, the goods that are actually to be
moved, the so-called $\pi$-containers, are also designed as routing entities in
a third artifact. These three artifacts are then compared and evaluated for the
consideration of real-time traffic data. This paper proposes $\pi$-transporters
as routing entities whose software representatives negotiate freight handover
points in a cloud-based marketplace.

to a minority of contaminated data. Robust list-decodable learning focuses on
the more challenging regime where only a minority $\frac 1 k$ fraction of the
dataset is drawn from the distribution of interest, and no assumptions are made
on the remaining data. We study the fundamental task of list-decodable mean
estimation in high dimensions. Our main result is a new list-decodable mean
estimation algorithm for bounded covariance distributions with optimal sample
complexity and error rate, running in nearly-PCA time. Assuming the ground
truth distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ has bounded covariance, our algorithm
outputs a list of $O(k)$ candidate means, one of which is within distance
$O(\sqrt{k})$ from the truth. Our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde{O}(ndk)$
for all $k = O(\sqrt{d}) \cup \Omega(d)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset.
We also show that a variant of our algorithm has runtime $\widetilde{O}(ndk)$
for all $k$, at the expense of an $O(\sqrt{\log k})$ factor in the recovery
guarantee. This runtime matches up to logarithmic factors the cost of
performing a single $k$-PCA on the data, which is a natural bottleneck of known
algorithms for (very) special cases of our problem, such as clustering
well-separated mixtures. Prior to our work, the fastest list-decodable mean
estimation algorithms had runtimes $\widetilde{O}(n^2 d k^2)$ and
$\widetilde{O}(nd k^{\ge 6})$.
  Our approach builds on a novel soft downweighting method, $\mathsf{SIFT}$,
which is arguably the simplest known polynomial-time mean estimation technique
in the list-decodable learning setting. To develop our fast algorithms, we
boost the computational cost of $\mathsf{SIFT}$ via a careful ""win-win-win""
analysis of an approximate Ky Fan matrix multiplicative weights procedure we
develop, which we believe may be of independent interest.

both regression and classification methods, for designing this 3D detection

patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions.
These unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by
adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in CPES by compromising hundreds
of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This paper presents a
feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the

dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs). Using ALMA Band-6 observations of two Hot
DOGs, we have detected H2O(2_02-1_11) in W0149+2350, and H2O(3_12-3_03) and the
multiplet OH+(1_1-0_1) in W0410-0913. We find that both sources have luminous
H2O emission with line luminosities of L_H2O > 2.2x10^8 Lsol and L_H2O =
8.7x10^8 Lsol for W0149+2350 and W0410-0913, respectively. The H2O line
profiles are similar to those seen for the neighbouring CO(9-8) line, with
linewidths of FWHM ~ 800-1000 km/s. However, the H2O emission seems to be more
compact than the CO(9-8). OH+ is detected in emission for W0410-0913, with a
FWHM=1000km/s and a line luminosity of L_OH+ = 6.92x10^8 Lsol. The ratio of the
observed H2O line luminosity over the IR luminosity, for both Hot DOGs, is
consistent with previously observed star forming galaxies and AGN. The H2O/CO
line ratio of both Hot DOGs and the OH+/H2O line ratio of W0410-0913 are
comparable to those of luminous AGN in the literature. The bright
H2O(2_02-1_11), and H2O(3_12-3_03) emission lines are likely due to the
combined high star formation levels and luminous AGN in these sources. The
presence of OH+ in emission, and the agreement of the observed line ratios of
the Hot DOGs with luminous AGN in the literature, would suggest that the AGN
emission is dominating the radiative output of these galaxies. However,
followup multi-transition observations are needed to better constrain the
properties of these systems.

with the problem size. Solving a linear system of equations using direct
methods or most iterative methods is a typical example. Algebraic multi-grid
(AMG) methods are numerical methods used to solve large linear systems of
equations efficiently. One of the main differences between AMG methods is how
the coarser grid is constructed from a given fine grid. There are two main
classes of AMG methods; graph and aggregation based coarsening methods. Here we
propose an aggregation-based coarsening framework leveraging graph
representation learning and clustering algorithms. Our method introduces the
power of machine learning into the AMG research field and opens a new
perspective for future researches. The proposed method uses graph
representation learning techniques to learn latent features of the graph
obtained from the underlying matrix of coefficients. Using these extracted
features, we generated a coarser grid from the fine grid. The proposed method
is highly capable of parallel computations. Our experiments show that the
proposed method's efficiency in solving large systems is closely comparable
with other aggregation-based methods, demonstrating the high capability of
graph representation learning in designing multi-grid solvers.

time-varying regressors and 2) non-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees
for constant regressors. In this paper, we extend and discuss the results of
this same HT for general convex loss functions. Through the exploitation of

characterisation of 2MASS J0249-0557 c, a recently discovered young planetary
mass companion to the $\beta$ Pictoris member 2MASS J0249-0557. Methods: Using
the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Hemisphere
Survey (VHS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) data, we independently
identified the companion 2MASS J0249-0557 c. We obtained low-resolution optical
spectroscopy of this object using the Optical System for Imaging and
low-intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph at
the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and near-infrared spectroscopy using the
Son of Isaac (SofI) spectrograph on the New Technology Telescope (NTT).
Results: We classified 2MASS J0249-0557 c with a spectral type of L2.5$\pm$0.5
in the optical and L3$\pm$1 in the near-infrared. We identified spectroscopic
indicators of youth that are compatible with the age of the $\beta$ Pictoris
moving group. We also detect a strong H$\alpha$ emission, with a pEW of
-90$^{+20}_{-40}$A, which seems persistent in time. This indicates strong
chromospheric activity or disk accretion. Although many M-type brown dwarfs
have strong H$\alpha$ emission, this target is one of the very few L-type
planetary mass objects in which this strong H$\alpha$ emission has been
detected. Lithium absorption at 6708 A is observed with pEW $\lesssim$ 5A. We
also computed the binding energy of 2MASS J0249-0557 c and obtained an
(absolute) upper limit of $U=(-8.8\pm4.4) 10^{32}$ J. Conclusions: Similarly to
other young brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects, strong H$\alpha$
emission is also present in young planetary mass companions at ages of some
dozen million years. We also found that 2MASS J0249-0557 c is one of the wide
substellar companions with the lowest binding energy known to date.

light of ongoing privacy scandals, the future availability of quantum computing

quantum-limited capabilities want their data and algorithms to remain hidden,
while being able to verify that their computations are performed correctly.
Research in blind and verifiable delegation of quantum computing attempts to
address this question. However, available techniques suffer not only from high
overheads but also from over-sensitivity: When running on noisy devices,
imperfections trigger the same detection mechanisms as malicious attacks,
resulting in perpetually aborted computations. Hence, while malicious quantum
computers are rendered harmless by blind and verifiable protocols, inherent
noise severely limits their usability.
  We address this problem with an efficient, robust, blind, verifiable scheme
to delegate deterministic quantum computations with classical inputs and
outputs. We show that: 1) a malicious Server can cheat at most with an
exponentially small success probability; 2) in case of sufficiently small
noise, the protocol succeeds with a probability exponentially close to 1; 3)
the overhead is barely a polynomial number of repetitions of the initial
computation interleaved with test runs requiring the same physical resources in
terms of memory and gates; 4) the amount of tolerable noise, measured by the
probability of failing a test run, can be as high as 25% for some computations
and will be generally bounded by 12.5% when using a planar graph resource
state. The key points are that security can be provided without universal
computation graphs and that, in our setting, full fault-tolerance is not needed

challenging are systems exhibiting long-term memory. A natural question is how
learn such systems with non-asymptotic statistical rates depending on the
inherent dimensionality (order) $d$ of the system, rather than on the possibly
much larger memory length. We propose an algorithm that given a single
trajectory of length $T$ with gaussian observation noise, learns the system
with a near-optimal rate of $\widetilde O\left(\sqrt\frac{d}{T}\right)$ in
$\mathcal{H}_2$ error, with only logarithmic, rather than polynomial dependence
on memory length. We also give bounds under process noise and improved bounds
for learning a realization of the system. Our algorithm is based on multi-scale
low-rank approximation: SVD applied to Hankel matrices of geometrically
increasing sizes. Our analysis relies on careful application of concentration
bounds on the Fourier domain -- we give sharper concentration bounds for sample
covariance of correlated inputs and for $\mathcal H_\infty$ norm estimation,

can quickly count and locate the occurrences of any string (the query pattern)
in $T$ in time proportional to the query's length. The earliest optimal-time
solution to the problem, the suffix tree, dates back to 1973 and requires up to
two orders of magnitude more space than the plain text just to be stored. In
the year 2000, two breakthrough works showed that efficient queries can be
achieved without this space overhead: a fast index be stored in a space
proportional to the text's entropy. These contributions had an enormous impact
in bioinformatics: nowadays, virtually any DNA aligner employs compressed
indexes. Recent trends considered more powerful compression schemes (dictionary
compressors) and generalizations of the problem to labeled graphs: after all,
texts can be viewed as labeled directed paths. In turn, since finite state
automata can be considered as a particular case of labeled graphs, these
findings created a bridge between the fields of compressed indexing and regular
language theory, ultimately allowing to index regular languages and promising
to shed new light on problems such as regular expression matching. This survey
is a gentle introduction to the main landmarks of the fascinating journey that
took us from suffix trees to today's compressed indexes for labeled graphs and
regular languages.

development and scale up of processes in the industry. Model-based design of
experiments (MBDoE) has been widely used for the purpose of improving parameter
precision in nonlinear dynamic systems. This process needs to account for both
parametric and structural uncertainty, as the feasibility constraints imposed
on the system may well turn out to be violated leading to unsafe experimental
conditions when an optimally designed experiment is performed. In this work, a
Gaussian process is utilized in a two-fold manner: 1) to quantify the
uncertainty realization of the physical system and calculate the plant-model
mismatch, 2) to compute the optimal experimental design while accounting for
the parametric uncertainty. This method provides a guarantee for the
probabilistic satisfaction of the constraints in the context of model-based
design of experiments. The method is assisted with the use of adaptive
trust-regions in order to facilitate a satisfactory local approximation. The
proposed method is able to allow the design of optimal experiments starting
from limited preliminary knowledge of the parameter set, leading to a safe
exploration of the parameter space. The performance of this method is
demonstrated through illustrative case studies regarding the parameter
identification of the kinetic model in flow reactors.

convenience they have brought to our lives. At the same time, the increasing
security threats that rise from using mobile devices not only have caught
attention from cyber security agencies but also have become a valid concern for
mobile users. Keylogging is one of the mobile security threats caused by using
insecure third-party IME (input method editor) applications. Keylogging, as the
name suggests, keeps track of user\rq s key events performed on the device and
stores all the events in a log. The log could include highly sensitive data
such as credit card number, social security number, and passwords. This paper
presents a novel solution by intercepting the keystroke events triggered by a
user and encrypting them before sending them to the third-party IME, making the
third-party IME unable to log what the users actually entered on the screen.
Input will be decrypted when showing on text view on the underlying app. This
solution addresses the fundamental reason why an IME may leak sensitive
information since an IME will no longer have access to the user\rq s actual
sensitive information, which will greatly reduce the chance of leaking
sensitive information by using a third-party IME while maintaining the
functionalities of the third-party IME at the same time.

required mass-loss when they are engulfed in the envelope of the red giant
star. J08205+0008 was the first example of a hot subdwarf star with a close,
substellar companion candidate to be found. Here we perform an in-depth
re-analysis of this important system with much higher quality data allowing
additional analysis methods. From the higher resolution spectra obtained with
ESO-VLT/XSHOOTER we derive the chemical abundances of the hot subdwarf as well
as its rotational velocity. Using the { it Gaia} parallax and a fit to the
spectral energy distribution in the secondary eclipse, tight constraints to the
radius of the hot subdwarf are derived. From a long-term photometric campaign
we detected a significant period decrease of $-3.2(8)\cdot 10^{-12} \,\rm
dd^{-1}$. This can be explained by the non-synchronised hot subdwarf star being
spun up by tidal interactions forcing it to become synchronised. From the rate
of period decrease we could derive the synchronisation timescale to be 4 Myr,
much smaller than the lifetime on EHB. By combining all different methods we
could constrain the hot subdwarf to a mass of $0.39-0.50\,\rm M_\odot$ and a
radius of $R_{\rm sdB}=0.194\pm0.008\,\rm R_\odot$, and the companion to
$0.061-0.071\rm\,M_\odot$ with a radius of $R_{\rm comp}=0.092 \pm 0.005\,\rm

of the interfacial tension, allowing spreading under gravity. Understanding the
spreading dynamics of room temperature liquid metals is important for
developing soft electronics and understanding fluid dynamics of liquids with
extreme surface tensions. When the applied voltage or the oxidation rate
becomes too high, the EGaIn undergoes fingering instabilities, including
tip-splitting, which occur due to a Marangoni stress on the interface. Our
experiments are performed with EGaIn droplets placed in an electrolyte (sodium
hydroxide); by placing the EGaIn on copper electrodes, which EGaIn readily
wets, we are able to control the initial width of EGaIn fingers, setting the

at the EFT level and by matching to UV-complete theories. In order to assess
the consistency of the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) anomaly matching, it is useful to
introduce an auxiliary, non-dynamical gauge field associated to the PQ

fermionic matter that obtains most of its mass by coupling to the Higgs
doublets. We assess the viability of such a SM extension through electroweak
precision tests, bounds on Higgs rates and direct searches for heavy charged

matches onto an EFT where the electroweak gauge symmetry is non-linearly

a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state energy
of a Hamiltonian. The approximation to the ground state energy is obtained as
the sum of two contributions. The first contribution comes from a noncontextual
approximation to the Hamiltonian, and is computed classically. The second
contribution is obtained by using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
technique to compute a contextual correction on a quantum processor. In general
the VQE computation of the contextual correction uses fewer qubits and
measurements than the VQE computation of the original problem. Varying the
number of qubits used for the contextual correction adjusts the quality of the
approximation. We simulate CS-VQE on tapered Hamiltonians for small molecules,
and find that the number of qubits required to reach chemical accuracy can be
reduced by more than a factor of two. The number of terms required to compute
the contextual correction can be reduced by more than a factor of ten, without
the use of other measurement reduction schemes. This indicates that CS-VQE is a
promising approach for eigenvalue computations on noisy intermediate-scale
quantum devices.

influence of the scene illumination on the object colors. As such, it is an
essential part of the image processing pipelines of most digital cameras. One
of the important parts of the computational color constancy is illumination
estimation, i.e. estimating the illumination color. When an illumination
estimation method is proposed, its accuracy is usually reported by providing
the values of error metrics obtained on the images of publicly available
datasets. However, over time it has been shown that many of these datasets have
problems such as too few images, inappropriate image quality, lack of scene
diversity, absence of version tracking, violation of various assumptions, GDPR
regulation violation, lack of additional shooting procedure info, etc. In this
paper, a new illumination estimation dataset is proposed that aims to alleviate
many of the mentioned problems and to help the illumination estimation
research. It consists of 4890 images with known illumination colors as well as
with additional semantic data that can further make the learning process more
accurate. Due to the usage of the SpyderCube color target, for every image
there are two ground-truth illumination records covering different directions.
Because of that, the dataset can be used for training and testing of methods
that perform single or two-illuminant estimation. This makes it superior to
many similar existing datasets. The datasets, it's smaller version

the if-clause. Its quantum version applies an unknown $n$-qubit unitary $U\in

$control_\phi(U)=\left|0\right>\!\!\left<0\right|\otimes I + e^{i

beyond exponential in $n$: Even with any number of queries to $U$ and
$U^\dagger$, a quantum circuit with a success/fail measurement cannot implement
$control_\phi(U)$ with a nonzero probability of success for all $U\in U(2^n)$ -
not even approximately. The impossibility extends to process matrices, quantum

continuous function and uses topological arguments. Compared to the polynomial

  Our result does not contradict process tomography. We show directly why
process tomography fails at if-clause, and suggest relaxations to random
if-clause or entangled if-clause - their optimal query complexity remains open.

to model and analyze electromagnetic resonator systems. Nevertheless,
restrictive assumptions and lack of rigorous connection to Maxwell's equations
limit the TCMT formulation's generality and robustness. Herein, we present the
Black-box Coupled-Mode Theory (BBCMT), a general ab initio CMT framework
developed from Maxwell's equations and quasinormal mode (QNM) theory to model
the electromagnetic interactions of dispersive, lossy, and open resonators.
BBCMT development is enabled by employing Poynting's and conjugated reciprocity
theorems to rigorously normalize QNMs and calculate their expansion
coefficients. Our novel QNM analysis approach allows the definition of a
resonator Hamiltonian matrix to characterize the modes' electromagnetic
interactions, energy storage, and absorption. Uniquely, the BBCMT framework can
capture a resonator's non-resonant scattering and absorption by treating the
resonator scattered fields as a perturbation to those of a background
structure, which can be flexibly chosen considering the desired
accuracy-simplicity trade-off. BBCMT modeling complexity can be further
adjusted by treating user-defined subcomponents of a resonator system as
black-boxes described only by their input-output transfer characteristics.
Beyond the BBCMT formulation, we present two lemmas to reverse-engineer the
modeling parameters from calculated or measured far-field spectra. Moreover, we
introduce the signal flow graphs from control theory to illustrate, interpret,
and solve the BBCMT equations. To evince BBCMT's validity and generality, we
compare the BBCMT and TCMT predictions for two plasmonic nanoresonator systems
to finite-difference time-domain simulations and find BBCMT results to be a
much better match. BBCMT reduces to TCMT or cavity perturbation theory under
certain constraints and approximations.

  That is, let $m$ be an integer and let $M$ be an $m$-sound,
$(m,\omega_1+1)$-iterable premouse. Then (i) $M$ is $(m+1)$-solid and
$(m+1)$-universal, $(m+1)$ condensation holds for $M$, and if $m\geq 1$ then
$M$ is super-Dodd-sound, a slight strengthening of Dodd-soundness. And (ii) if
there is $x\in M$ such that $M$ is the $\mathrm{r}\Sigma_{m+1}$-hull of
parameters in $\rho_{m+1}^M\cup\{x\}$, then $M$ is a normal iterate of its
$(m+1)$-core $C=\mathfrak{C}_{m+1}(M)$; in fact, there is an $m$-maximal
iteration tree $\mathcal{T}$ on $C$, of finite length, such that
$M=M^{\mathcal{T}}_\infty$, and $i^{\mathcal{T}}_{0\infty}$ is just the core
embedding.
  Applying fact (ii), we prove that if $M\models\mathrm{ZFC}$ is a mouse and
$W\subseteq M$ is a ground of $M$ via a strategically $\sigma$-closed forcing
$\mathbb{P}\in W$, and if $M|\aleph_1^M\in W$ (that is, the initial segment of

$M\subseteq W$.

emergent higher-spin symmetry, generated by an infinite tower of currents whose
anomalous dimensions vanish exponentially in the distance. Stated
geometrically, the diameter of a non-compact conformal manifold must diverge
logarithmically in the higher-spin gap. In the holographic context our
conjectures are related to the Distance Conjecture in the swampland program.
Interpreted gravitationally, they imply that approaching infinite distance in

massless at an exponential rate that is bounded from below in Planck units. We
discuss further implications for conformal manifolds of superconformal field
theories in three and four dimensions.

triangular lattice and discuss the conducting states that are expected on
doping them. These states labeled CS1 and CS2 are associated with two distinct
topological orders with different edge states, although they both spontaneously
break time reversal symmetry and exhibit the same quantized spin Hall
conductance. While CSL1 is related to the Kalmeyer-Laughlin state, CSL2 is the
$\nu =4$ member of Kitaev's 16 fold way classification. Both states are
described within the Abrikosov fermion representation of spins, and the effect
of doping can be accessed by introducing charged holons. On doping CSL2,
condensation of charged holons leads to a topological d+id superconductor.
However on doping CSL1 , in sharp contrast , two different scenarios can arise:
first, if holons condense, a chiral metal with doubled unit cell and finite
Hall conductivity is obtained. However, in a second novel scenario, the
internal magnetic flux adjusts with doping and holons form a bosonic integer
quantum Hall (BIQH) state. Remarkably, the latter phase is identical to a
$d+id$ superconductor. In this case the Mott insulator to superconductor
transition is associated with a bosonic variant of the integer quantum Hall
plateau transition for the holon. We connect the above two scenarios to two
recent numerical studies of doped chiral spin liquids on triangular lattice.
Our work clarifies the complex relation between topological superconductors,
chiral spin liquids and quantum criticality .

the best fit is provided by an expression including the overall power level and
two characteristic frequencies, one with an exponent of 2 and one with a free
exponent taking on a value around 6. We assess the impact of the 3D hydro-code

find that the main conclusion is unchanged. However, the details of the
resulting best fits differ slightly between the two codes, but we explain this
difference by studying the effect of the spatial resolution and the duration of
the simulation on the fit. Additionally, we look into the impact of adding
white noise to the simulated time series as a simple way to mimic a real star.
We find that, as long as the noise level is not too low, the results are
consistent with the no-noise case.

first develop a proper notion of hydrodynamic transport in such a system by
constructing a global conservation law that can be attributed to the presence
of topological solitons. The correlation functions of local objects charged
under this conservation law can then be used to study the universal properties
of the dynamics at late times, applicable to both quantum and classical
systems. Performing the time evolution via classically simulable automata
circuits unveils a rich phenomenology of the system's non-equilibrium
properties: For a large class of relevant initial states, local charges are
effectively restricted to move along one-dimensional 'tubes' within the
quasi-two-dimensional system, displaying fracton-like mobility constraints. The
time scale on which these tubes are stable diverges with increasing systems
size, yielding a novel mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in the thermodynamic
limit. We further explore the role of geometry by studying the system in a
quasi-one-dimensional limit, where the Hilbert space is strongly fragmented due
to the emergence of an extensive number of conserved quantities. This provides
an instance of a recently introduced concept of 'statistically localized
integrals of motion', whose universal anomalous hydrodynamics we determine by a
mapping to a problem of classical tracer diffusion. We conclude by discussing
how our approach might generalize to study transport in other lattice gauge

branching fractions between channels as well as constraints on uncertain
physical processes that impact the observational properties of mergers. Given
our set of formation models, we find significant differences between the
branching fractions of the underlying and detectable populations, and that the
diversity of detections suggests that multiple formation channels are at play.
A mixture of channels is strongly preferred over any single channel dominating
the detected population: an individual channel does not contribute to more than
$\simeq 70\%$ of the observational sample of binary black holes. We calculate
the preference between the natal spin assumptions and common envelope
efficiencies in our models, favoring natal spins of isolated black holes of
$\lesssim 0.1$, and marginally preferring common envelope efficiencies of
$\gtrsim 2.0$ while strongly disfavoring highly inefficient common envelopes.
We show that it is essential to consider multiple channels when interpreting
gravitational wave catalogs, as inference on branching fractions and physical
prescriptions becomes biased when contributing formation scenarios are not

Precise, automated and computationally inexpensive methods to derive physical
parameters from light curves are needed to cope with the large influx of these
data from space-based missions such as Kepler and TESS. Here we present a new
methodology which we call The Swan, a fast, generalizable and effective
approach for deriving stellar surface gravity ($\log g$) for main sequence,
subgiant and red giant stars from Kepler light curves using local linear
regression on the full frequency content of Kepler long cadence power spectra.
With this inexpensive data-driven approach, we recover $\log g$ to a precision
of $\sim$0.02 dex for 13,822 stars with seismic $\log g$ values between 0.2-4.4
dex, and $\sim$0.11 dex for 4,646 stars with Gaia derived $\log g$ values
between 2.3-4.6 dex. We further develop a signal-to-noise metric and find that
granulation is difficult to detect in many cool main sequence stars
($T_{\text{eff}}$ $\lesssim$ 5500 K), in particular K dwarfs. By combining our
$\log g$ measurements with Gaia radii, we derive empirical masses for 4,646
subgiant and main sequence stars with a median precision of $\sim$7%. Finally,
we demonstrate that our method can be used to recover $\log g$ to a similar
mean absolute deviation precision for TESS-baseline of 27 days. Our methodology

operates in the energy range of 3 - 60 keV. The second telescope was a
one-dimensional LE with a focal length of 250 mm and a FOV of 2.7 x 8.0 deg for
the energy range 3 - 40 keV. The X-ray telescopes were supplemented by a camera
in the visible spectrum with 1,280 x 1,024 px resolution, which was used to
obtain images of the observed sources and to verify the resulting pointing of
the rocket carrier. Other devices also include infrared array sensors and
inertial measurement units tested for future small satellite missions. The data

considerable attention for its applications in reinforcement learning and
risk-averse optimization. The current NSCO algorithms have worse stochastic
oracle complexities, by orders of magnitude, than those for simpler stochastic
composite optimization problems (e.g., sum of smooth and nonsmooth functions)
without the nested structure. Moreover, they require all outer-layer functions
to be smooth, which is not satisfied by some important applications. These
discrepancies prompt us to ask: ``does the nested composition make stochastic
optimization more difficult in terms of the order of oracle complexity?"" In
this paper, we answer the question by developing order-optimal algorithms for
the convex NSCO problem constructed from an arbitrary composition of smooth,
structured non-smooth and general non-smooth layer functions. When all
outer-layer functions are smooth, we propose a stochastic sequential dual (SSD)
method to achieve an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$
($\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$) when the problem is non-strongly (strongly) convex.
When there exists some structured non-smooth or general non-smooth outer-layer
function, we propose a nonsmooth stochastic sequential dual (nSSD) method to
achieve an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. We provide a lower
complexity bound to show the latter $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ complexity to
be unimprovable even under a strongly convex setting. All these complexity
results seem to be new in the literature and they indicate that the convex NSCO
problem has the same order of oracle complexity as those without the nested
composition in all but the strongly convex and outer-non-smooth problem.

  Here, we show that a mathematical operation denominated degree-normalization
can improve the extraction of FC fingerprints. Degree-normalization has the
effect of reducing the excessive influence of strongly connected brain areas in
the whole-brain network. We adopt the differential identifiability framework
and apply it to both original and degree-normalized FCs of 409 individuals from
the Human Connectome Project, in resting-state and 7 fMRI tasks.
  Our results indicate that degree-normalization systematically improves three
fingerprinting metrics, namely differential identifiability, identification
rate and matching rate. Moreover, the results related to the matching rate
metric suggest that individual fingerprints are embedded in a low-dimensional

  The results suggest that low-dimensional functional fingerprints lie in part
in weakly connected subnetworks of the brain, and that degree-normalization
helps uncovering them. This work introduces a simple mathematical operation

unseen classes are disjoint, resulting in a distribution shift between training
and testing. 2) During testing, labeled data of previously unseen classes is
sparse, making it difficult to reliably extrapolate from labeled support
examples to unlabeled query examples. To tackle the first challenge, we
introduce Hybrid Consistency Training to jointly leverage interpolation
consistency, including interpolating hidden features, that imposes linear
behavior locally and data augmentation consistency that learns robust
embeddings against sample variations. As for the second challenge, we use
unlabeled examples to iteratively normalize features and adapt prototypes, as
opposed to commonly used one-time update, for more reliable prototype-based
transductive inference. We show that our method generates a 2% to 5%
improvement over the state-of-the-art methods with similar backbones on five
FSL datasets and, more notably, a 7% to 8% improvement for more challenging
cross-domain FSL.

Previous works have addressed this by relational reasoning over all objects in

Instead, we take a multi-task learning approach, where we implement the
classification as an attention layer. This allows for the prior knowledge to
emerge and propagate within the perception model. By enforcing the model also
to represent the prior, we achieve a strong inductive bias. We show that our
model can accurately generate commonsense knowledge and that the iterative
injection of this knowledge to scene representations leads to significantly
higher classification performance. Additionally, our model can be fine-tuned on
external knowledge given as triples. When combined with self-supervised
learning and with 1% of annotated images only, this gives more than 3%
improvement in object classification, 26% in scene graph classification, and
36% in predicate prediction accuracy.

a method to model the stellar spectrum of a star in the presence of spots by
using the out-of-transit observations. It is based on a chi squared
minimization procedure of the out-of-transit spectrum on a grid of stellar
spectra with different sizes and temperatures of the spots. The approach allows
us also to study the temporal evolution of the spots when comparing stellar
spectra observed at different epochs. We also present a method to correct the
transit depth variations due to non-occulted stellar spots and estimate the
error we introduce if we apply the same correction to crossings over the
stellar spots. The method is tested on three types of stellar targets that
ARIEL will observe in its 4-years mission lifetime. In all the explored cases,
the approach allows to reliably recover the spot parameters (size and
temperature) from out-of-transit observations and, for non-occulted spots, to
confidently recover the planetary atmosphere transmission spectrum within the
noise level(with average uncertainty of at most 3.3% of the planetary signal).
Conversely, we find systematic biases in the inferred planetary spectra due to
the occulted spots, with measurable effects for the brightest targets
especially for more contrasted spots.

directly measuring the density of states with STM spectroscopy, we show that
the bulk band gap magnitude shows substantial changes with applied gate
voltage, which is contrary to the na\""ive expectation that a gate would rigidly
shift the bands relative to the Fermi level. To explain our data, we carry out
density functional theory and model Hamiltonian calculations which show that a
gate electric field causes doping and inversion symmetry breaking which
polarizes and spin-splits the bulk bands. Interestingly, the calculated spin
splitting from the effective Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling can be in the tens

correlations in phase-space representations of quantum mechanics are obtained.
They relate time-dependent stochastic samples to multi-time observables, and
rely on the presence of derivative-free operator identities. In particular,
expressions for time-ordered normal-ordered observables in the positive-P
distribution are derived which replace Heisenberg operators with the bare
time-dependent stochastic variables, confirming extension of earlier such
results for the Glauber-Sudarshan P. Analogous expressions are found for the
anti-normal-ordered case of the doubled phase-space Q representation, along
with conversion rules among doubled phase-space s-ordered representations. The
latter are then shown to be readily exploited to further calculate anti-normal
and mixed-ordered multi-time observables in the positive-P, Wigner, and
doubled-Wigner representations. Which mixed-order observables are amenable and
which are not is indicated, and explicit tallies are given up to 4th order.
Overall, the theory of quantum multi-time observables in phase-space
representations is extended, allowing non-perturbative treatment of many cases.
The accuracy, usability, and scalability of the results to large systems is
demonstrated using stochastic simulations of the unconventional photon blockade
system and a related Bose-Hubbard chain. In addition, a robust but simple
algorithm for integration of stochastic equations for phase-space samples is
provided.

resulting in nanoscale hotspots leading to device failures. To understand the
reliability impact of the hotspots, the device needs to be tested under the
actual operating conditions. Therefore, the development of high-resolution
thermometry techniques is required to understand the heat dissipation processes
during the device operation. Recently, several thermometry techniques have been
proposed,such as radiation thermometry, thermocouple based contact thermometry,
scanning thermal microscopy (SThM), scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) and transition based threshold thermometers. However, most of these
techniques have limitations including the need for extensive calibration,
perturbation of the actual device temperature, low throughput, and the use of
ultra-high vacuum. Here, we present a facile technique, which uses a thin film
contact thermometer based on the phase change material Ge2Sb2Te5, to precisely
map thermal contours from the nanoscale to the microscale. Ge2Sb2Te5 undergoes
a crystalline transition at Tg with large changes in its electric conductivity,
optical reflectivity and density. Using this approach, we map the surface
temperature of a nanowire and an embedded micro-heater on the same chip where
the scales of the temperature contours differ by three orders of magnitude. The
spatial resolution can be as high as 20 nanometers thanks to the continuous

address occlusion and miss-detection issues, reduce false alarms, and recover
identity switch (ID switch). To handle occlusion and miss-detection issues, we
propose a measurement-to-disappeared track association method based on one-step
delta-GLMB filter, so it is possible to manage these difficulties by jointly
processing occluded or miss-detected objects. This part of proposed method is
based on a proposed similarity metric which is responsible for defining the
weight of hypothesized reappeared tracks. We also extend the delta-GLMB filter
to efficiently recover switched IDs using the cardinality density, size and
color features of the hypothesized tracks. We also propose a novel birth model
to achieve more effective clutter removal performance. In both
occlusion/miss-detection handler and newly-birthed object detector sections of
the proposed method, unassigned measurements play a significant role, since
they are used as the candidates for reappeared or birth objects. In addition,
we perform an ablation study which confirms the effectiveness of our
contributions in comparison with the baseline method. We evaluate the proposed
method on well-known and publicly available MOT15 and MOT17 test datasets which
are focused on pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that the proposed
tracker performs better or at least at the same level of the state-of-the-art
online and offline MOT methods. It effectively handles the occlusion and ID
switch issues and reduces false alarms as well.

and 11.3 microns, respond to changes in the number of carbons, charge of the
molecule, and the hardness of the radiation field that impinges the molecule.
We confirm that the 6.2/7.7 band ratio is a good predictor for the size of the
PAH molecule (based on the number of carbons present). We also investigate the
efficacy of the 11.3/3.3 ratio to trace the size of PAH molecules and note the
dependence of this ratio on the hardness of the radiation field. While the
ratio can potentially also be used to trace PAH molecular size, a better
understanding of the impact of the underlying radiation field on the 3.3
microns feature and the effect of the extinction on the ratio should be
evaluated. The newly developed diagnostics are compared to band ratios measured
in a variety of galaxies observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board the
Spitzer Space Telescope. We demonstrate that the band ratios can be used to
probe the conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies and differentiate
between environments encountered in normal star forming galaxies and Active
Galactic Nuclei. Our work highlights the immense potential that PAH

responding to client queries for host-names with corresponding IP addresses and
records. Traditional DNS is also unencrypted, and leaks user information to
network operators. Recent efforts to secure DNS using DNS over TLS (DoT) and
DNS over HTTPS (DoH) have been gaining traction, ostensibly protecting traffic
and hiding content from on-lookers. However, one of the criticisms of DoT and
DoH is brought to bear by the small number of large-scale deployments (e.g.,
Comcast, Google, Cloudflare): DNS resolvers can associate query contents with
client identities in the form of IP addresses. Oblivious DNS over HTTPS(ODoH)
safeguards against this problem. In this paper we ask what it would take to
make ODoH practical? We describe ODoH, a practical DNS protocol aimed at
resolving this issue by both protecting the client's content and identity. We
implement and deploy the protocol, and perform measurements to show that ODoH
has comparable performance to protocols like DoH and DoT which are gaining
widespread adoption, while improving client privacy, making ODoH a practical
privacy enhancing replacement for the usage of DNS.

fracture emerge from the minimization of a non-convex energy functional subject
to irreversibility constraints. This results in a multifield problem governed
by a mechanical balance equation and evolution equations for the internal
variables. While the balance equation is subject to kinematic admissibility of
the displacement field, the evolution equations for the internal variables are
subject to irreversibility conditions, and take the form of variational
inequalities, which are typically solved in a relaxed or penalized way that can
lead to deviations of the actual solution. This paper presents an
interior-point method that allows to rigorously solve the system of variational
inequalities. With this method, a sequence of perturbed constraints is
considered, which, in the limit, recovers the original constrained problem. As
such, no penalty parameters or modifications of the governing equations are
involved. The interior-point method is applied in both a staggered and a
monolithic scheme for both brittle and ductile fracture models. In order to
stabilize the monolithic scheme, a perturbation is applied to the Hessian
matrix of the energy functional. The presented algorithms are applied to three
benchmark problems and compared to conventional methods, where irreversibility
of the crack phase-field is imposed using a history field or an augmented

swine industry. Understanding transmission dynamics, such as through
mechanistic modeling, is critical for designing effective control strategies.
Articles were examined across multiple epidemiological and model
characteristics. Model filiation was determined through creation of a
neighbor-joined tree using phylogenetic software. Of 34 four articles
qualifying for inclusion, four main modelling objectives were identified:
estimating transmission parameters (11 studies), assessing determinants of
transmission (7), examining consequences of hypothetical outbreaks (5), and
assessing alternative control strategies (11). Estimated transmission
parameters varied widely as did parameter assumptions between models.
Uncertainties on epidemiological and ecological parameters were usually
accounted for to assess the impact on the modeled infection trajectory. Almost
all models are host specific, being developed for either domestic pigs or wild
boar despite the fact that spillover events between domestic pigs and wild boar
are evidenced to play an important role in ASF outbreaks. The development of
models incorporating such transmission routes is crucial. All compared control
strategies were defined a priori, and future models should be built to identify
optimal contributions across many control methods. Further, control strategies
were examined in competition, opposed to how they would be synergistically
implemented. While comparing strategies is beneficial for identifying a
rank-order efficacy of control methods, this structure does not necessarily
determine the most effective combination of all available strategies. In order
for ASFV models to effectively support decision-making in controlling ASFV
globally, these modelling limitations need to be addressed.

generated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is heavily dependent on the
knowledge of a low dimensional manifold (parameterized by a reaction coordinate
or RC) that typically distinguishes between relevant metastable states and
which captures the relevant slow dynamics of interest. Methods based on machine
learning and artificial intelligence have been proposed over the years to deal
with learning such low-dimensional manifolds, but they are often criticized for
a disconnect from more traditional and physically interpretable approaches. To
deal with such concerns, in this work, we propose a deep learning based State
Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) approach to learn the RC from high
dimensional molecular simulation trajectories. We demonstrate analytically and
numerically how the RC learnt in this approach is deeply connected to the
committor in chemical physics, and can be used to accurately identify
transition states. A crucial hyperparameter in this approach is the time-delay,
or how far into the future the algorithm should make predictions about. Through
careful comparisons for benchmark systems, we demonstrate that this
hyperparameter choice gives useful control over how coarse-grained we want the
metastable state classification of the system to be. We thus believe that this
work represents a step forward in systematic application of deep learning based
ideas to molecular simulations in a way that bridges the gap between artificial

that stable inversion can be obtained when the number of known coefficients is

that under floating catalyst chemical vapor conditions in the direct spinning
method, used both in research and industry,the ceramic reactor tube plays an
unsuspected active role in CNT growth, leading for example to doubling of
reaction yield when mullite (Al4+2xSi2-2xO10-x(x = 0.4)) is used instead of
alumina (Al2O3), but without affecting CNT morphology in terms of number of
layers, purity or degree of graphitization. This behaviour has been confirmed
for different carbon sources andwhen growing either predominantly single-walled
or multi-walled CNTs by adjusting promotor concentration. Analysis of large
Si-based impurities occasionally found in CNT fiber fabric samples, attributed
to reactor tube fragments that end up trapped inthe porous fibers, indicate
that the role of the reactor tube is in catalyzing the thermal decomposition of
hydrocarbons, which subsequently react with floating Fe catalyst nanoparticles
and produce extrusion of the CNTs and formation of an aerogel. Reactor gas
analysis confirms that extensive thermal decomposition of the carbon source
occurs in the absence of Fe catalystparticles, and that the concentration of
different carbon species (e.g. carbon dioxide and ethylene) is sensitive to the
reactor tube type. These finding open new avenues for controlled synthesis of

depending on the symmetry $G$ of the family (unitary, symplectic or
orthogonal). This integral bounds the average order of vanishing at the central

  A subcritical route to turbulence via purely quasi-two-dimensional
mechanisms, for a quasi-two-dimensional system composed of an isolated
exponential boundary layer, is numerically investigated. Exponential boundary
layers are highly stable, and are expected to form on the walls of liquid metal
coolant ducts within magnetic confinement fusion reactors. Subcritical
transitions were detected only at weakly subcritical Reynolds numbers (at most
$\approx 70$% below critical). Furthermore, the likelihood of transition was
very sensitive to both the perturbation structure and initial energy. Only the
quasi-two-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting wave disturbance, attained by either
linear or nonlinear optimisation, was able to initiate the transition process,
by means of the Orr mechanism. The lower initial energy bound sufficient to
trigger transition was found to be independent of the domain length. However,
longer domains were able to increase the upper energy bound, via the merging of
repetitions of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave. This broadens the range of
initial energies able to exhibit transitional behaviour. Although the eventual
relaminarization of all turbulent states was observed, this was also greatly
delayed in longer domains. The maximum nonlinear gains achieved were orders of
magnitude larger than the maximum linear gains (with the same initial
perturbations), regardless if the initial energy was above or below the lower
energy bound. Nonlinearity provided a second stage of energy growth by an
arching of the conventional Tollmien-Schlichting wave structure. A streamwise
independent structure, able to efficiently store perturbation energy, also
formed.

understand how changes in economic activity and traffic affect ambient air
quality and how much pollution reduction potential can the society offer
through digitalization and mobilitylimiting policies. In this work, we estimate
pollution reduction over the lockdown period by using the measurements from
ground air pollution monitoring stations, training a long-term prediction model
and comparing its predictions to measured values over the lockdown month.We
show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the data from air
pollution measurement stations in Switzerland and in China: evaluate up to
-15.8% / +34.4% change in NO2 / PM10 in Zurich; -35.3 % / -3.5 % and -42.4 % /
-34.7 % in NO2 / PM2.5 in Beijing and Wuhan respectively. Our reduction
estimates are consistent with recent publications, yet in contrast to prior
works, our method takes local weather into account. What can we learn from
pollution emissions during lockdown? The lockdown period was too short to train
meaningful models from scratch. To tackle this problem, we use transfer
learning to newly fit only traffic-dependent variables. We show that the
resulting models are accurate, suitable for an analysis of the post-lockdown
period and capable of estimating the future air pollution reduction potential.

double edge dislocation, imparts OAM to scattered X-rays. Unlike single
dislocations, a double dislocation does not introduce magnetic frustration, and
the ASI equilibrates to its antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state. The
topological charge of the defect differs with respect to the structural and
magnetic order; thus, X-ray diffraction from the ASI produces photons with even
and odd OAM quantum numbers at the structural and AF Bragg conditions,
respectively. The magnetic transitions of the ASI allow the AF OAM beams to be
switched on and off by modest variations of temperature and applied magnetic
field. These results demonstrate ASIs can serve as metasurfaces for
reconfigurable X-ray optics that could enable selective probes of electronic

is derived by assessing the phase-response and sensitivity of the wake dynamics

required for phase-locking between the cylinder vibrations and the wake. We
furthermore show that this synchronization mechanism can be employed to
stabilize the wake and subsequently reduce drag. We also uncover the
circumstances under which the concurrent occurrence of different vibrational

provide valuable insights for the study of vortex-induced body oscillations,
the enhancement of aerodynamic performance of flyers, or the mitigation of

Traditional spike sorting technologies perform feature extraction and
clustering separately after spikes are well detected. However, it may often
cause many additional processes and further lead to low-accurate and/or
unstable results especially when there are noises and/or overlapping spikes in
datasets. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed a unified
optimisation model integrating feature extraction and clustering for spike
sorting. Interestingly, instead of the widely used combination strategies,
i.e., performing the principal component analysis (PCA) for spike feature
extraction and K-means (KM) for clustering in sequence, we unified PCA and KM
into one optimisation model, which reduces additional processes with fewer
iteration times. Subsequently, by embedding the K-means++ strategy for
initialising and a comparison updating rule in the solving process, the
proposed model can well handle the noises and/or overlapping interference.
Finally, taking the best of the clustering validity indices into the proposed
model, we derive an automatic spike sorting method. Plenty of experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our proposed
method outperforms the related state-of-the-art approaches.

formulated as an interconnected optimal stopping and stochastic control problem
(Stopping-Control Problem) in a finite time horizon. The problem contains three
state variables: wealth $x$, habit level $h$ and wage rate $w$. We aim to
derive the retirement boundary of this ""wealth-habit-wage"" triplet $(x,h,w)$.
The complicated dual relation is proposed and proved to convert the original
problem to the dual one. We obtain the retirement boundary of the dual
variables based on an obstacle-type free boundary problem. Using dual relation
we find the retirement boundary of primal variables and feed-back forms of
optimal strategies. We show that if the so-called ""de facto wealth"" exceeds a
critical proportion of wage, it will be optimal for the agent to choose to
retire immediately. In numerical applications, we show how ""de facto wealth""
determines the retirement decisions and optimal strategies. Moreover, we
observe discontinuity at retirement boundary: investment proportion always
jumps down upon retirement, while consumption may jump up or jump down,
depending on the change of marginal utility. We also find that the agent with
higher standard of life tends to work longer.

recommending items based on anonymous behavior sequences. Most existing SBR
studies model the user preferences based only on the current session while
neglecting the item-transition information from the other sessions, which
suffer from the inability of modeling the complicated item-transition pattern.
To address the limitations, we introduce global item-transition information to
strength the modeling of the dynamic item-transition. For fully exploiting the
global item-transition information, two ways of exploring global information
for SBR are studied in this work. Specifically, we first propose a basic
GNN-based framework (BGNN), which solely uses session-level item-transition

called Session-based Recommendation with Global Information (SRGI), which
infers the user preferences via fully exploring global item-transitions over
all sessions from two different perspectives: (i) Fusion-based Model (SRGI-FM),
which recursively incorporates the neighbor embeddings of each node on global
graph into the learning process of session level item representation; and (ii)
Constrained-based Model (SRGI-CM), which treats the global-level
item-transition information as a constraint to ensure the learned item
embeddings are consistent with the global item-transition. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that both
SRGI-FM and SRGI-CM outperform the state-of-the-art methods consistently.

of fast shear flows an undershoot in the shear stress is observed following the
overshoot, i.e., before approaching the steady state. Whereas tumbling of the
entangled chain was proposed to be at its origin, here we investigate another
possible cause for the stress undershoot, i.e., slippage at the interface
between polymer and solid wall. To this end, we extend the primitive chain
network model to include slip at the interface between entangled polymeric
liquids and solid walls with grafted polymers. We determine the slip velocity
at the wall, and the shear rate in the bulk, by imposing that the shear stress
in the bulk polymers is equal to that resulting from the polymers grafted at
the wall. After confirming that the predicted results for the steady state are
reasonable, we examine the transient behavior. The simulations confirm that
slippage weakens the magnitude of the stress overshoot, as reported earlier.
The undershoot is also weakened, or even disappears, because of a reduced
coherence in molecular tumbling. In other words, the disentanglement between
grafted and bulk chains, occurring throughout the stress overshoot region, does
not contribute to the stress undershoot.

electrode array insertion. Magnetic guidance of the electrode array has been
proposed to mitigate this medical complication. After insertion, the guiding
magnet attached to the tip of the electrode array must be detached via a
heating process and removed. This heating process may, however, cause thermal
trauma within the cochlea. In this study, a validated three-dimensional finite
element heat transfer model of the human cochlea is applied to perform an
intracochlear thermal analysis necessary to ensure the safety of the magnet
removal phase. Specifically, the maximum safe input power density to detach the
magnet is determined as a function of the boundary conditions, heating
duration, cochlea size, implant electrode array radius and insertion depth,
magnet size, and cochlear fluid. A dimensional analysis and numerical
simulations reveal that the maximum safe input power density increases with
increasing cochlea size and the radius of the electrode array, whereas it
decreases with increasing electrode array insertion depth and magnet size. The
best cochlear fluids from the thermal perspective are perilymph and a soap
solution. Even for the worst case scenario in which the cochlear walls are
assumed to be adiabatic except at the round window, the maximum safe input
power density is larger than that required to melt 1 $\rm{mm^3}$ of paraffin

this work with other aspects of the design of the magnetic insertion process,

properties. One method to achieve end-to-end testing of the system is by
injecting mock FRBs in the live data-stream and searching for them blindly.
Mock FRB injection is particularly effective for machine-learning-based
classifiers, for which analytic characterisation is impractical. We describe a
first-of-its-kind implementation of a real-time mock FRB injection system at
the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) and present our
results for a set of 20,000 mock FRB injections. The injections have yielded
clear insight into the detection efficiencies and have provided a survey
completeness function for pulse width, fluence and DM. Mock FRBs are recovered
with uniform efficiency over the full range of injected DMs, however the
recovery fraction is found to be a strong function of the width and
Signal-to-Noise (SNR). For low widths ($\lesssim 20$ ms) and high SNR
($\gtrsim$ 9) the recovery is highly effective with recovery fractions
exceeding 90%. We find that the presence of radio frequency interference causes
the recovered SNR values to be systematically lower by up to 20% compared to
the injected values. We find that wider FRBs become increasingly hard to
recover for the machine-learning-based classifier employed at UTMOST. We
encourage other observatories to implement live injection set-ups for similar

feedback control of systems with input saturation. Although saturation commonly
arises in several practical control systems, there is still a scarce of
effective design methodologies that can directly deal with the severe
non-linearity of the saturation operator. In this paper, we aim to design an
anti-windup controller for enlarging the region of stability of the closed-loop
system by learning from the numerical simulations of the closed-loop system.
The data-driven framework we propose in this paper is based on a deep-learning
technique called Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. Within our framework,
we first obtain a candidate controller by using the deep-learning technique,
which is then tested by the existing theoretical results already established in
the literature, thereby avoiding the computational challenge in the
conventional design methodologies as well as theoretically guaranteeing the
performance of the system. Our numerical simulation shows that the proposed
framework can significantly outperform a conventional design methodology based
on linear matrix inequalities.

which describe the total energy change caused by infinitesimal rotations of
spins near some equilibrium state. For the small variations, such interactions
can be always related to the response function. However, the form of this
relation can depend on additional approximations. Particularly, the commonly
used magnetic force theorem (MFT) prescribes the linear relation between the
exchange interactions and the response function, while the exact theory
requires this dependence to be inverse. We explore the origin and consequences
of these differences in the definition for the wide class of materials:
ferromagnetic Ni, antiferromagnetic NiO, half-metallic CrO2, multiferroic
HoMnO3, and layered magnets CrCl3 and CrI3. While in most of these cases, MFT
produces quite reasonable results and can be rigorously justifies in the long
wavelength and strong-coupling limits, the exact formulation appears to be more
consistent, especially in dealing with two important issues, which typically
arise in the theory of exchange interactions: (i) the treatment of the ligand
states, and (ii) the choice of the suitable variable for the description of
infinitesimal rotations of spins. Both issues can be efficiently resolved by
employing the ideas of adiabatic spin dynamics supplemented with the exact
expression for the exchange interactions. Particularly, we propose a simple
""downfolding"" procedure for the elimination of the ligand spins by transferring
their effect to the interaction parameters between the localized spins.
Furthermore, we argue that the rotations of spin moments are more suitable for
the description of low-energy excitations, while the rotations of the whole
magnetization matrix cause much stronger perturbation in the system of spins.

where competitive queues try to get their packets served. In this model, a
queue gets to send a packet each step to one of the servers, which will attempt
to serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to
each queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the
capacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length
of each queue varies, resulting in a highly dependent random process. Earlier
work by the authors [EC'20] shows that with no-regret learners, the system
needs twice the capacity as would be required in the coordinated setting to
ensure queue lengths remain stable despite the selfish behavior of the queues.
In this paper, we demonstrate that this way of evaluating outcomes is myopic:
if more patient queues choose strategies that selfishly maximize their long-run
success rate, stability can be ensured with just $\frac{e}{e-1}\approx 1.58$
times extra capacity, better than what is possible assuming the no-regret
property.
  As these systems induce highly dependent processes, our analysis draws
heavily on techniques from probability theory. Though these systems are random
under any fixed policies by the queues, we show that, surprisingly, these
systems have deterministic and explicit asymptotic behavior. We show that the
asymptotic growth rates of queues can be written as a ratio of a submodular and
modular function, which provides significant game-theoretic properties. Our
equilibrium analysis then relies on a novel deformation argument towards a more
analyzable solution that differs significantly from previous price of anarchy
results. While the intermediate points will not be equilibria, this analytic
structure will ensure that this deformation is monotonic along this continuous
path.

so-called partially labeling issue. To address this, we propose a dynamic
on-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on
partially labeled datasets. DoDNet consists of a shared encoder-decoder
architecture, a task encoding module, a controller for generating dynamic
convolution filters, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The
information of the current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior
to tell the model what the task is expected to solve. Different from existing
approaches which fix kernels after training, the kernels in dynamic head are
generated adaptively by the controller, conditioned on both input image and
assigned task. Thus, DoDNet is able to segment multiple organs and tumors, as
done by multiple networks or a multi-head network, in a much efficient and
flexible manner. We have created a large-scale partially labeled dataset,

and coalescence of cracks aided by high internal stresses. Hence, accurate
prediction of maximum internal stress is critical to predicting time to failure
and improving the fracture resistance and reliability of materials. Existing
high-fidelity methods, such as the Finite-Discrete Element Model (FDEM), are
limited by their high computational cost. Therefore, to reduce computational
cost while preserving accuracy, a novel deep learning model, ""StressNet,"" is
proposed to predict the entire sequence of maximum internal stress based on
fracture propagation and the initial stress data. More specifically, the
Temporal Independent Convolutional Neural Network (TI-CNN) is designed to
capture the spatial features of fractures like fracture path and spall regions,
and the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Network is adapted to
capture the temporal features. By fusing these features, the evolution in time
of the maximum internal stress can be accurately predicted. Moreover, an
adaptive loss function is designed by dynamically integrating the Mean Squared
Error (MSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), to reflect the
fluctuations in maximum internal stress. After training, the proposed model is
able to compute accurate multi-step predictions of maximum internal stress in
approximately 20 seconds, as compared to the FDEM run time of 4 hours, with an
average MAPE of 2% relative to test data.

simultaneous differential CEvNS measurements with detectors of different

cancel systematic errors. While many applications are possible, we illustrate
the idea with three examples: testing the dominant quadratic dependence on the
number of neutrons, $N$, that is predicted by the theoretical models;
constraining the average neutron root mean square (rms) radius; and testing the
weak mixing angle and the sensitivity to new physics. In all three cases we
find that the extra sensitivity provided by this method will potentially allow
high-precision robust measurements with CEvNS and particularly, will resolve

propose a compressive Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing method. Instead of
reconstructing wavefronts with slope measurements of all sub-apertures, our
method reconstructs wavefronts with slope measurements of sub-apertures which
have spot images with high signal to noise ratio. Besides, we further propose
to use a deep neural network to accelerate wavefront reconstruction speed.
During the training stage of the deep neural network, we propose to add a
drop-out layer to simulate the compressive sensing process, which could
increase development speed of our method. After training, the compressive
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing method can reconstruct wavefronts in high
spatial resolution with slope measurements from only a small amount of
sub-apertures. We integrate the straightforward compressive Shack-Hartmann
wavefront sensing method with image deconvolution algorithm to develop a
high-order image restoration method. We use images restored by the high-order

important role in development of data processing methods, such as PSF based
astrometry, photometry and image restoration. However, for wide field small
aperture telescopes (WFSATs), estimating PSF in any position of the whole field
of view is hard, because aberrations induced by the optical system are quite
complex and the signal to noise ratio of star images is often too low for PSF
estimation. In this paper, we further develop our deep neural network (DNN)

the telescope alignment and testing stage, our method collects system
calibration data through modification of optical elements within engineering
tolerances (tilting and decentering). Then we use these data to train a DNN

optical excitation lasts for the duration of the laser pulse and the system
relaxes at a fast rate due to the electron-electron interaction. We study the

which exploit the time-shared microarchitectural components, such as caches,
translation look-aside buffers (TLBs), branch prediction unit (BPU), and
speculative execution, in modern processors to leak critical information from a
victim process or thread. To mitigate such attacks, the mechanism for flushing
the on-core state is extensively used by operating-system-level solutions,
since on-core state is too expensive to partition. In these systems, the
flushing operations are implemented in software (using cache maintenance

  To bridge this gap, we propose specialized hardware support, a
single-instruction multiple-flush (SIMF) mechanism to flush the core-level

flushing by more than a factor of two in execution time and reduces dynamic
instruction count by orders-of-magnitude.

views often have distinct incompleteness, i.e., unbalanced incompleteness,

Compared with previous methods, UIMC has two unique advantages: 1) it proposes
weighted multi-view subspace clustering to integrate these unbalanced
incomplete views, which effectively solves the unbalanced incomplete multi-view
problem; 2) it designs the low-rank and robust representation to recover the

methods. Generally speaking, a spatially fixed parameter for regularization
item in the whole image does not perform well for both edge and smooth areas. A
larger parameter of regularization item reduces noise better in smooth areas
but blurs edge regions, while a small parameter sharpens edge but causes
residual noise. In this paper, an automated spatially adaptive regularization
model, which combines the harmonic and TV models, is proposed for
reconstruction of noisy and blurred images. In the proposed model, it detects
the edges and then spatially adjusts the parameters of Tikhonov and TV
regularization terms for each pixel according to the edge information.
Accordingly, the edge information matrix will be also dynamically updated
during the iterations. Computationally, the newly-established model is convex,
which can be solved by the semi-proximal alternating direction method of
multipliers (sPADMM) with a linear-rate convergence rate. Numerical simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively reserves the image
edges and eliminates the noise and blur at the same time. In comparison to
state-of-the-art algorithms, it outperforms other methods in terms of PSNR,
SSIM and visual quality.

Plasmonic nano-tweezers thus face the challenge of disentangling the intricate

the atmospheric magnetic field plays an important part in understanding these
phenomena. Tools to study solar magnetic fields include magnetic topology and
features such as magnetic null points, separatrix surfaces, and separators. The
theory of these has most robustly been developed under magnetic charge
topology, where the sources of the magnetic field are taken to be discrete, but
observed magnetic fields are continuously distributed, and reconstructions and
numerical simulations typically use continuously distributed magnetic boundary
conditions. This article investigates the pitfalls in using continuous source
descriptions, particularly when null points on the $z=0$ plane are obscured by
the continuous flux distribution through, e.g., the overlap of non-point
sources. The idea of null-like points on the boundary is introduced where the
parallel requirement on the field $B_{\parallel}=0$ is retained but the
requirement on the perpendicular component is relaxed, i.e., $B_{\perp}\ne0$.
These allow the definition of separatrix-like surfaces which are shown (through
use of a squashing factor) to be a class of quasi-separatrix layer, and
separator-like lines which retain the x-line structure of separators. Examples
are given that demonstrate that the use of null-like points can reinstate
topological features that are eliminated in the transition from discrete to
continuous sources, and that their inclusion in more involved cases can enhance
understanding of the magnetic structure and even change the resulting
conclusions. While the examples in this article use the potential
approximation, the definition of null-like points is more general and may be
employed in other cases such as force-free field extrapolations and MHD
simulations.

the wide range of problematic to be tackled, absolute navigation performances

studying the sim2real gap which is one the major bottlenecks of modern robotics
and autonomous navigation. To design the navigation pipeline four main
challenges arise; environment, localization, navigation and planning. The
iGibson simulator is picked for its photo-realistic textures and physics
engine. A topological approach to tackle space representation was picked over
metric approaches because they generalize better to new environments and are
less sensitive to change of conditions. The navigation pipeline is decomposed
as a localization module, a planning module and a local navigation module.
These modules utilize three different networks, an image representation
extractor, a passage detector and a local policy. The laters are trained on
specifically tailored tasks with some associated datasets created for those
specific tasks. Localization is the ability for the agent to localize itself
against a specific space representation. It must be reliable, repeatable and
robust to a wide variety of transformations. Localization is tackled as an
image retrieval task using a deep neural network trained on an auxiliary task
as a feature descriptor extractor. The local policy is trained with behavioral

Lapidoth and Marti (2020) derived coding theorems, associated with achievable
channel-coding rates (of the main encoder) for this model, here our focus is on
error exponents. We consider both continuous-alphabet, additive white Gaussian
channels and finite-alphabet, modulo-additive channels, and for each one of
them, we study the cases of both fixed-rate and variable-rate noise
descriptions by the helper. Our main finding is that, as long as the
channel-coding rate, $R$, is below the helper-rate, $R_{\mbox{\tiny h}}$, the
achievable error exponent is unlimited (i.e., it can be made arbitrarily
large), and in some of the cases, it is even strictly infinite (i.e., the error
probability can be made strictly zero). However, in the range of coding rates
$(R_{\mbox{\tiny h}},R_{\mbox{\tiny h}}+C_0)$, $C_0$ being the ordinary channel
capacity (without help), the best achievable error exponent is finite and
strictly positive, although there is a certain gap between our upper bound

error exponent. This means that the model of encoder-assisted communication is
essentially equivalent to a model, where in addition to the noisy channel
between the encoder and decoder, there is also a parallel noiseless bit-pipe of

produces a joint representation of temporal image sequences and object motion.
The proposed TM-VoD aggregates visual feature maps extracted by convolutional
neural networks applying the temporal attention gating and spatial feature
alignment. This temporal feature aggregation is performed in two stages in a
hierarchical fashion. In the first stage, the visual feature maps are fused at
a pixel level via gated attention model. In the second stage, the proposed
method aggregates the features after aligning the object features using
temporal box offset calibration and weights them according to the cosine
similarity measure. The proposed TM-VoD also finds the representation of the
motion of objects in two successive steps. The pixel-level motion features are
first computed based on the incremental changes between the adjacent visual
feature maps. Then, box-level motion features are obtained from both the region
of interest (RoI)-aligned pixel-level motion features and the sequential
changes of the box coordinates. Finally, all these features are concatenated to
produce a joint representation of the objects for VoD. The experiments
conducted on the ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms existing VoD methods and achieves a performance comparable to that
of state-of-the-art VoDs.

deduce that if $W\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact convex body then, for every
$\varepsilon>0$, there exists a convex body $W_{\varepsilon}$ of class
$C^{1,1}$ such that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}\left(\partial W\setminus \partial

$f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is a convex function and $f$ is not of class
$C^{1,1}_{\rm loc}$, then for any $\varepsilon>0$ there is a convex function
$g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ of class $C^{1,1}_{\rm loc}$ such that
$\mathcal{L}^n(\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n:\, f(x)\neq g(x)\})<\varepsilon$ if and only
if $f$ is essentially coercive, meaning that
$\lim_{|x|\to\infty}f(x)-\ell(x)=\infty$ for some linear function $\ell$. A
consequence of this result is that, if $S$ is the boundary of some convex set
with nonempty interior (not necessarily bounded) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $S$ does
not contain any line, then for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a convex
hypersurface $S_{\varepsilon}$ of class $C^{1,1}_{\textrm{loc}}$ such that
$\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(S\setminus S_{\varepsilon})<\varepsilon$.

gradient boosting tree (GBT). Our OPRC-GBT model is used in the prediction of
protein-ligand binding affinity, which is one of key steps in drug design.

federated learning (FL) has been proposed as an attractive substitute for

learning model at edge devices, FL avoids direct data transmission and thus
overcomes high communication latency and privacy issues as compared to
centralized ML. To improve the communication efficiency in FL model
aggregation, over-the-air computation has been introduced to support a large
number of simultaneous local model uploading by exploiting the inherent
superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the heterogeneity
of communication capacities among edge devices, over-the-air FL suffers from
the straggler issue in which the device with the weakest channel acts as a
bottleneck of the model aggregation performance. This issue can be alleviated
by device selection to some extent, but the latter still suffers from a
tradeoff between data exploitation and model communication. In this paper, we
leverage the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to relieve the
straggler issue in over-the-air FL. Specifically, we develop a learning
analysis framework to quantitatively characterize the impact of device
selection and model aggregation error on the convergence of over-the-air FL.
Then, we formulate a unified communication-learning optimization problem to
jointly optimize device selection, over-the-air transceiver design, and RIS
configuration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed design achieves
substantial learning accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially when channel conditions vary dramatically across edge
devices.

matching is to find similar patches in a large neighborhood which can alleviate

optimization problems are widely used in many big-data applications, e.g.
training deep neural networks as well as other complex and potentially
non-convex machine learning models. Their inexpensive iterations generally come
together with slow global convergence rate (mostly sublinear), leading to the
necessity of carrying out a very high number of iterations before the iterates
reach a neighborhood of a minimizer. In this work, we present a first-order
stochastic algorithm based on a combination of homotopy methods and SGD, called
Homotopy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (H-SGD), which finds interesting
connections with some proposed heuristics in the literature, e.g. optimization
by Gaussian continuation, training by diffusion, mollifying networks. Under
some mild assumptions on the problem structure, we conduct a theoretical
analysis of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis shows that, with a
specifically designed scheme for the homotopy parameter, H-SGD enjoys a global
linear rate of convergence to a neighborhood of a minimum while maintaining
fast and inexpensive iterations. Experimental evaluations confirm the
theoretical results and show that H-SGD can outperform standard SGD.

illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first

for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we
apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the
policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class
of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework and that it is more robust
with respect to model mis-specification when compared to a model-based

silylated groups. These hybrid films represent excellent candidates for
replacing conventional polymeric materials in biomedical applications, but they
need to be optimized in terms of biocompatibility which is highly related to
protein adsorption. Neutron reflectivity has been used to study the adsorption
of two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and lysozyme, at the silylated oil
(ICO)-water interface in the absence and presence of salt at physiologic ionic
strength and pH and at different protein concentrations. These measurements are
compared to adsorption at the air-water interface. While salt enhances
adsorption by a similar degree at the air-water and the oil-water interface,
the impact of the oil film is significant, with adsorption at the oil-water
interface three-to four-fold higher compared to the air-water interface. Under
these conditions, the concentration profiles of the adsorbed layers for both
proteins indicate multilayer adsorption: The thickness of the outer layer
(oil-side) is close to the dimension of the minor axis of the protein molecule,
~ 30 {\AA}, suggesting a side-way orientation with the long axis parallel to
the interface. The inner layer extends to 55-60 {\AA}. Interestingly, in all
cases, the composition of oil film remains intact without significant protein
penetration into the film. The optimal adsorption on these nanofilms, 1.7-2.0
mg$\bullet$m-2 , is comparable to the results obtained recently on thick solid
cross-linked films using quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force
microscopy, showing in particular that adsorption at these ICO film interfaces
under standard physiological conditions is non-specific. These results furnish

Bessel functions, have recently attracted considerable attention for their
optical properties. Nevertheless, identity resolution is still an open
question, which is an essential mathematical property that defines an
overcomplete basis in the Fock space and allows a coherent state quantization
map. In this regard, the modified Susskind-Glogower coherent states have been
introduced as an alternative family of states that resolve the identity
resolution. In the present manuscript, the quantization map related to the
modified Susskind-Glogower coherent states is exploited, which naturally leads
to a particular representation of the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra in its
discrete series. The latter provides evidence about further generalizations of
coherent states, built from the Susskind-Glogower ones by extending the indexes
of the Bessel functions of the first kind and, alternatively, by employing the
modified Bessel functions of the second kind. In this form, the new families of
Susskind-Glogower-I and Susskind-Glogower-II coherent states are introduced.
The corresponding quantization maps are constructed so that they lead to
general representations of elements of the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ and
$\mathfrak{su}(2)$ Lie algebras as generators of the SU$(1,1)$ and SU$(2)$
unitary irreducible representations respectively. For completeness, the optical
properties related to the new families of coherent states are explored and
compared with respect to some well-known optical states.

ability of generators to stay synchronized with the positive-sequence voltage
of the network, whether for symmetrical or asymmetrical faults. In contrast,
both positive- and negative-sequence synchronizations should be of concern for
inverter-based generation (IBG) under asymmetrical faults. This is because the
latest grid codes stipulate that IBG should inject dual-sequence current when
riding through asymmetrical faults. Currently, much less is known about the
synchronization stability during asymmetrical faults. This significantly
differs from the positive-sequence synchronization alone because the coupled
dual-sequence synchronization is involved. This paper aims to fill this gap.
Considering the sequence coupling under asymmetrical faults, the dual-sequence
synchronization model of IBG is developed. Based on the model, the conditions
that steady-state equilibrium points should follow are identified. The
conditions throw light on the possible types of synchronization instability,
including the positive-sequence dominated instability and the negative-sequence
dominated one. For different types of instability, the dominant factors are
analyzed quantitatively, which are reflected by the limit on the current
injection amplitude. Exceeding the limit will lead to the loss of both
positive- and negative-sequence synchronizations. The model and the analysis
are verified by simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.

subcellular levels. Immunofluorescence labeling showed TMEM240 to be expressed
in various areas of the brain, with the highest levels in the hippocampus,
isocortex, and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, TMEM240 was detected in the deep
nuclei and the cerebellar cortex. The protein was expressed in all three layers
of the cortex and various cerebellar neurons. TMEM240 was localized to
climbing, mossy, and parallel fiber afferents projecting to Purkinje cells, as
shown by coimmunostaining with VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Co-immunostaining with
synaptophysin, post-synaptic fractionation, and confirmatory electron
microscopy showed TMEM240 to be localized to the post-synaptic side of synapses
near the Purkinje-cell soma. Similar results were obtained in human cerebellar
sections. These data suggest that TMEM240 may be involved in the organization
of the cerebellar network, particularly in synaptic inputs converging on
Purkinje cells. This study is the first to describe TMEM240 expression in the
normal mouse brain.

neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), a rare lysosomal-storage disorder
characterized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, retinitis pigmentosa, and
cognitive disorders, usually beginning between 13 and 25 years of age. This is
a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast,
heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia
associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified
homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much
broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations,
depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by
classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other
homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal
dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar
ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not
have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of
some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma
progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a
homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is
a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on
replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous
carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease.
Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43
cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous
mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43
pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing
observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some
neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process
preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study
has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis.
Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic
counseling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as
they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More
broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to
different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a
challenge for genetic diagnosis.

rapid damage assessment after a disaster occurred. For instance, building
damage detection can be automated by applying computer vision techniques to
satellite imagery. Such models operate in a multi-domain setting: every
disaster is inherently different (new geolocation, unique circumstances), and
models must be robust to a shift in distribution between disaster imagery
available for training and the images of the new event. Accordingly, estimating
real-world performance requires an out-of-domain (OOD) test set. However,
building damage detection models have so far been evaluated mostly in the
simpler yet unrealistic in-distribution (IID) test setting. Here we argue that
future work should focus on the OOD regime instead. We assess OOD performance
of two competitive damage detection models and find that existing
state-of-the-art models show a substantial generalization gap: their
performance drops when evaluated OOD on new disasters not used during training.
Moreover, IID performance is not predictive of OOD performance, rendering
current benchmarks uninformative about real-world performance. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ecker-lab/robust-bdd.

scenarios. In these scenarios, original image data often contain missing

However, missing instances may make these methods difficult to use directly and
noises will lead to unreliable clustering results. In this paper, we propose a
novel Auto-weighted Noisy and Incomplete Multi-view Clustering framework
(ANIMC) via a soft auto-weighted strategy and a doubly soft regular regression
model. Firstly, by designing adaptive semi-regularized nonnegative matrix
factorization (adaptive semi-RNMF), the soft auto-weighted strategy assigns a
proper weight to each view and adds a soft boundary to balance the influence of
noises and incompleteness. Secondly, by proposing{\theta}-norm, the doubly soft
regularized regression model adjusts the sparsity of our model by choosing
different{\theta}. Compared with existing methods, ANIMC has three unique
advantages: 1) it is a soft algorithm to adjust our framework in different
scenarios, thereby improving its generalization ability; 2) it automatically
learns a proper weight for each view, thereby reducing the influence of noises;
3) it performs doubly soft regularized regression that aligns the same
instances in different views, thereby decreasing the impact of missing
instances. Extensive experimental results demonstrate its superior advantages
over other state-of-the-art methods.

  videos",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents algorithms for the feedback-stabilised walking of bipedal
humanoid robotic platforms, along with the underlying theoretical and
sensorimotor frameworks required to achieve it. Bipedal walking is inherently
complex and difficult to control due to the high level of nonlinearity and
significant number of degrees of freedom of the concerned robots, the limited
observability and controllability of the corresponding states, and the
combination of imperfect actuation with less-than-ideal sensing. The presented
methods deal with these issues in a multitude of ways, ranging from the
development of an actuator control and feed-forward compensation scheme, to the
inclusion of filtering in almost all of the gait stabilisation feedback
pipelines. Two gaits are developed and investigated, the direct fused angle
feedback gait, and the tilt phase controller. Both gaits follow the design
philosophy of leveraging a semi-stable open-loop gait generator, and extending
it through stabilising feedback via the means of so-called corrective actions.
The idea of using corrective actions is to modify the generation of the
open-loop joint waveforms in such a way that the balance of the robot is
influenced and thereby ameliorated. Examples of such corrective actions include
modifications of the arm swing and leg swing trajectories, the application of
dynamic positional and rotational offsets to the hips and feet, and adjustments
of the commanded step size and timing. Underpinning both feedback gaits and
their corresponding gait generators are significant advances in the field of 3D
rotation theory. These advances include the development of three novel rotation
representations, the tilt angles, fused angles, and tilt phase space
representations. All three of these representations are founded on a new
innovative way of splitting 3D rotations into their respective yaw and tilt
components.

Bose--Einstein condensates is investigated theoretically. Singly quantized
vortices are categorized by the local ordered state in the vortex core and
three types of vortices are found as lowest-energy vortices, which are elliptic
AF-core vortices, axisymmetric F-core vortices, and N-core vortices. These
vortices are named after the local ordered state, ferromagnetic (F),
antiferromagnetic (AF), broken-axisymmetry (BA), and normal (N) states apart
from the bulk polar (P) state. The N-core vortex is a conventional vortex, in
the core of which the superfluid order parameter vanishes. The other two types
of vortices are stabilized when the quadratic Zeeman energy is smaller than a
critical value. The axisymmetric F-core vortex is the lowest-energy vortex for
ferromagnetic interaction, and it has an F core surrounded by a BA skin that
forms a ferromagnetic-spin texture, as exemplified by the localized Mermin--Ho
texture. The elliptic AF-core vortex is stabilized for antiferromagnetic
interaction; the vortex core has both nematic-spin and ferromagnetic orders
locally and is composed of the AF-core soliton spanned between two BA edges.
The phase transition from the N-core vortex to the other two vortices is
continuous, whereas that between the AF-core and F-core vortices is
discontinuous. The critical point of the continuous vortex-core transition is
computed by the perturbation analysis of the Bogoliubov theory and the
Ginzburg--Landau formalism describes the critical behavior. The influence of
trapping potential on the core structure is also investigated.

we propose to embed the MFMVDR filter within a deep learning framework. The
TCNs are trained to map the noisy speech STFT coefficients to the required

of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) and employ massively parallel ray
shooting on them using GPUs to find free and occupied voxels. These are fed
back into CPU to update the voxel occupancy and restructure the octree. In our

a unitary evolution and the coarse-grained description of it is given by a CPTP
map taking the original system into an \emph{effective} Hilbert space of
smaller dimension. We see that a well-defined effective dynamics can only be

applications, for example to track the number of unique users in Internet
services or the number of distinct flows on a network. In many cases, an
estimate rather than the exact value is sufficient and thus many algorithms for
cardinality estimation that significantly reduce the memory and computation
requirements have been proposed. Among them, Hyperloglog has been widely
adopted in both software and hardware implementations. The security of
Hyperloglog has been recently studied showing that an attacker can create a set
of elements that produces a cardinality estimate that is much smaller than the
real cardinality of the set. This set can be used for example to evade
detection systems that use Hyperloglog. In this paper, the security of
Hyperloglog is considered from the opposite angle: the attacker wants to create
a small set that when inserted on the Hyperloglog produces a large cardinality
estimate. This set can be used to trigger false alarms in detection systems
that use Hyperloglog but more interestingly, it can be potentially used to
inflate the visits to websites or the number of hits of online advertisements.
Our analysis shows that an attacker can create a set with a number of elements
equal to the number of registers used in the Hyperloglog implementation that
produces any arbitrary cardinality estimate. This has been validated in two
commercial implementations of Hyperloglog: Presto and Redis. Based on those
results, we also consider the protection of Hyperloglog against such an attack.

which soon spread all over the world, resulting in a deadly pandemic that
infected millions of people around the globe. The government and public health
agencies followed many strategies to counter the fatal virus. However, the

paper, we extract and study the opinion of people from the top five worst
affected countries by the virus, namely USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and South
Africa. We propose a deep language-independent Multilevel Attention-based
Conv-BiGRU network (MACBiG-Net), which includes embedding layer, word-level
encoded attention, and sentence-level encoded attention mechanism to extract
the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The embedding layer encodes the
sentence sequence into a real-valued vector. The word-level and sentence-level
encoding is performed by a 1D Conv-BiGRU based mechanism, followed by
word-level and sentence-level attention, respectively. We further develop a
COVID-19 Sentiment Dataset by crawling the tweets from Twitter. Extensive
experiments on our proposed dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed MACBiG-Net. Also, attention-weights visualization and in-depth results

our poses and dense reconstructions are a direct output of an altered bundle
adjuster. To this end, we parametrize each depth map with a linear combination
of a limited number of basis ""depth-planes"" predicted in a monocular fashion by
a deep net. Using a set of high-quality sparse keypoint matches, we optimize
over the per-frame linear combinations of depth planes and camera poses to form
a geometrically consistent cloud of keypoints. Although our bundle adjustment
only considers sparse keypoints, the inferred linear coefficients of the basis
planes immediately give us dense depth maps. RidgeSfM is able to collectively
align hundreds of frames, which is its main advantage over recent memory-heavy
deep alternatives that can align at most 10 frames. Quantitative comparisons
reveal performance superior to a state-of-the-art large-scale SfM pipeline.

and Dark Matter studied in Ref. arXiv:1811.02302. The scenario is based on the
incomplete decay of the inflaton field into right-handed (s)neutrino pairs. By
imposing a discrete interchange symmetry on the inflaton and the right-handed
(s)neutrinos, one can ensure the stability of the inflaton field at the global
minimum today, while still allowing it to partially decay and reheat the
Universe after inflation. Compatibility of inflationary predictions, BBN bounds
and obtaining the right DM abundance for the inflaton Dark Matter candidate
typically requires large values of its coupling to the neutrino sector, and we
use supersymmetry to protect the inflaton from potentially dangerous large
radiative corrections which may spoil the required flatness of its potential.
In addition, the inflaton will decay now predominatly into sneutrinos during
reheating, which in turn give rise both to the thermal bath made of Standard
Model particles, and inflaton particles. We have performed a through analyses
of the reheating process following the evolution of all the partners involved,
identifying the different regimes in the parameter space for the final Dark

programming languages, with which we can argue about program behaviour and
program equivalence by formal means; in particular, we can describe and verify
our arguments with a proof assistant. There are various approaches to giving
formal semantics to programming languages, at different abstraction levels and
applying different mathematical machinery: the reason for using the semantics
determines which approach to choose.
  In this paper we investigate some of the approaches that share their roots
with traditional relational big-step semantics, such as (a) functional big-step
semantics (or, equivalently, a definitional interpreter), (b) pretty-big-step
semantics and (c) traditional natural semantics. We compare these approaches
with respect to the following criteria: executability of the semantics
definition, proof complexity for typical properties (e.g. determinism) and the
conciseness of expression equivalence proofs in that approach. We also briefly
discuss the complexity of these definitions and the coinductive big-step
semantics, which enables reasoning about divergence.
  To enable the comparison in practice, we present an example language for
comparing the semantics: a sequential subset of Core Erlang, a functional
programming language, which is used in the intermediate steps of the Erlang/OTP
compiler. We have already defined a relational big-step semantics for this
language that includes treatment of exceptions and side effects. The aim of
this current work is to compare our big-step definition for this language with
a variety of other equivalent semantics in different styles from the point of

example, we consider unitary groups of separable abelian unital $C^*$-algebras
with spectrum having finitely many components, which we classify up to
topological isomorphism and up to quasi-isometry, in order to highlight the
difference. The main results then concern the Haagerup property, and Properties
(T) and (FH). We present the first non-trivial non-abelian and non-localy
compact groups having the Haagerup property, most of them being non-amenable.
These are the groups $\mathcal{U}_2(M,\tau)$, where $M$ is a semifinite von

signal the number of antennas that the transmitter (Tx) of this signal uses, as
well as its specific modulation scheme (from phase-shift keying (PSK) or
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)). Formally, these are modulation and
antenna classification problems. We examine the problems with data-driven
machine learning (ML)-based techniques. The two sub-problems of modulation and
number of transmitter antenna classification are initially examined
independently for a variety for system parameters, namely the SNR, number of
receiver (Rx) antennas, and classification algorithms. Then we consider the
joint problem where we follow two approaches. One, where the sub-problems are
solved independently and in parallel, and one where the antenna classifier
waits on the result of the modulation classifier. The two proposed schemes do
not require any knowledge/details of the used modulation schemes and the way
the Tx antennas are used (spatial multiplexing, space-time codes,etc.) as it is
fully data-driven and not decision-theoretic based. The results of our approach
are characterized by high classification accuracy and they pave the way for
more ML-based data-driven techniques that reveal more characteristics of the
Tx.

engineering research. Wagner theory, originating in 1932, predicts impact
pressures, and accounts for contributions to the total pressure arising from
various flow domains in the vicinity of the wetting region on the wedge. Here
we study the slamming of a wedge and a cone at a constant, well-controlled
velocity throughout the impact event using high fidelity sensors. Pressures at
two locations on the impactor are measured during and after impact. Pressure
time series from the two impactors are discussed using inertial pressure and
time scales. The non-dimensionalised pressure time series are compared to
sensor-integrated averaged composite Wagner solutions (Zhao & Faltinsen 1993),
Logvinovich (1969, 4.7), modified Logvinovich (Korobkin & Malenica 2005) and
generalised Wagner models (Korobkin 2004). In addition, we provide an
independent experimental justification of approximations made in the literature
in extending the Wagner model to three-dimensions. The second part of the paper
deals with pre-impact air cushioning -- an important concern since it is
responsible for determining the thickness of air layer trapped upon impact.
Using a custom-made technique we measure the air-water interface dynamics as it
responds to the build up of pressure in the air layer intervening in between
the impactor and the free surface. We show both experimentally and using
two-fluid boundary integral (BI) simulations, that the pre-impact deflection of
the interface due to air-cushioning is fully described by potential flow.

branches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as

locking that is the first of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to
directly predict a key bit value from a locked synthesized gate-level netlist
without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler yet more
flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are
evaluated. The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected
neural network. The second approach utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more
complex convolutional neural network architectures specialized for the given
task. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for attacking
locking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive
evaluation of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both
reference benchmark circuits as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The
evaluation results show that SnapShot achieves an average key prediction
accuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant
performance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the
art. Moreover, SnapShot outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated

of the young active dM4 star Gl 729. First, we analyzed long-cadence $K2$
photometry to characterize its transient events (e.g., flares) and global and
surface differential rotation. Then, from the Mount Wilson $S$-indexes derived
from CASLEO spectra and other public observations, we analyzed its long-term
activity between 1998 and 2020 with four different time-domain techniques to
detect cyclic patterns. Finally, we explored the chromospheric activity at
different heights with simultaneous measurements of the H$\alpha$ and the Na I
D indexes, and we analyzed their relations with the $S$-Index.
  We found that the cumulative flare frequency follows a power-law distribution
with slope $\sim- 0.73$ for the range $10^{32}$ to $10^{34}$ erg. We obtained
$P_{rot} = (2.848 \pm 0.001)$ days, and we found no evidence of differential
rotation. We also found that this young active star presents a long-term
activity cycle with a length of $\text{about four}$ years; there is less
significant evidence of a shorter cycle of $0.8$ year. The star also shows a
broad activity minimum between 1998 and 2004. We found a correlation between
the S index, on the one hand, and the H$\alpha$ the Na I D indexes, on the
other hand, although the saturation level of these last two indexes is not
observed in the Ca lines.
  Because the maximum-entropy spot model does not reflect migration between
active longitudes, this activity cycle cannot be explained by a solar-type
dynamo. It is probably caused by an $\alpha^2$-dynamo.

single crystals. The penetration of X-rays respect to the surface normal during
diffraction (extinction depth, $1/\sigma_e$) in perfect single crystals does
not have a constant value. The value changes for different angular positions on
the crystal diffraction condition. For higher X-ray energies this value can
change from few micrometers to tens of millimeters for each different crystal
angular position in the small angular range of the diffraction condition. This
effect may spread a single point in the object (sample) as a line in the image
detector, especially if the crystal is set (or if the sample angularly deviates
the beam) at lower diffraction angle positions, where the surface component of
X-ray penetration can achieve huge values. Then, for imaging experiments where
the dynamical diffraction occurs, such intrinsic property can affect the image
resolution. We have modeled and experimentally checked such a dynamical
diffraction property using, as example, an Analyzer-based X-ray phase contrast
imaging setup (ABI) at two different X-ray energies: 10.7 keV and 18 keV. The
results show that our theoretical model is consistent with the measured
results. For higher energies the blur effect is enhanced and intrinsically
limits the image spatial resolution.

original data often contain noises. Some graph-based multi-view clustering
methods have been proposed to try to reduce the negative influence of noises.
However, previous graph-based multi-view clustering methods treat all features
equally even if there are redundant features or noises, which is obviously
unreasonable. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view clustering framework
Double Self-weighted Multi-view Clustering (DSMC) to overcome the
aforementioned deficiency. DSMC performs double self-weighted operations to
remove redundant features and noises from each graph, thereby obtaining robust
graphs. For the first self-weighted operation, it assigns different weights to
different features by introducing an adaptive weight matrix, which can
reinforce the role of the important features in the joint representation and
make each graph robust. For the second self-weighting operation, it weights
different graphs by imposing an adaptive weight factor, which can assign larger
weights to more robust graphs. Furthermore, by designing an adaptive multiple
graphs fusion, we can fuse the features in the different graphs to integrate
these graphs for clustering. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate
its advantages over other state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.

Mathematical models used to inform such decisions often include uncertainty

methodologies, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), require
modelers to specify a precise probability distribution to represent the
uncertainty of a model parameter. This study introduces a novel approach for
propagating parameter uncertainty, probability bounds analysis (PBA), where the
uncertainty about the unknown probability distribution of a model parameter is
expressed in terms of an interval bounded by lower and upper bounds on the
unknown cumulative distribution function (p-box) and without assuming a
particular form of the distribution function. We give the formulas of the
p-boxes for common situations (given combinations of data on minimum, maximum,
median, mean, or standard deviation), describe an approach to propagate p-boxes
into a black-box mathematical model, and introduce an approach for
decision-making based on the results of PBA. We demonstrate the characteristics
and utility of PBA versus PSA using two case studies. In sum, this study
provides modelers with practical tools to conduct parameter uncertainty
quantification given the constraints of available data and with the fewest
assumptions.

a CIR estimation method in this setup is limited by both the available channel

compensate for the CSI distortions, we develop a per-band processing algorithm

recovery method to exploit channel sparsity. Splicing clean CSI over M
frequency bands, we use orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) as an estimation
method to recover the sparse CIR with high (M-fold) resolution. Unlike previous
works in the literature, our method does not appeal to any limiting assumption
on the CIR (other than the widely accepted sparsity assumption) or any ad hoc
processing for distortion removal. We show, empirically, that the proposed

(PSR J0633+1746) between $15\,$GeV and $75\,$GeV. This is the first time a
middle-aged pulsar has been detected up to these energies. Observations were
carried out with the MAGIC telescopes between 2017 and 2019 using the
low-energy threshold Sum-Trigger-II system. After quality selection cuts, $\sim
80\,$hours of observational data were used for this analysis. To compare with
the emission at lower energies below the sensitivity range of MAGIC, $11$ years
of Fermi-LAT data above $100\,$MeV were also analysed. From the two pulses per
rotation seen by Fermi-LAT, only the second one, P2, is detected in the MAGIC
energy range, with a significance of $6.3\,\sigma$. The spectrum measured by
MAGIC is well-represented by a simple power law of spectral index $\Gamma=
5.62\pm0.54$, which smoothly extends the Fermi-LAT spectrum. A joint fit to
MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data rules out the existence of a sub-exponential cut-off
in the combined energy range at the $3.6\,\sigma$ significance level. The
power-law tail emission detected by MAGIC is interpreted as the transition from
curvature radiation to Inverse Compton Scattering of particles accelerated in
the northern outer gap.

reviews the wavevector evolution of the dynamic structure factor, which
provides evidence of a pseudo-acoustic propagating mode up to frequencies

partially explain the deviation from the Debye law. At higher frequencies, the
inelastic spectrum presents a complex pattern of vibrations, with evidences of
two peaks in various systems. To conclude, we will highlight the information

point defects in doped insulating crystals. The approach is based on the
density functional theory calculations. We apply it to the problem of obtaining
of Ti-doped sapphire crystals with high figure-of-merit (FOM). The FOM of a
given sample is defined as the ratio of the coefficient of absorption at the
pump frequency to the coefficient of absorption at the working frequency of
Ti:sapphire laser. It is believed that FOM is proportional to the ratio of the
concentration of isolated Ti$^{3+}$ ions to the concentration of
Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$ pairs. We find that generally this ratio is in inverse
proportion to the concentration of Ti$^{4+}$ isolated substitutional defects
with the coefficient of proportionality that depends on the temperature at
which the thermodynamically equilibrium concentration of defects is reached. We
argue that in certain cases the inverse proportion between concentrations of
Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$ and Ti$^{4+}$ may be violated. We show that codopants that
form positively (negatively) charged defects may decrease (increase) the
concentration of positively charged defects formed by the main dopants. To
evaluate the effect of codoping it is important to take into account not only
isolated defects but defect complexes formed by codopants, as well. In
particular, we show that codoping of Ti:sapphire with nitrogen results in an
essential increase of the concentration of Ti$^{4+}$ and in a decrease of the
FOM, and, consequently, growth or annealing in the presence of nitrogen or its
compounds is unfavorable for producing Ti:sapphire laser crystals. The approach
developed can be used for determining appropriate growth and annealing
conditions for obtaining doped crystals with the required characteristics.

inverted to produce maser emission. It is found that beaming is necessary to
explain the observed brightness temperatures of the recently discovered CS
masers in W51 e2e. The model calculations suggest that a CS abundance of a few
times $10^{-5}$ and CS($v=0$) column densities of the order
$10^{16}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ are required for these masers. The rarity of the CS
masers in high mass star forming regions might be the result of a required high
CS abundance as well as due to attenuation of the maser emission inside as well

all available data streams and learn more about the astrophysical objects that
fall within its breadth. One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous
optical/near-infrared counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
gravitational-wave (GW) signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~
three days, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed;
however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to
search for these fast-evolving candidates. Thus, it is beneficial to optimize
the survey cadence for realtime kilonova identification and enable further
photometric and spectroscopic observations. We explore how the cadence of wide
field-of-view surveys like ZTF can be improved to facilitate such
identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g., the
adoption of three epochs per night on a ~ nightly basis, and the prioritization
of redder photometric bands, detection efficiencies improve by about a factor
of two relative to the nominal cadence. We also provide realistic hypothetical
constraints on the kilonova rate as a form of comparison between strategies,
assuming that no kilonovae are detected throughout the long-term execution of
the respective observing plan. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of
ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of GWs or GRBs,
thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal
cadence through Target of Opportunity programs.

stars (orbital period $P_{orb} \lsim$8 days) to investigate the orbital
oscillations, instellation cycles, and orbital stability of circumbinary
planets (CBPs). We consider two tidal models and show that both predict an
outward-then-inward evolution of the binary's semi-major axis $a_{bin}$ and
eccentricity $e_{bin}$. This orbital evolution drives a similar evolution of
the minimum CBP semi-major axis for orbital stability. By expanding on previous
models to include the evolution of the mass concentration, we show that the
maximum in the CBP orbital stability limit tends to occur 100 Myr after the
planets form, a factor of 100 longer than previous investigations. This result
provides further support for the hypothesis that the early stellar-tidal
evolution of binary stars has removed CBPs from short-period binaries. We then
apply the models to Kepler-47 b, a CBP orbiting close to its host stars'
stability limit, to show that if the binary's initial $e_{bin} \gsim$0.24, the
planet would have been orbiting within the instability zone in the past and
probably wouldn't have survived. For stable, hypothetical cases in which the
stability limit does not reach a planet's orbit, we find that the amplitudes of
$a_{bin}$ and $e_{bin}$ oscillations can damp by up to 10\% and 50\%,
respectively. Finally, we consider equal-mass stars with $P_{orb} =$ 7.5 days
and compare the HZ to the stability limit. We find that for stellar masses
$\lsim0.12M_{\odot}$, the HZ is completely unstable, even if the binary orbit
is circular. For $e_{bin} \lsim$0.5, that limit increases to $0.17M_{\odot}$,
and the HZ is partially destabilized for stellar masses up to $0.45M_{\odot}$.
These results may help guide searches for potentially habitable CBPs, as well
as characterize their evolution and likelihood to support life after they are
found.

systems such as the solar corona. As a slow wave propagates through a plasma,
it modifies the equilibrium quantities of density, temperature, and magnetic
field. In the corona and other plasma systems, the thermal equilibrium is
comprised of a balance between continuous heating and cooling processes, the
magnitudes of which vary with density, temperature and magnetic field. Thus the
wave may induce a misbalance between these competing processes. Its back
reaction on the wave has been shown to lead to dispersion, and amplification or
damping, of the wave. In this work the importance of the effect of magnetic
field in the rapid damping of slow waves in the solar corona by heating/cooling
misbalance is evaluated and compared to the effects of thermal conduction. The
two timescales characterising the effect of misbalance are derived and
calculated for plasma systems with a range of typical coronal conditions. The
predicted damping times of slow waves from thermal misbalance in the solar
corona are found to be of the order of 10-100 minutes, coinciding with the wave
periods and damping times observed. Moreover the slow wave damping by thermal
misbalance is found to be comparable to the damping by field-aligned thermal
conduction. We show that in the infinite field limit, the wave dynamics is
insensitive to the dependence of the heating function on the magnetic field,
and this approximation is found to be valid in the corona so long as the
magnetic field strength is greater than 10G for quiescent loops and plumes and
100G for hot and dense loops. In summary thermal misbalance may damp slow
magnetoacoustic waves rapidly in much of the corona, and its inclusion in our
understanding of slow mode damping may resolve discrepancies between
observations and theory relying on compressive viscosity and thermal conduction
alone.

concerning our universe and the validity of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model. Therefore, it is important to develop new techniques that
can exploit the huge quantity of data that future observations will give us
access to in the most effective way possible. For this reason, we decided to
investigate the development of a new method to treat weak lensing higher order
statistics, which are known to break degeneracy among cosmological parameters
thanks to their capability of probing the non-Gaussian properties of the shear
field. In particular, the proposed method directly applies to the observed
quantity, i.e., the noisy galaxy ellipticity. We produced simulated lensing
maps with different sets of cosmological parameters and used them to measure
higher order moments, Minkowski functionals, Betti numbers, and other
statistics related to graph theory. This allowed us to construct datasets with
different size, precision, and smoothing. We then applied several machine
learning algorithms to determine which method best predicts the actual
cosmological parameters associated with each simulation. The best model
resulted to be simple multidimensional linear regression. We used this model to
compare the results coming from the different datasets and found out that we
can measure with good accuracy the majority of the parameters that we
considered. We also investigated the relation between each higher order
estimator and the different cosmological parameters for several signal-to-noise
thresholds and redshifts bins. Given the promising results, we consider this
approach as a valuable resource, worth of further development.

rotation of the degenerate core after core helium burning and reduced mass-loss
rates in massive asymptotic giant-branch stars. We compare our findings with
the predictions from ultra-massive white dwarfs resulting from the merger of
two equal-mass carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs, by assuming complete mixing
between them and a carbon-oxygen core for the merged remnant. The resulting
ultra-massive carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs evolve markedly slower than their

  journal",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We prove the existence of an oblivious routing scheme that is
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$-competitive in terms of $(congestion + dilation)$, thus
resolving a well-known question in oblivious routing.
  Concretely, consider an undirected network and a set of packets each with its
own source and destination. The objective is to choose a path for each packet,
from its source to its destination, so as to minimize $(congestion +
dilation)$, defined as follows: The dilation is the maximum path hop-length,
and the congestion is the maximum number of paths that include any single edge.
The routing scheme obliviously and randomly selects a path for each packet
independent of (the existence of) the other packets. Despite this
obliviousness, the selected paths have $(congestion + dilation)$ within a
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ factor of the best possible value. More precisely, for
any integer hop-bound $h$, this oblivious routing scheme selects paths of
length at most $h \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ and is $\mathrm{poly}(\log
n)$-competitive in terms of $congestion$ in comparison to the best possible
$congestion$ achievable via paths of length at most $h$ hops. These paths can
be sampled in polynomial time.
  This result can be viewed as an analogue of the celebrated oblivious routing
results of R\""{a}cke [FOCS 2002, STOC 2008], which are $O(\log n)$-competitive
in terms of $congestion$, but are not competitive in terms of $dilation$.

disease causing parkinsonian symptoms. Altered DNA methylation of the
microtubule-associated protein tau gene correlates with the expression changes
in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease brains. However, few studies
examine the sequences beyond the constitutive promoter.Objectives: Because
activating different microtubule associated protein tau gene control regions
via methylation might regulate the differential tau expression constituting the
specific signatures of individual tauopathies, we compared methylation of a
candidate promoter, intron 0.Methods: We assessed DNA methylation in the brains
of patients with different tauopathies (35 Alzheimer's disease, 10 corticobasal
degeneration, and 18 PSP) and 19 controls by intron 0 pyrosequencing. We also
evaluated methylation in an independent cohort of 11 PSP cases and 12 controls.
Frontal (affected by tau pathology) and occipital (unaffected) cortices were
analyzed.Results: In the initial samples, one CpG island site in intron 0
(CpG1) showed significant hypomethylation in PSP-affected frontal cortices when
compared with controls (p = 0.022). Such hypomethylation was observed in
replicate samples, but not in occipital cortices or other tauopathies. PSP and
control samples (combining the initial and replicate samples) remained
significantly different after adjustment for potential confounding factors
(age, H1/H1 diplotype; p = 0.0005). PSP-affected tissues exhibited
microtubule-associated protein tau RNA hyperexpression when compared with
controls (p = 0.004), although no correlation with CpG1 methylation was
observed.Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that regions other than
the constitutive promoter may be involved in microtubule-associated protein tau
gene regulation in tauopathies and that intron 0 hypomethylation may be a
specific epigenetic signature of PSP. These preliminary findings require
confirmation.

we report on five days of observations during which we detected three
thermonuclear (Type-I) X-ray bursts, identifying the system as a neutron star
LMXB. Time-resolved spectroscopy of the three Type-I bursts revealed typical
characteristics expected for these phenomena. All three Type-I bursts show slow
rises and long decays, indicative of mixed H/He fuel. We find no strong
evidence that any of the Type-I bursts reached the Eddington Luminosity;
however, under the assumption that the brightest X-ray burst underwent
photospheric radius expansion, we estimate a <12.4kpc upper limit for the
distance. We searched for burst oscillations during the Type-I bursts from MAXI
J1807+132 and found none (<10% amplitude upper limit at 95% confidence level).
Finally, we found that the brightest Type-I burst shows a ~1.6sec pause during
the rise. This pause is similar to one recently found with NICER in a bright
Type-I burst from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The
fact that Type-I bursts from both sources can show this type of pause suggests
that the origin of the pauses is independent of the composition of the burning
fuel, the peak luminosity of the Type-I bursts, or whether the NS is an X-ray

From the bulk characterisation we observe a temperature and frequency range
with two distinct relaxation-like features, leading to high and even 'colossal'
values for the dielectric permittivity. One feature trivially originates from
the formation of a Schottky barrier at the electrode-sample interface, whereas
the second one relates to an internal barrier layer capacitance (BLC). The
calculated volume fraction of the internal BLC (of 8 %) is in good agreement
with the observed volume fraction of insulating domain walls (DWs). While it is
established that insulating DWs can give rise to high dielectric constants,
studies typically focused on proper ferroelectrics where electric fields can
remove the DWs. In h-ErMnO$_3$, by contrast, the insulating DWs are
topologically protected, facilitating operation under substantially higher
electric fields. Our findings provide the basis for a conceptually new approach

the characterisation of such atmospheres. Previous analyses of its transmission
spectrum from the Kepler, Hubble (HST), and Spitzer space telescopes data using
both retrieval algorithms and forward-modelling suggest the presence of H$_2$O
and an H$_2$--He atmosphere, but have not detected other gases, such as CH$_4$.
  We present simulations of the atmosphere of K2-18 b using Exo-REM, our
self-consistent 1D radiative-equilibrium model, using a large grid of
atmospheric parameters to infer constraints on its chemical composition.
  We show that our simulations favour atmospheric metallicities between 40 and
500 times solar and indicate, in some cases, the formation of H$_2$O-ice
clouds, but not liquid H$_2$O clouds. We also confirm the findings of our
previous study, which showed that CH$_4$ absorption features nominally dominate
the transmission spectrum in the HST spectral range. We compare our results
with results from retrieval algorithms and find that the H$_2$O-dominated
spectrum interpretation is either due to the omission of CH$_4$ absorptions or
a strong overfitting of the data. Finally, we investigated different scenarios
that would allow for a CH$_4$-depleted atmosphere. We were able to fit the data
to those scenarios, finding, however, that it is very unlikely for K2-18b to
have a high internal temperature. A low C/O ratio ($\approx$ 0.01--0.1) allows
for H$_2$O to dominate the transmission spectrum and can fit the data but so
far, this set-up lacks a physical explanation. Simulations with a C/O ratio $<$
0.01 are not able to fit the data satisfactorily.

study their convergence, the idea of strong convexity and sequential criteria
for gH-continuity of interval-valued function are illustrated. In the sequel, a
new definition of gH-differentiability for interval-valued functions is also
proposed. The new definition of gH-differentiability is described with the help
of a newly defined concept of linear interval-valued function. It is noticed
that the proposed gH-differentiability is superior to the existing ones. For a
gH-differentiable interval-valued function, the relation of convexity with the
gH-gradient of an interval-valued function and an optimality condition of an
interval optimization problem are derived. For the derived optimality
condition, a notion of efficient direction for interval-valued functions is
introduced. The idea of efficient direction is used to develop the proposed
gradient methods. As an application of the proposed methods, the least square
problem for interval-valued data by W-gH-gradient efficient method is solved.
The proposed method for least square problems is illustrated by a polynomial
fitting and a logistic curve fitting.

  2021 (FL-ICML'21)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is an emerging practical framework for effective and
scalable machine learning among multiple participants, such as end users,
organizations and companies. However, most existing FL or distributed learning
frameworks have not well addressed two important issues together: collaborative
fairness and adversarial robustness (e.g. free-riders and malicious
participants). In conventional FL, all participants receive the global model
(equal rewards), which might be unfair to the high-contributing participants.
Furthermore, due to the lack of a safeguard mechanism, free-riders or malicious
adversaries could game the system to access the global model for free or to
sabotage it. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust and Fair Federated
Learning (RFFL) framework to achieve collaborative fairness and adversarial
robustness simultaneously via a reputation mechanism. RFFL maintains a
reputation for each participant by examining their contributions via their
uploaded gradients (using vector similarity) and thus identifies
non-contributing or malicious participants to be removed. Our approach
differentiates itself by not requiring any auxiliary/validation dataset.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that RFFL can achieve high
fairness and is very robust to different types of adversaries while achieving
competitive predictive accuracy.

increase loss weight of positive samples in classification task training. Also
the joint of classification score and object confidence will be used to guide
NMS. Our method can not only improve classification task, but also ease

insights on stellar formation patterns. The amount of data from current and
upcoming surveys calls for robust and objective procedures to detect structure,
so the results can be statistically analysed and different regions compared. We
provide the community with a tool able to detect the small scale significant
structure, above random expectation, in star-forming regions, which could be
the imprint of the stellar formation process. The tool makes use of the one
point correlation function and of nearest neighbour statistics to determine the
parameters for the DBSCAN algorithm. The procedure successfully detects
significant small scale substructures in heterogeneous regions, fulfilling the
goals it was designed for, and providing very reliable structures. The analysis
of regions close to complete spatial randomness ($Q \in [0.7,0.87]$) shows
that, even when some structure is present and recovered, it is hardly
distinguishable from spurious detection in homogeneous regions due to
projection effects. Interpretation should thus be done with care. For
concentrated regions, we detect a main structure surrounded by smaller ones,
corresponding to the core plus some Poisson fluctuations around it. We argue
that these structures do not correspond to the small compact regions we are
looking for. In some realistic cases, a more complete hierarchical, multi-scale
analysis would be needed to capture the complexity of the region. We have
developed implementations of our procedure, and a catalogue of the NESTs
(Nested Elementary STructures) detected by it in four star-forming regions
(Taurus, IC 348, Upper Scorpius, and Carina), which are publicly available to
the community. Implementations of the 3D, and up to 6D versions of the
procedure including proper movements are in progress, and will be provided as

key concepts of systemic angular momentum losses are first discussed in the
framework of the secular evolution of Cataclysmic Binaries. MSP binaries with
compact companions represent end-points of previous evolution. In the class of
systems characterized by short orbital period and low companion mass, we may
instead be catching the recycling phase `in the act'. These systems are in fact
either MSP, or low mass X--ray binaries (LMXB), some of which accreting X-ray
MSP (AMXP), or even `transitional' systems from the accreting to the radio MSP
stage. The donor structure is affected by irradiation due to X-rays from the
accreting NS, or by the high fraction of MSP rotational energy loss emitted in
the gamma rays range of the energy spectrum. X-ray irradiation leads to cyclic
LMXB stages, causing super-Eddington mass transfer rates during the first
phases of the companion evolution, and, possibly coupled with the angular
momentum carried away by the non-accreted matter, helps to explain the high
positive orbital period derivatives of some LMXB systems and account for the
(apparently) different birthrates of LMXB and MSP. Irradiation by the MSP may
be able to drive the donor to a stage in which either radio-ejection (in the
redbacks) or mass loss due to the companion expansion, and `evaporation' may
govern the evolution to the black widow stage and to the final disruption of

studies on real-world data sets from SMs measurements in the worst-case

three-dimensional (3D) flexible membrane immersed in an unsteady separated flow
at moderate Reynolds numbers. We employ a body-conforming variational FSI
solver based on the recently developed partitioned iterative scheme for the
coupling of turbulent fluid flow with nonlinear structural dynamics. Of
particular interest is to understand the flow-excited instability of a 3D
flexible membrane as a function of the non-dimensional mass ratio, Reynolds
number and aeroelastic number. For a wide range of the parameters, we examine
two distinctive stability regimes of fluid-membrane interaction:
deformed-steady state (DSS) and dynamic balance state (DBS). We propose
stability phase diagrams to demarcate the DSS and DBS regimes for the parameter
space of mass ratio vs. Reynolds number and mass ratio vs. aeroelastic number.
Based on the aeroelastic mode analysis, we observe a frequency synchronization
between the vortex shedding frequency and the membrane vibration frequency
which leads to self-sustained vibrations in the dynamic balance state. To
characterize the origin of the frequency lock-in, we derive an approximate
analytical formula for the nonlinear natural frequency by considering the added
mass effect and employing a large deflection theory for a simply supported
rectangular membrane. Through our systematic high-fidelity numerical
investigation, we find that the onset of the membrane vibration and the mode
transition has a dependence on the frequency lock-in between the natural
frequency of the tensioned membrane and the vortex shedding frequency or its
harmonics. These findings on the fluid-elastic instability of membranes have
implications for the design and development of control strategies for membrane
wing-based unmanned systems and drones.

that the population covariance matrices assumed to be non-random or random but
independent of the random data matrix in statistics and random matrix theory

work [25, 13] by using the techniques of free probability theory. Since,

which are independent of the data matrices, its applicability has to be
justified. The justification has been given in [22] for Gaussian data matrices
with independent entries, a standard analytical model of free probability, by
using a version of the techniques of random matrix theory. In this paper we use
another, more streamlined, version of the techniques of random matrix theory to
generalize the results of [22] to the case where the entries of the synaptic

Predictive Control (MPC) for linear time-invariant systems under additive

partially inferred from data. We propose a novel online learning based
risk-averse stochastic MPC framework in which Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
constraints on system states are required to hold for a family of distributions
called an ambiguity set. The ambiguity set is constructed from disturbance data
by leveraging a Dirichlet process mixture model that is self-adaptive to the
underlying data structure and complexity. Specifically, the structural property
of multimodality is exploit-ed, so that the first- and second-order moment
information of each mixture component is incorporated into the ambiguity set. A
novel constraint tightening strategy is then developed based on an equivalent
reformulation of distributionally ro-bust CVaR constraints over the proposed
ambiguity set. As more data are gathered during the runtime of the controller,
the ambiguity set is updated online using real-time disturbance data, which
enables the risk-averse stochastic MPC to cope with time-varying disturbance
distributions. The online variational inference algorithm employed does not
require all collected data be learned from scratch, and therefore the proposed
MPC is endowed with the guaranteed computational complexity of online learning.
The guarantees on recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the
proposed MPC are established via a safe update scheme. Numerical examples are
used to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MPC.

detection of non-overlapping ellipses from edge points. The methods introduce
new developments in: (i) robust Monte Carlo-based ellipse fitting to
2-dimensional (2D) points in the presence of outliers; (ii) detection of
non-overlapping ellipse from 2D edge points; and (iii) extraction of cylinder
from 3D point clouds. The proposed methods were thoroughly compared with
established state-of-the-art methods, using simulated and real-world datasets,
through the design of four sets of original experiments. It was found that the
proposed robust ellipse detection was superior to four reliable robust methods,
including the popular least median of squares, in both simulated and real-world
datasets. The proposed process for detecting non-overlapping ellipses achieved
F-measure of 99.3% on real images, compared to F-measures of 42.4%, 65.6%, and
59.2%, obtained using the methods of Fornaciari, Patraucean, and Panagiotakis,
respectively. The proposed cylinder extraction method identified all detectable
mechanical pipes in two real-world point clouds, obtained under laboratory, and
industrial construction site conditions. The results of this investigation show
promise for the application of the proposed methods for automatic extraction of
circular targets from images and pipes from point clouds.

Natural Language Processing (NLP). As the size of attention-based models has
been scaling with the available computational resources, a number of pruning
techniques have been developed to detect and to exploit sparseness in such
models in order to make them more efficient. The majority of such efforts have
focused on looking for attention patterns and then hard-coding them to achieve
sparseness, or pruning the weights of the attention mechanisms based on
statistical information from the training data. Here, we marry these two lines
of research by proposing Attention Pruning (AP): a novel pruning framework that
collects observations about the attention patterns in a fixed dataset and then
induces a global sparseness mask for the model. This can save 90% of the
attention computation for language modelling and about 50% for machine
translation and for solving GLUE tasks, while maintaining the quality of the
results. Moreover, using our method, we discovered important distinctions
between self- and cross-attention patterns, which could guide future NLP
research in attention-based modelling. Our framework can in principle speed up
any model that uses attention mechanism, thus helping develop better models for
existing or for new NLP applications. Our implementation is available at

challenges of computing students in one private University in the Philippines
during the period where the entire Luzon region was placed under the Enhanced

through MS Forms Pro was performed to identify the experiences of students in
online learning. The survey ran from March 16 to March 18, 2020, which yielded
a total of 300 responses. Descriptive statistics revealed that the top three
barriers and challenges encountered by students were 1. the difficulty of
clarifying topics or discussions with the professors, 2.the lack of study or
working area for doing online activities, and 3. the lack of a good Internet
connection for participating in online activities. It can be concluded that
both students and faculty members were not fully prepared to undergo full
online learning. More so, some faculty members may have failed to adapt to the
needs of the students in an online learning environment. While the primary data
of the study mainly came from the students, it would also be an excellent

theoretically the behaviour of such partially active electro-active polymer. We
address two problems: (i) the electrostatic elastica including geometric
non-linearities and partially electro-active strip using a variational
approach. We propose a new interpretation of the equations of deformation, by
drawing analogies with biological growth, in which the effect of the electric
voltage is seen as a change in the reference stress-free state. (ii) we explain
the nature of the distribution of electrostatic forces on this simple system,

wellbeing. Time series data from multiple modalities such as physiological and
motion sensor data have proven to be integral for measuring and quantifying
emotions. Monitoring emotional trajectories over long periods of time inherits
some critical limitations in relation to the size of the training data. This
shortcoming may hinder the development of reliable and accurate machine
learning models. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework to
tackle the limitation in performing emotional state recognition on multiple
multimodal datasets: 1) encoding multivariate time series data into coloured
images; 2) leveraging pre-trained object recognition models to apply a Transfer
Learning (TL) approach using the images from step 1; 3) utilising a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion classification from
physiological data; 4) concatenating the pre-trained TL model with the 1D CNN.
Furthermore, the possibility of performing TL to infer stress from
physiological data is explored by initially training a 1D CNN using a large
physical activity dataset and then applying the learned knowledge to the target
dataset. We demonstrate that model performance when inferring real-world
wellbeing rated on a 5-point Likert scale can be enhanced using our framework,
resulting in up to 98.5% accuracy, outperforming a conventional CNN by 4.5%.
Subject-independent models using the same approach resulted in an average of
72.3% accuracy (SD 0.038). The proposed CNN-TL-based methodology may overcome
problems with small training datasets, thus improving on the performance of
conventional deep learning methods.
