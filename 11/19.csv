networks poses a tremendous hurdle in the widespread adoption of deep learning
in safety and security-critical domains. While adversarial defense mechanisms
have been proposed since the discovery of the adversarial vulnerability issue
of deep neural networks, there is a long path to fully understand and address
this issue. In this study, we hypothesize that part of the reason for the
incredible effectiveness of adversarial attacks is their ability to implicitly
tap into and exploit the gradient flow of a deep neural network. This innate
ability to exploit gradient flow makes defending against such attacks quite
challenging. Motivated by this hypothesis we argue that if a deep neural
network architecture can explicitly tap into its own gradient flow during the
training, it can boost its defense capability significantly. Inspired by this
fact, we introduce the concept of self-gradient networks, a novel deep neural
network architecture designed to be more robust against adversarial
perturbations. Gradient flow information is leveraged within self-gradient
networks to achieve greater perturbation stability beyond what can be achieved
in the standard training process. We conduct a theoretical analysis to gain
better insights into the behaviour of the proposed self-gradient networks to
illustrate the efficacy of leverage this additional gradient flow information.
The proposed self-gradient network architecture enables much more efficient and
effective adversarial training, leading to faster convergence towards an
adversarially robust solution by at least 10X. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of self-gradient networks when compared with state-of-the-art
adversarial learning strategies, with 10% improvement on the CIFAR10 dataset
under PGD and CW adversarial perturbations.

and power an industry generating hundreds of billions of dollars a year in
revenue. Auction theory has historically focused on the question of designing
the best way to sell a single item to potential buyers, with the concurrent
objectives of maximizing revenue generated or welfare created. Theoretical
results in this area have typically relied on some prior Bayesian knowledge
agents were assumed to have on each-other. This assumption is no longer
satisfied in new markets such as online advertising: similar items are sold
repeatedly, and agents are unaware of each other or might try to manipulate
each-other. On the other hand, statistical learning theory now provides tools
to supplement those missing pieces of information given enough data, as agents
can learn from their environment to improve their strategies. This survey
covers recent advances in learning in repeated auctions, starting from the
traditional economic study of optimal one-shot auctions with a Bayesian prior.
We then focus on the question of learning optimal mechanisms from a dataset of
bidders' past values. The sample complexity as well as the computational
efficiency of different methods will be studied. We will also investigate
online variants where gathering data has a cost to be accounted for, either by
seller or buyers (""earning while learning""). Later in the survey, we will
further assume that bidders are also adaptive to the mechanism as they interact
repeatedly with the same seller. We will show how strategic agents can actually
manipulate repeated auctions, to their own advantage. All the questions
discussed in this survey are grounded in real-world applications and many of
the ideas and algorithms we describe are used every day to power the Internet
economy.

Regional forecasts of patient demand are commonly available as a Poisson random

trained in such a fashion do not require expert-defined action spaces, but they
have to deal with large action spaces and long trajectories, making RL
impractical. Using the latent space of a variational model as action space
alleviates this problem. However, current approaches use an uninformed prior
for training and optimize the latent distribution solely on the context. It is
therefore unclear whether the latent representation truly encodes the
characteristics of different actions. In this paper, we explore three ways of
leveraging an auxiliary task to shape the latent variable distribution: via
pre-training, to obtain an informed prior, and via multitask learning. We
choose response auto-encoding as the auxiliary task, as this captures the
generative factors of dialogue responses while requiring low computational cost
and neither additional data nor labels. Our approach yields a more
action-characterized latent representations which support end-to-end dialogue
policy optimization and achieves state-of-the-art success rates. These results
warrant a more wide-spread use of RL in end-to-end dialogue models.

family members to spread in orbital semimajor axis with a rate often inversely
proportional to their diameter. This size dependent semimajor axis drift causes
family members to form structures in the semimajor axis vs inverse diameter
plane that have the shape of the letter V. The V-shape method consists in
finding the borders of such V-shapes of unknown center and opening. Although
successfully employed to find some very old families in the inner main asteroid
belt, the V-shape searching method is very sensitive to many parameters. In
this work, we first created and evolved a synthetic asteroid family over
billions of years. Then, by adding uncertainties to semimajor axis and diameter
of the evolved synthetic family components, we randomly generated additional 99
similar, but not perfectly V-shaped, family clones. We chose a fairly low
initial velocity dispersion of 20 m/s for our family. Thus, we can more easily
relate the spreading in semimajor axis with the family's age (slope of the
evolving V). A synthetic background with an initially randomly distributed
components was also created and evolved for 100 Myr. Thus, by setting different
levels of ratio of the synthetic family and background asteroids, we derived a
detection efficiency map for the V-shape method and determined how sensitive
the results can be based on signal-to-noise levels. We also determined optimal
parameter values for the method's efficiency. We found that, families older
than ~3 Gyr are likely undetectable, with a method efficiency of 50% or less,
whereas younger families (0.5--2.5 Gyr) are more easily detected by the method,
with an efficiency of >80%.

natural question to ask whether they satisfy some form of the topological
recursion. The world of unitary-invariant observables is however much richer in
tensor models than in matrix models. It is therefore a priori unclear which set
of observables could satisfy the topological recursion. Such a set of
observables was identified a few years ago in the context of the quartic
melonic model by the first author and Dartois. It was shown to satisfy an
extension of the topological recursion introduced by Borot and called the
blobbed topological recursion. Here we show that this set of observables is
present in arbitrary tensor models which have non-vanishing couplings for the
quartic melonic interactions. It satisfies the blobbed topological recursion in
a universal way, i.e. independently of the choices of the other interactions.
In combinatorial terms, the correlation functions describe stuffed maps with
colored boundary components. The specifics of the model only appear in the
generating functions of the stuffings and the blobbed topological recursion
only requires them to have well-defined $1/N$ expansions. The spectral curve is
a disjoint union of Gaussian spectral curves, with the cylinder function
receiving an additional holomorphic part. This result is achieved via a
perturbative rewriting of tensor models as multi-matrix models due to the first
author, Lionni and Rivasseau. It is then possible to formally integrate all
degrees of freedom except those which enter the topological recursion, meaning
interpreting the Feynman graphs as stuffed maps. We further provide new
expressions to relate the expectations of $U(N)^d$-invariant observables on the
tensor and matrix sides.

Light curves of TDEs are related to orbital properties of stars falling SMBHs.
We study the origin, density, and velocity distributions of bound and unbound
stars in the nuclear star cluster, which are causing TDEs as a function of
their orbital eccentricity $e$ and energy $E$. These quantities determine near
the SMBH the ratio of the orbit's pericenter to tidal disruption radii (denoted
as penetration factor, $\beta$). We develop an analytical model for the density
and velocity distribution of such stars in the cluster, which agrees well with
N-body experiments. Our model extends classical models of angular momentum
diffusion in the loss cone. We also derive an analytical model for three
characteristic eccentricities in the loss cone: the minimum and maximum value
for given $\beta$, respectively, and $e_{\rm lcb}$, which represents the
orbital eccentricity defining the boundary between empty and full loss cone
regimes. With N-body experiments, we show that stars causing TDEs are
distributed between these eccentricity limits on the $e-\beta$ plane. Moreover,
we find most of the bound stars between $e_{\rm lcb}$ and $e=1$ (i.e., the full
loss cone regime), whereas the remaining bound stars are originating from the
empty loss cone regime. This is consistent with the loss cone theory. We
propose that the $e-\beta$ distribution of stars in a star cluster or galactic

the most fundamental problem is to understand the hierarchical organization of

described by a universal law due to Zipf, but whose validity has been
challenged by recent empirical studies. A theoretical model must also be able
to explain the relatively frequent rises and falls of cities and civilizations,

stochastic equation for modelling population growth in cities, which we
construct from an empirical analysis of recent datasets (for Canada, France, UK

city growth. This equation predicts a complex shape for the city distribution
and shows that Zipf's law does not hold in general due to finite-time effects,
implying a more complex organization of cities. It also predicts the existence
of multiple temporal variations in the city hierarchy, in agreement with
observations. Our result underlines the importance of rare events in the
evolution of complex systems and at a more practical level in urban planning.

artificial intelligence (AI) and robots in everyday life is increasing.
However, when interacting in such complex human environments, the failure of
intelligent systems, such as robots, can be inevitable, requiring recovery
assistance from users. In this work, we develop automated, natural language
explanations for failures encountered during an AI agents' plan execution.
These explanations are developed with a focus of helping non-expert users
understand different point of failures to better provide recovery assistance.
Specifically, we introduce a context-based information type for explanations
that can both help non-expert users understand the underlying cause of a system
failure, and select proper failure recoveries. Additionally, we extend an
existing sequence-to-sequence methodology to automatically generate our
context-based explanations. By doing so, we are able develop a model that can
generalize context-based explanations over both different failure types and
failure scenarios.

network - is a problem with a variety of applications. Most existing work
towards community detection focuses on a single network. However, many
real-life applications naturally yield what we refer to as Triple Networks.
Triple Networks are comprised of two networks, and the network of bipartite
connections between their nodes. In this paper, we formulate and investigate
the problem of finding Connected-Dense-Connected subgraph (CDC), a subnetwork
which has the largest density in the bipartite network and whose sets of end
points within each network induce connected subnetworks. These patterns
represent communities based on the bipartite association between the networks.
To our knowledge, such patterns cannot be detected by existing algorithms for a
single network or heterogeneous networks. We show that finding CDC subgraphs is
NP-hard and develop novel heuristics to obtain feasible solutions, the fastest
of which is O(nlogn+m) with n nodes and m edges. We also study different
variations of the CDC subgraphs. We perform experiments on a variety of real
and synthetic Triple Networks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
the developed methods. Employing these heuristics, we demonstrate how to
identify communities of similar opinions and research interests, and factors
influencing communities.

We start with the definition of the photonic zilch current in chiral kinetic
theory framework and work out field-theoretical definition of the fermionic
zilch using the Wigner function formalism. This object has similar properties
to the photonic zilch and is conserved in the non-interacting theory. We also
show that, in full analogy with a case of photons, the fermionic zilch acquires
a non-trivial contribution due to the medium rotation - zilch vortical effect
(ZVE) for fermions. Combined with a previously studied ZVE for photons, these
results form a wider set of chiral effects parameterized by the spin of the

ZVE, its possible relation to the anomalies in the underlying microscopic
theory and possible application for studying the spin polarization in chiral

(MFM) device deployment in an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) model with and

monitoring system was developed to analyze the MFM deployment procedure
performed by a qualified radiologist. The pressure and flow rate evolution
during the procedure was recorded. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments
were conducted on models with and without MFM device to evaluate and compare
flow patterns and local flow velocity and vorticity in the aneurysm. Results:
The experiments revealed no significant change in pressure and flow rate during
and after deployment of the MFM device. The flow rate of the incorporated
branch was fully preserved. On all models, the aneurysmal flow velocity was
significantly reduced. In addition, the device modified local flow patterns,
reducing vorticity and better feeding the incorporated branch. Conclusion: This
first experimental study provides the basis for a better understanding of the
mechanism of the MFM device, which allows intra-aneurysmal flow decrease while
preserving incorporated branch and reducing the risk of endoleak type II. The
experimental system developed for this study was effective in simulating an

The interstellar extinction and elemental abundances provide crucial
constraints on the composition, size and quantity of interstellar dust. Most of
the extinction modeling efforts have assumed the total abundances (both in gas
and in dust) of the dust-forming elements---known as the ""interstellar
abundances"", the ""interstellar reference abundances"", or the ""cosmic
abundances""---to be solar and the gas-phase abundances to be independent of the
interstellar environments. However, it remains unclear if the solar abundances
are an appropriate representation of the interstellar abundances. Meanwhile,
the gas-phase abundances are known to exhibit appreciable variations with the
local interstellar environments. In this work we explore the viability of the
abundances of B stars, the solar and protosolar abundances, and the protosolar
abundances augmented by Galactic chemical enrichment (GCE) as an appropriate
representation of the interstellar abundances by quantitatively examining the
extinction and elemental abundances of ten interstellar lines of sight for
which both the extinction curves and the gas-phase abundances of all the major
dust-forming elements (i.e., C, O, Mg, Si and Fe) have been observationally
determined. Instead of assuming a specific dust model and then fitting the
observed extinction curves, for each sightline we apply the model-independent
Kramers-Kronig relation, which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to
the total dust volume, to place a lower limit on the dust depletion. This,
together with the observationally-derived gas-phase abundances, allows us to
rule out the B-star, solar, and protosolar abundances as the interstellar
reference standard. We conclude that the GCE-augmented protosolar abundances
are a viable representation of the interstellar abundances.

real-valued function $f$ over an arbitrary partially ordered domain as a
collection of Boolean functions over the same domain, roughly capturing the
distance of $f$ to monotonicity and the structure of violations of $f$ to
monotonicity.
  We apply our generalized isoperimetric inequality to improve algorithms for
testing monotonicity and approximating the distance to monotonicity for
real-valued functions. Our tester for monotonicity has query complexity
$\widetilde{O}(\min(r \sqrt{d},d))$, where $r$ is the size of the image of the
input function. (The best previously known tester, by Chakrabarty and Seshadhri
(STOC 2013), makes $O(d)$ queries.) Our tester is nonadaptive and has 1-sided
error. We show a matching lower bound for nonadaptive, 1-sided error testers
for monotonicity. We also show that the distance to monotonicity of real-valued
functions that are $\alpha$-far from monotone can be approximated nonadaptively
within a factor of $O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ with query complexity polynomial in
$1/\alpha$ and the dimension $d$. This query complexity is known to be nearly
optimal for nonadaptive algorithms even for the special case of Boolean

for a variety of theory-motivated shapes. We consider general arguments for 2D
and 3D surveys, with a particular emphasis on the CMB. A scale-invariant
$N$-point correlator can be measured with a signal-to-noise that naively scales
with the square root of the number of observed modes. This intuition generally
fails for two reasons. First, the signal-to-noise scaling is reduced due to the
blurring of the last scattering surface at short distances. This blurring is
caused by the combination of projection and damping, but the loss of signal is
not due to exponential decay, as both signal and noise are equally damped.
Second, the behavior of the $N$-point correlator in the squeezed and collapsed
(for $N>3$) limits can enhance the scaling of the signal-to-noise with the
resolution, even with a reduced range of momenta probing these limits. We
provide analytic estimates for all $N$-point correlators. We show that blurring
affects equilateral-like shapes much more than squeezed ones. We discuss under
what conditions the optimistic scalings in the collapsed limit can be
exploited. Lastly, we confirm our analytical estimates with numerical
calculations of the signal-to-noise for local, orthogonal and equilateral
bispectra, and local trispectra. We also show that adding polarization to
intensity data enhances the scaling for equilateral-like spectra.

variable models (HCDL) from data streams. There are three different levels of
changes for latent variable models: 1) the first level is the change in data
distribution for fixed latent variables, 2) the second one is that in the
distribution over latent variables, and 3) the third one is that in the number
of latent variables. It is important to detect these changes because we can
analyze the causes of changes by identifying which level a change comes from
(change interpretability). This paper proposes an information-theoretic
framework for detecting changes of the three levels in a hierarchical way. The
key idea to realize it is to employ the MDL (minimum description length) change
statistics for measuring the degree of change, in combination with DNML
(decomposed normalized maximum likelihood) code-length calculation. We give a
theoretical basis for making reliable alarms for changes. Focusing on
stochastic block models, we employ synthetic and benchmark datasets to
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of change
interpretability as well as change detection.

the first deep, blind, medium-wide interferometric surveys for neutral hydrogen
(HI) ever undertaken, extending our knowledge of HI emission to z=0.6. The
science goals of this medium-deep, medium-wide survey are extensive, including
the evolution of the neutral gas content of galaxies over the past 5 billion
years. Simulations predict nearly 3000 galaxies over 0<z<0.4 will be detected
directly in HI, with statistical detections extending to z=0.6. The survey
allows us to explore HI as a function of galaxy environment, with massive
groups and galaxy clusters within the survey volume. Additionally, the area is
large enough to contain as many as 50 local galaxies with HI mass $<10^8$ Msun,
which allows us to study the low-mass galaxy population. The 20 deg$^2$ main
survey area is centred on fields with exceptional multi-wavelength ancillary
data, with photometry ranging from optical through far-infrared wavelengths,
supplemented with multiple spectroscopic campaigns. We describe here the survey
design and the key science goals. We also show first results from the Early
Science observations, including kinematic modelling of individual sources,
along with the redshift, HI, and stellar mass ranges of the sample to date.

the dislocation vibration. The observed increase in attenuation from 1.2 K to a
peak near 0.3 K is independent of drive amplitude and reflects crossover from
overdamped to underdamped oscillation of dislocations pinned at network nodes.
Below 0.3 K, amplitude-dependent and hysteretic variations are observed in both
attenuation and speed. The attenuation decreases from the peak at 0.3 K to a
very small constant value below 70 mK at sufficiently low drive amplitudes of
ultrasound, while it remains a high value down to 15mK at the highest drive

effects of the thermal pinning and unpinning of dislocations by the impurities.
The binding energy between a dislocation line and a $^3$He atom is estimated to
be 0.35 K. The nonlinear and hysteretic behaviors at intermediate drive

large external magnetic fields. We explore two different configurations, with
the anisotropy either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, focusing
on the competition and interplay between the two. A detailed study of the RG
flow in the ground state reveals a rich structure where depending on which of
the two, anisotropy or magnetic field, is stronger, intermediate geometries
with approximate AdS$_4\times \mathbb{R}$ and AdS$_3\times \mathbb{R}^2$

finite temperature, specifically in the dependence of the chiral transition
temperature on anisotropy and magnetic field, from which we infer the presence
of inverse magnetic and anisotropic catalyses of the chiral condensate.
Finally, we consider other salient observables in the theory, including the
quark-antiquark potential, shear viscosity, entanglement entropy and the
butterfly velocity. We demonstrate that they serve as good probes of the
theory, in particular, distinguishing between the effects of the magnetic field

velocity, which codifies how fast information propagates in the plasma,
exhibits a rich structure as a function of temperature, anisotropy and magnetic

Chandra data for 55 actively star-forming galaxies at D < 30 Mpc with gas-phase
metallicities spanning 12 + log(O/H) = 7-9.2. Within the galactic footprints,
our sample contains a total of 1311 X-ray point sources, of which ~49% are
expected to be HMXBs, with the remaining sources likely to be low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs; ~22%) and unrelated background sources (~29%). We construct a
model that successfully characterizes the average HMXB XLF over the full
metallicity range. We demonstrate that the SFR-normalized HMXB XLF shows clear
trends with metallicity, with steadily increasing numbers of luminous and
ultraluminous X-ray sources (logL(erg/s) = 38-40.5) with declining metallicity.
However, we find that the low-luminosity (logL(erg/s) = 36-38) HMXB XLF appears
to show a nearly constant SFR scaling and slope with metallicity. Our model
provides a revised scaling relation of integrated LX/SFR versus 12 + log(O/H)
and a new characterization of its the SFR-dependent stochastic scatter. The
general trend of this relation is broadly consistent with past studies based on
integrated galaxy emission; however, our model suggests that this relation is
driven primarily by the high-luminosity end of the HMXB XLF. Our results have
implications for binary population synthesis models, the nature of
super-Eddington accreting objects (e.g., ultraluminous X-ray sources), recent

nuclei bound in a lattice, $q_0 = \sqrt{2 m_N \omega_0}$ where $m_N$ is the
mass of the nucleus and $\omega_0$ is the optical phonon energy, an
intermediate scattering regime characterized by multi-phonon excitations
emerges. We study a greatly simplified model of a single nucleus in a harmonic

transfer $q$ is equal to the elastic value $q^2/(2m_N)$, the phonon occupation
number follows a Poisson distribution and thus the energy spread is $\Delta E =
q\sqrt{\omega_0/(2m_N)}$. This observation suggests that low-threshold
calorimetric detectors may have significantly increased sensitivity to sub-GeV
DM compared to the expectation from elastic scattering, even when the energy
threshold is above the single-phonon energy, by exploiting the tail of the
Poisson distribution for phonons above the elastic energy. We use a simple
model of electronic excitations to argue that this multi-phonon signal will
also accompany ionization signals induced from DM-electron scattering or the
Migdal effect. In well-motivated models where DM couples to a heavy,
kinetically-mixed dark photon, we show that these signals can probe
experimental milestones for cosmological DM production via thermal freeze-out,

as being due to the presence of a constant density `core', but it could also be
explained by the effects of Galactic tides. The latter interpretation has been
disfavoured because it is apparently inconsistent with the orbital parameters
and star formation history of Fornax. We revisit these arguments with the help
of the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We show that simulated
dwarfs with similar properties to Fornax are able to form stars after infall,
so that star formation is not necessarily a good tracer of infall time. We also
examine the constraints on the pericentre of Fornax and point out that small
pericentres (<50 kpc) are not currently ruled out by the data, allowing for
Fornax to be tidally influenced on its current orbit. Furthermore, we find that
some dwarfs with large orbital pericentres can be stripped prior to infall due
to interactions with more massive galaxies. Tidal effects lead to a reduction
in the dark matter density, while the profile remains cuspy.
Navarro-Frenk-White profiles are consistent with the kinematic data within
3$\sigma$ in the innermost regions, while profiles with shallow cusps or cores
provide a better fit. We predict that if the reduction of the dark matter
density in Fornax occurs, at least in part, because of the action of Galactic
tides, then tidal tails should be visible with a surface brightness limit of
$\sim35-36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ over a survey area of $\gtrsim$100 deg$^2$.

potentially one of the shortest WR binaries known to date. Such short-period
binary systems containing a WR star in low-metallicity environments are prime
candidate progenitors of black-hole (BH) mergers. By thoroughly analysing the

scenario for the 1.55-day system. BAT99 126 comprises at least four components.
The 1.55-day photometric signal originates in an eclipsing O+O binary of
spectral types O4 V and O6.5 V, and masses of 36+/-5 MSun and 15+/-2 MSun,
respectively. For the WR star, we derived a spectral type WN2.5-3 and reject
the previously reported 25.5-d period. We find evidence in the composite
spectra of a fourth component, a B1 V star, which shows radial velocity
variation. The configurations of the B-type star, WR star, and possible
additional undetected components remain unknown. We estimated the age of the
system to be 4.2 Myr. The O+O binary likely went through a phase of
conservative mass transfer and is currently a near-contact system. We show that
BAT99 126 is a multiple - quadruple or higher-order - system with a total
initial mass > 160 MSun. The 1.55-day O+O binary most likely will not evolve

Rydberg atoms have pointed to the existence of a new type of dynamical behavior
that challenged the conventional paradigms of integrability and thermalization.
This novel collective effect has been named quantum many-body scars by analogy
with weak ergodicity breaking of a single particle inside a stadium billiard.
In this overview, we provide a pedagogical introduction to quantum many-body
scars and highlight the newly emerged connections with the semiclassical
quantization of many-body systems. We discuss the relation between scars and
more general routes towards weak violations of ergodicity due to ""embedded""
algebras and non-thermal eigenstates, and highlight possible applications of
scars in quantum technology.

form coset pairs with respect to the meromorphic $E_{8,1}$ CFT. Evidence for
this has taken the form of holomorphic bilinear relations between the
characters. We propose that suitable 4-point functions of primaries in these
models also obey bilinear relations that combine them into current correlators
for $E_{8,1}$, and provide strong evidence that these relations hold in each
case. Different cases work out due to special identities involving tensor
invariants of the algebra or hypergeometric functions. In particular these
results verify previous calculations of correlators for exceptional WZW models,
which have rather subtle features. We also find evidence that the intermediate
vertex operator algebras A$_{0.5}$ and E$_{7.5}$, as well as the
three-character A$_{4,1}$ theory, also appear to satisfy the novel coset

strong-gravitational lenses and their counterpart time-delays in order to
precisely measure $H_0$ will become computationally expensive, and highly
complex. A complimentary approach is to study the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of time-delays where the global population of lenses is modelled
along with $H_0$. In this paper we use a suite of hydro-dynamical simulations
to estimate the CDF of time-delays from doubly-imaged quasars for a realistic
distribution of lenses. We find that the CDFs exhibit large amounts of
halo-halo variance, regulated by the density profile inner slope and the total
mass within $5$kpc. With the objective of fitting to data, we compress the CDFs
using Principal Component Analysis and fit a Gaussian Processes Regressor
consisting of three physical features: the redshift of the lens, $z_{\rm L}$;
the power law index of the halo, $\alpha$, and the mass within $5$kpc, plus
four cosmological features. Assuming a flat Universe, we fit our model to 27
doubly-imaged quasars finding $H_0=71^{+2}_{-3}$km/s/Mpc, $z_{\rm L} =
0.36_{-0.09}^{+0.2} $, $\alpha=-1.8_{-0.1}^{+0.1}$,
$\log(M(<5$kpc$)/M_\odot)=11.1_{-0.1}^{+0.1} $, $\Omega_{\rm M} =
0.3_{-0.04}^{+0.04} $ and $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. We
compare our estimates of $z_{\rm L}$ and $\log(M(<5$kpc$)/M_\odot)$ to the data
and find that within the sensitivity of the data, they are not systematically
biased. We generate mock CDFs and find with that the Vera Rubin Observatory
(VRO) could measure $\sigma/H_0$ to $<3\%$, limited by the precision of the
model. If we are to exploit fully VRO, we require simulations that sample a
larger proportion of the lens population, with a variety of feedback models,
exploring all possible systematics.

resounding no! All cosmological problems can be solved by a sequence of short
bursts of cosmic acceleration, interrupted by short epochs of decelerated
expansion. The spectrum of perturbations will still match the CMB and LSS if
the earliest stage of the last ${\cal O}(50)-{\cal O}(60)$ efolds is at least
${\cal O}(15)$ efolds long. Other stages can be considerably shorter. But as
long as they add up to ${\cal O}(50)-{\cal O}(60)$ efolds and the stages of
decelerated expansion in between them are shorter and also overall last less,
the ensuing cosmology will pass muster. The presence of the interruptions
resets the efold clock of each accelerating stage, and changes its value at the
CMB pivot point. This change opens up the theory space, loosening the bounds.
In particular some models that seem excluded at ${\cal N}=60$ fit very well as
shorter stages with ${\cal N}=30$. Interesting predictions are that both the
scalar and tensor spectra of perturbations are rapidly modified at short
wavelengths. These features could be tested with future CMB spectroscopy
searches and with short wavelength primordial gravity probes. The spatial
curvature in these models can be larger than the largest wavelength scalar
perturbations, because $\Omega_{\tt k}$ evolves differently than the scalar
perturbations $\frac{\delta \rho}{\rho}|_{\tt S}$. Finally, with many short
stages of accelerated expansion, the abundance of reheating products from
previous accelerated stages does not get completely wiped out. This implies
that the universe may contain additional populations of particles, more rare
than the visible ones, or even primordial black holes, created during a late
decelerated epoch before last reheating, which may be dark matter.

model to be solved is encoded in the coupling between the oscillators, and a
solution is offered by the steady state of the network. This approach relies on
the assumption that mode competition steers the network to the ground-state
solution of the Ising model. By considering a broad family of frustrated Ising
models, we show that the most-efficient mode does not correspond generically to
the ground state of the Ising model. We infer that networks of parametric
oscillators close to threshold are intrinsically not Ising solvers.
Nevertheless, the network can find the correct solution if the oscillators are
driven sufficiently above threshold, in a regime where nonlinearities play a
predominant role. We find that for all probed instances of the model, the
network converges to the ground state of the Ising model with a finite
probability.

theories (CFTs) in 1+1D, in which the driving Hamiltonian involves the
energy-momentum density spatially modulated by an arbitrary smooth function.
This generalizes earlier work which was restricted to the sine-square deformed
type of Floquet Hamiltonians, operating within a $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ sub-algebra.
Here we show remarkably that the problem remains soluble in this generalized
case which involves the full Virasoro algebra, based on a geometrical approach.
It is found that the phase diagram is determined by the stroboscopic
trajectories of operator evolution. The presence/absence of spatial fixed
points in the operator evolution indicates that the driven CFT is in a
heating/non-heating phase, in which the entanglement entropy grows/oscillates
in time. Additionally, the heating regime is further subdivided into a
multitude of phases, with different entanglement patterns and spatial
distribution of energy-momentum density, which are characterized by the number
of spatial fixed points. Phase transitions between these different heating
phases can be achieved simply by changing the duration of application of the
driving Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the general features with concrete CFT
examples and compare the results to lattice calculations and find remarkable
agreement.

and the observed dark matter relic abundance. In particular, the Kaluza-Klein
excitations of the new scalar particle, which is required to naturally obtain
fermion bulk masses through Yukawa-like interactions, can be the leading portal
to any fermion propagating into the bulk of the extra dimension and playing the
role of dark matter. Moreover, such scalar excitations will necessarily mix
with the Higgs boson, leading to modifications of the Higgs couplings and
branching ratios, and allowing the Higgs to mediate the coannihilation of the
fermionic dark matter. We study these effects and explore the viability of
fermionic dark matter in the presence of these new heavy scalar mediators both
in the usual freeze-out scenario and in the case where the freeze-out happens
during an early period of matter domination.

available mock data for spherical stellar systems. We focus on the recovery of
the density and velocity anisotropy as a function of radius, using either
line-of-sight velocity data only, or adding proper motion data. All methods
perform well on isotropic and tangentially anisotropic mock data, recovering
the density and velocity anisotropy within their 95% confidence intervals over
the radial range 0.25 < R/Rhalf < 4, where Rhalf is the half light radius.
However, radially-anisotropic mocks are more challenging. For line-of-sight
data alone, only methods that use information about the shape of the velocity
distribution function are able to break the degeneracy between the density
profile and the velocity anisotropy to obtain an unbiased estimate of both.
This shape information can be obtained through directly fitting a global phase
space distribution function, by using higher order 'Virial Shape Parameters',
or by assuming a Gaussian velocity distribution function locally, but
projecting it self-consistently along the line of sight. Including proper
motion data yields further improvements, and in this case, all methods give a
good recovery of both the radial density and velocity anisotropy profiles.

problems with this idea. In this chapter, two computer scientists survey what's
been done in algorithmic redistricting, discuss what doesn't work and highlight
approaches that show promise. This preprint was prepared as a chapter in the
forthcoming edited volume Political Geometry, an interdisciplinary collection
of essays on redistricting. (https://mggg.org/gerrybook)

Boundary (EB) states, which are distinct from the well-known topological and
non-Hermitian skin boundary states. EB states occur in the presence of
exceptional points, which are non-Hermitian critical points where eigenstates
coalesce and fail to span the Hilbert space. This eigenspace defectiveness not
only limits the accessibility of state information, but also interplays with
long-range order to give rise to singular propagators only possible in
non-Hermitian settings. Their resultant EB eigenstates are characterized by
robust anomalously large or negative occupation probabilities, unlike ordinary
Fermi sea states whose probabilities lie between zero and one. EB states remain
robust after a variety of quantum quenches and give rise to enigmatic negative
entanglement entropy contributions. Through suitable perturbations, the
coefficient of the logarithmic entanglement entropy scaling can be continuously
tuned. EB states represent a new avenue for robustness arising from geometric
defectiveness, independent of topological protection or non-reciprocal pumping.

and massless Wess-Zumino (WZ) model in perturbation theory. At the classical
level the model possesses ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal symmetry, which is
partially broken by quantum anomalies. The form of the anomalies and the part
of the symmetry they break depend on the multiplet of conserved currents used.
It was previously shown that the R-symmetry anomaly of the conformal current
multiplet induces an anomaly in Q-supersymmetry, which appears first in 4-point
functions. Here we confirm this result by an explicit 1-loop computation using
a supersymmetric Pauli-Villars regulator.
  The conformal current multiplet does not exist in the regulated theory
because the regulator breaks conformal invariance, R-symmetry and
S-supersymmetry explicitly. The minimal massive multiplet is the Ferrara-Zumino
(FZ) one and the supersymmetry preserved by the regulator is a specific field
dependent combination of Q- and S- supersymmetry of the conformal multiplet.
While this supersymmetry is non anomalous, conformal invariance, R-symmetry and
the original Q- and S-supersymmetries are explicitly broken by finite contact
terms, both in the regulated and renormalized theories.
  A conformal current multiplet does exist for the renormalized theory and may
be obtained from the FZ multiplet by a set of finite local counterterms that
eliminate the explicit symmetry breaking, thus restoring superconformal
invariance up to anomalies. However, this necessarily renders both Q- and
S-supersymmetries anomalous, as is manifest starting at 4-point functions of
conformal multiplet currents. The paper contains a detailed discussion of a
number of issues and subtleties related to Ward identities that may be useful
in a wider context.

analyze both binary soliton collisions and a soliton rotating around a central

were used to build operative parameter value series and their variation.
Conventional statistical analyses and fractal dimension analyses were performed
on the series. Statistical analyses indicated that the data did not follow a
Gauss (i.e. ""normal"") distribution, thus nonparametric statistical analyses
were chosen to describe data. The sequence of admitted daily admissions and
patients staying on each service were found to be a kind of random series of a
kind called random walks (Rw). Rw are sequences where what happens next ($
y_{t+\Delta t}$), depends on what happens now ($ y_{t}$) plus a random variable
($ \epsilon $), $ y_{t+\Delta t}= y_t + \epsilon $. Rw analysed with parametric
or non parametric statistics may simulate cycles and drifts which resemble
seasonal variations or fake trends. Globally, admitted patients Rws in LFFH,
were found to be determined by the time elapsed between daily discharges and
admissions. The factor determining LFH Rw were found to be the difference
between daily admissions and discharges. The analysis suggests discharges are
replaced by admissions with some random delay and that the random difference
determinants LFH Rws. The daily difference between hospitalised patients
follows the same statistical distribution as the daily difference between
admissions and discharges. These suggest that if the daily difference between
admissions and discharges is minimised, i.e., a patient is admitted without
delay when another is discharged, the number of admitted panties would
fluctuate less and the number of unoccupied beds would be reduced optimising
the Hospital service.

foundation offered by oscillator based grid-forming (GFM) controllers and
enables fast over-current limiting and fault ride-through (FRT). Control design
for effective FRT requires transient stability analysis. Existing transient
stability analysis methods and studies are limited in either considering only
current unconstrained scenarios or neglecting the simultaneous power angle and
voltage dynamics. Under current-constrained faults, the voltage and power angle
dynamics are strongly coupled and both play critical roles in determining
transient stability. Therefore, decoupled analysis of the two, typically used
in transient stability studies, does not offer comprehensive insight into the
system dynamics. In this work, the overall FRT method for uVOC is presented and
a comprehensive modeling and analysis method for transient stability is
developed under both current-saturated and unsaturated symmetrical AC faults.
We utilize phase-plane analysis of the overall system in a single graphical
representation to obtain holistic insights into the coupled voltage and power
angle dynamics. The FRT controller and the analysis method have been validated

first phase consists of medium-resolution spectroscopy of over 100 stars
selected from low-resolution surveys. This paper describes the selection
criteria, and the observing, classification and analysis methods. It presents
107 spectral classifications on the MK-like Drilling system and 106 coarse

non-LTE and line-blanketed LTE model atmospheres. For 75 stars, atmospheric
parameters have been derived for the first time. The sample may be divided into
6 distinct groups including the classical `helium-rich' sdO stars with spectral
types (Sp) sdO6.5 - sdB1 (74) comprising carbon-rich (35) and carbon-weak (39)
stars, very hot He-sdO's with Sp $\lesssim$ sdO6 (13), extreme helium stars
with luminosity class $\lesssim 5$ (5), intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs with
helium class 25 -- 35 (8), and intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs with helium
class $10 - 25$ (6). The last covers a narrow spectral range (sdB0 -- sdB1)
including two known and four candidate heavy-metal subdwarfs. Within other
groups are several stars of individual interest, including an extremely
metal-poor helium star, candidate double-helium subdwarf binaries, and a
candidate low-gravity He-sdO star.

integrating information from regions of the brain that are specialised to
individual sensory modalities. This allows for improved robustness and better
generalisation ability. In contrast, deep neural networks are usually designed
to process one particular information stream and susceptible to various types
of adversarial perturbations. While many methods exist for detecting and
defending against adversarial attacks, they do not generalise across a range of
attacks and negatively affect performance on clean, unperturbed data. We
developed a fusion model using a combination of background and foreground
features extracted in parallel from Places-CNN and Imagenet-CNN. We tested the
benefits of the fusion approach on preserving adversarial robustness for human
perceivable (e.g., Gaussian blur) and network perceivable (e.g.,
gradient-based) attacks for CIFAR-10 and MS COCO data sets. For gradient based
attacks, our results show that fusion allows for significant improvements in
classification without decreasing performance on unperturbed data and without
need to perform adversarial retraining. Our fused model revealed improvements
for Gaussian blur type perturbations as well. The increase in performance from
fusion approach depended on the variability of the image contexts; larger
increases were seen for classes of images with larger differences in their
contexts. We also demonstrate the effect of regularization to bias the
classifier decision in the presence of a known adversary. We propose that this
biologically inspired approach to integrate information across multiple
modalities provides a new way to improve adversarial robustness that can be
complementary to current state of the art approaches.

architecture that incorporates modality-specific inductive biases for the

cross-modal relations in a given pair of video and text. The disentanglement
achieved by our proposal gives the model more capacity to capture multi-modal
structures which result in captions with higher quality for videos. Our
experiments on two established video captioning datasets verifies the
effectiveness of the proposed approach based on automatic metrics. We further
conduct a human evaluation to measure the grounding and relevance of the

  a Graph","21 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SI stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce HITMIX, a new technique for network seed-set expansion, i.e.,
the problem of identifying a set of graph vertices related to a given seed-set
of vertices. We use the moments of the graph's hitting-time distribution to
quantify the relationship of each non-seed vertex to the seed-set. This
involves a deterministic calculation for the hitting-time moments that is
scalable in the number of graph edges and so avoids directly sampling a Markov
chain over the graph. The moments are used to fit a mixture model to estimate
the probability that each non-seed vertex should be grouped with the seed set.
This membership probability enables us to sort the non-seeds and threshold in a
statistically-justified way. To the best of our knowledge, HITMIX is the first
full statistical model for seed-set expansion that can give vertex-level
membership probabilities. While HITMIX is a global method, its linear
computation complexity in practice enables computations on large graphs. We
have a high-performance implementation, and we present computational results on
stochastic blockmodels and a small-world network from the SNAP repository. The
state of the art in this problem is a collection of recently developed local
methods, and we show that distinct advantages in solution quality are available
if our global method can be used. In practice, we expect to be able to run
HITMIX if the graph can be stored in memory.

method, MOdular FActorial Design (MOFA). MOFA pursues several rounds of HPO,
where each round alternates between exploration of hyperparameter space by
factorial design and exploitation of evaluation results by factorial analysis.
Each round first explores the configuration space by constructing a
low-discrepancy set of hyperparameters that cover this space well while
de-correlating hyperparameters, and then exploits evaluation results through
factorial analysis that determines which hyperparameters should be further
explored and which should become fixed in the next round. We prove that the
inference of MOFA achieves higher confidence than other sampling schemes. Each
individual round is highly parallelizable and hence offers major improvements
of efficiency compared to model-based methods. Empirical results show that MOFA
achieves better effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art

dialogue system. Building a DST module that is highly effective is still a
challenging issue, although significant progresses have been made recently.
This paper proposes a new approach to dialogue state tracking, referred to as
Seq2Seq-DU, which formalizes DST as a sequence-to-sequence problem. Seq2Seq-DU
employs two BERT-based encoders to respectively encode the utterances in the
dialogue and the descriptions of schemas, an attender to calculate attentions
between the utterance embeddings and the schema embeddings, and a decoder to
generate pointers to represent the current state of dialogue. Seq2Seq-DU has
the following advantages. It can jointly model intents, slots, and slot values;
it can leverage the rich representations of utterances and schemas based on
BERT; it can effectively deal with categorical and non-categorical slots, and
unseen schemas. In addition, Seq2Seq-DU can also be used in the NLU (natural
language understanding) module of a dialogue system. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets in different settings (SGD, MultiWOZ2.2, MultiWOZ2.1,
WOZ2.0, DSTC2, M2M, SNIPS, and ATIS) show that Seq2Seq-DU outperforms the
existing methods.

Clausius statement that heat does not spontaneously flow from cold to hot

statement in its plain form does not hold. First, for ergodic systems, the
energy transfer may be consistent with the statement on a coarse-grained time
scale, but be anomalously directed during time intervals shorter than the
thermalization time. In particular, when an initially colder system is brought
in contact to a hotter bath, the internal energy of the former increases with
time in a long run but not monotonically. Second, the heat transfer may not
respect the Clausius statement on any time-scale in non-ergodic systems due to
the formation of localized vibrational modes. We illustrate the two scenarios
with a familiar model of an isotope atom attached to a semi-infinite harmonic
atomic chain. Technically, the discussion is based on a Langevin equation for
the isotope, using the initial condition when the isotope and chain are
initially prepared in uncorrelated canonical states under the constraint that
the boundary atom between the isotope and chain is initially fixed and later
released. In such setting, the noise in the Langevin equation is

Earth-like planets that orbit Sun-like stars. Accurately estimating this planet

understanding of the stars searched for planets. Previous ground-based
follow-up observations have, through a variety of methods, sought to improve
our knowledge of stars that are known to host planets. Kepler targets without
detected planets, however, have not been subjected to the same intensity of
follow-up observations. In this paper, we better constrain stellar multiplicity
for stars around which Kepler could have theoretically detected a transiting
Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. We subsequently aim to improve
estimates of the exoplanet search completeness -- the fraction of exoplanets
that were detected by Kepler -- with our analysis. By obtaining adaptive optics
observations of 71 Kepler target stars from the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick
Observatory, we detected 14 candidate stellar companions within 4'' of 13
target stars. Of these 14 candidate stellar companions, we determine through
multiple independent methods that 3 are likely to be bound to their

low-ionization species such as NI, NII, SiII, CII, and SiIII. We also make an
estimate of the covering fraction to be 0.883, giving us a limiting size of the
DLA to be $A_{DLA}\rm \geq3.3~kpc^2$. Assuming a uniform column density over
the entire DLA system, we estimate its mass to be $M_{DLA}\geq5.3\times
10^6~M_\odot$. The extended illuminator and the low redshift of this DLA give
us the unique opportunity to characterize its nature and the connection to its
host galaxy. We measure a velocity offset of +131 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic
velocity of the host for the DLA. This velocity is $-84$ km s$^{-1}$ from the
projected rotation velocity of the host galaxy as measured using a newly
constructed rotation curve. Based on the size of the host galaxy, the HI column
density, and the gas kinematics, we believe this DLA is tracing the warm
neutral gas in the HI disk of the foreground galaxy. Our detection adds to a
small set of low-redshift DLAs that have confirmed host galaxies, and is the
first to be found using an extended background source.

gravitational-wave detections offers unprecedented information about the spin
magnitudes and orientations of merging binary black holes (BBHs). Notably,
analysis of the BBH population suggests the presence of binaries whose
component spins are significantly misaligned with respect to their orbital
angular momenta. Significantly misaligned spins are typically predicted to be
at odds with isolated field formation via standard common envelope (CE)
evolution, and hence a ""smoking gun"" signature of dynamical binary formation
inside dense stellar clusters. Here, we explore whether the LIGO/Virgo
observation of spin-orbit misalignment indeed rules out the possibility that
BBHs are formed entirely in the field via standard CE evolution. In particular,
we seek to understand whether, by varying the natal kicks black holes receive
upon formation, we can invoke the CE scenario to self-consistently explain both
the observed spin distribution and merger rate of BBHs. We find that, if
isolated black holes are born with small natal spins, then BBHs formed through
CE require extreme natal kicks to match the observed BBH population, with a
velocity dispersion $\sigma =
9.7^{+26.7}_{-5.9}\times10^2\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and
$\sigma>260\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 99% credibility. To avoid this
condition, we argue that it is necessary to assume that isolated black holes
are born with non-vanishing natal spins, that one or more alternative channels
contribute to the observed BBH population, and/or that other unforeseen
mechanisms serve to yield large spin-orbit misalignment in the field.

challenge for designing new dielectric polymer materials with high energy

an advanced computational screening method coupled with hierarchical modelling

It is well known that the dielectric response of polymeric materials is largely
influenced by their phases and local heterogeneous structures as well as
operational temperature. Such inputs are crucial to accelerate the design and
discovery of potential polymer candidates. However, an efficient computational
framework to probe temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of

reactive molecular dynamics with a valence-state aware polarizable charge

our framework on high energy density polymer systems recently identified

active regions (ARs) can be seen bright in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft
X-ray images. The semiempirical determination of the three-dimensional (3D)
distribution of basic physical parameters (electronic density and temperature,
and magnetic field) is a key constraint for coronal heating models. In this
work we develop a technique for the study of EUV bright loops based on
differential emission measure (DEM) analysis and we first apply it to AR
structures observed by the {Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) on board the
{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). The 3D structure and intensity of the
magnetic field of the observed EUV loops are modelled using force-free field
extrapolations based on magnetograms taken by the {Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager} (HMI) on board SDO. In this work we report the results obtained for
several bright loops identified in different ARs. Our analysis indicates that
the mean and width of the temperature distributions are nearly invariant along
the loop lengths. For a particular loop we study its temporal evolution and
find that these characteristics remain approximately constant for most of its
life time. The appearance and disappearance of this loop occurs at time-scales
much shorter than its life time of $\approx 2.5$ hours. The results of this
analysis are compared with numerical simulations using the zero-dimensional
(0D) hydrodynamic model, Enthalpy-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL). We
study two alternative heating scenarios: first, we apply a constant heating
rate assuming loops in quasi-static equilibrium, and second, we heat the loops
using impulsive events or nanoflares. We find that all the observed loops are
overdense with respect to a quasi-static equilibrium solution and that the
nanoflare heating better reproduces the observed densities and temperatures.

wavelengths, allowing the study of the geometry and strength of the magnetic
field. Over last couple of decades observations and theory have led to the
establishment of the Radiative Alignment Torque (RAT) mechanism as leading
candidate to explain the effect. With a quantitatively well constrained theory,
polarization can be used not only to study the interstellar magnetic field, but
also the dust and other environmental parameters. Photo-dissociation Regions
(PDRs), with their intense, anisotropic radiation fields, consequent rapid $\rm
H_{2}$ formation, and high spatial density-contrast provide a rich environment
for such studies. Here we discuss an expanded optical, NIR, and mm-wave study
of the IC\,63 nebula, showing strong $\rm H_{2}$ formation-enhanced alignment
and the first direct empirical evidence for disalignment due to gas-grain
collisions using high-resolution $\rm HCO^{+}$(J=1-0) observations. We find
that relative amount of polarization is marginally anti-correlated with column
density of $\rm HCO^{+}$. However, separating the lines of sight of optical
polarimetry into those behind, or in front of, a dense clump as seen from
$\gamma$ Cas, the distribution separates into two well defined sets, with data
corresponding to \enquote{shaded} gas having a shallower slope. This is
expected if the decrease in polarization is caused by collisions since
collisional disalignment rate is proportional to R$_C\propto n\sqrt{T}$. Ratios
of the best-fit slopes for the \enquote{illuminated} and \enquote{shaded}
samples of lines of sight agrees, within the uncertainties, with the

humans and can lead to severe brain injuries, strokes, and brain tumors. Early
detection of seizures can help to mitigate injuries, and can be used to aid the
treatment of patients with epilepsy. The purpose of a seizure prediction system
is to successfully identify the pre-ictal brain stage, which occurs before a
seizure event. Patient-independent seizure prediction models are designed to
offer accurate performance across multiple subjects within a dataset, and have
been identified as a real-world solution to the seizure prediction problem.
However, little attention has been given for designing such models to adapt to
the high inter-subject variability in EEG data. Methods: We propose two
patient-independent deep learning architectures with different learning
strategies that can learn a global function utilizing data from multiple
subjects. Results: Proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance for
seizure prediction on the CHB-MIT-EEG dataset, demonstrating 88.81% and 91.54%
accuracy respectively. Conclusions: The Siamese model trained on the proposed
learning strategy is able to learn patterns related to patient variations in
data while predicting seizures. Significance: Our models show superior
performance for patient-independent seizure prediction, and the same
architecture can be used as a patient-specific classifier after model
adaptation. We are the first study that employs model interpretation to
understand classifier behavior for the task for seizure prediction, and we also
show that the MFCC feature map utilized by our models contains predictive
biomarkers related to interictal and pre-ictal brain states.

significantly less power at short timescales in the X-rays than in the NIR.
Less X-ray variability at short timescales combined with the observed NIR-X-ray
correlations means the variability can be described as the result of two
strictly correlated stochastic processes, the X-ray process being the
low-pass-filtered version of the NIR process. The NIR--X-ray linkage suggests a
simple radiative model: a compact, self-absorbed synchrotron sphere with
high-frequency cutoff close to NIR frequencies plus a synchrotron self-Compton
scattering component at higher frequencies. This model, with parameters fit to
the submillimeter, NIR, and X-ray structure functions, reproduces the observed
flux densities at all wavelengths, the statistical properties of all light
curves, and the time lags between bands. The fit also gives reasonable values
for physical parameters such as magnetic flux density $B\approx13$ G, source
size $L \approx2.2R_{S}$, and high-energy electron density
$n_{e}\approx4\times10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$. An animation illustrates typical light
curves, and we make public the parameter chain of our Bayesian analysis, the

suggested as a promising site for particle acceleration in solar flares. Recent
development of magnetic reconnection has shown that numerous plasmoids can be
produced in a large-scale current layer. Here we investigate the dynamical
modulation of electron acceleration in the looptop region when plasmoids
intermittently arrive at the shock by combining magnetohydrodynamics
simulations with a particle kinetic model. As plasmoids interact with the
shock, the looptop region exhibits various compressible structures that
modulate the production of energetic electrons. The energetic electron
population varies rapidly in both time and space. The number of 5$-$10 keV
electrons correlates well with the area with compression, while that of $>$50
keV electrons shows good correlation with strong compression area but only
moderate correlation with shock parameters. We further examine the impacts of
the first plasmoid, which marks the transition from a quasi-steady shock front
to a distorted and dynamical shock. The number of energetic electrons is
reduced by $\sim 20\%$ at 15$-$25 keV and nearly 40\% for 25$-$50 keV, while
the number of 5$-$10 keV electrons increases. In addition, the electron energy
spectrum above 10 keV evolves softer with time. We also find double or even
multiple distinct sources can develop in the looptop region when the plasmoids
move across the shock. Our simulations have strong implications to the
interpretation of nonthermal looptop sources, as well as the commonly observed
fast temporal variations in flare emissions, including the quasi-periodic
pulsations.

However, this loss restricts the scope of applicable regression models, limits
the ability to target many desirable properties (e.g. calibration, sharpness,

we develop new quantile methods that address these shortcomings. In particular,
we propose methods that can apply to any class of regression model, allow for
selecting a trade-off between calibration and sharpness, optimize for

suggesting a bipolar outflow from TYC 2597-735-1. TYC 2597-735-1's spectrum and

abnormally low surface gravity and a detectable long-term luminosity decay,

stellar activity, and accretion. The combined observations, paired with stellar

several thousand years ago. TYC 2597-735-1 provides a look at an unobstructed
stellar merger found at an evolutionary stage between its dynamic onset and the
theorized final equilibrium state, directly inferring how two stars merge into
a single star.

that limit the sensitivity of searches for low-mass dark matter (DM) using
xenon time projection chambers. In the LUX detector, signatures of low-mass DM
interactions would be very low energy ($\sim$keV) scatters in the active target
that ionize only a few xenon atoms and seldom produce detectable scintillation
signals. In this regime, extra precaution is required to reject a complex set
of low-energy electron backgrounds that have long been observed in this class
of detector. Noticing backgrounds from the wire grid electrodes near the top
and bottom of the active target are particularly pernicious, we develop a
machine learning technique based on ionization pulse shape to identify and
reject these events. We demonstrate the technique can improve Poisson limits on
low-mass DM interactions by a factor of $2$-$7$ with improvement depending
heavily on the size of ionization signals. We use the technique on events in an
effective $5$ tonne$\cdot$day exposure from LUX's 2013 science operation to
place strong limits on low-mass DM particles with masses in the range
$m_{\chi}\in0.15$-$10$ GeV. This machine learning technique is expected to be
useful for near-future experiments, such as LZ and XENONnT, which hope to
perform low-mass DM searches with the stringent background control necessary to
make a discovery.

Using UVC LEDs emitting $\sim$ 40 mW of power each with an airflow rate of 30

featured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors
beginners: (i) at multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates trading
environments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500,
HSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300; (ii) organized in a layered architecture with modular
structure, FinRL provides fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN,

evaluation baselines to alleviate the debugging workloads and promote the
reproducibility, and (iii) being highly extendable, FinRL reserves a complete

introduce a transfer learning method to adapt the characteristics of the target
image and organ by updating the model before testing with arbitrary support and
query data sampled from the support data. We evaluate our proposed model using
three 3D CT datasets with annotations of different organs. Our model yielded
significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art few shot segmentation

  While bitrate is frequently used, BOLA allows the video provider to define
its own proxy of video quality as the algorithm's ""utility"" function. However,
using SSIM as utility proved surprisingly complex for BOLA-BASIC, despite the
algorithm's simplicity. Given the rising popularity of SSIM and related quality

Here we consider cooling schemes in the strong sideband coupling regime, where

attention in the last years. In both natural and artificial samples however,
multilayer stacked Bernal graphene (BG) occurs more frequently, making it
desirable to determine what is their relative stability and under which

It is shown that the electronic temperature, not accounted for in previous
studies, plays a crucial role in determining which phase is preferred. We also
show that the low energy states at room temperature consist of BG, RG and mixed
BG-RG systems with a particular type of interface. Energies of all stacking

fit them, which can be used for larger N as well. In this way, the ordering of

often neglected seventh parameter of the standard cosmological model. As well
as its variation affecting the physics of the CMB, the measurement of $T_0$ is
also used to calibrate the anisotropies, via the orbital dipole. We point out
that it is easy to misestimate the effect of $T_0$ because the CMB anisotropies
are conventionally provided in temperature units. In fact the anisotropies are
most naturally described as dimensionless and we argue for restoring the
convention of working with $\Delta T/T$ rather than $\Delta T$. As a free
cosmological parameter, $T_0$ most naturally only impacts the CMB power spectra
through late-time effects. Thus if we ignore the COBE-FIRAS measurement,
current CMB data only weakly constrain $T_0$. Even ideal future CMB data can at
best provide a percent-level constraint on $T_0$, although adding large-scale
structure data will lead to further improvement. The FIRAS measurement is so
precise that its uncertainty negligibly effects most, but not all, cosmological
parameter inferences for current CMB experiments. However, if we eventually
want to extract all available information from CMB power spectra measured to
multipoles $\ell\simeq5000$, then we will need a better determination of $T_0$

telescope with the main objective to make the first observation of UHECRs via
the fluorescence technique from suborbital space. The EUSO-SPB1 instrument is a
refractive telescope consisting of two 1m$^2$ Fresnel lenses with a high-speed
UV camera at the focal plane. The camera has 2304 individual pixels capable of
single photoelectron counting with a time resolution of 2.5$\mu$s. A detailed
performance study including calibration was done on ground. We separately
evaluated the properties of the Photo Detector Module (PDM) and the optical
system in the laboratory. An end-to-end test of the instrument was performed
during a field campaign in the West Desert in Utah, USA at the Telescope Array

of view of 11.1$^\circ$ and an absolute photo-detection efficiency of 10%. We
also measured the light flux necessary to obtain a 50% trigger efficiency using
laser beams. These measurements were crucial for us to perform an accurate post

were also used to estimated the reconstruction angular resolution. Finally, we

challenges. Unlike other computer vision problems, the AED is not solely
dependent on the content of frames. It also depends on the appearance of the

address the AED problem. Among those, deep learning based methods show the best
results. This paper is based on deep learning methods and provides an effective
way to detect and locate abnormal events in videos by handling spatio temporal
data. This paper uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) and performs
transfer learning algorithms on pre trained convolutional neural network (CNN)
which result in an accurate and efficient model. The efficiency of the model is
further improved by processing the optical flow information of the video. This
paper runs experiments on two benchmark datasets for AED problem (UCSD Peds1

comparisons are based on various criteria such as area under curve (AUC) and
true positive rate (TPR). Experimental results show that the proposed method

determine real and reactive power injection/consumption can create voltage
instabilities (over-voltage, voltage oscillations and more) in an electrical
distribution network if set-points are not properly configured. In this work,
linear distribution power flow equations and droop-based Volt-Var and Volt-Watt
control curves are used to analytically derive a stability criterion using
\lyapnouv analysis that includes the network operating condition. The
methodology is generally applicable for control curves that can be represented
as Lipschitz functions. The derived Lipschitz constants account for smart
inverter hardware limitations for reactive power generation. A local policy is
derived from the stability criterion that allows inverters to adapt their
control curves by monitoring only local voltage, thus avoiding centralized
control or information sharing with other inverters. The criterion is
independent of the internal time-delays of smart inverters. Simulation results
for inverters with and without the proposed stabilization technique demonstrate
how smart inverters can mitigate voltage oscillations locally and mitigate real
and reactive power flow disturbances at the substation under multiple
scenarios. The study concludes with illustrations of how the control policy can
dampen oscillations caused by solar intermittency and cyber-attacks.

in agreement with CMB data, but when late-time model-independent measurements
are considered, $H_0$ is fully compatible with the $R^{H18}$ value. Finally, as
an extension of these results, our proposal is capable to distinguish between
$f(R)$ scenarios at both routes of the distance ladder showing a good approach

correlated {\it ab initio } methods proved to be highly efficient for an
accurate description of CF multiplets and magnetism of individual lanthanide

approach is a complete account of Goodenough's exchange mechanism along with
traditional Anderson's superexchange and other contributions, the former being
dominant in many lanthanide materials. Application of this methodology to the
description of the ground-state order in the neodymium nitride with rocksalt
structure reveals the multipolar nature of its ferromagnetic order. We found
that the primary and secondary order parameters (of $T_{1u}$ and $E_g$

to the ninth order. The calculated spin-wave dispersion and magnetic and
thermodynamic properties show that they cannot be simulated quantitatively by
confining to the ground CF multiplet on the Nd sites. Our results demonstrate

states of neutral atoms with the motional degrees of freedom due to the
momentum kick from photon absorption and re-emission is quantified. This occurs
when the atom is in a superposition of internal states but only one of these
states is manipulated by visible or UV photons. The Schr\""odinger equation that
describes this situation is presented and two cases are explored. In the first
case, the entanglement arises because the spatial wave function shifts due to
the separation in time between excitation and stimulated emission. For neutral
atoms in a harmonic trap, the decoherence can be expressed within a sudden
approximation when the duration of the laser pulses are shorter than the
harmonic oscillator period. In this limit, the decoherence is given by simple
analytic formulas that account for the momentum of the photon, the temperature
of the atoms, the harmonic oscillator frequency, and atomic mass. In the second
case, there is a reduction in gate fidelity because the photons causing
absorption and stimulated emission are in focused beam modes. This leads to a
dependence of the optically induced changes in the internal states on the
center of mass atomic position. In the limit where the time between pulses is
short, the decoherence can be expressed as a simple analytic formula involving
the laser waist, temperature of the atoms, the trap frequency and the atomic
mass. These limits on gate fidelity are studied for the standard $\pi-2\pi-\pi$
Rydberg gate and a new protocol based on a single adiabatic pulse with Gaussian
envelope.

method for symmetric integer programs. We study fundamental domains, which are

understand the relationship between the complexity of such polyhedra and their

  Borrowing ideas from geometric group theory, we provide structural properties
that relate the action of the group with the geometry of the facets of
fundamental domains. Inspired by these insights, we provide a new generalized
construction for fundamental domains, which we call generalized Dirichlet
domain (GDD). Our construction is recursive and exploits the coset
decomposition of the subgroups that fix given vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We use
this construction to analyze a recently introduced set of symmetry breaking
inequalities by Salvagnin (2018) and Liberti and Ostrowski (2014), called
Schreier-Sims inequalities. In particular, this shows that every permutation
group admits a fundamental domain with less than $n$ facets. We also show that
this bound is tight.
  Finally, we prove that the Schreier-Sims inequalities can contain an
exponential number of isomorphic binary vectors for a given permutation group
$G$, which provides evidence of the lack of symmetry breaking effectiveness of
this fundamental domain. Conversely, a suitably constructed GDD for this $G$
has linearly many inequalities and contains unique representatives for
isomorphic binary vectors.

the component boundary (GPU to CPU or vice versa) is novel, introducing unique
challenges, but also providing the attacker with new capabilities that must be
considered when we design defenses against microarchitectrual attacks in these
environments. Specifically, we consider the potential for covert channel
attacks that arise either from shared microarchitectural components (such as
caches) or through shared contention domains (e.g., shared buses). We
illustrate these two types of channels by developing two reliable covert
channel attacks. The first covert channel uses the shared LLC cache in Intel's
integrated GPU architectures. The second is a contention based channel
targeting the ring bus connecting the CPU and GPU to the LLC. Cross component
channels introduce a number of new challenges that we had to overcome since
they occur across heterogeneous components that use different computation
models and are interconnected using asymmetric memory hierarchies. We also
exploit GPU parallelism to increase the bandwidth of the communication, even
without relying on a common clock. The LLC based channel achieves a bandwidth
of 120 kbps with a low error rate of 2%, while the contention based channel

galaxies. In this work, we study the quenching rate, i.e., the variation in the
fraction of quenched galaxies per unit time, of the Illustris-1 simulation. By
building the quenched fraction function $f(m,\rho, t)$ of each snapshot in the
simulation, we derive an accurate form of quenching rate as
$\Re_q=df(m,\rho,t)/dt$. According to the analytic expression of the quenching
rate $\Re_q$, we split it into four components: mass quenching, environmental
quenching, intrinsic mass quenching and intrinsic environmental quenching. The
precise value and evolutions can be given via the formula of $\Re_q$. With this
method, we analyze the Illustris-1 simulation. We find that quenched galaxies
concentrate around $M_*\simeq10^{11}h^{-1}M_\odot$ and $\delta+1\simeq10^{3.5}$
at earlier times, and that the quenching galaxy population slowly shifts to
lower stellar mass and lower overdensity regions with time. We also find that
mass quenching dominates the quenching process in this simulation, in agreement
with some previous analytical models. Intrinsic quenching is the second most
important component. Environmental quenching is very weak, because it is
possible that the pre- or postprocessing of environments disguises
environmental quenching as intrinsic quenching. We find that our method roughly
predict the actual quenching rate. It could well predict the actual amount of
galaxies quenched by intrinsic quenching. However, it overestimates the amount
of mass quenching galaxies and underestimates the amount of environmental
quenching. We suggest that the reason is the nonlinearity of the environmental
overdensity change and mass growth of the galaxy.

parallelism. When a job parallelizes across multiple servers it will complete
more quickly, but jobs receive diminishing returns from being allocated
additional servers. Because allocating multiple servers to a single job is
inefficient, it is unclear how best to allocate a fixed number of servers
between many parallelizable jobs. This paper provides the first optimal
allocation policy for minimizing the mean slowdown of parallelizable jobs of
known size when all jobs are present at time 0. Our policy provides a simple
closed form formula for the optimal allocations at every moment in time.
Minimizing mean slowdown usually requires favoring short jobs over long ones
(as in the SRPT policy). However, because parallelizable jobs have sublinear
speedup functions, system efficiency is also an issue. System efficiency is
maximized by giving equal allocations to all jobs and thus competes with the
goal of prioritizing small jobs. Our optimal policy, high-efficiency SRPT
(heSRPT), balances these competing goals. heSRPT completes jobs according to
their size order, but maintains overall system efficiency by allocating some
servers to each job at every moment in time. Our results generalize to also
provide the optimal allocation policy with respect to mean flow time. Finally,
we consider the online case where jobs arrive to the system over time. While
optimizing mean slowdown in the online setting is even more difficult, we find
that heSRPT provides an excellent heuristic policy for the online setting. In
fact, our simulations show that heSRPT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art allocation policies for parallelizable jobs.

algorithms on finite state space via modifying the energy landscape. The core
idea of landscape modification relies on introducing a parameter $c$, in which
the landscape is modified once the algorithm is above this threshold parameter.
We illustrate the power and benefits of landscape modification by investigating
its effect on the classical Curie-Weiss model with Glauber dynamics and
external magnetic field in the subcritical regime. This leads to a
landscape-modified mean-field equation, and with appropriate choice of $c$ the
free energy landscape can be transformed from a double-well into a single-well,
while the location of the global minimum is preserved on the modified
landscape. Consequently, running algorithms on the modified landscape can
improve the convergence to the ground-state in the Curie-Weiss model. In the
setting of simulated annealing, we demonstrate that landscape modification can
yield improved mean tunneling time between global minima, and give convergence
guarantee using an improved logarithmic cooling schedule with reduced critical
height. Finally, we discuss connections between landscape modification and
other acceleration techniques such as Catoni's energy transformation algorithm,
preconditioning, importance sampling and quantum annealing. We stress that the
technique developed in this paper is applicable to any difference-based

such that they transport ions more efficiently in one direction than the other.
Conical nanopores have been shown to rectify ionic current, but only those with
at least 500 nm in length exhibit significant ICR. Here, through the finite
element method, we show how ICR of conical nanopores with length below 200 nm
can be tuned by controlling individual charged surfaces i.e. inner pore surface
(surface_inner), and exterior pore surfaces on the tip and base side
(surface_tip and surface_base). The charged surface_inner and surface_tip can
induce obvious ICR individually, while the effects of the charged surface_base
on ICR can be ignored. The fully charged surface_inner alone could render the
nanopore counterion-selective and induces significant ion concentration
polarization in the tip region, which causes reverse ICR compared to nanopores
with all surface charged. In addition, the direction and degree of
rectification can be further tuned by the depth of the charged surface_inner.
When considering the exterior membrane surface only, the charged surface_tip
causes intra-pore ionic enrichment and depletion under opposite biases which
results in significant ICR. Its effective region is within ~40 nm beyond the
tip orifice. We also found that individual charged parts of the pore system
contributed to ICR in an additive way due to the additive effect on the ion
concentration regulation along the pore axis. With various combinations of
fully/partially charged surface_inner and surface_tip, diverse ICR ratios from
~2 to ~170 can be achieved. Our findings shed light on the mechanism of ionic
current rectification in ultra-short conical nanopores, and provide a useful
guide to the design and modification of ultra-short conical nanopores in ionic
circuits and nanofluidic sensors.

separates the simplicity of optimal single-dimensional multi-bidder auctions
from the complexity of optimal multi-dimensional multi-bidder auctions.
Specifically, consider the revenue-optimal, Bayesian Incentive Compatible
auction for buyers with valuations drawn from $\vec{D}:=\times_i D_i$, where
each distribution has support-size $n$. This auction takes as input a valuation
profile $\vec{v}$ and produces as output an allocation of the items and prices
to charge, $Opt_{\vec{D}}(\vec{v})$. When each $D_i$ is single-dimensional,
this mapping is locally-implementable: defining each input $v_i$ requires
$\Theta(\log n)$ bits, and $Opt_{\vec{D}}(\vec{v})$ can be fully determined
using just $\Theta(\log n)$ bits from each $D_i$. This follows immediately from
Myerson's virtual value theory [Mye81].
  Our main result establishes that optimal multi-dimensional mechanisms are not
locally-implementable: in order to determine the output
$Opt_{\vec{D}}(\vec{v})$ on one particular input $\vec{v}$, one still needs to
know (essentially) the entire distribution $\vec{D}$. Formally, $\Omega(n)$
bits from each $D_i$ is necessary: (essentially) enough to fully describe
$D_i$, and exponentially more than the $\Theta(\log n)$ needed to define the
input $v_i$. We show that this phenomenon already occurs with just two bidders,
even when one bidder is single-dimensional, and when the other bidder is barely
multi-dimensional. More specifically, the multi-dimensional bidder is
``inter-dimensional'' from the FedEx setting with just two days [FGKK16].
  Our techniques are fairly robust: we additionally establish that optimal
mechanisms for single-dimensional buyers with budget constraints are not
locally-implementable. This occurs with just two bidders, even when one has no
budget constraint, and even when the other's budget is public.

continuous critical bending induced by the magnetic field, characterized by a
critical exponent for the bending magnitude, and the derivative of which has a
singularity in the critical region is reported for the first time. The
mechanical stability loss and the symmetry reduction of the magnetic state,
which are interrelated with each other, take place at the critical point. The
magnetization in the high-symmetric state (below the critical point) is
directed along the magnetic field and the torque is absent. Above the critical
point, the magnetization and the magnetic field are noncollinear and there
arises a torque, which is self-consistent with the bending. The magnetic field
dependence of the MAE bending was found to have a hysteresis, which is
associated with the magneto-rheological effect. The shape memory effect was
also obtained for the MAE bending in a cycle consisting of magnetization,
cooling (at H=/0), and heating (at H=0). The influence of the critical glass
transition temperature of the matrix, as well as its melting/solidification

of these EFs is as an emerging cancer treatment modality. In vitro studies by
Novocure Ltd. reported that intermediate frequency (100 - 300 kHz), low
amplitude (1 - 3 V/cm) EFs, which they called ""Tumor Treating Fields""
(TTFields), had an anti-mitotic effect on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells.
The effect was found to increase with increasing EF amplitude. Despite
continued theoretical, preclinical, and clinical study, the mechanism of action
remains incompletely understood. Previous in vitro studies of ""TTFields"" have
used attached, capacitively coupled electrodes to deliver alternating EFs to
cell and tissue cultures. This contacting delivery method suffers from a poorly
characterized EF profile and conductive heating that limits the duration and
amplitude of the applied EFs. In contrast, our device delivers EFs with a
well-characterized radial profile in a non-contacting manner, eliminating
conductive heating and enabling thermally regulated EF delivery. To test and
demonstrate our system, we generated continuous 200 kHz EMF with an EF
amplitude profile spanning 0 - 6.5 V/cm pk-pk and applied them to human thyroid
cell cultures for 72 hours. We observed moderate reduction in cell density (<
10%) at low EF amplitudes (< 4 V/cm) and a greater reduction in cell density of
up to 25% at higher amplitudes (4 - 6.5 V/cm). Our device can be extended to
other EF frequency and amplitude regimes. Future studies with this device
should contribute to the ongoing debate about the efficacy and mechanism(s) of
action of ""TTFields"" by better isolating the effects of EFs.

suboptimal from two aspects: (1) It fails to capture spatially global

vital for predicting the surf zone hydrodynamics and for route planning to
avoid subsurface features. Hence, it is increasingly important for a wide
variety of applications, including shipping operations, coastal management, and
risk assessment. However, direct high resolution surveys of nearshore
bathymetry are rarely performed due to budget constraints and logistical
restrictions. Another option when only sparse observations are available is to
use Gaussian Process regression (GPR), also called Kriging. But GPR has
difficulties recognizing patterns with sharp gradients, like those found around
sand bars and submerged objects, especially when observations are sparse. In
this work, we present several deep learning-based techniques to estimate
nearshore bathymetry with sparse, multi-scale measurements. We propose a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) to compute posterior estimates of the nearshore
bathymetry, as well as a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that
samples from the posterior distribution. We train our neural networks based on
synthetic data generated from nearshore surveys provided by the U.S.\ Army
Corps of Engineer Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, North Carolina. We
compare our methods with Kriging on real surveys as well as surveys with
artificially added sharp gradients. Results show that direct estimation by DNN
gives better predictions than Kriging in this application. We use bootstrapping
with DNN for uncertainty quantification. We also propose a method, named
DNN-Kriging, that combines deep learning with Kriging and shows further
improvement of the posterior estimates.

Our main goal is to understand how structural properties of the network

topological bounds provide a more informative assessment of the inefficiency of

of our main results, we derive (tight) bounds on the Price of Anarchy for
clustering games on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs (where every possible edge
in the network is present with a fixed probability), which, depending on the
graph density, stand in stark contrast to the known Price of Anarchy bounds.

the frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it challenging to
estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has lots of
variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter
estimating algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with many
parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space
model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast estimation by
avoiding computations of a complete numerical solution in the likelihood. The
posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more specifically, the
approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method (Honkela et al. 2010), which
avoids samplings based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In simulation
studies, we compared the speed and performance of the proposed method with

which can move the mucus. The air--mucus interaction plays an important role in
cough and in chest physiotherapy (CP). The conditions under which it induces a
displacement of the mucus are still unclear. Yet, the air--mucus interaction
justifies common technics of CP used to help the draining of the mucus in
prevalent diseases. Hence, the determination of the distribution of the shear
stress in the lung is crucial for understanding the effects of these therapies
and, potentially, improve their efficiency. We develop a mathematical model to
study the distribution of the wall shear stress (WSS) induced by an air flow
exiting an airway tree. This model accounts for the main physical processes
that determines the WSS, more particularly the compliance of the airways, the
air inertia and the tree structure. We show that the WSS distribution in the
tree depends on the dynamics of the airways deformation and on the air inertia.
The WSS distribution in the tree exhibits a maximum whose amplitude and
location depend on the amount of air flow and on the ""tissue"" pressure
surrounding the airways. To characterize the behavior of the WSS at the tree
bifurcations, we derive new analytical criteria related to the airway size
reduction in the bifurcations. Our results suggest that a tuning of the airflow

with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. The intrinsic
limitation in spatial resolution of these instruments implies that the spectra
associated with pixels of such images are most often mixtures of the spectra of
the ""pure"" components that exist in the considered region. In order to estimate
the spectra and spatial abundances of these pure components, we here propose an
original blind signal separation (BSS), that is to say an unsupervised unmixing
method. Our approach is based on extensions and combinations of linear BSS
methods that belong to two major classes of methods, namely nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) and Sparse Component Analysis (SCA). The former performs
the decomposition of hyperspectral images, as a set of pure spectra and
abundance maps, by using nonnegativity constraints, but the estimated solution
is not unique: It highly depends on the initialization of the algorithm. The
considered SCA methods are based on the assumption of the existence of points
or tiny spatial zones where only one source is active (i.e., one pure component
is present). In real conditions, the assumption of perfect single-source points
or zones is not always realistic. In such conditions, SCA yields approximate
versions of the unknown sources and mixing coefficients. We propose to use part
of these preliminary estimates from the SCA to initialize several runs of the
NMF to constrain the convergence of the NMF algorithm. Detailed tests with
synthetic data show that the decomposition achieved with such hybrid methods is
nearly unique and provides good performance, illustrating the potential of
applications to real data.

the center of the sounds of that class in the audio domain. In terms of

differing from the standard homological product of three classical codes. When
instantiated with 3 classical LDPC codes, this ""XYZ product"" yields a non CSS
quantum LDPC code which might display a large minimum distance. The simplest
instance of this construction, corresponding to the product of 3 repetition
codes, is a non CSS variant of the 3-dimensional toric code known as the Chamon
code. The general construction was introduced in Denise Maurice's PhD thesis,
but has remained poorly understood so far. The reason is that while hypergraph
product codes can be analyzed with combinatorial tools, the XYZ product codes
also depend crucially on the algebraic properties of the parity-check matrices
of the three classical codes, making their analysis much more involved.
  Our main motivation for studying XYZ product codes is that the natural
representatives of logical operators are two-dimensional objects. This
contrasts with standard hypergraph product codes in 3 dimensions which always
admit one-dimensional logical operators. In particular, specific instances of
XYZ product codes with constant rate might display a minimum distance as large
as $\Theta(N^{2/3})$. While we do not prove this result here, we obtain the
dimension of a large class of XYZ product codes, and when restricting to codes
with dimension 1, we reduce the problem of computing the minimum distance to a
more elementary combinatorial problem involving binary 3-tensors. We also
discuss in detail some families of XYZ product codes that can be embedded in
three dimensions with local interaction. Some of these codes seem to share
properties with Haah's cubic codes and might be interesting candidates for

multitude of scenarios, e.g., agriculture, smart cities, industry, etc.,
require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these
sensors observe a phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, it is
expected that collected observations will be correlated in time and space. In
this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based scheduling
mechanism capable of taking advantage of correlated information. We design our
solution using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The
proposed mechanism is capable of determining the frequency with which sensors
should transmit their updates, to ensure accurate collection of observations,
while simultaneously considering the energy available. To evaluate our
scheduling mechanism, we use multiple datasets containing environmental
observations obtained in multiple real deployments. The real observations
enable us to model the environment with which the mechanism interacts as
realistically as possible. We show that our solution can significantly extend
the sensors' lifetime. We compare our mechanism to an idealized, all-knowing
scheduler to demonstrate that its performance is near-optimal. Additionally, we
highlight the unique feature of our design, energy-awareness, by displaying the
impact of sensors' energy levels on the frequency of updates.

a wide variety of sensors and devices. Data semantics facilitate information
exchange, adaptability, and interoperability among several sensors and devices.
Sensor data and their meaning can be described using ontologies, e.g., the
Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) Ontology. Notwithstanding, semantically enriched,
the size of semantic sensor data is substantially larger than raw sensor data.
Moreover, some measurement values can be observed by sensors several times, and
a huge number of repeated facts about sensor data can be produced. We propose a
compact or factorized representation of semantic sensor data, where repeated
measurement values are described only once. Furthermore, these compact
representations are able to enhance the storage and processing of semantic
sensor data. To scale up to large datasets, factorization based, tabular
representations are exploited to store and manage factorized semantic sensor
data using Big Data technologies. We empirically study the effectiveness of a
semantic sensor's proposed compact representations and their impact on query
processing. Additionally, we evaluate the effects of storing the proposed
representations on diverse RDF implementations. Results suggest that the
proposed compact representations empower the storage and query processing of
sensor data over diverse RDF implementations, and up to two orders of magnitude
can reduce query execution time.

requires a very large amount of interaction data. This result is perhaps
unsurprising, as using complicated function approximation often requires more
data to fit, and early theoretical results on linear Markov decision processes
provide regret bounds that scale with the dimension of the linear
approximation. Ideally, we would like to automatically identify the minimal
dimension of the approximation that is sufficient to encode an optimal policy.
Towards this end, we consider the problem of model selection in RL with
function approximation, given a set of candidate RL algorithms with known
regret guarantees. The learner's goal is to adapt to the complexity of the
optimal algorithm without knowing it \textit{a priori}. We present a
meta-algorithm that successively rejects increasingly complex models using a
simple statistical test. Given at least one candidate that satisfies
realizability, we prove the meta-algorithm adapts to the optimal complexity
with $\tilde{O}(L^{5/6} T^{2/3})$ regret compared to the optimal candidate's
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt T)$ regret, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $L$ is the
number of algorithms. The dimension and horizon dependencies remain optimal
with respect to the best candidate, and our meta-algorithmic approach is
flexible to incorporate multiple candidate algorithms and models. Finally, we
show that the meta-algorithm automatically admits significantly improved
instance-dependent regret bounds that depend on the gaps between the maximal
values attainable by the candidates.

robotic tasks can be formulated as a free-energy minimization problem. The
proposed approach allows handling partially observable initial states and
improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while
at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, we
specify the nominal behavior offline, through BTs. However, in contrast to
previous approaches, we introduce a new type of leaf node to specify the
desired state to be achieved rather than an action to execute. The decision of
which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through
active inference. This results in continual online planning and hierarchical
deliberation. By doing so, an agent can follow a predefined offline plan while
still keeping the ability to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at
runtime, respecting safety constraints. We provide proof of convergence and
robustness analysis, and we validate our method in two different mobile

assume all source domains can be accessed directly. This neglects the
privacy-preserving policy, that is, all the data and computations must be kept
decentralized. There exists three problems in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the
domain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from source and
target domains, which is not accessible. (2) The communication cost and privacy
security limit the application of UMDA methods (e.g., the domain adversarial
training). (3) Since users have no authority to check the data quality, the
irrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes
negative transfer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving UMDA paradigm
named Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation (KD3A),
which performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models
from different source domains. KD3A solves the above problems with three
components: (1) A multi-source knowledge distillation method named Knowledge
Vote to learn high-quality domain consensus knowledge. (2) A dynamic weighting
strategy named Consensus Focus to identify both the malicious and irrelevant
domains. (3) A decentralized optimization strategy for domain distance named
BatchNorm MMD. The extensive experiments on DomainNet demonstrate that KD3A is
robust to the negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication
cost compared with other decentralized UMDA methods. Moreover, our KD3A
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches.

each others' decision-making cycle while internally seeking synchronisation of
this process -- all in the context of further interactions with the third

dimensional reduction approximation and stability analysis. We compare this to
a numerical solution for a range of internal and cross-network coupling
parameters to investigate various synchronisation regimes and critical
thresholds. The comparison reveals good agreement for appropriate parameter
ranges. Performing parameter sweeps, we reveal that Blue's pursuit of a
strategy of staying too-far ahead of Red's decision cycles triggers a

from the explosive phenomena such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray

explosive transients through its spin-down. The spin-down evolution of the NS
can sometimes be affected by fallback accretion, although it is usually
regulated by the magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation of
the NS. Under appropriate conditions, the accreting material can be firstly
ejected and subsequently recycled back, so that the accretion disk can keep in
a quasi-steady state for a long time. Here we describe the interaction of the
NS with such a propeller-recycling disk and their co-evolution. Our result
shows that, the spin-down of the NS can be initially dominated by the
propeller, which prevents the disk material from falling onto the NS until
hundreds or thousands of seconds later. It is suggested that the abrupt fall of
the disk material onto the NS could significantly suppress the magnetic dipole
radiation and then convert the NS from a normal magnetar to a low-field
magnetar. This evolution behavior of the newborn NS can help to understand the
very different influence of the NS on the early GRB afterglows and the late

regions of L1689: the clump L1689N which houses the IRAS 16293-2422
protostellar system, the starless clump SMM-16, and the starless core L1689B.
We use the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method to estimate plane-of-sky field
strengths of $366\pm 55$ $\mu$G in L1689N, $284\pm 34$ $\mu$G in SMM-16, and
$72\pm 33$ $\mu$G in L1689B, for our fiducial value of dust opacity. These
values indicate that all three regions are likely to be magnetically
trans-critical with sub-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence. In all three regions, the
inferred mean magnetic field direction is approximately perpendicular to the
local filament direction identified in $Herschel$ Space Telescope observations.
The core-scale field morphologies for L1689N and L1689B are consistent with the
cloud-scale field morphology measured by the $Planck$ Space Observatory,
suggesting that material can flow freely from large to small scales for these
sources. Based on these magnetic field measurements, we posit that accretion
from the cloud onto L1689N and L1689B may be magnetically regulated. However,
in SMM-16, the clump-scale field is nearly perpendicular to the field seen on
cloud scales by $Planck$, suggesting that it may be unable to efficiently
accrete further material from its surroundings.

lack of foreground modeling and propose a foreground-aware relation network
(FarSeg) from the perspectives of relation-based and optimization-based
foreground modeling, to alleviate the above two problems. From perspective of
relation, FarSeg enhances the discrimination of foreground features via
foreground-correlated contexts associated by learning foreground-scene
relation. Meanwhile, from perspective of optimization, a foreground-aware
optimization is proposed to focus on foreground examples and hard examples of
background during training for a balanced optimization. The experimental
results obtained using a large scale dataset suggest that the proposed method
is superior to the state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods and
achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. Code has been made

decision problems under uncertainty. To derive a robust optimization model, a
central ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is

derive uncertainty sets from given historical data that result in solutions
that are robust regarding future scenarios. In this paper we use an
unsupervised deep learning method to learn and extract hidden structures from
data, leading to non-convex uncertainty sets and better robust solutions. We
prove that most of the classical uncertainty classes are special cases of our
derived sets and that optimizing over them is strongly NP-hard. Nevertheless,
we show that the trained neural networks can be integrated into a robust
optimization model by formulating the adversarial problem as a convex quadratic
mixed-integer program. This allows us to derive robust solutions through an
iterative scenario generation process. In our computational experiments, we
compare this approach to a similar approach using kernel-based support vector
clustering. We find that uncertainty sets derived by the unsupervised deep

Freecyto is a free, easy-to-learn, Python-flask-based web application that uses
a weighted k-means clustering algorithm to facilitate the interactive analysis
of flow cytometry data. A key limitation of web browsers is their inability to
interactively display large amounts of data. Freecyto addresses this bottleneck
through the use of the k-means algorithm to quantize the data, allowing the
user to access a representative set of data points for interactive
visualization of complex datasets. Moreover, Freecyto enables the interactive
analyses of large complex datasets while preserving the standard FCM
visualization features, such as the generation of scatterplots (dotplots),
histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, as well as a SQL-based sub-population gating
feature. We also show that Freecyto can be applied to the analysis of various

the discrete problem of selecting a contact surface for each footstep and the
continuous problem of placing each footstep on the selected surface.
Consequently, footstep planning can be addressed with a Mixed Integer Program
(MIP), an elegant but computationally-demanding method, which can make it
unsuitable for online planning. We reformulate the MIP into a cardinality
problem, then approximate it as a computationally efficient l1-norm
minimisation, called SL1M. Moreover, we improve the performance and convergence
of SL1M by combining it with a sampling-based root trajectory planner to prune
irrelevant surface candidates. Our tests on the humanoid Talos in four
representative scenarios show that SL1M always converges faster than MIP. For
scenarios when the combinatorial complexity is small (< 10 surfaces per step),
SL1M converges at least two times faster than MIP with no need for pruning. In
more complex cases, SL1M converges up to 100 times faster than MIP with the
help of pruning. Moreover, pruning can also improve the MIP computation time.
The versatility of the framework is shown with additional tests on the
quadruped robot ANYmal.

of TB holds vast potential to assist medical experts in expediting and

there is a shortage of trained medical experts and radiologists. To date,
several deep learning based methods for automated detection of TB from chest
radiographs have been proposed. However, the performance of a few of these
methods on the Indian chest radiograph data set has been suboptimal, possibly
due to different texture of the lungs on chest radiographs of Indian subjects
compared to other countries. Thus deep learning for accurate and automated
diagnosis of TB on Indian datasets remains an important subject of research.
Methods: The proposed work explores the performance of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for the diagnosis of TB in Indian chest x-ray images. Three
different pre-trained neural network models, AlexNet, GoogLenet, and ResNet are
used to classify chest x-ray images into healthy or TB infected. The proposed
approach does not require any pre-processing technique. Also, other works use
pre-trained NNs as a tool for crafting features and then apply standard
classification techniques. However, we attempt an end to end NN model based
diagnosis of TB from chest x-rays. The proposed visualization tool can also be
used by radiologists in the screening of large datasets. Results: The proposed
method achieved 93.40% accuracy with 98.60% sensitivity to diagnose TB for the

tested against techniques described in the literature. The proposed method
outperforms the state of art on Indian and Shenzhen datasets.

produces distortions and speckles in the resulting images, limiting the

the highest possible sensitivity to faint sources such as planets, using both
hardware and data analysis software. While analytic methods are efficient, real
systems are better-modelled numerically, but such models with many parameters
can be hard to understand, optimize and apply. Automatic differentiation
software developed for machine learning now makes calculating derivatives with
respect to aberrations straightforward for arbitrary optical systems. We apply
this powerful new tool to enhance high-angular-resolution astronomical imaging.
Self-calibrating observables such as the 'closure phase' or 'bispectrum' have
been widely used in optical and radio astronomy to mitigate optical aberrations
and achieve high-fidelity imagery. Kernel phases are a generalization of
closure phases in the limit of small phase errors. Using automatic
differentiation, we reproduce existing kernel phase theory within this
framework and demonstrate an extension to the Lyot coronagraph, finding
self-calibrating combinations of speckles which are resistant to phase noise,
but only in the very high-wavefront-quality regime. As an illustrative example,
we reanalyze Palomar adaptive optics observations of the binary alpha Ophiuchi,
finding consistency between the new pipeline and the existing standard. We
present a new Python package 'morphine' that incorporates these ideas, with an

solving this class of problems by exploiting the underlying structure. The
global convergence of our method is guaranteed under the Kurdyka--Lojasiewicz
(KL) property and some mild assumptions. We then identify the explicit
exponents of the KL property for three important structured fractional

problem with either cardinality regularization or sparsity constraint, we show
that the KL exponents are 1/2, and so, the proposed method exhibits linear
convergence rate. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with both

drawings. Provided a vector drawing, such as a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
file, our method embeds bitstrings in the image by perturbing the drawing
primitives (lines, circles, etc.). This results in a morphed image that can be
decoded to recover the original bitstring. The use-case is similar to that of
the well-known QR code, but our solution provides creatives with artistic
freedom to transfer digital information via drawings of their own design. The
method comprises two neural networks, which are trained jointly: an encoder
network that transforms a bitstring into a perturbation of the drawing
primitives, and a decoder network that recovers the bitstring from an image of
the morphed drawing. To enable end-to-end training via back propagation, we
introduce a soft rasterizer, which is differentiable with respect to
perturbations of the drawing primitives. In order to add robustness towards
real-world image capture conditions, image corruptions are injected between the
soft rasterizer and the decoder. Further, the addition of an object detection
and camera pose estimation system enables decoding of drawings in complex
scenes as well as use of the drawings as markers for use in augmented reality
applications. We demonstrate that our method reliably recovers bitstrings from
real-world photos of printed drawings, thereby providing a novel solution for
creatives to transfer digital information via artistic imagery.

properties of a family of engineered quantum states, most of which show various
nonclassical features. The beauty of these states is that these states can be
used to establish quantum supremacy. Earlier, a considerable amount of works
has been reported on various types of quantum states and their nonclassical
properties. Here, complementing the earlier works, the effect of
non-Gaussianity inducing operators on the nonclassical and phase properties of
displaced Fock states have been studied. This thesis includes 6 chapters. In
Chapter 1, motivation behind performing the present work is stated explicitly,
also the basic concepts of quantum optics are discussed with a specific
attention on the witnesses and measures of nonclassicality. In Chapter 2,
nonclassical properties of photon added and subtracted displaced Fock states
have been studied using various witnesses of lower- and higher-order
nonclassicality which are introduced in Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, we have
continued our investigation on photon added and subtracted displaced Fock
states (and their limiting cases). In this chapter, quantum phase properties of
these states are investigated from a number of perspectives, and it is shown
that the quantum phase properties are dependent on the quantum state
engineering operations performed. In Chapter 4, we have continued our
investigation on the impact of non-Gaussianity inducing operators on the
nonclassical and phase properties of the displaced Fock states. In Chapter 5,
we have performed a comparison between to process that are used in quantum
state engineering to induce nonclassical features. Finally, this thesis is
concluded in Chapter 6, where we have summarized the findings of this thesis
and have also described scope of the future works.

semantic and instance segmentation. Importantly, the proposed new method,
termed DR1Mask, can perform panoptic segmentation by adding a single layer. To
our knowledge, DR1Mask is the first panoptic segmentation framework that
exploits a shared feature map for both instance and semantic segmentation by
considering both efficacy and efficiency. Not only our framework is much more
efficient -- twice as fast as previous best two-branch approaches, but also the
unified framework opens up opportunities for using the same context module to
improve the performance for both tasks. As a byproduct, when performing
instance segmentation alone, DR1Mask is 10% faster and 1 point in mAP more

different applications as catalysts and optical materials. In this work, we
demonstrate that the TbVO4 compound can be also used as magnetic refrigerant in
efficient and ecofriendly cryocoolers due to its strong magnetocaloric effect
at low temperature regime. The application of a relatively low magnetic field
of 2 T along the easy magnetization axis (a) gives rise to a maximum entropy
change of about 20 J/kg K at 4 K. More interestingly, under sufficiently high
magnetic fields, the isothermal entropy change -{\Delta}ST remains
approximately constant over a wide temperature range which is highly
appreciated from a practical point of view. In the magnetic field change of 7
T, -{\Delta}ST that reaches roughly 22 J/kg K remains practically unchanged
between 0 and 34 K leading to an outstanding refrigerant capacity of about 823
J/kg. On the other hand, the lowering of crystallographic symmetry from the
tetragonal to the orthorhombic structure occurring close to 33 K as confirmed
by Raman scattering data results in a strong magnetic anisotropy. Accordingly,
strong thermal effects can be also obtained simply by spinning the TbVO4 single
crystals between their hard and easy orientations in constant magnetic fields

magnetocaloric effects would open the way for the implementation of TbVO4 in a

considering the distribution of magnetic field measured by the Helioseismic and

that \ion{Si}{4} intensities obtained in CHs are lower than those obtained in
QS for regions with identical magnetic flux densities. Moreover, the difference
in intensities between CHs and QS increases with increasing magnetic flux. For
the regions with equal magnetic flux density, QS line profiles are more
redshifted than those measured in CHs. Moreover, the blue shifts measured in
CHs show an increase with increasing magnetic flux density unlike in the QS.
The non-thermal velocities in QS, as well as in CHs, show an increase with
increasing magnetic flux. However, no significant difference was observed in QS
and CHs, albeit a small deviation at small flux densities. Using these results,
we propose a unified model for the heating of the corona in the QS and in CHs

laser beams. Typically, a confocal arrangement of lenses with a diaphragm in
the focal plane is used for intracavity spatial filtering. Such conventional
filtering requires access to the far-field domain. In microlasers, however,
conventional filtering is impossible due to the lack of space in
micro-resonators to access the far-field. Therefore, a novel concept for more
compact and efficient spatial filtering is necessary. In this study, we propose
and demonstrate a conceptually novel mechanism of spatial filtering in the
near-field domain, by a nanostructured multilayer coating - a 2D photonic
crystal structure with a periodic index modulation along the longitudinal and
transverse direction to the beam propagation. The structure is built on a
nano-modulated substrate, to provide the transverse periodicity. The physical
vapor deposition is used to provide self-repeating modulation in the
longitudinal direction. We experimentally demonstrate a 5 micron thick photonic
multilayer structure composed of nanostructured multiple layers of alternating
high- and low-index materials providing spatial filtering in the near-infrared
frequencies with 2{\deg} low angle passband. The proposed photonic structure
can be considered as an ideal component for intracavity spatial filtering in
microlasers.

detection with deep edge detectors, based on an observation that the
localization ambiguity of deep edge detectors is mainly caused by the mixing
phenomenon of convolutional neural networks: feature mixing in edge
classification and side mixing during fusing side predictions. The CATS
consists of two modules: a novel tracing loss that performs feature unmixing by
tracing boundaries for better side edge learning, and a context-aware fusion
block that tackles the side mixing by aggregating the complementary merits of
learned side edges. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed CATS can be
integrated into modern deep edge detectors to improve localization accuracy.
With the vanilla VGG16 backbone, in terms of BSDS500 dataset, our CATS improves
the F-measure (ODS) of the RCF and BDCN deep edge detectors by 12% and 6%

calibration. In this paper, a particle filter methodology for continuous
calibration of the physics-based model element of a digital twin is presented
and applied to an example of an underground farm. The methodology is applied to
a synthetic problem with known calibration parameter values prior to being used
in conjunction with monitored data. The proposed methodology is compared
against static and sequential Bayesian calibration approaches and compares
favourably in terms of determination of the distribution of parameter values

developed mean that neither the parameters nor the predictions should be
interpreted causally. However, when prediction models are used to support
decision making, there is often a need for predicting outcomes under
hypothetical interventions. We aimed to identify published methods for
developing and validating prediction models that enable risk estimation of
outcomes under hypothetical interventions, utilizing causal inference: their
main methodological approaches, underlying assumptions, targeted estimands, and
potential pitfalls and challenges with using the method, and unresolved
methodological challenges.
  Methods: We systematically reviewed literature published by December 2019,
considering papers in the health domain that used causal considerations to
enable prediction models to be used for predictions under hypothetical
interventions.
  Results: We identified 4919 papers through database searches and a further
115 papers through manual searches, of which 13 were selected for inclusion,
from both the statistical and the machine learning literature. Most of the
identified methods for causal inference from observational data were based on
marginal structural models and g-estimation.
  Conclusions: There exist two broad methodological approaches for allowing
prediction under hypothetical intervention into clinical prediction models: 1)
enriching prediction models derived from observational studies with estimated
causal effects from clinical trials and meta-analyses; and 2) estimating
prediction models and causal effects directly from observational data. These
methods require extending to dynamic treatment regimes, and consideration of
multiple interventions to operationalise a clinical decision support system.
Techniques for validating 'causal prediction models' are still in their
infancy.

design for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided secure communication
system. We assume that a single-antenna legitimate receiver (Bob) served by a
multi-antenna base station (BS) is overheard by multiple single-antenna
eavesdroppers (Eves), and the artificial noise (AN) is incorporated to confuse
the Eves. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming,
the AN spatial distribution at the BS, and the passive beamforming at the IRS,
where the Eve-related channels are assumed to be imperfect due to the channel
estimation errors and their concealment. Two scenarios with partial channel
state information (CSI) error of only cascaded BS-IRS-Eve channel and full CSI
errors of both cascaded BS-IRS-Eve channel and direct BS-Eve channel are
investigated under the statistical CSI error model. An outage-constrained power
minimization problem is formulated by limiting the maximum allowable data rate
of Eves and ensuring the minimum data rate requirement of Bob. To solve it, the
Bernstein-type inequality and alternating optimization strategy are exploited,
and artful mathematical manipulations are performed to facilitate the
optimization on the phase shifts of the IRS. Simulation results confirm the
performance advantages of the proposed algorithm.

the minimum total weight of a set of edges whose removal disconnects $G$. We
completely characterize the quantum query and time complexity of the minimum
cut problem in the adjacency matrix model. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and edge
weights at least $1$ and at most $\tau$, we give a quantum algorithm to solve
the minimum cut problem using $\tilde O(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ queries and time.
Moreover, for every integer $1 \le \tau \le n$ we give an example of a graph
$G$ with edge weights $1$ and $\tau$ such that solving the minimum cut problem
on $G$ requires $\Omega(n^{3/2}\sqrt{\tau})$ many queries to the adjacency
matrix of $G$. These results contrast with the classical randomized case where
$\Omega(n^2)$ queries to the adjacency matrix are needed in the worst case even
to decide if an unweighted graph is connected or not.
  In the adjacency array model, when $G$ has $m$ edges the classical randomized
complexity of the minimum cut problem is $\tilde \Theta(m)$. We show that the
quantum query and time complexity are $\tilde O(\sqrt{mn\tau})$ and $\tilde
O(\sqrt{mn\tau} + n^{3/2})$, respectively, where again the edge weights are
between $1$ and $\tau$. For dense graphs we give lower bounds on the quantum
query complexity of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for $\tau > 1$ and $\Omega(\tau n)$ for
any $1 \leq \tau \leq n$.
  Our query algorithm uses a quantum algorithm for graph sparsification by
Apers and de Wolf (FOCS 2020) and results on the structure of near-minimum cuts
by Kawarabayashi and Thorup (STOC 2015) and Rubinstein, Schramm and Weinberg
(ITCS 2018). Our time efficient implementation builds on Karger's tree packing

but they are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous works on
adversarial attacks mainly focused on the single-task setting. However, in real
applications, it is often desirable to attack several models for different
tasks simultaneously. To this end, we propose Multi-Task adversarial Attack
(MTA), a unified framework that can craft adversarial examples for multiple
tasks efficiently by leveraging shared knowledge among tasks, which helps
enable large-scale applications of adversarial attacks on real-world systems.
More specifically, MTA uses a generator for adversarial perturbations which
consists of a shared encoder for all tasks and multiple task-specific decoders.
Thanks to the shared encoder, MTA reduces the storage cost and speeds up the
inference when attacking multiple tasks simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed
framework can be used to generate per-instance and universal perturbations for
targeted and non-targeted attacks. Experimental results on the Office-31 and
NYUv2 datasets demonstrate that MTA can improve the quality of attacks when

independence. In contrast to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated
not for a single assignment of values to the free variables, but on a set of
such assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for a purely
logical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence
of data matters, but based on sets, it does not take into account multiple
occurrences of data values. It is therefore insufficient in scenarios where
such multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning about probabilities and
statistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams
(i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors.
  In this paper we aim at a systematic development of logics of dependence and
independence based on multiteam semantics. We study atomic dependency
properties of finite multiteams and discuss the appropriate meaning of logical
operators to extend the atomic dependencies to full-fledged logics for
reasoning about dependence properties in a multiteam setting. We explore
properties and expressive power of a wide spectrum of different multiteam
logics and compare them to logics with team semantics. We also study the
relationship of logics with multiteam semantics with existential second-order
logic for a specific class of metafinite structures. It turns out that
inclusion-exclusion logic can be characterised in a precise sense by the
Presburger fragment of this logic, but for capturing independence, we need to
go beyond it and add some form of multiplication. Finally we also consider
multiteams with weights in the reals and study the expressive power of formulae
by means of topological properties.

the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF). Weak lensing missions, in
particular, aim at measuring the shape of galaxies, and PSF effects represent
an important source of systematic errors which must be handled appropriately.
This demands a high accuracy in the modelling as well as the estimation of the
PSF at galaxy positions. Sometimes referred to as non-parametric PSF
estimation, the goal of this paper is to estimate a PSF at galaxy positions,
starting from a set of noisy star image observations distributed over the focal
plane. To accomplish this, we need our model to first of all, precisely capture
the PSF field variations over the Field of View (FoV), and then to recover the
PSF at the selected positions. This paper proposes a new method, coined MCCD
(Multi-CCD PSF modelling), that creates, simultaneously, a PSF field model over
all of the instrument's focal plane. This allows to capture global as well as
local PSF features through the use of two complementary models which enforce
different spatial constraints. Most existing non-parametric models build one
model per Charge Coupled Device (CCD), which can lead to difficulties in
capturing global ellipticity patterns. We first test our method on a realistic
simulated dataset comparing it with two state-of-the-art PSF modelling methods
(PSFEx and RCA). We outperform both of them with our proposed method. Then we
contrast our approach with PSFEx on real data from CFIS (Canada France Imaging
Survey) that uses the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope). We show that our
PSF model is less noisy and achieves a 22% gain on pixel Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE) with respect to PSFEx. We present, and share the code of, a new
PSF modelling algorithm that models the PSF field on all the focal plane that
is mature enough to handle real data.

incipient faults. To overcome this, a novel irradiance based three diode model
(IB3DM) is proposed. It is a nine parameter model that provides higher accuracy
even at low irradiance conditions, an important aspect for detecting incipient
faults from noise. To exploit PV data, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is
used due to its ability to detecting incipient faults. Lack of explainability,
feature variability for sample instances, and false alarms are challenges with
data-driven FDD methods. These shortcomings are overcome by hybridization of
XGBoost and IB3DM, and using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
techniques. To combine the XGBoost and IB3DM, a fault-signature metric is
proposed that helps reducing false alarms and also trigger an explanation on
detecting incipient faults. To provide explainability, an eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) application is developed. It uses the local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework and provides
explanations on classifier outputs for data instances. These explanations help

machine learning techniques based on weak supervision to perform searches. Weak
supervision based on mixed samples can be used to search for resonances with
little or no prior knowledge on the production mechanism. Also, it offers the
advantage that sidebands or control regions can be used to effectively model
backgrounds with minimal reliance on simulations. However, weak supervision
alone is found to be highly inefficient in identifying corners of the
multi-dimensional space of interest. Instead, we propose an approach to search
for new resonances that involves a classification procedure that is signature
and topology based. A combination of weak supervision with Deep Neural Network
algorithms are applied following this classification. The performance of this
strategy is evaluated on the production of SM Higgs boson decaying to a pair of
photons inclusively and in exclusive regions of phase space tailored for
specific production modes at the LHC. After verifying the ability of the
methodology to extract different SM Higgs boson signal mechanisms, a search for
new phenomena in high-mass final states is setup for the LHC.

optimal partitions become disordered. Some arguments, which interpret
additional links as thermal excitations and refer to the thermodynamics of
Ising models, suggest a qualitatitve explanation of such a behaviour. The
histogram of overlaps suggests that a replica symmetry is broken in a
one-dimensional small world. In the two-dimensional case, the replica symmetry
seems to hold but with some additional degeneracy of stripe-like partitions.

of dualities: between diffeomorphisms and a notion of ""dual diffeomorphisms"" on
the one hand, and between first order curvature and torsion on the other hand.
This is most elegantly revealed and understood when studying the most general
Lorentz-invariant first order theory in connection and triad variables,
described by the so-called Mielke-Baekler Lagrangian. By analyzing the
quasi-local symmetries of this theory in the covariant phase space formalism,
we show that in each sector of the torsion/curvature duality there exists a
well-defined notion of dual diffeomorphism, which furthermore follows uniquely
from the Sugawara construction. Together with the usual diffeomorphisms, these
duals form at finite distance, without any boundary conditions, and for any
sign of the cosmological constant, a centreless double Virasoro algebra which
in the flat case reduces to the BMS$_3$ algebra. These algebras can then be
centrally-extended via the twisted Sugawara construction. This shows that the
celebrated results about asymptotic symmetry algebras are actually generic
features of three-dimensional gravity at any finite distance. They are however
only revealed when working in first order connection and triad variables, and a
priori inaccessible from Chern-Simons theory. As a bonus, we study the second
order equations of motion of the Mielke-Baekler model, as well as the on-shell
Lagrangian. This reveals the duality between Riemannian metric and teleparallel
gravity, and a new candidate theory for three-dimensional massive gravity which
we call teleparallel topologically massive gravity.

additional electron in the conduction band speeds up the hot electron cooling
by enhanced electron-electron scattering followed by charge redistribution and
polaron formation in picoseconds timescale. The trions are finally decayed by

carriers in the first place, rather than elementary constituents of matter, and

concepts---that characterise quantum mechanics as a theory of physical systems.
To this end, we will illustrate how physical laws can be viewed as algorithms
for the update of memory registers that make a physical system. Imposing the
characteristic properties of physical laws to such an algorithm, i.e.
homogeneity, reversibility and isotropy, we will show that the physical laws
thus selected are particular algorithms known as cellular automata. Further
assumptions regarding maximal simplicity of the algorithm lead to two cellular
automata only, that in a suitable regime can be described by Weyl's
differential equations, lying at the basis of the dynamics of relativistic
quantum fields. We will finally discuss how the same cellular automaton can
give rise to both Fermionic field dynamics and to Maxwell's equations, that
rule the dynamics of the electromagnetic field. We will conclude reviewing the
discussion of the relativity principle, that must be suitably adapted to the
scenario where space-time is not an elementary notion, through the definition
of a change of inertial reference frame, and whose formulation leads to the
recovery of the symmetry of Minkowski space-time, identified with Poincar\'e's
group. Space-time thus emerges as one of the manifestations of physical laws,
rather than the background where they occur, and its features are determined by
the dynamics of systems, necessarily equipped with differential equations that
express it. In brief, there is no space-time unless an evolution rule requires

applications across domains due to their high performance (e.g., high accuracy
on image classification). Nevertheless, a well-trained DNN after deployment
could oftentimes raise errors during practical use in the operational
environment due to the mismatching between distributions of the training
dataset and the potential unknown noise factors in the operational environment,
e.g., weather, blur, noise etc. Hence, it poses a rather important problem for
the DNNs' real-world applications: how to repair the deployed DNNs for
correcting the failure samples (i.e., incorrect prediction) under the deployed
operational environment while not harming their capability of handling normal
or clean data. The number of failure samples we can collect in practice, caused
by the noise factors in the operational environment, is often limited.
Therefore, It is rather challenging how to repair more similar failures based
on the limited failure samples we can collect.
  In this paper, we propose a style-guided data augmentation for repairing DNN
in the operational environment. We propose a style transfer method to learn and
introduce the unknown failure patterns within the failure data into the
training data via data augmentation. Moreover, we further propose the
clustering-based failure data generation for much more effective style-guided

factors that may happen in the real world and compare with four
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods and two DNN repairing methods,
demonstrating that our method can significantly enhance the deployed DNNs on

Such an evolutionary phenomenon should depend on the age of the star-planet

using two independent determinations of host star ages among the
California-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample. We find evidence for a wide and nearly
empty void of planets in the period-radius diagram at the youngest system ages
($\lesssim$2-3 Gyr) represented in the CKS sample. We show that the orbital
period dependence of the radius valley among the younger CKS planets is
consistent with that found among those planets with asteroseismically
determined host star radii. Relative to previous studies of preferentially
older planets, the radius valley determined among the younger planetary sample
is shifted to smaller radii. This result is compatible with an atmospheric loss
timescale on the order of gigayears for progenitors of the largest observed
super-Earths. In support of this interpretation, we show that the planet sizes
which appear to be unrepresented at ages $\lesssim$2-3 Gyr are likely to
correspond to planets with rocky compositions. Our results suggest the size
distribution of close-in exoplanets, and the precise location of the radius

resolve the tension is a period of early dark energy, in which a scalar field
contributes a subdominant part of the energy budget of the universe at this
time. This scenario faces significant fine-tuning problems which can be
ameliorated by a non-trivial coupling of the scalar to the standard model
neutrinos. These become non-relativistic close to the time of matter-radiation
equality, resulting in an energy injection into the scalar that kick-starts the
early dark energy phase, explaining its coincidence with this seemingly
unrelated epoch. We present a minimal version of this neutrino-assisted early
dark energy model, and perform a detailed analysis of its predictions and
theoretical constraints. We consider both particle physics constraints -- that
the model constitute a well-behaved effective field theory for which the
quantum corrections are under control, so that the relevant predictions are
within its regime of validity -- and the constraints provided by requiring a
consistent cosmological evolution from early through to late times. Our work
paves the way for testing this scenario using cosmological data sets.

present deep learning research. Without access to data, conventional
data-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation.
Recently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained
model to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes
biased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to
high-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of
generalizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory
performance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple
yet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to
construct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing:
mixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We
prove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing
methods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge
distillation, and pruning. Specifically, MixMix achieves up to 4% and 20%
accuracy uplift on quantization and pruning, respectively, compared to existing

signal-to-noise ratio of SNR>8. Four of the six emitters are near-infrared
blank SMGs. After excluding one SMG whose emission line is falling at the edge
of the spectral window, all galaxies show clear velocity gradients along the
major axes that are consistent with rotating gas disks. The estimated rotation
velocities of the disks are 330-550 km s$^{-1}$ and the inferred host
dark-matter halo masses are ~2-8 $\times$ 10$^{12}$M$_{\odot}$. From their
estimated halo masses and [CII] luminosity function, we suggest that these
galaxies have a high (50-100%) duty cycle and high (~0.1) baryon conversion
efficiency (SFR relative to baryon accretion rate), and that they contribute
$\simeq$2% to the total star-formation rate density at z=4.6. These SMGs are
concentrated within just 0.3% of the full survey volume, suggesting they are
strongly clustered. The extent of this structure and the individual halo masses

starburst in massive halos at z>4, which could be driven by mergers or fed by

pressure deficit at the storm's center, radius of maximal winds, storm center

Statistically novel aspects include that the model is developed in Lagrangian

low-rank representations along with circular process models. The model is
trained on a set of tropical cyclone data from an advanced weather forecasting

$\mathbb{R}$. A function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{H}$ is slice regular if it is of
class $\mathscr{C}^1$ and, for all complex planes $\mathbb{C}_I$ spanned by $1$
and a quaternionic imaginary unit $I$, the restriction $f_I$ of $f$ to
$\Omega_I=\Omega\cap\mathbb{C}_I$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations
associated to $I$, i.e., $\overline{\partial}_I f_I=0$ on $\Omega_I$, where
$\overline{\partial}_I=\frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}+I\frac{\partial}{\partial\beta}\big)$.
Given any positive natural number $n$, a function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{H}$ is
called slice polyanalytic of order $n$ if it is of class $\mathscr{C}^n$ and
$\overline{\partial}_I^{\,n} f_I=0$ on $\Omega_I$ for all $I$. We define global
slice polyanalytic functions of order $n$ as the functions
$f:\Omega\to\mathbb{H}$, which admit a decomposition of the form
$f(x)=\sum_{h=0}^{n-1}\overline{x}^hf_h(x)$ for some slice regular functions
$f_0,\ldots,f_{n-1}$. Global slice polyanalytic functions of any order $n$ are
slice polyanalytic of the same order $n$. The converse is not true: for each
$n\geq2$, we give examples of slice polyanalytic functions of order $n$, which
are not global.
  The aim of this paper is to study the continuity and the differential
regularity of slice regular and global slice polyanalytic functions viewed as
solutions of the slice-by-slice differential equations
$\overline{\partial}_I^{\,n} f_I=0$ on $\Omega_I$ and as solutions of their
global version $\overline{\vartheta}^nf=0$ on $\Omega\setminus\mathbb{R}$. Our
quaternionic results extend to the monogenic case.

context of Chern Simons (CS) modified gravity theory. Different cosmological
parameters such as energy density, deceleration parameter, equation of state,
square of sound speed and cosmological plane are discussed using FRW metric.
Two separate solutions of CS field equations arose. The R\'{e}nyi HDE model
showed the transition from deceleration to acceleration phase which is fully
consistent with the observational data while in the second case it represented
a decelerated phase of expansion only. In fact, EoS illustrates the era of
dominance of the universe by certain components. Our results predicted that the
universe is under the influence of dark energy as EoS showed accelerated
expansion phase. On the other hand case two advocated the influence of
$\Lambda$ CDM. In both cases, $\omega <0,\omega^{\prime}<0$ indicated that the
R\'{e}nyi HDE model is in the freezing region and cosmic expansion is more
accelerating in the context of CS modified gravity. It is also observed that
the value of $\nu^2_s$ is positive $ \forall z\in \Re $ a sufficient condition
for the stability of the system. Hence it is concluded that the R\'{e}nyi HDE
model is supported by the results of general relativity in the framework of CS
modified gravity.

revenue management and online advertising. In these problems, requests arrive
sequentially during a finite horizon and, for each request, a decision maker
needs to choose an action that consumes a certain amount of resources and
generates reward. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards subject to a
constraint on the total consumption of resources. In this paper, we consider a
data-driven setting in which the reward and resource consumption of each
request are generated using an input model that is unknown to the decision
maker. We design a general class of algorithms that attain good performance in
various input models without knowing which type of input they are facing. In
particular, our algorithms are asymptotically optimal under independent and
identically distributed inputs as well as various non-stationary stochastic
input models, and they attain an asymptotically optimal fixed competitive ratio
when the input is adversarial. Our algorithms operate in the Lagrangian dual
space: they maintain a dual multiplier for each resource that is updated using
online mirror descent. By choosing the reference function accordingly, we
recover the dual sub-gradient descent and dual multiplicative weights update
algorithm. The resulting algorithms are simple, fast, and do not require
convexity in the revenue function, consumption function and action space, in
contrast to existing methods for online allocation problems. We discuss
applications to network revenue management, online bidding in repeated auctions
with budget constraints, online proportional matching with high entropy, and
personalized assortment optimization with limited inventory.

grant-free random access in the sixth-generation (6G) cell-free wireless
networks with sourced and unsourced paradigms. First, we propose a cooperative
framework for solving the problem of device activity detection in sourced
random access. In particular, multiple access points (APs) cooperatively detect
the device activity via exchanging low-dimensional intermediate information
with their neighbors. This is enabled by the proposed covariance-based
algorithm via exploiting both the sparsity-promoting and similarity-promoting
terms of the device state vectors among neighboring APs. A decentralized
approximate separating approach is introduced based on the forward-backward
splitting strategy for addressing the formulated problem. Then, the proposed
activity detection algorithm is adopted as a decoder of cooperative unsourced
random access, where the multiple APs cooperatively detect the list of
transmitted messages regardless of the identity of the transmitting devices.
Finally, we provide sufficient conditions on the step sizes that ensure the
convergence of the proposed algorithm in the sense of Bregman divergence.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for addressing
both sourced and unsourced massive random access problems, while requires a
shorter signature sequence and accommodates a significantly larger number of
active devices with a reasonable antenna array size, compared with the
state-of-art algorithms.

45{\textdegree}] around its array axis (axis along the row of its elements) and
then, scans the imaged object for each pivoted angle by translating the array
perpendicularly to the rotation axis. A theoretical basis is presented so that
the angular and translational scan sampling periods can be best adjusted for
any linear transducer array. We experimentally implemented scanning with a
5-MHz array. In vitro characterization was performed with phantoms designed to
test resolution and contrast. Spatial resolution assessed based on the
full-width half-maximum of images from isolated microspheres was increased by a
factor 3 along the translational direction from a simple translation scan of
the array. Moreover, the resolution is uniform over a cross-sectional area of

blood of COVID-19 patients might be used to predict clinical outcomes.
  Methods: We thus investigated such clinical datasets from COVID-19 patients
with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods
with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random
forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine,
K-nearest neighbour and deep learning methods.
  Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood
samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive

above 90%.
  Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine
clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient
outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital
laboratory analyses of patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19
patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be
optimised.

are ill-equipped to handle. This bias manifests itself when the underlying
causal signal is strongly correlated with other confounding signals due to the
training data collection procedure. In the situation where the confounding
signal is easy-to-learn, deep neural networks will latch onto this and the
resulting model will generalise poorly to in-the-wild test scenarios. We argue
herein that the cause of failure is a combination of the deep structure of
neural networks and the greedy gradient-driven learning process used - one that
prefers easy-to-compute signals when available. We show it is possible to
mitigate against this by generating bias-decoupled training data using latent
adversarial debiasing (LAD), even when the confounding signal is present in
100% of the training data. By training neural networks on these adversarial
examples,we can improve their generalisation in collider bias settings.

interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) models by applying the
simplest phenomenological model which introduces an interaction term between
dark energy (DE) and WIMP DM, i.e., $Q = 3\gamma_{DM} H\rho_{DM}$. In general,
the coupling strength $\gamma_{DE}$ is close to $0$ as the interaction between
DE and WIMP DM is very weak, thus the effect of $\gamma_ {DE}$ on the evolution
of $Y$ associated with DM energy density can be safely neglected. Meanwhile,
our numerical calculation also indicates that $x_f\approx20$ is associated with
DM freeze-out temperature, which is the same as the vanishing interaction
scenario. As for DM relic density, it will be magnified by
$\frac{2-3\gamma_{DM}}{2}[{2\pi g_* m_{DM}^3}/{(45 s_0 x_f^3})]^{\gamma_{DM}}$
times, which provides a new way to test WIMP DM models. As an example, we
analyze the case in which WIMP DM is a scalar DM. (SGL+SNe+Hz) and
(CMB+BAO+SNe) cosmological observations will give
$\gamma_{DM}=0.134^{+0.17}_{-0.069}$ and $\gamma_{DM}=-0.0008\pm0.0016$,
respectively. After further considering the constraints from DM direct
detection experiment, DM indirect detection experiment, and DM relic density,
we find that the allowed parameter space of the scalar DM model will be
completely excluded for the former cosmological observations, while it will
increase for the latter ones. Those two cosmological observations lead to an
almost paradoxical conclusion. Therefore, one could expect more stringent
constraints on the WMIP DM models, with the accumulation of more accurate
cosmological observations in the near future.

of the tachyonic Dirac equation. The first approach works within the theory of
restricted relativity, starting from a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian consistent
with a spacelike four-momentum. The second approach uses the theory of
relativity extended to superluminal motions and works directly on the ordinary
Dirac equation through superluminal Lorentz transformations. The equations
resulting from the two approaches show mostly different, if not opposite,
properties. In particular, the first equation violates the invariance under the
action of the parity and charge conjugation operations. Although it is a good
mathematical tool to describe the dynamics of a space-like particle, it also
shows that the mean particle velocity is subluminal. In contrast, the second
equation is invariant under the action of parity and charge conjugation
symmetries, but the particle it describes is consistent with the classical
dynamics of a tachyon. This study shows that it is not possible with the
currently available theories to formulate a covariant equation that coherently
describes the neutrino in the framework of the physics of tachyons, and
depending on the experiment, one equation rather than the other should be used.

contributions are two-fold: i) the pre-training task creates a model that can
accurately forecast HR based only on cheap activity sensors, and ii) we
leverage the information captured through this task by proposing a simple
method to aggregate the learnt latent representations (embeddings) from the
window-level to user-level. Notably, we show that the embeddings can generalize
in various downstream tasks through transfer learning with linear classifiers,
capturing physiologically meaningful, personalized information. For instance,
they can be used to predict variables associated with individuals' health,

neurodegenerative disorders resulting in impaired memory, communication, and
thought processes. In recent years, clinical research advances in brain aging
have focused on the earliest clinically detectable stage of incipient dementia,
commonly known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Currently, these disorders
are diagnosed using a manual analysis of neuropsychological examinations. We
measure the feasibility of using the linguistic characteristics of verbal
utterances elicited during neuropsychological exams of elderly subjects to
distinguish between elderly control groups, people with MCI, people diagnosed
with possible Alzheimer's disease (AD), and probable AD. We investigated the
performance of both theory-driven psycholinguistic features and data-driven
contextual language embeddings in identifying different clinically diagnosed
groups. Our experiments show that a combination of contextual and
psycholinguistic features extracted by a Support Vector Machine improved
distinguishing the verbal utterances of elderly controls, people with MCI,
possible AD, and probable AD. This is the first work to identify four clinical
diagnosis groups of dementia in a highly imbalanced dataset. Our work shows
that machine learning algorithms built on contextual and psycholinguistic
features can learn the linguistic biomarkers from verbal utterances and assist
clinical diagnosis of different stages and types of dementia, even with limited
data.

can negatively impact the quality of prediction algorithms or are not
informative enough is a crucial storage-saving technique in text indexing and
results in improved computational efficiency. Typically, a generic stop word
list is applied to a dataset regardless of the domain. However, many common
words are different from one domain to another but have no significance within
a particular domain. Eliminating domain-specific common words in a corpus
reduces the dimensionality of the feature space, and improves the performance
of text mining tasks. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical approach
for the automatic extraction of domain-specific words called the
hyperplane-based approach. This new approach depends on the notion of low
dimensional representation of the word in vector space and its distance from
hyperplane. The hyperplane-based approach can significantly reduce text
dimensionality by eliminating irrelevant features. We compare the
hyperplane-based approach with other feature selection methods, namely \c{hi}2
and mutual information. An experimental study is performed on three different
datasets and five classification algorithms, and measure the dimensionality
reduction and the increase in the classification performance. Results indicate
that the hyperplane-based approach can reduce the dimensionality of the corpus
by 90% and outperforms mutual information. The computational time to identify
the domain-specific words is significantly lower than mutual information.

  correlates with mild traumatic brain injury","To be published in Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng. 2021 Feb",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a complex syndrome that affects up to
600 per 100,000 individuals, with a particular concentration among military
personnel. About half of all mTBI patients experience a diverse array of
chronic symptoms which persist long after the acute injury. Hence, there is an
urgent need for better understanding of the white matter and gray matter
pathologies associated with mTBI to map which specific brain systems are
impacted and identify courses of intervention. Previous works have linked mTBI
to disruptions in white matter pathways and cortical surface abnormalities.
Herein, we examine these hypothesized links in an exploratory study of joint
structural connectivity and cortical surface changes associated with mTBI and
its chronic symptoms. Briefly, we consider a cohort of 12 mTBI and 26 control
subjects. A set of 588 cortical surface metrics and 4,753 structural
connectivity metrics were extracted from cortical surface regions and diffusion
weighted magnetic resonance imaging in each subject. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of each metric set. We
then applied independent component analysis (ICA) both to each PCA space
individually and together in a joint ICA approach. We identified a stable
independent component across the connectivity-only and joint ICAs which
presented significant group differences in subject loadings (p<0.05,
corrected). Additionally, we found that two mTBI symptoms, slowed thinking and
forgetfulness, were significantly correlated (p<0.05, corrected) with mTBI
subject loadings in a surface-only ICA. These surface-only loadings captured an
increase in bilateral cortical thickness.

generation photonics and optoelectronics. The challenge is to devise growth,
transfer and fabrication protocols providing high (>5,000 cm2 V-1 s-1) mobility
devices with reliable performance at the wafer scale. Here, we present a flow
for the integration of graphene in photonics circuits. This relies on chemical
vapour deposition (CVD) of single layer graphene (SLG) matrices comprising up
to ~12000 individual single crystals (SCs), grown to match the geometrical
configuration of the devices in the photonic circuit. This is followed by a
transfer approach which guarantees coverage over ~80% of the device area, and
integrity for up to 150 mm wafers, with room temperature mobility ~5000 cm2 V-1
s-1. We use this process flow to demonstrate double SLG electro-absorption
modulators with modulation efficiency ~0.25, 0.45, 0.75, 1 dB V-1 for device
lengths ~30, 60, 90, 120 {\mu}m. The data rate is up to 20 Gbps. Encapsulation
with single-layer hBN is used to protected SLG during plasma-enhanced CVD of
Si3N4, ensuring reproducible device performance. Our full process flow (from
growth to device fabrication) enables the commercial implementation of
graphene-based photonic devices.

  Institutions",,,"10.25147/ijcsr.2017.001.1.22",,"cs.NI cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: This study proposes an adaptive bandwidth management system which
can be explicitly used by educational institutions. The primary goal of the
system is to increase the bandwidth of the users who access more on educational
websites. Through this proposed bandwidth management, the users of the campus
networks is encouraged to utilize the internet for educational purposes.
  Method: The weblog from a university's pfSense proxy server was utilized and
undergo Web Usage Mining (WUM) to determine the number of educational and
non-educational websites accessed by the users. Certain formulas were used in
the computation of the bandwidth which was dynamically assigned to the users. A
prototyping technique was applied in developing adaptive bandwidth management
system. The prototype was simulated and evaluated by experts in compliance with
ISO/IEC 14598-6 and ISO/IEC 9126-1 standards.
  Results: This study found that the prototype is capable of adjusting the
bandwidth of the network users dynamically. The users who browsed more on
educational websites or contents were assigned with higher bandwidth compared
to those who are not. Further, the evaluated prototype met the software
standards of ISO.
  Conclusion: The proposed adaptive bandwidth management can contribute to the
continuous development in the area of computer networking, especially in
designing and managing campus networks. It also helps the network
administrators or IT managers in allocating bandwidth with minimal effort.
