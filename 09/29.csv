stochastic common-spectrum process affecting pulsar timing residuals in its

stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). I examine whether the NANOGrav

for the tensor spectral index $n_T$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.
Explaining NANOGrav while complying with upper limits on $r$ from BICEP2/Keck
Array and Planck requires $r \gtrsim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$ in conjunction with an
extremely blue tensor spectrum, $0.7 \lesssim n_T \lesssim 1.3$. After
discussing models which can realize such a blue spectrum, I show that this

assumed a power-law parametrization for the primordial tensor spectrum, an
inflationary interpretation of the NANOGrav signal is therefore not excluded.

problems out of equilibrium, with manifold applications throughout the natural
and social sciences. To formulate models of stochastic dynamics the
conventional approach consists in superimposing random fluctuations on a
suitable deterministic evolution. These fluctuations are sampled from
probability distributions that are prescribed a priori, most commonly as
Gaussian or L\'evy. While these distributions are motivated by (generalised)
central limit theorems they are nevertheless \textit{unbounded}, meaning that
arbitrarily large fluctuations can be obtained with finite probability. This
property implies the violation of fundamental physical principles such as
special relativity and may yield divergencies for basic physical quantities
like energy. Here we solve the fundamental problem of unbounded random
fluctuations by constructing a comprehensive theoretical framework of
stochastic processes possessing physically realistic finite propagation
velocity. Our approach is motivated by the theory of L\'evy walks, which we
embed into an extension of conventional Poisson-Kac processes. The resulting
extended theory employs generalised transition rates to model subtle
microscopic dynamics, which reproduces non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations
on macroscopic scales. It thus enables the modelling of many different kinds of
dynamical features, as we demonstrate by three physically and biologically
motivated examples. The corresponding stochastic models capture the whole
spectrum of diffusive dynamics from normal to anomalous diffusion, including
the striking `Brownian yet non Gaussian' diffusion, and more sophisticated
phenomena such as senescence. Extended Poisson-Kac theory can therefore be used
to model a wide range of finite velocity dynamical phenomena that are observed
experimentally.

data-rate, and high-dynamic range. Thanks to these characteristics, event
cameras are particularly suited for scenarios with high motion, challenging
lighting conditions and requiring low latency. However, due to the novelty of
the field, the performance of event-based systems on many vision tasks is still
lower compared to conventional frame-based solutions. The main reasons for this
performance gap are: the lower spatial resolution of event sensors, compared to
frame cameras; the lack of large-scale training datasets; the absence of well
established deep learning architectures for event-based processing. In this
paper, we address all these problems in the context of an event-based object
detection task. First, we publicly release the first high-resolution
large-scale dataset for object detection. The dataset contains more than 14
hours recordings of a 1 megapixel event camera, in automotive scenarios,
together with 25M bounding boxes of cars, pedestrians, and two-wheelers,
labeled at high frequency. Second, we introduce a novel recurrent architecture
for event-based detection and a temporal consistency loss for better-behaved
training. The ability to compactly represent the sequence of events into the
internal memory of the model is essential to achieve high accuracy. Our model
outperforms by a large margin feed-forward event-based architectures. Moreover,
our method does not require any reconstruction of intensity images from events,
showing that training directly from raw events is possible, more efficient, and
more accurate than passing through an intermediate intensity image. Experiments
on the dataset introduced in this work, for which events and gray level images
are available, show performance on par with that of highly tuned and studied
frame-based detectors.

the rich properties of magnetic domains. Here, we employ cryogenic scanning
magnetometry using a single-electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in a

study their dynamics in atomically thin CrBr$_3$. The high spatial resolution
of this technique enables imaging of magnetic domains and allows to resolve
domain walls pinned by defects. By controlling the magnetic domain evolution as
a function of magnetic field, we find that the pinning effect is a dominant
coercivity mechanism with a saturation magnetization of about 26~$\mu_B$/nm$^2$
for bilayer CrBr$_3$. The magnetic-domain structure and pinning-effect
dominated domain reversal process are verified by micromagnetic simulation. Our
work highlights scanning nitrogen-vacancy center magnetometry as a quantitative

analyze the performance of the greedy policy, we 1) put forth a relaxed greedy
policy that decouples the sampling processes of the arms, 2) formulate the
sampling process of each arm as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP), and 3) derive the average sampled AoI under the relaxed greedy policy
as a sum of the average AoI sampled from individual arms. Numerical and

approximation to the greedy policy in terms of the expected AoI sampled over an

phenomena. The 2D Boussinesq system focused here is anisotropic and involves
only horizontal dissipation and horizontal thermal diffusion. Due to the lack

out the possibility that the remnant might be a dynamically stable neutron star

recent events, I argue that the universal maximum density hypothesis should be
revived. Accordingly, the central densities in the cores of ultra-compact
objects must be upper-limited by the critical density number $n_{cr},$ beyond
which supradense nuclear matter becomes purely incompressible.
  Based on the spacetime-matter coupling in GR, it is shown that the topology
of spacetime embedding incompressible quantum fluids with $n =n_{cr}$ must be
Minkowski flat, which implies that spacetime at the background of ultra-compact

interaction topology affects synchronization. Many studies have gained key
insights into this question by studying the classic Kuramoto oscillator model
on static networks. However, new questions arise when network structure is
time-varying or when the oscillator system is multistable, the latter of which
can occur when an inertial term is added to the Kuramoto model. While the
consequences of evolving topology and multistability on collective behavior
have been examined separately, real-world systems such as gene regulatory
networks and the brain can exhibit these properties simultaneously. How does
the rewiring of network connectivity affect synchronization in systems with
multistability, where different paths of network evolution may differentially
impact system dynamics? To address this question, we study the effects of
time-evolving network topology on coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. We
show that hysteretic synchronization behavior occurs when the network density
of coupled inertial oscillators is slowly varied as the dynamics evolve.
Moreover, we find that certain fixed-density rewiring schemes induce
significant changes to the level of global synchrony, and that these changes
remain after the network returns to its initial configuration and are robust to
a wide range of network perturbations. Our findings suggest that the specific
progression of network topology, in addition to its initial or final static
structure, can play a considerable role in modulating the collective behavior
of systems evolving on complex networks.

the possibility that their progenitors assumed to be globular clusters may have
formed elsewhere, migrated to and assembled near their present location. The
main challenge for this scenario is whether globular clusters can withstand the
tidal field of their host galaxies. Our analysis suggests that provided the
mass-density distribution of background potential is relatively shallow, as in
some galaxies with relatively flat surface brightness profiles, the tidal field
near the center of galaxies may be shown to be able to compress rather than
disrupt a globular cluster at a distance from the center much smaller than the
conventionally defined `tidal disruption radius', $r_t$. To do so, we adopt a
previously constructed formalism and consider the secular evolution of star
clusters with a homogeneous mass density distribution. We analytically solve
the secular equations in the limit that the mass density of stars in the
galactic center approaches a uniform distribution. Our model indicates that a
star cluster could travel to distances much smaller than $r_t$ without
disruption, thus potentially contributing to the formation of the nuclear
cluster. However, appropriate numerical N-body simulations are needed to
confirm our analytic findings.

advertisements and marketing, and policy making. There are two significant
challenges associated with undertaking causal inference using observational
data: treatment assignment heterogeneity (\textit{i.e.}, differences between
the treated and untreated groups), and an absence of counterfactual data
(\textit{i.e.}, not knowing what would have happened if an individual who did
get treatment, were instead to have not been treated). We address these two
challenges by combining structured inference and targeted learning. In terms of
structure, we factorize the joint distribution into risk, confounding,
instrumental, and miscellaneous factors, and in terms of targeted learning, we
apply a regularizer derived from the influence curve in order to reduce
residual bias. An ablation study is undertaken, and an evaluation on benchmark
datasets demonstrates that TVAE has competitive and state of the art
performance.

  Active Tracking",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decades, visual target tracking has been one of the primary
research interests of the Robotics research community. The recent advances in
Deep Learning technologies have made the exploitation of visual tracking
approaches effective and possible in a wide variety of applications, ranging
from automotive to surveillance and human assistance. However, the majority of
the existing works focus exclusively on passive visual tracking, i.e., tracking
elements in sequences of images by assuming that no actions can be taken to
adapt the camera position to the motion of the tracked entity. On the contrary,
in this work, we address visual active tracking, in which the tracker has to
actively search for and track a specified target. Current State-of-the-Art
approaches use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to address the
problem in an end-to-end manner. However, two main problems arise: i) most of
the contributions focus only on discrete action spaces and the ones that
consider continuous control do not achieve the same level of performance; and
ii) if not properly tuned, DRL models can be challenging to train, resulting in
a considerably slow learning progress and poor final performance. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel DRL-based visual active tracking system
that provides continuous action policies. To accelerate training and improve
the overall performance, we introduce additional objective functions and a
Heuristic Trajectory Generator (HTG) to facilitate learning. Through an
extensive experimentation, we show that our method can reach and surpass other
State-of-the-Art approaches performances, and demonstrate that, even if trained
exclusively in simulation, it can successfully perform visual active tracking
even in real scenarios.

distribution of an Active Ornstein Uhlenbeck Particle (AOUP) experiencing, in
addition to self-propulsion, a Gaussian white noise modelling a bath at
temperature T. This allows us to derive analytical formulas for three
quantities: the spatial density of a confined particle, the current induced by
an asymmetric periodic potential and the entropy production rate. These
formulas disentangle the respective roles of the passive and active noises on
the steady state of AOUPs, showing that signatures of non-equilibrium can
display surprising behaviors as the temperature is varied. Indeed, depending on
the potential in which the particle evolves, both the current and the entropy
production rate can be non-monotonic functions of T. The latter can even
diverge at high temperature for steep enough confining potentials. Thus,
depending on context, switching on translational diffusion may drive the
particle closer to or further away from equilibrium. We then probe the range of
validity of our quantitative derivations by numerical simulations. Finally, we
explain how the method presented here to tackle perturbatively an Ornstein
Uhlenbeck (OU) noise could be further generalized beyond the Brownian case.

imaging of microvasculature at capillary level. Currently, the clinical utility
of ULM on clinical ultrasound scanners is hindered by the technical
limitations, such as long data acquisition time, and compromised tracking
performance associated with low imaging frame-rate. Here we present an in-human
ULM on a high frame-rate (HFR) clinical ultrasound scanner to achieve
super-resolution microvessel imaging using a short acquisition time (<10s).
Ultrasound MB data were acquired from different human tissues, (liver, kidney,
pancreatic, and breast tumor) using an HFR clinical scanner. By leveraging the
HFR and advanced processing techniques including sub-pixel motion registration,
MB signal separation, and Kalman filter-based tracking, MBs can be robustly
localized and tracked for successful ULM under the circumstances of relatively
high MB concentration and limited data acquisition time in humans. Subtle
morphological and hemodynamic information were demonstrated on data acquired
with single breath-hold and free-hand scanning. Compared with contrast-enhanced
power Doppler generated based on the same MB dataset, ULM showed a 5.7-fold
resolution improvement in a vessel, and provided a wide-range flow speed
measurement that is Doppler angle-independent. This study demonstrated the
feasibility of ultrafast in-human ULM in various human tissues based on a
clinical scanner that supports HFR imaging, and showed a great potential for
the implementation of super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging in a
myriad of clinical applications involving microvascular abnormalities and

Since a $P_t$-free graph contains $\mathcal{O}(n^{t-1})$ induced paths in

most recent observations for this system. We used the photometric observations
from the Solaris network and the TESS telescope, combined with the new radial
velocities from the CHIRON spectrograph and those published in the literature.
We confirmed that V1200 Cen consists of a 2.5-day eclipsing binary orbited by a
third body. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are
$M_{Aa} = 1.393\pm0.018\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{Aa} = 1.407\pm0.014\,$R$_\odot$ and
$T_{{\rm eff},Aa} = 6\,588\pm58\,$K for the primary, and $M_{Ab} =
0.863\,3\pm0.008\,1\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{Ab} = 1.154\pm0.014\,$R$_\odot$ and
$T_{{\rm eff},Ab} = 4\,475\pm68\,$K for the secondary. Regarding the third
body, we obtained significantly different results than previously published.
The period of the outer orbit is found to be 180.4 days, implying a minimum
mass $M_B = 0.871\pm0.020\,$M$_\odot$. Thus, we argue that V1200 Cen is a
quadruple system with a secondary pair composed of two low-mass stars. Finally,
we determined the ages of each eclipsing component using two evolution codes,
namely MESA and CESTAM. We obtained ages of 16-18.5$\,$Myr and 5.5-7$\,$Myr for
the primary and the secondary, respectively. In particular, the secondary
appears larger and hotter than predicted at the age of the primary. We
concluded that dynamical and tidal interactions occurring in multiples may
alter the stellar properties and explain the apparent non-coevality of V1200
Centauri.

unstable. We present an alternative that has both advantages and suffers from
neither of the disadvantages; by representing $k$-dimensional subspaces as

sequential decision-making problems. Episodic reinforcement learning
generalizes contextual bandits and is often perceived to be more difficult due
to long planning horizon and unknown state-dependent transitions. The current
paper shows that the long planning horizon and the unknown state-dependent
transitions (at most) pose little additional difficulty on sample complexity.
  We consider the episodic reinforcement learning with $S$ states, $A$ actions,
planning horizon $H$, total reward bounded by $1$, and the agent plays for $K$
episodes. We propose a new algorithm, \textbf{M}onotonic \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{P}ropagation (MVP), which relies on a new Bernstein-type bonus.
Compared to existing bonus constructions, the new bonus is tighter since it is
based on a well-designed monotonic value function. In particular, the
\emph{constants} in the bonus should be subtly setting to ensure optimism and
monotonicity.
  We show MVP enjoys an $O\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK} + S^2A\right) \poly\log

$\Omega\left(\sqrt{SAK}\right)$ lower bound of \emph{contextual bandits} up to

properties of high-redshift ($z>4$) black holes over a wide mass range, $10^3 <
M_{bh}/M_\odot < 10^{10}$. Our black hole growth implementation includes a
critical halo mass ($M_{h}^{crit}$) below which the black hole is starved and
above which it is allowed to grow either at the Eddington limit or
proportionally to the gas content of the galaxy. As a consequence, after an
initial growth phase dominated by black hole mergers down to $z \sim 7 (9)$,
supermassive black holes in $z=4$ halo masses of $M_h|_{z=4} \sim 10^{11.75} ~
(10^{13.4}) M_\odot$ mainly grow by gas accretion from the interstellar medium.
In particular, we find that: (i) while most of the accretion occurs in the
major branch for $M_h|_{z=4} \sim 10^{11-12} M_\odot$ halos, accretion in
secondary branches plays a significant role in assembling the black hole mass
in higher-mass halos ($M_h|_{z=4} \gtrsim 10^{12} M_\odot$); (ii) while the
Eddington ratio increases with decreasing redshift for low-mass ($M_{bh} < 10^5
M_\odot$) black holes, it shows the opposite trend for larger masses. In
addition, since the accretion rate depends on the gas mass present in the host
halo, the duty cycle of the Eddington-limited accretion phase -- which can last
up to $\approx 650$ Myr -- is crucially linked to the joint assembly history of
the black hole and its host halo.

  Focusing on the round complexity of the shuffle model, we ask in this work
what can be computed in the shuffle model of differential privacy with two
rounds. Ishai et al. [FOCS 2006] showed how to use one round of the shuffle to
establish secret keys between every two parties. Using this primitive to
simulate a general secure multi-party protocol increases its round complexity
by one. We show how two parties can use one round of the shuffle to send secret
messages without having to first establish a secret key, hence retaining round
complexity. Combining this primitive with the two-round semi-honest protocol of
Applebaun et al. [TCC 2018], we obtain that every randomized functionality can
be computed in the shuffle model with an honest majority, in merely two rounds.
This includes any differentially private computation. We then move to examine
differentially private computations in the shuffle model that (i) do not
require the assumption of an honest majority, or (ii) do not admit one-round
protocols, even with an honest majority. For that, we introduce two
computational tasks: the common-element problem and the nested-common-element
problem, for which we show separations between one-round and two-round
protocols.

transiting BDs have similar masses, but very different radii and ages. Their
host stars have similar masses, effective temperatures, and metallicities. The
younger and larger transiting BD is TOI-811b at a mass of $M_b = 55.3 \pm

$93^{+61}_{-29}$ Myr, which we derive from an application of gyrochronology to
its host star, is why this BD's radius is relatively large, not heating from
its host star since this BD orbits at a longer orbital period than most known
transiting BDs. This constraint on the youth of TOI-811b allows us to test
substellar mass-radius isochrones where the radius of BDs changes rapidly with

BDs that trace out the oldest substellar mass-radius isochrones where
contraction of the BD's radius asymptotically slows. Both host stars have a
mass of $M_\star = 1.32{\rm M_\odot}\pm0.05$ and differ in their radii, $T_{\rm

cosmological simulations (MassiveFIRE) of the Feedback in Realistic

UV}$ relation that is in good agreement with the observed relation in nearby
galaxies. IRX is tightly coupled to the UV optical depth, and is mainly
determined by the dust-to-star geometry instead of total dust mass, while
$\beta_{\rm UV}$ is set both by stellar properties, UV optical depth, and the
dust extinction law. Overall, much of the scatter in the IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$
relation of our sample is found to be driven by variations of the intrinsic UV
spectral slope. We further assess how the IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation depends
on viewing direction, dust-to-metal ratio, birth-cloud structures, and the dust
extinction law and we present a simple model that encapsulates most of the
found dependencies. Consequently, we argue that the reported `deficit' of the

non-standard dust extinction law at those epochs.

one-dimensional model, we study the spatial correlation among ionization rates
of gas, 6.4 keV line fluxes, and gamma-ray emissions from a molecular cloud
illuminated by CRs accelerated at an adjacent supernova remnant. We find that
the spatial distributions of these three observables depend on how CRs intrude
the cloud and on the internal structure of the cloud. If the intrusion is
represented by slow diffusion, the 6.4 keV line should be detected around the
cloud edge where ionization rates are high. On the other hand, if CRs freely
stream in the cloud, the 6.4 keV line should be observed where gamma rays are
emitted. In the former, the cooling time of the CRs responsible for the 6.4 keV
line is shorter than their cloud crossing time, and it is opposite in the
latter. Although we compare the results with observations, we cannot conclude
whether the diffusion or the free-streaming is dominantly realized. Our
predictions can be checked in more detail with future X-ray missions such as
XRISM and Athena and by observations of ionization rates that cover wider

of disk pebbles (mm-cm dust grains), from millimeter observations with ALMA or
the SMA, and ii) infrared molecular emission spectra as observed with Spitzer.
The line flux ratios of H2O with HCN, C2H2, and CO2 all anti-correlate with the
dust disk radius R$_{dust}$, expanding previous results found by Najita et al.
(2013) for HCN/H2O and the dust disk mass. By normalization with the dependence
on accretion luminosity common to all molecules, only the H2O luminosity
maintains a detectable anti-correlation with disk radius, suggesting that the
strongest underlying relation is between H2O and R$_{dust}$. If R$_{dust}$ is
set by large-scale pebble drift, and if molecular luminosities trace the
elemental budgets of inner disk warm gas, these results can be naturally
explained with scenarios where the inner disk chemistry is fed by sublimation
of oxygen-rich icy pebbles migrating inward from the outer disk.
Anti-correlations are also detected between all molecular luminosities and the
infrared index n$_{13-30}$, which is sensitive to the presence and size of an
inner disk dust cavity. Overall, these relations suggest a physical
interconnection between dust and gas evolution both locally and across disk
scales. We discuss fundamental predictions to test this interpretation and
study the interplay between pebble drift, inner disk depletion, and the

Population II stars (Z=0.0001) evolves through a stable Roche lobe overflow and
common envelope episode. Both exposed stellar cores undergo direct
core-collapse and form massive BHs while avoiding pair-instability pulsation
mass-loss or total disruption. LIGO/Virgo observations show that the merger
rate density of light BH-BH mergers (both components: <50 Msun) is of the order

to clean settings without disorder. This fact raises the question whether an
homogeneous discrete time crystal is possible in which the originally expected
heating is evaded. Studying both a localized and an homogeneous model with
short-range interactions, we clarify this issue showing explicitly the key
differences between the two cases. On the one hand, our careful scaling
analysis confirms that, in the thermodynamic limit and in contrast to localized
discrete time crystals, homogeneous systems indeed heat. On the other hand, we
show that, thanks to a mechanism reminiscent of quantum scars, finite-size
homogeneous systems can still exhibit very crisp signatures of time
crystallinity. A subharmonic response can in fact persist over timescales that
are much larger than those set by the integrability-breaking terms, with
thermalization possibly occurring only at very large system sizes (e.g., of
hundreds of spins). Beyond clarifying the emergence of heating in disorder-free
systems, our work casts a spotlight on finite-size homogeneous systems as prime
candidates for the experimental implementation of nontrivial out-of-equilibrium

temperature of the emission in both bands ($>10^6$ K) suggests that it is a
pc-scale jet produced by the AGN. The relatively steep VLBA spectral index
($\alpha_{VLBA} = 0.63\pm0.03$) is consistent with the presence of optically
thin emission on milliarcsecond scales. Finally, we investigated two possible
scenarios that can result in the misalignment between the kpc and pc-scale

define the (first) chiral limit where the AA stacking hopping is zero, and a
flat limit with exactly flat bands. In the chiral-flat limit, the TBG
Hamiltonian has a U(4)$\times$U(4) symmetry, and we find that the exact ground
states at integer filling $-4\le \nu\le 4$ relative to charge neutrality are
Chern insulators of Chern numbers $\nu_C=4-|\nu|,2-|\nu|,\cdots,|\nu|-4$, all
of which are degenerate. This confirms recent experiments where Chern
insulators are found to be competitive low-energy states of TBG. When the
chiral-flat limit is reduced to the nonchiral-flat limit which has a U(4)
symmetry, we find $\nu=0,\pm2$ has exact ground states of Chern number $0$,
while $\nu=\pm1,\pm3$ has perturbative ground states of Chern number
$\nu_C=\pm1$, which are U(4) ferromagnetic. In the chiral-nonflat limit with a
different U(4) symmetry, different Chern number states are degenerate up to
second order perturbations. In the realistic nonchiral-nonflat case, we find
that the perturbative insulator states with Chern number $\nu_C=0$
($0<|\nu_C|<4-|\nu|$) at integer fillings $\nu$ are fully (partially)
intervalley coherent, while the insulator states with Chern number
$|\nu_C|=4-|\nu|$ are valley polarized. However, for $0<|\nu_C|\le4-|\nu|$, the
fully intervalley coherent states are highly competitive (0.005meV/electron
higher). At nonzero magnetic field $|B|>0$, a first-order phase transition for
$\nu=\pm1,\pm2$ from Chern number $\nu_C=\text{sgn}(\nu B)(2-|\nu|)$ to
$\nu_C=\text{sgn}(\nu B)(4-|\nu|)$ is expected, which agrees with recent

at optical/near-infrared wavelengths we further show that the sources lacking
such counterparts are likely to be high-redshift in nature (typical

rates, implying that exotic materials with orbital $L$ order or large
spin-orbit couplings $L\otimes S$ are not necessary to have strong reach to a
broad class of DM models. We highlight that phonon based crystal experiments in

Wigner crystals (GWCs). In this article, we investigate the problem of Wigner
crystallization in the presence of an underlying (moir\'e) lattice. Based on
the best estimates of the system parameters, we find a variety of homobilayer
and heterobilayer TMDs to be excellent candidates for realizing GWCs. In
particular, our analysis based on $r_{s}$ indicates that $\rm MoSe_{2}$ (among
the homobilayers) and $\rm MoSe_2/WSe_2$ or $\rm MoS_2/ WS_2$ (among the
heterobilayers) are the best candidates for realizing GWCs. We also establish
that due to larger effective mass of the valence bands, in general,
hole-crystals are easier to realize that electron-crystals as seen
experimentally. For completeness, we show that satisfying the Mott criterion
$n_{\rm Mott}^{1/2} a_{\ast} = 1$ requires densities nearly three orders of
magnitude larger than the maximal density for GWC formation. This indicates
that for the typical density of operation, HoM or HeM systems are far from the
Mott insulating regime. These crystals realized on a moir\'e lattice, unlike
the conventional Wigner crystals, are incompressible due the gap arising from
pinning with the lattice. Finally, we capture this many-body gap by
variationally renormalizing the dispersion of the vibration modes. We show
these low-energy modes, arising from coupling of the WC with the moir\'e
lattice, can be effectively modeled as a Sine-Gordon theory of fluctuations.

evidence that the extreme star-formation rates observed in the most active

configurations at kilo-parsec scales with different magnetic field profiles,
jet speeds, and density contrast. We also obtain synthetic non-thermal emission
signatures for different viewing angles using an approach that assumes static
particle spectra and that obtained by evolving the particle spectra using
Lagrangian macro-particles incorporating the effects of shock acceleration and
radiative losses. We find that the shocks due to Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability in the axial magnetic field configurations can strongly affect the
jet dynamics. Additionally, we also find the presence of weak biconical shocks
in the under-dense jet columns. The inclusion of a helical magnetic field
hinders the vortex growth at the shear surface thereby stabilizing the jet
column. With the evolving particle spectra approach, the synthetic SEDs
obtained for cases with strong KH instability show the presence of multiple
humps ranging from radio to TeV gamma-ray band. We conclude that the
high-energy electrons accelerated in the vicinity of freshly formed shocks due

power of the asymptotic-safety paradigm. Firstly, we strengthen indications
that quantum gravitational fluctuations could drive scalar potentials towards
flatness, with intriguing potential implications for inflation and dark energy.
Secondly, we explore how asymptotic safety could rule out large parts of the
parameter space in models for scalar dark matter. Thirdly, we discover hints
that at an asymptotically safe fixed point with finite top quark mass, the
non-minimal Higgs-curvature coupling could be constrained. Finally, by
combining the constraining power of asymptotic safety in particle physics and
cosmology, we find hints that Higgs inflation lies in the asymptotically safe
swampland. In summary, we strengthen previous indications for the constraining
power of asymptotic safety and the resulting large extent of the asymptotically
safe swampland.

large statistical sample to measure the IGM evolution during the transition
phase of the reionization epoch. We construct a data set of deep optical
spectra of these quasars using VLT, Keck, Gemini, LBT, and MMT. We measure the
Ly$\alpha$ effective optical depth at $5.36<z<6.57$ using the Ly$\alpha$
forests of both individual spectra and the stacked spectrum. The large scatter
of individual measurements is consistent with previous work, suggesting an
inhomogeneous reionization process. Combining our new measurements and previous
results, we obtain a best-fit for the Ly$\alpha$ effective optical depth
evolution at $z>5.3$, $\tau\propto(1+z)^{8.6\pm1.0}$. We then estimate the
observed Ly$\beta$ effective optical depth using Ly$\beta$ forests and convert
them to Ly$\alpha$ optical depth for comparison, which provides additional
constraints on the evolution of the IGM optical depth. The Ly$\beta$-based
measurements are generally in agreement with the best-fit evolution obtained
from Ly$\alpha$ forests. Using this new sample, we identify 389 Ly$\alpha$ and
50 Ly$\beta$ transmission spikes at $5.5<z<6.3$. The upper limits of Ly$\alpha$
optical depth estimated using transmission spikes are well consistent with our
best-fit evolution. The evolution in number density of these high-redshift
transmission spikes suggests a rapid transition phase at the end of the
reionization. Comparison of our optical depth measurements with hydrodynamical
simulations indicates a IGM neutral hydrogen fraction $\langle f_{\rm

quantum field theory (QFT). To this end, we use for definiteness a scalar QFT
with a $\varphi^{4}$ interaction, where the field $\varphi$ represents a
particle with mass $m$. A bound state of the $\varphi$-$\varphi$ type is
created when the coupling constant is negative and its modulus is larger than a
certain critical value. We investigate the contribution of this bound state to
the pressure of the thermal gas of the system by using the $S$-matrix formalism
involving the derivative of the phase-shift scattering. Our analysis, which is
based on an unitarized one-loop resumed approach which renders the theory
finite and well-defined for each value of the coupling constant, leads to
following main results: (i) We generalize the phase-shift formula in order to
take into account within a unique formal approach the two-particle interaction
as well as the bound state (if existent). (ii) \textit{On the one hand}, the
number density of the bound state in the system at a certain temperature $T$ is
obtained by the standard thermal integral; this is the case for any binding
energy, even if it is much smaller than the temperature of the thermal gas.
(iii) \textit{On the other hand}, the contribution of the bound state to the
total pressure is partly -- but not completely -- canceled by the two-particle
interaction contribution to the pressure. (iv) The pressure as function of the
coupling constant is \textit{continuous} also at the critical coupling for the
bound state formation: the jump in pressure due to the sudden appearance of the
bound state is exactly canceled by an analogous jump (but with opposite sign)
of the interaction contribution to the pressure.

order on an arbitrary closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $d$, which reads
\[ \log \mathcal D \le c \mu (L/a)^{d-2}.\] Here, $L$ is the diameter of the

Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) radio telescope. However, no
radio bursts were detected from FRB 180916.J0158+65 at any of the frequencies
used during our observations with the DSN radio telescopes. We find that FRB
180916.J0158+65's apparent activity is strongly frequency-dependent due to the
narrowband nature of its radio bursts, which have less spectral occupancy at
high radio frequencies ($\gtrsim$ 2 GHz). We also find that fewer or fainter
bursts are emitted from the source at high radio frequencies. We discuss the
implications of these results on possible progenitor models of repeating FRBs.

wireless communications, limited channel state information (CSI) feedback is a
central tool to support advanced single- and multi-user MIMO
beamforming/precoding. To achieve a given CSI quality, the CSI quantization
codebook size has to grow exponentially with the number of antennas, leading to
quantization complexity, as well as, feedback overhead issues for larger MIMO
systems. We have recently proposed a multi-stage recursive Grassmannian
quantizer that enables a significant complexity reduction of CSI quantization.
In this paper, we show that this recursive quantizer can effectively be
combined with deep learning classification to further reduce the complexity,
and that it can exploit temporal channel correlations to reduce the CSI

variability in their X-ray emission due to our changing view of the intrabinary
shock (IBS) between the pulsar wind and stellar wind from the companion. Some
redbacks (""transitional"" MSPs) have shown dramatic changes in their
multiwavelength properties, indicating a transition from a radio pulsar state
to an accretion-powered state. The redback MSP 47 Tuc W showed clear X-ray
orbital variability in the Chandra ACIS-S observations in 2002, which were not
detectable in the longer Chandra HRC-S observations in 2005-06, suggesting that
it might have undergone a state transition. However, the Chandra observations
of 47 Tuc in 2014-15 show similar X-ray orbital variability as in 2002. We
explain the different X-ray light-curves from these epochs in terms of two
components of the X-ray spectrum (soft X-rays from the pulsar, vs. harder
X-rays from the IBS), and different sensitivities of the X-ray instruments
observing in each epoch. However, when we use our best-fit spectra with HRC
response files to model the HRC light-curve, we expect a more significant and
shorter dip than that observed in the 2005-06 Chandra data. This suggests an
intrinsic change in the IBS of the system. We use the ICARUS stellar modelling
software, including calculations of heating by an IBS, to model the X-ray,
optical, and UV light-curves of 47 Tuc W. Our best-fitting parameters point
towards a high-inclination system (i~60 deg), which is primarily heated by the
pulsar radiation, with an IBS dominated by the companion wind momentum.

explicit breaking of $U(1)_A$ symmetry. We have attempted a systematic analysis
of the model parameters by fitting to self-consistent lattice QCD calculations.
Three parameters of the model are fixed by $eB=0$ results from published
lattice QCD on the chiral condensate, the pion decay constant ($F_\pi$), and
the pion mass ($m_\pi$). The difference of the $u$ and $d$ quark condensates in
the presence of a magnetic field ($eB$) is quite sensitive to $c$ and we fix
$c$ using published lattice QCD results for this observable. We see no evidence
that $c$ depends on $eB$. The crossover temperature decreases with increasing
$eB$ only for condensate values at the lower end of the allowed values (as
already seen in~\cite{Pagura:2016pwr}) and $F_\pi$ at the upper end of the
allowed values. We further check our model predictions by calculating the
topological susceptibility with the fitted $c$ values and comparing it with

various ways, combining results from mini and midisuperspace models. In the
past, the underlying geometry of space-time has often been expressed in terms
of line elements with metric components that differ from the classical
solutions of general relativity, motivated by modified equations of motion and
constraints. However, recent results have shown by explicit calculations that
most of these constructions violate general covariance and slicing
independence. The proposed line elements and black-hole models are therefore
ruled out. The only known possibility to escape this sentence is to derive not
only modified metric components but also a new space-time structure which is
covariant in a generalized sense. Formally, such a derivation is made available
by an analysis of the constraints of canonical gravity, which generate
deformations of hypersurfaces in space-time, or generalized versions if the
constraints are consistently modified. Implications for black holes are
described here. [Abbreviated abstract]

reduces to GCN. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in more realistic and challenging experimental settings with
significantly less training data compared to previous works: CPGNN variants
achieve state-of-the-art results in heterophily settings with or without

patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic
seizures (FBTCS) differ from alterations in patients without FBTCS.
  Methods: We dichotomized a cohort of 83 drug-resistant patients with TLE into
those with and without FBTCS and compared each group to 29 healthy controls.
For each subject, we used diffusion MRI to construct whole-brain structural
networks. First, we measured the extent of alterations by performing
FBTCS-negative (FBTCS-) versus control and FBTCS-positive (FBTCS+) versus
control comparisons, thereby delineating altered sub-networks of the
whole-brain structural network. Second, by standardising networks of each
patient using control networks, we measured the subject-specific abnormality at
every brain region in the network, thereby quantifying the spatial localisation
and the amount of abnormality in every patient.
  Results: Both FBTCS+ and FBTCS- patient groups had altered sub-networks with
reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) compared
to controls. The altered subnetwork in FBTCS+ patients was more widespread than
in FBTCS- patients (441 connections altered at t>3, p<0.001 in FBTCS+ compared
to 21 connections altered at t>3, p=0.01 in FBTCS-). Significantly greater
abnormalities-aggregated over the entire brain network as well as assessed at
the resolution of individual brain areas-were present in FBTCS+ patients
(p<0.001, d=0.82). In contrast, the fewer abnormalities present in FBTCS-
patients were mainly localised to the temporal and frontal areas.
  Significance: The whole-brain structural network is altered to a greater and
more widespread extent in patients with TLE and FBTCS. We suggest that these
abnormal networks may serve as an underlying structural basis or consequence of
the greater seizure spread observed in FBTCS.

part of the speed advantage is due to the feature to work in-place. Previously,
the in-place feature often implied performance penalties. Our main algorithmic
contribution is a blockwise approach to in-place data distribution that is
provably cache-efficient. We also parallelize this approach taking dynamic load
balancing and memory locality into account. Our comparison-based algorithm,
In-place Superscalar Samplesort (IPS$^4$o), combines this technique with
branchless decision trees. By taking cases with many equal elements into
account and by adapting the distribution degree dynamically, we obtain a highly
robust algorithm that outperforms the best in-place parallel comparison-based
competitor by almost a factor of three. IPS$^4$o also outperforms the best
comparison-based competitors in the in-place or not in-place, parallel or

The contribution is fourfold. Firstly, we present a generalised S-procedure

Secondly, we identify a class of uncertain systems over which the robust
feedback stability implies the existence of an appropriate Zames-Falb
multiplier based on the generalised S-procedure lossless theorem. Meanwhile, we
show that the existence of such a Zames-Falb multiplier is sufficient for the
robust feedback stability over a smaller class of uncertain systems. Thirdly,
when restricted to be static (a.k.a. memoryless), the second class of systems
coincides with the class of sloped-restricted monotone nonlinearities, and the
classical result of using the Zames-Falb multipliers to ensure feedback
stability is recovered. Lastly, when restricted to be LTI, the second class is
demonstrated to be a subset of the third, and the existence of a Zames-Falb

an analytical model considering synchrotron emission from an electron
distribution that is accelerated at a shock front with an energy-dependent
diffusion(EDD model). The spectral fit of NuSTAR and Swift-XRT observations
using EDD model during different flux states reveal the model parameters are
strongly correlated. We perform a detailed investigation of this correlation to
decipher the information hidden underneath. The model predicts the synchrotron
peak energy to be correlated with the peak spectral curvature which is
consistent with the case of Mkn 421. Expressing the energy dependence of the
diffusion in terms of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence energy index, it
appears the turbulence shifts from Kolmogorov/Kraichnan type to Bohm limit
during high flux states. Further, the correlation between the best-fit
parameters of EDD model lets us derive an expression for the product of source
magnetic field(B) and jet Doppler factor($\delta$) in terms of synchrotron and
Compton peak energies. The synchrotron peak energy is obtained using the
simultaneous Swift-XRT and NuSTAR observations; whereas, the Compton peak
energy is estimated by performing a linear regression analysis of the archival
spectral peaks. The deduced $\delta$B varies over a wide range; however, it
satisfies reasonably well with the values estimated solely from the spectral
peak energies independent of the EDD model. This highlights the plausible
connection between the microscopic description of the electron diffusion with
the macroscopic quantities deciding the broadband spectrum of Mkn 421.

proper mammographic positioning is paramount. Proper positioning ensures
adequate visualization of breast tissue and is necessary for effective breast
cancer detection. Therefore, breast-imaging radiologists must assess each
mammogram for the adequacy of positioning before providing a final
interpretation of the examination; this often necessitates return patient
visits for additional imaging. In this paper, we propose a deep

process to identify poorly positioned mammograms. Our objective for this
algorithm is to assist mammography technologists in recognizing inadequately
positioned mammograms real-time, improve the quality of mammographic
positioning and performance, and ultimately reducing repeat visits for patients
with initially inadequate imaging. The proposed model showed a true positive
rate for detecting correct positioning of 91.35% in the mediolateral oblique

present an automatically generated report which can aid the mammography

Specifically, a general class of discrete-time time-invariant nonlinear systems
is considered. First, the dynamics of a nonlinear system is approximated with a
directed graph. Subsequently, the condition for robust control invariance is
derived and an algorithm for computing the robust control invariant set is
presented. The algorithm combines the iterative subdivision technique with the
robust control invariance condition to produce outer approximations of the
largest robust control invariant set at each iteration. Following this, we
prove convergence of the algorithm to the largest RCIS as the iterations
proceed to infinity. Based on the developed algorithms, an algorithm to compute
inner approximations of the RCIS is also presented. A special case of input
affine and disturbance affine systems is also considered. Finally, two

Significant 2175~{\AA} excess absorption features of moderate strength are
measured, especially in the composite spectra. The excess absorption is well
described by a Drude profile. The bump amplitude expressed in units of
$k(\lambda)=A(\lambda)/E(B-V)$, relative to the featureless Calzetti et al.

with the specific star formation rate (sSFR), while it increases moderately
with the stellar mass. However, a comparison with local ""starburst"" galaxies
shows that the high-redshift main-sequence galaxies have stronger bump
features, despite having a higher sSFR than the local sample. Plotting the bump
strength against the $\Delta\log\mathrm{sSFR}\equiv \log \left(

brings the two samples into much better concordance. This may indicate that it

vertebrae, have played an important role in pressure buffering and tissue
protection. The fully-automatic localization and segmentation of IVDs have been
discussed in the literature for many years since they are crucial to spine
disease diagnosis and provide quantitative parameters in the treatment.
Traditionally hand-crafted features are derived based on image intensities and
shape priors to localize and segment IVDs. With the advance of deep learning,
various neural network models have gained great success in image analysis
including the recognition of intervertebral discs. Particularly, U-Net stands
out among other approaches due to its outstanding performance on biomedical
images with a relatively small set of training data. This paper proposes a
novel convolutional framework based on 3D U-Net to segment IVDs from
multi-modality MRI images. We first localize the centers of intervertebral
discs in each spine sample and then train the network based on the cropped
small volumes centered at the localized intervertebral discs. A detailed
comprehensive analysis of the results using various combinations of
multi-modalities is presented. Furthermore, experiments conducted on 2D and 3D

in terms of Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. Our method has proved to
be effective with a mean segmentation Dice coefficient of 89.0% and a standard

group field theory using the functional renormalization group method. We derive
the flow equation for the effective potential at any order restricting to a
subclass of tensorial interactions called cyclic melonic and projecting to a
constant field in group space. For a tensor field of rank $r$ on U$(1)$ we
explicitly calculate beta functions and find equivalence with those of O$(N)$
models but with an effective dimension flowing from $r-1$ to zero. In the $r-1$
dimensional regime, the equivalence to O$(N)$ models is modified by a tensor
specific flow of the anomalous dimension with the consequence that the
Wilson-Fisher type fixed point solution has two branches. However, due to the
flow to dimension zero, fixed points describing a transition between a broken

is of great importance to strike a balance between the detection accuracy and

detection of threshold crossings in a stochastic time series without the
knowledge of its statistics. To reduce the sampling cost in this detection
process, we propose the use of hierarchical generative adversarial networks
(GANs) to perform nonuniform sampling. In order to improve the detection
accuracy and reduce the delay in detection, we introduce a buffer zone in the
operation of the proposed GAN-based detector. In the experiments, we analyze
the performance of the proposed hierarchical GAN detector considering the
metrics of detection delay, miss rates, average cost of error, and sampling
ratio. We identify the tradeoffs in the performance as the buffer zone sizes
and the number of GAN levels in the hierarchy vary. We also compare the
performance with that of a sampling policy that approximately minimizes the sum
of average costs of sampling and error given the parameters of the stochastic
process. We demonstrate that the proposed GAN-based detector can have
significant performance improvements in terms of detection delay and average
cost of error with a larger buffer zone but at the cost of increased sampling
rates.

in order to develop applications in theoretical quantum chemistry.
  Based upon the momentum map geometric structure of QHD and the associated
Lie-Poisson and Euler-Poincar\'e equations, alternative geometric approaches to
the classical limit in QHD are presented. These include a new regularised
Lagrangian which allows for singular solutions called 'Bohmions' as well as a
'cold fluid' classical closure quantum mixed states.
  The momentum map approach to QHD is then applied to the nuclear dynamics in a
chemistry model known as exact factorization. The geometric treatment extends
existing approaches to include unitary electronic evolution in the frame of the
nuclear flow, with the resulting dynamics carrying both Euler-Poincar\'e and
Lie-Poisson structures. A new mixed quantum-classical model is then derived by
considering a generalised factorisation ansatz at the level of the molecular
density matrix.
  A new alternative geometric formulation of QHD is then constructed.
Introducing a $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ connection as the new fundamental variable
provides a new method for incorporating holonomy in QHD, which follows from its
constant non-zero curvature. The fluid flow is no longer irrotational and
carries a non-trivial circulation theorem, allowing for vortex filament
solutions.
  Finally, non-Abelian connections are then considered in quantum mechanics.
The dynamics of the spin vector in the Pauli equation allows for the
introduction of an $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ connection whilst a more general
$\mathfrak{u}(\mathscr{H})$ connection is introduced from the unitary evolution
of a quantum system. This is used to provide a new geometric picture for the
Berry connection and quantum geometric tensor, whilst relevant applications to
quantum chemistry are then considered.

hybridized functionalities is a holy grail of modern condensed matter physics

exhibit coupled degrees of freedom with a high degree of tunability which
sometimes lead to hybridized functionalities based on external stimuli.
However, the mechanisms of tunability and the sensitivity to external stimuli
are determined by intrinsic material properties which are not always
controllable. A Mott metal-insulator transition, which is technologically
attractive due to the large changes in resistance, can be tuned by doping,
strain, electric fields, and orbital occupancy but cannot be, in and of itself,
controlled externally with light. Here we present a new approach to produce
hybridized functionalities using a properly engineered
photoconductor/strongly-correlated hybrid heterostructure, showing control of
the Metal-to-Insulator transition (MIT) using optical means. This approach
combines a photoconductor, which does not exhibit an MIT, with a strongly
correlated oxide, which is not photoconducting. Due to the close proximity
between the two materials, the heterostructure exhibits large volatile and
nonvolatile, photoinduced resistivity changes and substantial photoinduced
shifts in the MIT transition temperatures. This approach can potentially be
extended to other judiciously chosen combinations of strongly correlated
materials with systems which exhibit optically, electrically or magnetically
controllable behavior.

we show that the above conjecture is almost true for the case $n\geq 4$, i.e.,

little is known about the manner in which scientific and technological

future breakthroughs. Network science has recently emerged as a framework for
measuring the structure and dynamics of knowledge. While helpful, existing
approaches struggle to capture the global properties of the underlying
networks, leading to conflicting observations about the nature of scientific

algebraic topology to characterize the higher-order structure of knowledge
networks in science and technology across scale. We observe rapid growth in the
higher-order structure of knowledge in many scientific and technological
fields. This growth is not observable using traditional network measures. We
further demonstrate that the emergence of higher-order structure coincides with
decline in lower-order structure, and has historically far outpaced the
corresponding emergence of higher-order structure in scientific and
technological collaboration networks. Up to a point, increases in higher-order
structure are associated with better outcomes, as measured by the novelty and
impact of papers and patents. However, the nature of science and technology
produced under higher-order regimes also appears to be qualitatively different
from that produced under lower-order ones, with the former exhibiting greater

processes, for example wind speeds, are the main cause of severe damage in
property, such as electrical networks, transport and agricultural
infrastructures. Therefore, availability of accurate data on such processes is
highly important in risk analysis, and in particular in producing probability
maps showing the spatial distribution of damage risks. Typically, as is the
case of wind speeds, data are available at few stations with many missing
observations and consequently simulated data are often used to augment
information, due to simulated environmental data being available at high
spatial and temporal resolutions. However, simulated data often mismatch
observed data, particularly at tails, therefore calibrating and bringing it in
line with observed data may offer practitioners more reliable and richer data
sources. Although the calibration methods that we describe in this manuscript
may equally apply to other environmental variables, we describe the methods
specifically with reference to wind data and its consequences. Since most
damages are caused by extreme winds, it is particularly important to calibrate
the right tail of simulated data based on observations. Response relationships
between the extremes of simulated and observed data are by nature highly
non-linear and non-Gaussian, therefore data fusion techniques available for
spatial data may not be adequate for this purpose. After giving a brief
description of standard calibration and data fusion methods to update simulated
data based on the observed data, we propose and describe in detail a specific
conditional quantile matching calibration method and show how our wind speed
data can be calibrated using this method.

of Si and Ge core-shell nanowires with hexagonal cores (made of GaP for Si

they are charged a cost that depends on the number of players simultaneously

re-weights the feature channels is exploited in the encoder to capture more
informative features and discard information in irrelevant regions.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-prediction guided attention mechanism which
provides pixel-wise semantic prediction guidance to better recover the
segmentation mask at each scale. This mechanism which transforms the deep
supervision to supervised attention is able to guide feature aggregation with
more semantic information between intermediate layers. Experiments on the

transfer across source and target tasks through cross-task representation
learning. The proposed method is demonstrated for extracting facial anatomical
landmarks which facilitate the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome. The source
and target tasks in this work are face recognition and landmark detection,
respectively. The main idea of the proposed method is to retain the feature
representations of the source model on the target task data, and to leverage
them as an additional source of supervisory signals for regularizing the target
model learning, thereby improving its performance under limited training
samples. Concretely, we present two approaches for the proposed representation

in specific applications, but these models can be difficult to fit in a
Bayesian setting due to posterior distributions that are challenging to sample
from efficiently. In this work, we introduce a general model for
heteroskedastic data. This approach models the conditional variance in a mixed
model approach as a function of any desired covariates or random effects. We
rely on new distribution theory in order to construct priors that yield fully
conjugate full conditional distributions. Thus, our approach can easily be fit
via Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we extend the model to a deep learning
approach that can provide highly accurate estimates for time dependent data. We
also provide an extension for heavy-tailed data. We illustrate our methodology
via three applications. The first application utilizes a high dimensional soil

assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field with its

Gaussian random fields which include rough fields and can be even rougher than
the white noise, and hence should be interpreted as distributions. The
well-posedness of the direct source scattering problem is established in the

presence of network failure while preserving the quality of service constraints
like delay and capacity. Fast Re-Route (FRR) mechanisms are widely used for
traffic re-routing purposes in failure scenarios. Control plane FRR typically
computes the backup forwarding rules to detour the traffic in the data plane
when the failure occurs. This mechanism could be computed in the data plane
with the emergence of programmable data planes. In this paper, we propose a
system (called TEL) that contains two FRR mechanisms, namely, TEL-C and TEL-D.
The first one computes backup forwarding rules in the control plane, satisfying
max-min fair allocation. The second mechanism provides FRR in the data plane.
Both algorithms require minimal memory on programmable data planes and are
well-suited with modern line rate match-action forwarding architectures (e.g.,
PISA). We implement both mechanisms on P4 programmable software switches (e.g.,
BMv2 and Tofino) and measure their performance on various topologies. The
obtained results from a datacenter topology show that our FRR mechanism can
improve the flow completion time up to 4.6x$-$7.3x (i.e., small flows) and
3.1x$-$12x (i.e., large flows) compared to recirculation-based mechanisms, such

from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in
the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a
novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.

[Method:] Meta-modelings are used to generate both hadronic and QM EOSs in the

framework. An explicitly isospin-dependent parametric EOS for the $npe\mu$
matter in NSs at $\beta$ equilibrium is connected through the Maxwell
construction to the QM EOS described by the constant speed of sound (CSS) model

$\De\ep/\ep_t=0.4^{+0.20}_{-0.15}$ at 68\% confidence level, respectively. The
corresponding probability distribution of QM fraction in a 1.4 M$_{\odot}$ NS
peaks around 0.9 in a 10 km sphere. Strongly correlated to the PDFs of $\rho_t$

at $0.95^{+0.05}_{-0.35}$, and the total probability of being less than 1/3 is
very small. (2) The correlations between PDFs of hadronic and QM EOS parameters

together with all known EOS constraints from theories and terrestrial nuclear
experiments prefer the formation of a large volume of QM even in canonical NSs.

earlier approaches to coupling classical wake superposition and atmospheric
boundary layer models in order to enable applicability to arbitrary wind-farm
layouts. Coupling wake and top-down boundary layer models is particularly
challenging since the latter requires averaging over planform areas associated
with certain turbine-specific regions of the flow. The ALC model uses Voronoi
tesselation to define a local area around each turbine. A top-down description
of a developing internal boundary layers is then applied over Voronoi cells
upstream of each turbine to estimate the local mean velocity profile. Coupling
between the velocity at hub-height based on this localized top-down model and a
wake model is achieved by enforcing a minimum least-square-error in mean
velocity in each cell. The ALC model is implemented using a wake model with a
profile that transitions from a top-hat to Gaussian function and accounts for
wake interactions through linear superposition. Detailed comparisons to
large-eddy simulation (LES) data demonstrate the efficacy of the model in
accurate predictions of both power and hub height velocity for complex wind
farm geometries. Further validation with LES for a hybrid array-random farm
that has half of the turbines arranged in an array and the other half randomly
distributed indicates the model's versatility with respect to capturing results
from different wind farm configurations. In both cases, the ALC model is shown
to produce improved power predictions for both the farm and individual turbines
over prevailing approaches for a range of wind inflow directions.

The adaptation can be informed by the model state, external information, or

mesh configuration {\it as part of the model state}. If observational data is
to be assimilated into the model, the question of updating the mesh
configuration with the physical values arises. Adaptive meshes present
significant challenges when using popular ensemble Data Assimilation (DA)
methods. We develop a novel strategy for ensemble-based DA for which the
adaptive mesh is updated along with the physical values. This involves
including the node locations as a part of the model state itself allowing them
to be updated automatically at the analysis step. This poses a number of
challenges which we resolve to produce an effective approach that promises to
apply with some generality. We evaluate our strategy with two testbed models in
1-d comparing to a strategy that does not update the mesh configuration. We
find updating the mesh improves the fidelity and convergence of the filter.

adopted by large population groups, with critical consequences. Here, we
analyse epidemic spreading and optimal vaccination strategies, measured with
the average years of life lost, in two network topologies (scale-free and
small-world) assuming full adherence to vaccine administration. We consider the
spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, using a similar diffusion model as
the one used in epidemics, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness

rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to
adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network
are more exposed and therefore are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years
of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on

noise, and hence the information on the noise variance is often required to
design algorithms. In this paper, we propose an estimation method for the
unknown noise variance in compressed sensing problems. The proposed method,
called asymptotic residual matching (ARM), estimates the noise variance from a
single measurement vector on the basis of the asymptotic result for the
$\ell_{1}$ optimization problem. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic
residual corresponding to the $\ell_{1}$ optimization and show that it depends
on the noise variance. The proposed ARM approach obtains the estimate by
comparing the asymptotic residual with the actual one, which can be obtained by
the empirical reconstruction without the information of the noise variance. For
the proposed ARM, we also propose a method to choose a reasonable parameter on
the basis of the asymptotic residual as well. The idea of the proposed ARM can
be applied not only to the reconstruction of the sparse vector but also to that
of other structured vectors such as the binary vector. Simulation results show
that the proposed noise variance estimation outperforms several conventional
methods, especially when the problem size is small. We also show that, by using
the proposed method, we can tune the regularization parameter of the $\ell_{1}$
optimization to achieve good reconstruction performance even when the noise
variance is unknown.

describe novel objects which are unseen in caption-labeled training data, a
capability that is evaluated in the novel object captioning challenge (nocaps).
In this challenge, no additional image-caption training data, other thanCOCO
Captions, is allowed for model training. Thus, conventional Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) methods cannot be applied. This paper presents VIsual
VOcabulary pretraining (VIVO) that performs pre-training in the absence of
caption annotations. By breaking the dependency of paired image-caption
training data in VLP, VIVO can leverage large amounts of paired image-tag data
to learn a visual vocabulary. This is done by pre-training a multi-layer
Transformer model that learns to align image-level tags with their
corresponding image region features. To address the unordered nature of image
tags, VIVO uses a Hungarian matching loss with masked tag prediction to conduct
pre-training. We validate the effectiveness of VIVO by fine-tuning the
pre-trained model for image captioning. In addition, we perform an analysis of
the visual-text alignment inferred by our model. The results show that our
model can not only generate fluent image captions that describe novel objects,
but also identify the locations of these objects. Our single model has achieved
new state-of-the-art results on nocaps and surpassed the human CIDEr score.

the body remains challenging for capsule endoscopy. Traditional
electromagnetic-based solutions are limited in their data rates and available
power. Recently, ultrasound was investigated as a communication channel for
through-tissue data transmission. To achieve real-time video streaming through
tissue, data rates of ultrasound need to exceed 1 Mbps. In a previous study, we
demonstrated ultrasound communications with data rates greater than 30 Mbps
with two focused ultrasound transducers using a large footprint laboratory
system through slabs of lossy tissues [1]. While the form factor of the
transmitter is also crucial for capsule endoscopy, it is obvious that a large,
focused transducer cannot fit within the size of a capsule. Several other
challenges for achieving high-speed ultrasonic communication through tissue
include strong reflections leading to multipath effects and attenuation. In
this work, we demonstrate ultrasonic video communications using a mm-scale
microcrystal transmitter with video streaming supplied by a camera connected to
a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The signals were transmitted through a
tissue-mimicking phantom and through the abdomen of a rabbit in vivo. The
ultrasound signal was recorded by an array probe connected to a Verasonics
Vantage system and decoded back to video. To improve the received signal
quality, we combined the signal from multiple channels of the array probe.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation was used to reduce
the receiver complexity under a strong multipath environment.

The density-based novelty detection method provides a statistical element to

strength of the field ingested by the biggest convection cells (giant cells) to

proposed convection-based heuristic model for making a sunspot-BMR $\Omega$
loop avoids having $\sim$ 10$^5$ G field in the initial flux rope at the bottom

the problem of allocating items among the bidders to maximize the auctioneers""
revenue, i.e., the winner determination problem (WDP), is NP-complete to solve

optimization techniques and most of them focus on the single-unit WDP, where
each item only has one unit. On the contrary, few works consider the multi-unit
WDP in which each item may have multiple units. Given that the multi-unit WDP

propose two different sample generation processes. We also develop two novel
graph-based post-processing algorithms to transform the outputs of the GNN into
feasible solutions. Through simulations on both synthetic instances and a
specific virtual machine (VM) allocation problem in a cloud computing platform,
we validate that our proposed method can approach optimal performance with low

a method for determining the difficulty of examples. In many tasks, however,
satisfying these requirements can be a formidable challenge. In this paper, we
contend that histopathology image classification is a compelling use case for
curriculum learning. Based on the nature of histopathology images, a range of
difficulty inherently exists among examples, and, since medical datasets are
often labeled by multiple annotators, annotator agreement can be used as a
natural proxy for the difficulty of a given example. Hence, we propose a simple
curriculum learning method that trains on progressively-harder images as
determined by annotator agreement. We evaluate our hypothesis on the
challenging and clinically-important task of colorectal polyp classification.
Whereas vanilla training achieves an AUC of 83.7% for this task, a model

  We present what we believe to be the first general-purpose approach to

system, Montage, to support that approach. Montage is built on top of the
Ralloc nonblocking persistent allocator. It employs a slow-ticking epoch clock,
and ensures that no operation appears to span an epoch boundary. It also
arranges to persist only that data minimally required to reconstruct the

epochs $e$ and $e-1$ is lost, but work from prior epochs is preserved.
  We describe the implementation of Montage, argue its correctness, and report
unprecedented throughput for persistent queues, sets/mappings, and general

using integral field spectroscopy data through the stellar Metallicity
Distribution Function (MDF). This is the probability distribution of observing
stellar populations having a metallicity $Z$. We apply this method to a set of
$550$ galaxies from the CALIFA survey. We present the behaviour of the MDF as a
function of the morphology, the stellar mass and the radial distance. We use
the stellar metallicity radial profiles retrieved as the first moment of the
MDF, as an internal test for our method. The gradients in these radial profiles
are consistent with the known trends: they are negative in massive early-type
galaxies and tend to positive values in less massive late-type ones. We find
that these radial profiles may not convey the complex chemical structure of
some galaxy types. Overall, low mass galaxies
($\log{M_\star/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}\leq10$) have broad MDFs
($\sigma_Z\sim1.0\,$dex), with unclear dependence on their morphology. However
this result is likely affected by under-represented bins in our sample. On the
other hand, massive galaxies ($\log{M_\star/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}\geq11$) have
systematically narrower MDFs ($\sigma_Z\leq0.2\,$dex). We find a clear trend
whereby the MDFs at $r_k/R_e>1.5$ have large variance. This result is
consistent with sparse SFHs in medium/low stellar density regions. We further
find there are multi-modal MDFs in the outskirts ($\sim18\,$per cent) and the
central regions ($\sim40\,$per cent) of galaxies. This behaviour is linked to a
fast chemical enrichment during early stages of the SFH, along with the
posterior formation of a metal-poor stellar population.

that the MAML framework does not directly offer the universal attack across
image sources, requiring us to integrate it with another meta-learning
framework of L2O. The resulting scheme for meta-learning a UAP generator (i)
has better performance (50% higher ASR) than baselines such as Projected

electronic medical records, such automated systems are expected to eventually
replace human coders. In this work, we investigate how a simple typo-based
adversarial attack strategy can impact the performance of state-of-the-art
models for the task of predicting the top 50 most frequent ICD-9 codes from
discharge summaries. Preliminary results indicate that a malicious adversary,
using gradient information, can craft specific perturbations, that appear as
regular human typos, for less than 3% of words in the discharge summary to
significantly affect the performance of the baseline model.

is to analyze the amount of aggressive drivers that are needed in order to
generate a traffic gridlock in a portion of a city with signalized

regardless if they have enough time or space to clear it. When their traffic
light changes they block other drivers, thus providing the conditions for a

modeling and personalized recommender systems. Existing approaches often derive
an individual set of model parameters for each task by training on separate
data. However, the representation of the same user potentially has some
commonalities, such as preference and personality, even in different tasks. As
such, these separately trained representations could be suboptimal in
performance as well as inefficient in terms of parameter sharing.
  In this paper, we delve on research to continually learn user representations
task by task, whereby new tasks are learned while using partial parameters from
old ones. A new problem arises since when new tasks are trained, previously
learned parameters are very likely to be modified, and as a result, an
artificial neural network (ANN)-based model may lose its capacity to serve for
well-trained previous tasks forever, this issue is termed catastrophic
forgetting. To address this issue, we present \emph{Conure} the first
\underline{con}tinual, or lifelong, \underline{u}ser \underline{re}presentation

Specifically, we propose iteratively removing less important weights of old
tasks in a deep user representation model, motivated by the fact that neural
network models are usually over-parameterized. In this way, we could learn many
tasks with a single model by reusing the important weights, and modifying the
less important weights to adapt to new tasks. We conduct extensive experiments
on two real-world datasets with nine tasks and show that \emph{Conure} largely
exceeds the standard model that does not purposely preserve such old
""knowledge"", and performs competitively or sometimes better than models which
are trained either individually for each task or simultaneously by merging all

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by allowing an agent to store and reuse
its past experiences in a replay buffer. While many techniques have been
proposed to enhance ER by biasing how experiences are sampled from the buffer,
thus far they have not considered strategies for refreshing experiences inside
the buffer. In this work, we introduce Lucid Dreaming for Experience Replay
(LiDER), a conceptually new framework that allows replay experiences to be
refreshed by leveraging the agent's current policy. LiDER consists of three
steps: First, LiDER moves an agent back to a past state. Second, from that
state, LiDER then lets the agent execute a sequence of actions by following its
current policy -- as if the agent were ""dreaming"" about the past and can try
out different behaviors to encounter new experiences in the dream. Third, LiDER
stores and reuses the new experience if it turned out better than what the
agent previously experienced, i.e., to refresh its memories. LiDER is designed
to be easily incorporated into off-policy, multi-worker RL algorithms that use
ER; we present in this work a case study of applying LiDER to an actor-critic
based algorithm. Results show LiDER consistently improves performance over the
baseline in six Atari 2600 games. Our open-source implementation of LiDER and

  Galactic Nuclei","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitational waves from neutron star mergers have long been considered a
promising way to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$, which describes the local
expansion rate of the Universe. While black hole mergers are more abundantly
observed, their expected lack of electromagnetic emission and poor
gravitational-wave localization makes them less suited for measuring $H_0$.
Black hole mergers within the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) could be an
exception. Accretion from the AGN disk may produce an electromagnetic signal,
pointing observers to the host galaxy. Alternatively, the low number density of
AGNs could help identify the host galaxy of $1-5\%$ of mergers. Here we show
that black hole mergers in AGN disks may be the most sensitive way to determine
$H_0$ with gravitational waves. If 1% of LIGO/Virgo's observations occur in AGN
disks with identified host galaxies, we could measure $H_0$ with 1% uncertainty
within five years, likely beyond the sensitivity of neutrons star mergers.

dust when measured inside the Solar System, while undoubtedly existing in the
local interstellar cloud (LIC), which surrounds the Solar System.
  Methods. We present a theoretical argument that organic compounds sublimate
almost instantaneously by exothermic reactions, when solar insolation triggers
the recombination of free radicals or the rearrangement of carbon bonds in the
compounds.
  Results. It turns out that the triggering temperature lies in the range of
20$-$50 K by considering that sublimation of organic materials takes place
beyond the so-called filtration region of interstellar neutral atoms. We find
that in-situ measurements of LIC dust in the Solar System result in an
overestimate for the gas-to-dust mass ratio of the LIC, unless the sublimation
of organic materials is taken into account. We also find that previous
measurements of interstellar pickup ions have determined the total elemental
abundances of gas and organic materials, instead of interstellar gas alone.
  Conclusions. We conclude that LIC organic matter suffers from sublimation en
route to the heliosphere, implying that our understanding of LIC dust from
space missions is incomplete. Since space missions inside the orbit of Saturn
cannot give any information on the organic substances of LIC dust, one must
await a future exploration mission to the inner edge of the Oort cloud for a
thorough understanding of organic substances in the LIC. Once our model for the
sublimation of interstellar organic matter by exothermic chemical reactions of
free radicals is confirmed, the hypothesis of panspermia from the diffuse

suggested that it may be necessary to prioritize observations of future events.
Optimal prioritization requires a rapid measurement of a gravitational-wave
event's masses and spins, as these can determine the nature of any
electromagnetic emission. We extend the relative binning method of Zackay et
al. (2018; arXiv:1806.08792) to a coherent detector-network statistic. We show
that the method can be seeded from the output of a matched-filter search and
used in a Bayesian parameter measurement framework to produce marginalized
posterior probability densities for the source's parameters within 20 minutes
of detection on 32 CPU cores. We demonstrate that this algorithm produces
unbiased estimates of the parameters with the same accuracy as running
parameter estimation using the standard gravitational-wave likelihood. We
encourage the adoption of this method in future LIGO-Virgo observing runs to
allow fast dissemination of the parameters of detected events so that the
observing community can make best use of its resources.

from the most recent portion of a data stream. The aggregations of interest can
usually be expressed as binary operators that are associative but not
necessarily commutative nor invertible. Non-invertible operators, however, are
difficult to support efficiently. In a 2017 conference paper, we introduced
DABA, the first algorithm for sliding-window aggregation with worst-case
constant time. Before DABA, if a window had size $n$, the best published
algorithms would require $O(\log n)$ aggregation steps per window
operation---and while for strictly in-order streams, this bound could be
improved to $O(1)$ aggregation steps on average, it was not known how to
achieve an $O(1)$ bound for the worst-case, which is critical for
latency-sensitive applications.
  This article is an extended version of our 2017 paper. Besides describing
DABA in more detail, this article introduces a new variant, DABA Lite, which
achieves the same time bounds in less memory. Whereas DABA requires space for

partial aggregates. Our experiments on synthetic and real data support the

avoid expensive recomputation, etc. This paper describes the APT (Automated
Program Transformations) tools to carry out isomorphic data type refinements in
the ACL2 theorem prover and gives examples of their use. Because of the
inherent symmetry of isomorphisms, these tools are also useful to verify
existing programs, by turning more concrete data representations into more
abstract ones to ease verification. Typically, a data type will have relatively
few interface functions that access the internals of the type. Once versions of
these interface functions have been derived that work on the isomorphic type,
higher-level functions can be derived simply by substituting the old functions
for the new ones. We have implemented the APT transformations isodata to
generate the former, and propagate-iso for generating the latter functions as
well as theorems about the generated functions from the theorems about the
original functions. Propagate-iso also handles cases where the type is a
component of a more complex one such as a list of the type or a record that has
a field of the type: the isomorphism on the component type is automatically
lifted to an isomorphism on the more complex type. As with all APT
transformations, isodata and propagate-iso generate proofs of the relationship

Migdal-Eliashberg theory in order to match numerically exact results from
determinantal quantum Monte Carlo in the adiabatic limit. In this work we
provide a method to obtain the real-axis solutions of the Migdal-Eliashberg
equations with electron and phonon self-energies calculated self-consistently.
Our method avoids the typical challenge of computing cumbersome singular
integrals on the real axis and is numerically stable and exhibits fast
convergence. Analyzing the resulting real-frequency spectra and self-energies
of the two-dimensional Holstein model, we find that self-consistently including
the lowest-order correction to the phonon self-energy significantly affects the

broadness of the spectral function, renormalization of the phonon dispersion,
enhanced effective electron-phonon coupling strength, minimal increase in the
electron effective mass, and the enhancement of superconductivity which
manifests as a superconducting ground state despite strong competition with
charge-density-wave order. We discuss surprising differences in two common

high-yield/low-price fisheries to low-yield/high-price fisheries. To calculate
stochastic trajectories for demographic noise, we derive the master equation
corresponding to the model and perform Monte-Carlo simulation. Moreover, the
analysis of probabilistic potential and mean first-passage time reveals the
resilience of alternative steady states. We also describe the efficacy of a few
generic indicators in forecasting sudden transitions. Furthermore, we show that
incorporating social norms on the model allows moderate fish density to
maintain despite higher harvesting rates. Overall, our study highlights the
occurrence of critical transitions in a stochastic social-ecological model and
suggests ways to mitigate them.

  This paper has been accepted by Science China Mathematics",,,,"math.DG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let $M_t$ be an isoparametric foliation on the unit sphere
$(S^{n-1}(1),g^{\mathrm{st}})$ with $d$ principal curvature values. Using the
spherical coordinates induced by $M_t$, we construct a Minkowski norm with the
presentation $F=r\sqrt{2f(t)}$, which generalizes the notions of
$(\alpha,\beta)$-norm and $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-norm. Using the technique of
spherical local frame, we give an exact and explicit answer for the question
when $F=r\sqrt{2f(t)}$ really defines a Minkowski norm. Using the similar
technique, we study the Hessian isometry $\Phi$ between two Minkowski norms
induced by $M_t$, which preserves the orientation and fixes the spherical
$\xi$-coordinates. There are two ways to describe this $\Phi$, either by a
system of ODEs, or by its restriction to any normal plane for $M_t$, which is
then reduced to a Hessian isometry between Minkowski norms on $\mathbb{R}^2$
satisfying certain symmetry and d-properties. When $d>2$, we prove this $\Phi$
can be obtained by gluing positive scalar multiplications and compositions
between the Legendre transformation and positive scalar multiplications, so it
must satisfy the (d)-property for any orthogonal decomposition
$\mathbb{R}^n=\mathbf{V}'+\mathbf{V}''$, i.e., for any nonzero $x=x'+x''$ and
$\Phi(x)=\overline{x}=\overline{x}'+\overline{x}''$, with
$x',\overline{x}'\in\mathbf{V}'$ and $x'',\overline{x}''\in\mathbf{V}''$, we
have $g_x^{F_1}(x'',x)=g_{\overline{x}}^{F_2}(\overline{x}'',\overline{x}) $.
As byproducts, we prove the following results. On the indicatrix $(S_F,g)$,
where $F$ is a Minkowski norm induced by $M_t$ and $g$ is the Hessian metric,
the foliation $N_t=S_F\cap \mathbb{R}_{>0}M_0$ is isoparametric. Laugwitz
Conjecture is valid for a Minkowski norm $F$ induced by $M_t$, i.e, if its
Hessian metric $g$ is flat on $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\{0\}$ with $n>2$, then
$F$ is Euclidean.

greater than the distance between the target spacecraft and the center of
gravity of the planet, the accuracy of linearization-based control design
approaches may decline substantially. In this paper, we use a nonlinear state
space model which corresponds to more accurate description of dynamics than
linearized models but at the same time poses the known challenges of nonlinear
control design. To overcome these challenges, we utilize a Koopman operator
based approach with which the nonlinear spacecraft rendezvous dynamics is
lifted into a higher dimensional space over which the nonlinear dynamics can be
approximated by a linear system which is more suitable for control design
purposes than the original nonlinear model. An Iteratively Recursive Least

responsible for attracting microbes to food, embryonic cells into developing
tissues, or immune cells to infection sites. Mathematically chemotaxis is
described by the Patlak--Keller--Segel model. This macroscopic system of
equations is derived from the microscopic model when limiting behaviour is
studied. However, on taking the limit and passing from the microscopic
equations to the macroscopic equations, fluctuations are neglected. Perturbing
the system by a Gaussian random field restitutes the inherent randomness of the
system. This gives us the motivation to study the classical
Patlak--Keller--Segel system perturbed by random processes.
  We study a stochastic version of the classical Patlak--Keller--Segel system
under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on an interval
$\mathcal{O}=[0,1]$. In particular, let $\mathcal{W}_1$, $\mathcal{W}_2$ be two
time-homogeneous spatial Wiener processes over a filtered probability space
$\mathfrak{A}$. Let $u$ and $v$ denote the cell density and concentration of
the chemical signal. We investigate the coupled system \begin{align*} & d {u} -

extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.

exponential moving strategy from AMSGrad to avoid errors accumulation during
the optimization. The experiments verify the corollary of theoretical
convergence analysis, and further demonstrate that our optimization method can
speed up the convergence about 1:2x and boost the performance of BNNs to a
significant level than the specific binary optimizer about 3:7%, even in a
highly non-convex optimization problem.

of using Laplacian in deriving regularization operators on graphs and its
consequent use with spectral GCNN filter designs. In this work, we explore the
regularization properties of graph Laplacian and proposed a generalized
framework for regularized filter designs in spectral GCNNs. We found that the
filters used in many state-of-the-art GCNNs can be derived as a special case of

well-defined regularization behavior and tested their performance on
semi-supervised node classification tasks. Their performance was found to be

convolutional neural networks to improve the computational efficiency and to
reduce the number of parameters, most existing methods construct their group
convolution architectures by a predefined partitioning of the filters of each
convolutional layer into multiple regular filter groups with an equal spatial
group size and data-independence, which prevents a full exploitation of their
potential. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method of designing
self-grouping convolutional neural networks, called SG-CNN, in which the
filters of each convolutional layer group themselves based on the similarity of
their importance vectors. Concretely, for each filter, we first evaluate the
importance value of their input channels to identify the importance vectors,
and then group these vectors by clustering. Using the resulting
\emph{data-dependent} centroids, we prune the less important connections, which
implicitly minimizes the accuracy loss of the pruning, thus yielding a set of
\emph{diverse} group convolution filters. Subsequently, we develop two
fine-tuning schemes, i.e. (1) both local and global fine-tuning and (2) global
only fine-tuning, which experimentally deliver comparable results, to recover
the recognition capacity of the pruned network. Comprehensive experiments
carried out on the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our
self-grouping convolution method adapts to various state-of-the-art CNN
architectures, such as ResNet and DenseNet, and delivers superior performance
in terms of compression ratio, speedup and recognition accuracy. We demonstrate
the ability of SG-CNN to generalise by transfer learning, including domain
adaption and object detection, showing competitive results. Our source code is

to reverse-engineer the parameters of tasks being performed by a team of robots
by simply observing their positions. We address this question by using the
concept of persistency of excitation from system identification. Each robot in
the team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task
satisfaction and collision avoidance. These controllers exhibit an implicit
dependence on the task's parameters which poses a hurdle for deriving necessary
conditions for parameter identification, since such conditions usually require
an explicit relation. We address this bottleneck by using duality theory and
SVD of active collision avoidance constraints and derive an explicit relation
between each robot's task parameters and its control inputs. This allows us to
derive the main necessary conditions for successful identification which agree
with our intuition. We demonstrate the importance of these conditions through
numerical simulations by using (a) an adaptive observer and (b) an unscented
Kalman filter for goal estimation in various geometric settings. These
simulations show that under circumstances where parameter inference is supposed
to be infeasible per our conditions, both these estimators fail and likewise
when it is feasible, both converge to the true parameters. Videos of these

including reliability estimation for new datasets and progress indication in
data cleaning. Another goal is to attribute to individual tuples a level of
responsibility to the overall inconsistency, and thereby prioritize tuples in
the explanation or inspection of dirt. Therefore, inconsistency quantification
and attribution have been a subject of much research in Knowledge
Representation and, more recently, in Databases. As in many other fields, a
conventional responsibility sharing mechanism is the Shapley value from
cooperative game theory. In this paper, we carry out a systematic investigation
of the complexity of the Shapley value in common inconsistency measures for
functional-dependency (FD) violations. For several measures we establish a full
classification of the FD sets into tractable and intractable classes with
respect to Shapley-value computation. We also study the complexity of
approximation in intractable cases.

violation of every constraint, where the penalty is the cost (weight) of the
constraint. A computational challenge is that of finding an optimal subset: a
collection of database tuples that minimizes the total penalty when each tuple
has a cost of being excluded. When the constraints are strict (i.e., have an
infinite cost), this subset is a ""cardinality repair"" of an inconsistent
database; in soft interpretations, this subset corresponds to a ""most probable
world"" of a probabilistic database, a ""most likely intention"" of a
probabilistic unclean database, and so on. Within the class of functional
dependencies, the complexity of finding a cardinality repair is thoroughly
understood. Yet, very little is known about the complexity of this problem in
the more general soft semantics. This paper makes a significant progress in
this direction. In addition to general insights about the hardness and
approximability of the problem, we present algorithms for two special cases: a
single functional dependency, and a bipartite matching. The latter is the
problem of finding an optimal ""almost matching"" of a bipartite graph where a
penalty is paid for every lost edge and every violation of monogamy.

have several origins, such as a super-Rayleigh slope in the atmosphere of HD

design SynSetExpan, a novel framework that enables two tasks to mutually
enhance each other. SynSetExpan uses a synonym discovery model to include
popular entities' infrequent synonyms into the set, which boosts the set
expansion recall. Meanwhile, the set expansion model, being able to determine
whether an entity belongs to a semantic class, can generate pseudo training
data to fine-tune the synonym discovery model towards better accuracy. To
facilitate the research on studying the interplays of these two tasks, we
create the first large-scale Synonym-Enhanced Set Expansion (SE2) dataset via

connection with the airplane over such a long-range link thus becomes a
challenge. Microwave frequencies allow for long link distances but lack the
data rate to serve up to several hundreds of potential onboard customers.
Higher bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum (30 GHz-300 GHz) have, therefore,
been utilized to overcome the bandwidth limitations. Still, the per-user
throughput with state-of-the-art millimeter-wave systems is an order of
magnitude lower than the one available with terrestrial wireless networks. In
this paper, we take a step further and study the channel characteristics for
the terahertz band (THz, 0.3 THz-10 THz) in order to map the feasibility of
this band for aviation. We first propose a detailed channel model for aerial
THz communications taking into account both the non-flat Earth geometry and the
main features of the frequency-selective THz channel. We then apply this model
to estimate the characteristics of aerial THz links in different conditions. We
finally determine the altitudes where the use of airplane-to-satellite THz
connection becomes preferable over the airplane-to-ground THz link. Our results
reveal that the capacity of the airborne THz link may reach up to 120 Gbit/s,

It can be addressed by building supervised models to tagging product images
with labels representing themes and later retrieving them by labels. This
approach suffices for common and perennial themes like ""white shirt"" or
""lifestyle image of TV"". It does not work for new themes such as
""e-cigarettes"", hard-to-define ones such as ""image with a promotional badge"",
or the ones with short relevance span such as ""Halloween costumes"". SIR is
ideal for such cases because it allows us to search by an example, not a
pre-defined theme. We describe the steps - embedding computation, encoding, and
indexing - that power the approximate nearest neighbor search back-end. We also
highlight two applications of SIR. The first one is related to the detection of
products with various types of potentially objectionable themes. This
application is run with a sense of urgency, hence the typical time frame to
train and bootstrap a model is not permitted. Also, these themes are often
short-lived based on current trends, hence spending resources to build a
lasting model is not justified. The second application is a variant item
detection system where SIR helps discover visual variants that are hard to find
through text search. We analyze the performance of SIR in the context of these
applications.

results in generating synthetic data. However, the issues with GANs are: (i)
the learning happens around the training samples and the model often ends up
remembering them, consequently, compromising the privacy of individual samples
- this becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to training data including
personally identifiable information, (ii) the randomness in generated data -
there is no control over the specificity of generated samples. To address these
issues, we propose imdpGAN - an information maximizing differentially private
Generative Adversarial Network. It is an end-to-end framework that
simultaneously achieves privacy protection and learns latent representations.
With experiments on MNIST dataset, we show that imdpGAN preserves the privacy
of the individual data point, and learns latent codes to control the
specificity of the generated samples. We perform binary classification on digit
pairs to show the utility versus privacy trade-off. The classification accuracy
decreases as we increase privacy levels in the framework. We also
experimentally show that the training process of imdpGAN is stable but
experience a 10-fold time increase as compared with other GAN frameworks.
Finally, we extend imdpGAN framework to CelebA dataset to show how the privacy
and learned representations can be used to control the specificity of the
output.

lensing by the halos hosting the target z=0.35 galaxies. The angular

characterise the physical properties of the system components. We measured the

find indications that the dust production may have concentrated around B and
that the mutual orbital period may have changed by 1-2 days during the 2016
perihelion passage. Orbit solutions have semi-major axes in the range of
(105-109) km, eccentricities between 0.41 and 0.51, and periods of
(117.3-117.5) days pre-perihelion and (118.5-119.5) days post-perihelion,
corresponding to system masses in the range of (6.67-7.23) $\times$ 10$^{12}$
kg. The mutual and heliocentric orbit planes are roughly aligned. Based on the
orbit alignment, we infer that spin-up of the precursor by the YORP effect led
to the formation of the binary system. We disfavour (but cannot exclude) a
scenario of very recent formation where activity was directly triggered by the
break-up, because our data support a scenario with a single active component.

a constant mass anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$, consistent with the assumed
proximity of an infrared fixed point. For the relatively large fermion masses
simulated by the LatKMI collaboration, the influence of the infrared fixed
point diminishes, and our fits suggest that $\gamma_m$ starts running. Since a
complete higher-order analysis is not feasible with presently available data,
we adopt a more phenomenological approach. We propose a partial extension to
higher orders, which incorporates the running of $\gamma_m$ into the tree-level
lagrangian. We find that this extension successfully describes the full
fermion-mass range of the LatKMI data, including the pion taste splittings
which arise from using staggered fermions in the lattice simulations. We also
investigate a more general class of dilaton potentials proposed in the
literature, using both the LSD and LatKMI data sets, concluding that these data
favor the form predicted by dChPT.

anomaly and novelty detection. But despite its effectiveness, SVDD does not
scale well with data size. To avoid prohibitive training times, sampling
methods select small subsets of the training data on which SVDD trains a
decision boundary hopefully equivalent to the one obtained on the full data
set. According to the literature, a good sample should therefore contain
so-called boundary observations that SVDD would select as support vectors on
the full data set. However, non-boundary observations also are essential to not
fragment contiguous inlier regions and avoid poor classification accuracy.
Other aspects, such as selecting a sufficiently representative sample, are
important as well. But existing sampling methods largely overlook them,
resulting in poor classification accuracy. In this article, we study how to
select a sample considering these points. Our approach is to frame SVDD
sampling as an optimization problem, where constraints guarantee that sampling
indeed approximates the original decision boundary. We then propose RAPID, an
efficient algorithm to solve this optimization problem. RAPID does not require
any tuning of parameters, is easy to implement and scales well to large data
sets. We evaluate our approach on real-world and synthetic data. Our evaluation
is the most comprehensive one for SVDD sampling so far. Our results show that
RAPID outperforms its competitors in classification accuracy, in sample size,

explores the trade-off between the two objectives and converges to a better

optimal policy. We experiment on real-world smart home data, and show that the
multi-objective approaches: i) establish trade-off between the two objectives,

a way that compromises anonymity. Our system exploits the simultaneous
similarity and small disparity between close-by video frames depicting a human

between the pixelated frames. Each frame, supported by its aligned surrounding
frames, is first encoded, then decoded to a higher resolution. Reconstruction
and perceptual losses promote adherence to the ground-truth, and an adversarial
loss assists in maintaining domain faithfulness. There is no need for explicit
temporal coherency loss as it is maintained implicitly by the alignment of

them with misinformation to create confusion and provoke unrest among the

society. They can sway political elections, push down the stock price or crush
reputations of corporations or public figures. Several websites have taken on
the mission of checking rumors and allegations, but are often not fast enough
to check the content of all the news being disseminated. Especially social
media websites have offered an easy platform for the fast propagation of
information. Towards limiting fake news from being propagated among social
media users, the task of this year's PAN 2020 challenge lays the focus on the
fake news spreaders. The aim of the task is to determine whether it is possible
to discriminate authors that have shared fake news in the past from those that
have never done it. In this notebook, we describe our profiling system for the
fake news detection task on Twitter. For this, we conduct different feature
extraction techniques and learning experiments from a multilingual perspective,
namely English and Spanish. Our final submitted systems use character n-grams
as features in combination with a linear SVM for English and Logistic
Regression for the Spanish language. Our submitted models achieve an overall
accuracy of 73% and 79% on the English and Spanish official test set,
respectively. Our experiments show that it is difficult to differentiate
solidly fake news spreaders on Twitter from users who share credible
information leaving room for further investigations. Our model ranked 3rd out

especially challenging under unobserved heterogeneity, as is well featured in

intrinsically local, the LATE is known to lack external validity in
counterfactual environments. This paper investigates the possibility of
extrapolating local treatment effects to different counterfactual settings when

part of its neighboring nodes, the number of which is progressively determined
according to a heuristic searching procedure, which takes into account both the
predicted convergence rate and the communication and computation costs at each
iteration, resulting in a trade-off between communication and computation. Then
the node chooses its neighboring nodes according to an importance sampling
distribution derived theoretically to minimize the variance with the latest
information it locally stores. Finally, the node updates its local information
with a new update rule which adapts to the number of communication nodes. We
prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and provide an upper bound of
the convergence variance brought by randomness. Extensive simulations validate
the excellent performances of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence
rate and variance, the overall communication and computation cost, the impact

way that it can be evaluated on any input, yet it cannot be ""pirated"" - a
notion that is impossible to achieve in a classical setting. Aaronson (CCC
2009) initiated the formal study of quantum copy-protection schemes, and
speculated that quantum cryptography could offer a solution to the problem
thanks to the quantum no-cloning theorem. In this work, we introduce a quantum
copy-protection scheme for a large class of evasive functions known as
""compute-and-compare programs"" - a more expressive generalization of point
functions. A compute-and-compare program $\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ is specified by a
function $f$ and a string $y$ within its range: on input $x$,
$\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ outputs $1$, if $f(x) = y$, and $0$ otherwise. We prove that
our scheme achieves non-trivial security against fully malicious adversaries in
the quantum random oracle model (QROM), which makes it the first
copy-protection scheme to enjoy any level of provable security in a standard
cryptographic model. As a complementary result, we show that the same scheme
fulfils a weaker notion of software protection, called ""secure software
leasing"", introduced very recently by Ananth and La Placa (eprint 2020), with a
standard security bound in the QROM, i.e. guaranteeing negligible adversarial
advantage. Finally, as a third contribution, we elucidate the relationship
between unclonable encryption and copy-protection for multi-bit output point
functions.

indicates coupling between localized manganese magnetic moments and exciton
spins via a magnetic proximity effect. The saturation polarization of 15% at 4

manganese doping enables efficient control of excitonic spin states in

debated, as they could have occurred either in the first Myrs of the Solar
System via short-lived radioactive heating, or later by impact induced heating
and or solar radiation. Since Rb is more volatile than Sr, and some heated CM
chondrites are highly depleted in Rb, a dating system based on the radioactive
decay of 87Rb to 87Sr could be used to date the heating event relating to the

a more general situation where $\widetilde H = \widetilde H_t$ is

sub-groups.This class of nilpotent Lie groups is a major example of stratified
Lie groups of step 2. The sub-Laplacian involved in these Schr\''odinger
equations is subelliptic, and, contrarily to what happens for the usual
elliptic Schr\''odinger equation for example on flat tori or on negatively
curved manifolds, there exists a minimal time of controllability. The main
tools used in the proofs are (operator-valued) semi-classical measures
constructed by use of representation theory and a notion of semi-classical wave
packets that we introduce here in the context of groups of Heisenberg type.

when the computation and communication resource of clients cannot be estimated;
the method trains a machine learning (ML) model using the rich data and
computational resources of mobile clients without collecting their data in
central systems. Conventional FL with client selection estimates the required
time for an FL round from a given clients' computation power and throughput and
determines a client set to reduce time consumption in FL rounds. However, it is
difficult to obtain accurate resource information for all clients before the FL
process is conducted because the available computation and communication
resources change easily based on background computation tasks, background
traffic, bottleneck links, etc. Consequently, the FL operator must select
clients through exploration and exploitation processes. This paper proposes a
multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based client selection method to solve the exploration
and exploitation trade-off and reduce the time consumption for FL in mobile
networks. The proposed method balances the selection of clients for which the
amount of resources is uncertain and those known to have a large amount of
resources. The simulation evaluation demonstrated that the proposed scheme
requires less learning time than the conventional method in the resource
fluctuating scenario.

For example, a highly inefficient model would provide less utility to

pixel-level annotated datasets. In this paper, we present the first
weakly-supervised approach to the SID problem. Although weak supervision has
been considered in general saliency detection, it is mainly based on using
class labels for object localization. However, it is non-trivial to use only
class labels to learn instance-aware saliency information, as salient instances
with high semantic affinities may not be easily separated by the labels. We
note that subitizing information provides an instant judgement on the number of
salient items, which naturally relates to detecting salient instances and may
help separate instances of the same class while grouping different parts of the
same instance. Inspired by this insight, we propose to use class and subitizing
labels as weak supervision for the SID problem. We propose a novel
weakly-supervised network with three branches: a Saliency Detection Branch
leveraging class consistency information to locate candidate objects; a
Boundary Detection Branch exploiting class discrepancy information to delineate
object boundaries; and a Centroid Detection Branch using subitizing information
to detect salient instance centroids. This complementary information is further
fused to produce salient instance maps. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate that the proposed method plays favorably against carefully designed
baseline methods adapted from related tasks.

question of how this innate directionality affects their evolution. To explore
this question, we analyze 16,200 structures from the protein data bank (PDB).
We find remarkable enrichment of $\alpha$-helices at the C terminus and
$\beta$-strands at the N terminus. Furthermore, this $\alpha$-$\beta$ asymmetry
correlates with sequence length and contact order, both determinants of folding
rate, hinting at possible links to co-translational folding (CTF). Hence, we
propose the 'slowest-first' scheme, whereby protein sequences evolved
structural asymmetry to accelerate CTF: the slowest of the
cooperatively-folding segments are positioned near the N terminus so they have
more time to fold during translation. A phenomenological model predicts that
CTF can be accelerated by asymmetry, up to double the rate, when folding time
is commensurate with translation time; analysis of the PDB reveals that
structural asymmetry is indeed maximal in this regime. This correspondence is
greater in prokaryotes, which generally require faster protein production.
Altogether, this indicates that accelerating CTF is a substantial evolutionary
force whose interplay with stability and functionality is encoded in sequence
asymmetry.

interactions which have a negative impact on the performance and lifetime of
wind farms. It has recently been found that substantial power gains can be
obtained by tilting the rotors of spanwise-periodic wind-turbine arrays. Rotor
tilt is associated to the generation of coherent streamwise vortices which
deflect wakes towards the ground and, by exploiting the vertical wind shear,
replace them with higher-momentum fluid (high-speed streaks). The objective of
this work is to evaluate power gains that can be obtained by tilting rotors in
spanwise-periodic wind-turbine arrays immersed in the atmospheric boundary
layer and, in particular, to analyze the influence of the rotor size on power
gains in the case where the turbines emerge from the atmospheric surface layer.
We show that, for the case of wind-aligned arrays, large power gains can be
obtained for positive tilt angles of the order of 30{\deg}. Power gains are
substantially enhanced by operating tilted-rotor turbines at thrust
coefficients higher than in the reference configuration. These power gains
initially increase with the rotor size reaching a maximum for rotor diameters
of the order of 3.6 boundary layer momentum thicknesses (for the considered
cases) and decrease for larger sizes. Maximum power gains are obtained for
wind-turbine spanwise spacings which are very similar to those of large-scale
and very large scale streaky motions which are naturally amplified in turbulent
boundary layers. These results are all congruent with the findings of previous
investigations of passive control of canonical boundary layers for
drag-reduction applications where high-speed streaks replaced wakes of
spanwise-periodic rows of wall-mounted roughness elements.

840nm). The laser point source is located in the middle of the layer of water
above the brain tissue and irradiates the brain tissue. The propagation of
light in brain tissue was simulated by solving the diffusion equation. And the
temperature changes of gray matter and blood vessels were achieved by solving
the biological heat transfer equation. The simulation results show that the
light energy in the brain tissue decreases exponentially with the increase of
penetration depth. Since the cerebral blood vessels have a stronger absorption
on light compared with the surrounding tissues, the remaining light energy of
the blood vessels in the cerebral cortex is ~ 85.8% of the remaining light
energy in the surrounding gray matter. In the process of biological heat
transfer, due to more light deposition in blood vessels, the temperature of
blood vessels is 0.15 K higher than that of gray matter, and the temperature of
gray matter hardly changes. This research is helpful to understand the
propagation of light in the brain and the interaction between them, and has

positioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology due to its high

visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However,
existing vehicular VLP algorithms impose restrictive requirements, e.g., use of
high-bandwidth circuits, road-side lights and certain VLC modulation
strategies, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, are not
feasible for general use. This paper proposes a VLC-based vehicle localization
method that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver
design and associated vehicular VLP algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is

performance is evaluated under realistic platooning and collision avoidance

and polarization optical modes described by SU(2N) transformations due to
perturbations are autocompensated after a single round trip between Alice and
Bob. Bob can use a source of single photons or, alternatively, coherent states
and then Alice attenuates them up to a single photon level, and thus
non-perturbated 1-qudit states are generated for high-dimensional QKD

tuned by chemical doping. Here we demonstrate that amino (NH$_2$) functional
groups attached at the edges of chiral GNRs (chGNRs) can efficiently gate the
chGNRs and lead to the valence band (VB) depopulation on a metallic surface.
The NH$_2$-doped chGNRs are grown by on-surface synthesis on Au(111) using
functionalized bianthracene precursors. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy
resolves that the NH$_2$ groups significantly up-shift the bands of chGNRs,
causing the Fermi level crossing of the VB onset of chGNRs. Through density
functional theory simulations we confirm that the hole-doping behavior is due
to an upward shift of the bands induced by the edge NH$_2$ groups.

leads to profound changes in the structure of the classical and quantum
Yang-Mills theory. We show that the Weyl group as a non-trivial color subgroup
of SU(3) admits singlet irreducible representations on a space of classical
dynamical solutions which lead to strict concepts of one particle quantum
states for gluons and quarks. The Yang-Mills theory is a non-linear theory and,
in general, it is not possible to construct a Hilbert space of classical
solutions and quantum states as a linear vector space, so, usually, a
perturbative approach is applied. We propose a non-perturbative approach based
on Weyl symmetric solutions to full non-linear equations of motion and
construct a full space of dynamical solutions representing an infinite but
countable solution space classified by a finite set of integer numbers. It has
been proved that the Weyl singlet structure of classical solutions provides the
existence of a stable non-degenerate vacuum which serves as a main precondition
of the color confinement phenomenon. Some physical implications in quantum
chromodynamics are considered.

and proximity for desired molecular properties of the generated molecules. For
evaluating the manifold traversal exploration, we produce the latent chemical
space using various generative models such as grammar variational autoencoders
(with and without attention) as they deal with the randomized generation and
validity of compounds. With this novel traversal method, we are able to find
more unseen compounds and more specific regions to mine in the latent space.
Finally, these components are brought together in a simple platform allowing
users to perform search, visualization and selection of novel generated

characterize the secondary processes, namely thermal metamorphism and aqueous
alteration, that have affected carbonaceous chondrites. X-ray absorption
near-edge structure spectroscopy at the Fe-K- edge was performed on a series of
36 CM, 9 CR, 10 CV, and 2 CI chondrites. Among the four carbonaceous chondrites
groups studied, a correlation between the iron oxidation index (IOI = [2
((Fe2+) + 3(Fe3+))/FeTOT) and the hydrogen content is observed. However, within
the CM group, for which a progressive alteration sequence has been defined, a
conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is observed with increasing degree of aqueous
alteration. This reduction of iron can be explained by an evolution in the
mineralogy of the secondary phases. In the case of the few CM chondrites that
experienced some thermal metamorphism, in addition to aqueous alteration, a
redox memory of the aqueous alteration is present: a significant fraction of 3+
2+ 0 Fe is present, together with Fe and sometimes Fe. From our data set, the
CR chondrites show a wider range of IOI from 1.5 to 2.5. In all considered CR
chondrites, the three oxidation states of iron coexist. Even in the
least-altered CR chondrites, the fraction of Fe3+ can be high (30% for MET
00426). This observation confirms that oxidized iron has been integrated during
formation of fine-grained amorphous material in the matrix. Last, the IOI of CV
chondrites does not reflect the reduced/oxidized classification based on metal
and magnetite proportions, but is strongly correlated with petrographic types.
The valence of iron in CV chondrites therefore appears to be most closely
related to thermal history, rather than aqueous alteration, even if these
processes can occur together .

practical applications. Examples include dynamic pricing and assortment, design
of auctions and incentives and permeate a large number of sequential treatment
experiments. In this paper, we extend one of the most popular learning
solutions, the $\epsilon_t$-greedy heuristics, to high-dimensional contexts
considering a conservative directive. We do this by allocating part of the time
the original rule uses to adopt completely new actions to a more focused search
in a restrictive set of promising actions. The resulting rule might be useful
for practical applications that still values surprises, although at a
decreasing rate, while also has restrictions on the adoption of unusual
actions. With high probability, we find reasonable bounds for the cumulative
regret of a conservative high-dimensional decaying $\epsilon_t$-greedy rule.
Also, we provide a lower bound for the cardinality of the set of viable actions
that implies in an improved regret bound for the conservative version when
compared to its non-conservative counterpart. Additionally, we show that
end-users have sufficient flexibility when establishing how much safety they

to create novel ones, modern neural networks struggle to do so. This has been
emphasized recently with the introduction of the benchmark dataset ""gSCAN""
(Ruis et al. 2020), aiming to evaluate models' performance at compositional
generalization in grounded language understanding. In this work, we challenge
the gSCAN benchmark by proposing a simple model that achieves surprisingly good
performance on two of the gSCAN test splits. Our model is based on the
observation that, to succeed on gSCAN tasks, the agent must (i) identify the
target object (think) before (ii) navigating to it successfully (act).
Concretely, we propose an attention-inspired modification of the baseline model
from (Ruis et al. 2020), together with an auxiliary loss, that takes into
account the sequential nature of steps (i) and (ii). While two compositional
tasks are trivially solved with our approach, we also find that the other tasks
remain unsolved, validating the relevance of gSCAN as a benchmark for
evaluating models' compositional abilities.

the process from one level to another which happens smoothly, but over such a
small interval, that its length $\delta\_n$ is considered to be decreasing to
$0$ as $n\to+\infty$. We show that if $\delta\_n$ goes to zero slower than
$1/n$, our model is locally asymptotically normal (with a rather unusual rate
$\sqrt{\delta\_n/n}$), and the maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators are
consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient. If, on the

$^{222}$Rn emanation measurements performed for the XENON1T dark matter
experiment. Together with the bulk impurity screening campaign, the results
enabled us to select the radio-purest construction materials, targeting a
$^{222}$Rn activity concentration of 10 $\mu$Bq/kg in 3.2 t of xenon. The
knowledge of the distribution of the $^{222}$Rn sources allowed us to
selectively eliminate critical components in the course of the experiment. The
predictions from the emanation measurements were compared to data of the
$^{222}$Rn activity concentration in XENON1T. The final $^{222}$Rn activity
concentration of (4.5 $\pm$ 0.1) $\mu$Bq/kg in the target of XENON1T is the
lowest ever achieved in a xenon dark matter experiment.

non-local block network (MCW-Net) to properly restore the original background
textures in rainy images. Unlike existing encoder-decoder-based image deraining
models that improve performance with additional branches, MCW-Net improves
performance by maximizing information utilization without additional branches
through the following two proposed methods. The first method is a multi-level
connection that repeatedly connects multi-level features of the encoder network
to the decoder network. Multi-level connection encourages the decoding process
to use the feature information of all levels. In multi-level connection,
channel-wise attention is considered to learn which level of features is
important in the decoding process of the current level. The second method is a
wide regional non-local block. As rain streaks primarily exhibit a vertical
distribution, we divide the grid of the image into horizontally-wide patches
and apply a non-local operation to each region to explore the rich rain-free
background information. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the results of the joint
deraining and segmentation experiment prove that our model contributes
effectively to other vision tasks.

the recently increased use of AI in society, it has become more important than
ever that AI systems would be able to explain the reasoning behind their
results also to end-users in situations such as being eliminated from a
recruitment process or having a bank loan application refused by an AI system.
Especially if the AI system has been trained using Machine Learning, it tends
to contain too many parameters for them to be analysed and understood, which
has caused them to be called `black-box' systems. Most Explainable AI (XAI)
methods are based on extracting an interpretable model that can be used for
producing explanations. However, the interpretable model does not necessarily
map accurately to the original black-box model. Furthermore, the
understandability of interpretable models for an end-user remains questionable.
The notions of Contextual Importance and Utility (CIU) presented in this paper
make it possible to produce human-like explanations of black-box outcomes
directly, without creating an interpretable model. Therefore, CIU explanations
map accurately to the black-box model itself. CIU is completely model-agnostic
and can be used with any black-box system. In addition to feature importance,
the utility concept that is well-known in Decision Theory provides a new
dimension to explanations compared to most existing XAI methods. Finally, CIU
can produce explanations at any level of abstraction and using different
vocabularies and other means of interaction, which makes it possible to adjust
explanations and interaction according to the context and to the target users.

that it achieves an approximation ratio of $k + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k})$ for
$k$-systems when allowed to run for $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k})$ iterations, an
improvement in both the runtime and approximation over previous analyses. We
demonstrate that both algorithms may be modified to run in nearly linear time

  Both SimultaneousGreedys and RepeatedGreedy are flexible enough to
incorporate the intersection of $m$ additional knapsack constraints, while

calculations and analytical insights show, however, that reducing the plasma
frequency below the visible spectrum by strong electronic correlations-a
recently proposed strategy-unavoidably comes at a price: an enhanced scattering
and thus a substantial optical absorption above the plasma edge. As a way out
of this dilemma we identify several perovskite transparent conductors, relying
on hole doping, somewhat larger bandwidths and separations to other bands.

Conventional approaches are customarily utilized on a per-dataset basis. This

exploiting the complex joint information available across multiple datasets.
Consequently, ignoring such joint information has a direct impact on the
performance of segmentation algorithms. This paper proposes to revisit the
conventional image normalization approach by instead learning a common
normalizing function across multiple datasets. Jointly normalizing multiple
datasets is shown to yield consistent normalized images as well as an improved
image segmentation. To do so, a fully automated adversarial and task-driven
normalization approach is employed as it facilitates the training of realistic

state-of-the-art. The adversarial training of our network aims at finding the
optimal transfer function to improve both the segmentation accuracy and the
generation of realistic images. We evaluated the performance of our normalizer
on both infant and adult brains images from the iSEG, MRBrainS and ABIDE

managers are required to determine methods to make the most of their limited
resources. A particular difficulty that arises because of the nature and size

shipbuilding companies have attempted to manage and track the locations and
movements of vehicles using Global Positioning System (GPS) modules. However,
because certain vehicles, such as forklifts, roam irregularly around a yard,
identifying their working status without being onsite is difficult. Location
information alone is not sufficient to determine whether a vehicle is working,
moving, waiting, or resting. This study proposes an approach based on machine
learning to identify the work status of each forklift. We use the DBSCAN and
k-means algorithms to identify the area in which a particular forklift is
operating and the type of work it is performing. We developed a business
intelligence system to collect information from forklifts equipped with GPS and

A tidal lung simulation is developed to assess this test and also a method is
proposed to calculate lung heterogeneity from IST results. A sensitivity
analysis based on the Morris method and linear regression were applied to
verify and to validate the simulation. Additionally, simulated emphysema and
pulmonary embolism conditions were created using the simulation to assess the
ability of the IST to identify these conditions. Experimental data from five
pigs (pre-injured vs injured) were used for validation. This paper contributes
to the development of the IST. Firstly, our sensitivity analysis reveals that
the IST is highly accurate with an underestimation of about 5% of the simulated
values. Sensitivity analysis suggested that both instability in tidal volume
and extreme expiratory flow coefficients during the test cause random errors in
the IST results. Secondly, the ratios of IST results obtained at two tracer gas
oscillation frequencies can identify lung heterogeneity (ELV60/ELV180 and
Qp60/Qp180). There was dissimilarity between simulated emphysema and pulmonary
embolism (p < 0:0001). In the animal model, the control group had ELV60/ELV180

its surrounding supernova remnant (SNR). Such a model could explain the
repeating, apparently non-Poissonian nature of FRB121102, which appears to
display quiescent and active phases. This bursting behaviour is better
explained with a Weibull distribution, which includes parametrisation for
clustering. We observed 10 SLSNe/LGRBs for 63 hours, looking for repeating FRBs
with the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope, but have not detected any bursts. We
scale the burst rate of FRB121102 to an FRB121102-like source inhabiting each
of our observed targets, and compare this rate to our upper burst rate limit on
a source by source basis. By adopting a fiducial beaming fraction of 0.6, we
obtain 99.99\% and 83.4\% probabilities that at least one, and at least half of
our observed sources are beamed towards us respectively. One of our SLSN
targets, PTF10hgi, is coincident with a persistent radio source, making it a
possible analogue to FRB121102. We performed further observations on this
source using the Effelsberg-100~m and Parkes-64~m radio telescopes. Assuming
that PTF10hgi contains an FRB121102-like source, the probabilities of not
detecting any bursts from a Weibull distribution during our observations are
14\% and 16\% for Effelsberg and Parkes respectively. We conclude by showing
that a survey of many short observations increases burst detection probability
for a source with Weibull distributed bursting activity.

clarifying the possible presence of a divergent topological susceptibility in
the continuum limit. We follow a twofold strategy, based on one side on direct
simulations for $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ on lattices with correlation lengths up to
$O(10^2)$, and on the other side on the small-$N$ extrapolation of results
obtained for $N$ up to $9$. Based on that, we provide conclusive evidence for a
finite topological susceptibility at $N = 3$, with a continuum estimate $\xi^2
\chi = 0.110(5)$. On the other hand, results obtained for $N = 2$ are still
inconclusive: they are consistent with a logarithmically divergent continuum
extrapolation, but do not yet exclude a finite continuum value, $\xi^2 \chi
\sim 0.4$, with the divergence taking place for $N$ slightly below 2 in this
case. Finally, results obtained for the non-quadratic part of
$\theta$-dependence, in particular for the so-called $b_2$ coefficient, are
consistent with a $\theta$-dependence matching that of the Dilute Instanton Gas

entanglement changes in an extended minisuperspace parameterised by the scale
factor and additionally, by the massless scalar field. We study the
entanglement quantities for the universes which classically exhibit Big-Bang
and other than Big-Bang (exotic) singularities such as Big-Brake, Big-Freeze,
Big-Separation, and Little-Rip. While taking into account the scalar field, we
find that the entanglement entropy is finite at the Big-Bang singularity and
diverges at maxima or minima of expansion. As for the exotic singularity models
we find that the entanglement entropy or the temperature in all the critical
points and singularities is either finite or infinite, but it never vanishes.
This shows that each of the universes of a pair is entangled to a degree
parametrized by the entanglement quantities which measure the quantumness of
the system. Apart from the von Neumann entanglement entropy, we also check the
behaviour of the the Tsallis and the Renyi entanglement entropies, and find
that they behave similarly as the meters of the quantumness. Finally, we find
that the best-fit relation between the entanglement entropy and the Hubble
parameter (which classically marks special points of the universe evolution) is
of the logarithmic shape, and not polynomial, as one could initially expect.

the paradigm of very highly magnetized neutron stars, also known as magnetars.
According to this paradigm, the persistent emission of anomalous X-ray pulsars
(AXPs) is powered by the decay of the magnetic field. However, an alternative
scenario in which the persistent emission is explained through accretion is
also discussed in literature. In particular AXP 4U 0142+61has been suggested to
be either an accreting neutron star or a white dwarf. Here we rule out this
scenario based on the the observed X-ray variability properties of the source.
We directly compare the observed power spectra of 4U 0142+61 and of two other
magnetars, 1RXS J170849.0$-$400910 and 1E 1841-045 with that of the X-ray

include a bright young radio pulsar PSR B1509-58 into comparison. We show that,
unlike accreting sources, no aperiodic variability within the expected
frequency range is observed in the power density spectrum of the magnetars and
the radio pulsar. Considering that strong variability is an established
features of all accreting systems from young stellar objects to super-massive
black holes, and absence of the variability reports from other magnetars, we
conclude that our results indicates also that magnetars in general are not
powered by accretion.

initial hydrogen abundance ($X_0=0.75)$ and too high metallicity ($Z\approx
0.004$) as for a Population II star. The fitting of the parameter $f$, whose

The circular motion
takes place for a fixed radius, while radii are continuously distributed along
the circle. Two scenarios of the anomalous transport, related to the reflecting
and periodic angular boundary conditions, are studied. The first scenario with
the reflection boundary conditions for the circular diffusion corresponds to
the conformal mapping of a 2D comb Fokker-Planck equation on the circular comb.
This topologically constraint motion is named umbrella comb model. In this
case, the reflecting boundary conditions are imposed on the circular (rotator)
motion, while the radial motion corresponds to geometric Brownian motion with
vanishing to zero boundary conditions on infinity. The radial diffusion is
described by the log-normal distribution, which corresponds to exponentially
fast motion with the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the order of $e^t$. The
second scenario corresponds to the circular diffusion with periodic boundary
conditions and the outward radial diffusion with vanishing to zero boundary
conditions at infinity. In this case the radial motion corresponds to normal
diffusion. The circular motion in both scenarios is a superposition of cosine
functions that results in the stationary Bernoulli polynomials for the
probability distributions.

disk. After correcting the effect of different optical path lengths, a spatial
distribution of HCN emissions is derived over Neptune's disk, and it clearly

indicates that the HCN volume mixing ratio measured at the equator was 1.92 ppb
above the 10$^{-3}$ bar pressure level, which is 40$\%$ higher than that
measured at the southern middle and high latitudes. The spatial distribution of
HCN can be interpreted as either the effect of the transportation of N$_{2}$

supply such as cometary collisions (or both of these reasons). From the
meridional circulation point of view, the observed HCN enhancement on both the
equator and the pole can be explained by the production and accumulation of HCN
at the downward branches of the previously suggested two-cell meridional

phase transition with chemical potential, mu. The first order behaviour follows
from allowing a discontinuity in the dual description as the quarks are
integrated out below their constituent mass. The model predicts a deconfined
yet massive quark phase at intermediate densities (350 MeV< mu <500 MeV), above
the nuclear density phase, which has a very stiff equation of state and a speed
of sound close to one. We also include a holographic description of a colour
superconducting condensate in the chirally restored vacuum and study the
resulting equation of state. They provides a well behaved first order
transition from the deconfined massive quark phase at very high density (mu>500
MeV). We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with the resulting
equations of state and find stable hybrid stars with quark cores. We compute
the tidal deformability for these hybrid stars and show they are consistent
with LIGO/Virgo data on a neutron star collision. Our holographic model shows
that quark matter could be present at the core of such compact stars.

also demonstrate that the initial integration of feature maps can become a

attention, which we refer to as iterative attentional feature fusion. With
fewer layers or parameters, our models outperform state-of-the-art networks on

$(\mathbb{F},<)$ that extend the field of real numbers $(\mathbb{R},<)$. The
definition of ${m_L}$ is inspired by the Loeb measures of hyperreal fields in
the framework of Robinson's analysis with infinitesimals. The real-valued
measure ${m_L}$ turns out to be general enough to obtain a canonical measurable
representative in $\mathbb{F}$ for every Lebesgue measurable subset of
$\mathbb{R}$, moreover, the measure of the two sets is equal. In addition,
$m_L$ it is more expressive than a class of non-Archimedean uniform measures.
We focus on the properties of the real-valued measure in the case where
$\mathbb{F}=\mathcal{R}$, the Levi-Civita field. In particular, we compare
${m_L}$ with the uniform non-Archimedean measure over $\mathcal{R}$ developed
by Shamseddine and Berz, and we prove that the first is infinitesimally close
to the second, whenever the latter is defined. We also define a real-valued
integral for functions on the Levi-Civita field, and we prove that every real
continuous function has an integrable representative in $\mathcal{R}$. Recall
that this result is false for the current non-Archimedean integration over
$\mathcal{R}$. The paper concludes with a discussion on the representation of
the Dirac distribution by pointwise functions on non-Archimedean domains.

geometry suggests that, at $S=1$, there is a second order phase transition to
an Anti de Sitter black hole. On the other hand, we obtain from the

analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), typically designed to minimize the mean
squared error (MSE) in reconstructing the CT input signal, can be costly and
energy-inefficient in such cases. In this work, we study task-based ADCs, which
are designed to obtain a digital representation of a multivariate CT input
process with the goal of recovering an underlying statistically related
parameter vector, referred to as \emph{the task}. The proposed system employs
analog filtering, uniform sampling, and scalar uniform quantization of the
input process before recovering the task vector using a linear digital recovery
filter. We optimize the analog and digital filters and derive closed-form
expressions for the achievable MSE in recovering the task vector from a set of
analog signals when utilizing ADCs with a fixed sampling rate and amplitude
resolution. Based on our derivation, we provide guidelines for designing
practical acquisition systems subject to a constraint on the bit rate. Our
analysis proves that the intuitive approaches of either recovering the task
vector solely in digital or designing the analog filter to estimate the task
vector are inferior to the proposed joint design. We then consider the recovery
of a set of matched filter outputs under a rate budget. We numerically verify

epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferrimagnetic tetragonal
Mn$_3$Ga electrodes, both as analyzer in an Fe/MgO stack, and also in an

Solving the ballistic transport problem (NEGF + DFT) for the nonequilibrium
spin density in a scattering region extended to over 7.6 nm into the Mn$_3$Ga
electrode, we find long-range spatial oscillations of the STT decaying on a
length scale of a few tens of angstroms, both in the linear response regime and
for finite bias. The oscillatory behavior of the STT in Mn$_3$Ga is robust
against variations in the stack geometry and the applied bias voltage, which
may affect the phase and the amplitude of the spatial oscillation, but the wave
number is only responsive to variations in the longitudinal lattice constant of
Mn$_3$Ga (for fixed in-plane geometry) without being commensurate with the
lattice. Our interpretation of the long-range STT oscillations is based on the
bulk electronic structure of Mn$_3$Ga, taking also into account the
spin-filtering properties of the MgO barrier. Comparison to a fully
Mn$_3$Ga-based stack shows similar STT oscillations, but a significant
enhancement of both the TMR effect at the Fermi level and the STT at the
interface, due to resonant tunneling for the mirror-symmetric junction with
thinner barrier (three monoatomic layers). From the calculated energy
dependence of the spin-polarized transmissions at 0 V, we anticipate asymmetric
or symmetric TMR as a function of the applied bias voltage for the Fe-based and
the all-Mn$_3$Ga stacks, respectively, which also both exhibit a sign change
below 1 V. In the latter (symmetric) case we expect a TMR peak at zero, which
is larger for the thinner barriers because of a spin-polarized resonant
tunneling contribution.

after the launch of OuAA campaign, the time spent at retail and recreational
businesses in a typical conservative county increased significantly more than
in liberal counties (15% increase in a typical conservative county Vs. 9%
increase in a typical liberal county). We also found that in conservative
counties with stay-at-home orders in place, time spent at retail and
recreational businesses increased less than that of conservative counties
without stay-at-home orders. These findings illuminate to what extent
residents' political ideology could determine to what extent they follow local

obedience between liberal and conservative counties. The silver lining in our

local authorities that enforced stay-at-home restrictions were to some extent
effective.

oriented perpendicular to magnetic fields, with a transition at visual
extinctions $A_V\gtrsim{}3~\rm{}mag$. Here we use far-infrared polarimetric

This transition appears to be caused by gas flow and indicates that magnetic

collapse and star cluster formation to occur even in the presence of relatively

parameter of the ratio between advection and molecular diffusion. Here, we
address the case that length and time scales on which the effective diffusion
can be described are not separated from those of advection and molecular
diffusion. For this, we propose a new method for characterizing the effective
diffusivity without relying on the scale separation. For a given spatial domain
inside which the effective diffusion can emerge, a time constant related to the
diffusion is identified by considering the spatio-temporal evolution of a test
advection-diffusion equation, where its initial condition is set at a pulse
function. Then, the value of effective diffusivity is identified by minimizing
the $L_\infty$ distance between solutions of the above test equation and the
diffusion one with mean drift. With this method, for time-independent gyre and
time-periodic shear flows, we numerically show the scale dependence of the
effective diffusivity and its discrepancy from the classical limits that were
derived on the assumption of the scale separation. The kinematic origins of the
discrepancy are revealed as the development of the molecular diffusion across
flow cells of the gyre and as the suppression of the drift motion due to a
temporal oscillation in the shear.

if the measure theoretic dual holds, i.e., if the graph of all but Haar null
many (in the sense of Christensen) elements of $\text{Homeo}([0,1])$ have
length $2$. We answer this question in the affirmative.
  We call $f \in \text{Homeo}([0,1]^d)$ singular if it takes a suitable set of
full measure to a nullset, and strongly singular if it is almost everywhere
differentiable with singular derivative matrix. Since the graph of $f \in
\text{Homeo}([0,1])$ has length $2$ iff $f$ is singular iff $f$ is strongly
singular, the following results are the higher dimensional analogues of
Banach's observation and our solution to Mycielski's problem.
  We show that for $d \ge 2$ the graph of the generic element of
$\text{Homeo}([0,1]^d)$ has infinite $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure,
contrasting the above result of Banach. The measure theoretic dual remains
open, but we show that the set of elements of $\text{Homeo}([0,1]^d)$ with
infinite $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure is not Haar null. We show that for
$d \ge 2$ the generic element of $\text{Homeo}([0,1]^d)$ is singular but not
strongly singular. We also show that for $d \ge 2$ almost every element of

form a so called Haar ambivalent set (neither Haar null, nor co-Haar null).

possible definitions of singularity for maps of several variables, and explore
the connections between them.

regularities inherent to video motion, which we capture by using displaced
frame differences as video representations to train the neural network. In
addition, we propose a new space-time reconstruction network based on both an
LSTM model and a UNet model, which we call LSTM-UNet. The new video compression
framework has three components: a Displacement Calculation Unit (DCU), a
Displacement Compression Network (DCN), and a Frame Reconstruction Network
(FRN). The DCU removes the need for motion estimation found in hybrid codecs
and is less expensive. In the DCN, an RNN-based network is utilized to compress
displaced frame differences as well as retain temporal information between
frames. The LSTM-UNet is used in the FRN to learn space-time differential
representations of videos. Our experimental results show that our compression
model, which we call the MOtionless VIdeo Codec (MOVI-Codec), learns how to
efficiently compress videos without computing motion. Our experiments show that
MOVI-Codec outperforms the Low-Delay P veryfast setting of the video coding
standard H.264 and exceeds the performance of the modern global standard HEVC
codec, using the same setting, as measured by MS-SSIM, especially on higher

Inverse classification is a post modeling process to find changes in input
features of samples to alter the initially predicted class. It is useful in
many business applications to determine how to adjust a sample input data such
that the classifier predicts it to be in a desired class. In real world
applications, a budget on perturbations of samples corresponding to customers
or patients is usually considered, and in this setting, the number of
successfully perturbed samples is key to increase benefits. In this study, we
propose a new framework to solve inverse classification that maximizes the
number of perturbed samples subject to a per-feature-budget limits and
favorable classification classes of the perturbed samples. We design algorithms
to solve this optimization problem based on gradient methods, stochastic
processes, Lagrangian relaxations, and the Gumbel trick. In experiments, we
find that our algorithms based on stochastic processes exhibit an excellent

charger scheduling problems, optimizing the trajectory of mobile chargers to
prolong the life of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network (WRSN), a system
consisting of sensors with rechargeable batteries and mobile chargers. Existing
solutions to charger scheduling problems require problem-specific design and a
trade-off between the solution quality and computing time. Instead, we observe
that instances of the same type of charger scheduling problem are solved
repeatedly with similar combinatorial structure but different data. We consider
searching an optimal charger scheduling as a trial and error process, and the
objective function of a charging optimization problem as reward, a scalar
feedback signal for each search. We propose a deep reinforcement learning-based
charger scheduling optimization framework. The biggest advantage of the
framework is that a diverse range of domain-specific charger scheduling
strategy can be learned automatically from previous experiences. A framework
also simplifies the complexity of algorithm design for individual charger
scheduling optimization problem. We pick three representative charger
scheduling optimization problems, design algorithms based on the proposed deep
reinforcement learning framework, implement them, and compare them with
existing ones. Extensive simulation results show that our algorithms based on
the proposed framework outperform all existing ones.

that govern the jumps to/from different parts of the domain. We assume that the
spacial domain is divided into a sequence of two subdomains $A_n \cup B_n$ and
we have three different smooth kernels, one that controls the jumps from $A_n$
to $A_n$, a second one that controls the jumps from $B_n$ to $B_n$ and the
third one that governs the interactions between $A_n$ and $B_n$.Assuming that
$\chi_{A_n} (x) \to X(x)$ weakly in $L^\infty$ (and then $\chi_{B_n} (x) \to
1-X(x)$ weakly in $L^\infty$) as $n \to \infty$ and that the initial condition
is given by a density $u_0$ in $L^2$ we show that there is an homogenized limit
system in which the three kernels and the limit function $X$ appear. When the
initial condition is a delta at one point, $\delta_{\bar{x}}$ (this corresponds
to the process that starts at $\bar{x}$) we show that there is convergence
along subsequences such that $\bar{x} \in A_{n_j}$ or $\bar{x} \in B_{n_j}$ for
every $n_j$ large enough.
  We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of this evolution equation in
terms of a stochastic process that describes the movement of a particle that
jumps in $\Omega$ according to the three different kernels and show that the
underlying process converges in distribution to a limit process associated with
the limit equation.
  We focus our analysis in Neumann type boundary conditions and briefly
describe at the end how to deal with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

difference image followed by human inspection of the detected candidates.
Replacing the human inspection component with an entirely autonomous method

  Reasoning","39 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) is a longstanding and open topic in the
theory and practice-of-law. Predicting the nature and outcomes of judicial
matters is abundantly warranted, keenly sought, and vigorously pursued by those
within the legal industry and also by society as a whole. The tenuous act of
generating judicially laden predictions has been limited in utility and
exactitude, requiring further advancement. Various methods and techniques to
predict legal cases and judicial actions have emerged over time, especially
arising via the advent of computer-based modeling. There has been a wide range
of approaches attempted, including simple calculative methods to highly
sophisticated and complex statistical models. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
based approaches have also been increasingly utilized. In this paper, a review
of the literature encompassing Legal Judgment Prediction is undertaken, along
with innovatively proposing that the advent of AI Legal Reasoning (AILR) will
have a pronounced impact on how LJP is performed and its predictive accuracy.
Legal Judgment Prediction is particularly examined using the Levels of Autonomy
(LoA) of AI Legal Reasoning, plus, other considerations are explored including
LJP probabilistic tendencies, biases handling, actor predictors, transparency,
judicial reliance, legal case outcomes, and other crucial elements entailing
the overarching legal judicial milieu.

Every Olympics since 1960 has run over budget, at an average of 172 percent in
real terms, the highest overrun on record for any type of megaproject. The
paper tests theoretical statistical distributions against empirical data for
the costs of the Games, in order to explain the cost risks faced by host cities
and nations. It is documented, for the first time, that cost and cost overrun
for the Games follow a power-law distribution. Olympic costs are subject to
infinite mean and variance, with dire consequences for predictability and
planning. We name this phenomenon ""regression to the tail"": it is only a matter
of time until a new extreme event occurs, with an overrun larger than the
largest so far, and thus more disruptive and less plannable. The generative
mechanism for the Olympic power law is identified as strong convexity prompted
by six causal drivers: irreversibility, fixed deadlines, the Blank Check
Syndrome, tight coupling, long planning horizons, and an Eternal Beginner
Syndrome. The power law explains why the Games are so difficult to plan and
manage successfully, and why cities and nations should think twice before
bidding to host. Based on the power law, two heuristics are identified for
better decision making on hosting. Finally, the paper develops measures for
good practice in planning and managing the Games, including how to mitigate the

part due to the nontrivial QCD vacuum field and the nonzero gluon condensate,

infinite and thereby cannot exist as a free state. This is precisely what the

Forensic applications include detecting gender obfuscation, e.g. males posing

opens up an operational perspective on the swift detection of gender.

800,000 children under five every year, all over the world. This pathology is
mainly caused by viruses or bacteria. X-rays imaging analysis is one of the
most used methods for pneumonia diagnosis. These clinical images can be
analyzed using machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks
(CNN), which learn to extract critical features for the classification.
However, the usability of these systems is limited in medicine due to the lack
of interpretability, because of these models cannot be used to generate an
understandable explanation (from a human-based perspective), about how they
have reached those results. Another problem that difficults the impact of this
technology is the limited amount of labeled data in many medicine domains. The
main contributions of this work are two fold: the first one is the design of a
new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique based on combining the
individual heatmaps obtained from each model in the ensemble. This allows to
overcome the explainability and interpretability problems of the CNN ""black
boxes"", highlighting those areas of the image which are more relevant to
generate the classification. The second one is the development of new ensemble
deep learning models to classify chest X-rays that allow highly competitive
results using small datasets for training. We tested our ensemble model using a
small dataset of pediatric X-rays (950 samples) with low quality and anatomical
variability (which represents one of the biggest challenges). We also tested
other strategies such as single CNNs trained from scratch and transfer learning
using CheXNet. Our results show that our ensemble model outperforms these

to satisfy PDE, BCs and initial condition. An adaptive normalizing scheme is
developed to reduce loss terms simultaneously. In addition, theory of heat

Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural

Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is
appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI
datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality -- such as
whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a
linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function -- such
as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping
neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized
nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a
gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of
analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration
rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies
on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks -- including visual stimuli,
decision making, flavor, and working memory -- confirm that the proposed method
achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.

ML is used more and more for research, experimentation and production

But ML Engineering, as a discipline, has not widely matured as much as its
Software Engineering ancestor. Can we take what we have learned and help the
nascent field of applied ML evolve into ML Engineering the way Programming
evolved into Software Engineering [1]? In this article we will give a whirlwind
tour of Sibyl [2] and TensorFlow Extended (TFX) [3], two successive end-to-end

decade of applied ML built on these platforms, explain both their similarities

argue that in order to unlock the gains ML can bring, organizations should
advance the maturity of their ML teams by investing in robust ML infrastructure

generalization of the traditional Periodic Unit Cell based approach -- serves
as a reduced geometrical model for materials with stochastic heterogeneous
microstructure, enabling an efficient synthesis of microstructural
realizations. To facilitate macroscopic analyses with a fully resolved
microstructure generated with Wang tiles, we develop a reduced order modelling
scheme utilizing pre-computed characteristic features of the tiles. In the
offline phase, inspired by the computational homogenization, we extract
continuous fluctuation fields from the compressed microstructural
representation as responses to generalized loading represented by the first-
and second-order macroscopic gradients. In the online phase, using the ansatz
of the Generalized Finite Element Method, we combine these fields with a coarse
finite element discretization to create microstructure-informed reduced modes
specific for a given macroscopic problem. Considering a two-dimensional scalar
elliptic problem, we demonstrate that our scheme delivers less than a 3% error
in both the relative $L_2$ and energy norms with only 0.01% of the unknowns
when compared to the fully resolved problem. Accuracy can be further improved
by locally refining the macroscopic discretization and/or employing more
pre-computed fluctuation fields. Finally, unlike the standard snapshot-based
reduced-order approaches, our scheme handles significant changes in the
macroscopic geometry or loading without the need for recalculating the offline
phase, because the fluctuation fields are extracted without any prior knowledge
on the macroscopic problem.

the inability of the sensors to provide soil moisture information in instances

the cylindrical coordinates version of the Richards equation (field model)
which naturally models fields equipped with a center pivot irrigation system.
Secondly, measurements obtained from the microwave sensors are assimilated into
the field model using the extended Kalman filter to form an information fusion

fusion system is first investigated with simulated microwave sensor

computational molecular biology due to its potential applications to drug
design. One of the major approaches in such a study is inverse quantitative
structure activity/property relationships (inverse QSAR/QSPR) analysis, which
is to infer chemical structures from given chemical activities/properties.
Recently, a novel framework has been proposed for inverse QSAR/QSPR using both
artificial neural networks (ANN) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP).
This method consists of a prediction phase and an inverse prediction phase. In
the first phase, a feature vector $f(G)$ of a chemical graph $G$ is introduced
and a prediction function $\psi_{\mathcal{N}}$ on a chemical property $\pi$ is
constructed with an ANN $\mathcal{N}$. In the second phase, given a target
value $y^*$ of the chemical property $\pi$, a feature vector $x^*$ is inferred
by solving an MILP formulated from the trained ANN $\mathcal{N}$ so that
$\psi_{\mathcal{N}}(x^*)$ is equal to $y^*$ and then a set of chemical
structures $G^*$ such that $f(G^*)= x^*$ is enumerated by a graph enumeration
algorithm. The framework has been applied to chemical compounds with a rather
abstract topological structure such as acyclic or monocyclic graphs and graphs
with a specified polymer topology with cycle index up to 2.
  In this paper, we propose a new flexible modeling method to the framework so
that we can specify a topological substructure of graphs and a partial
assignment of chemical elements and bond-multiplicity to a target graph.

velocity vector of the two-dimensional slope deposit, the angle of the slip
