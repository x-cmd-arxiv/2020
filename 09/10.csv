  Optimization: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality",,,,,"cs.LG math.PR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) aims to find robust
and generalizable solutions by hedging against data perturbations in
Wasserstein distance. Despite its recent empirical success in operations
research and machine learning, existing performance guarantees for generic loss
functions are either overly conservative due to the curse of dimensionality, or
plausible only in large sample asymptotics. In this paper, we develop a
non-asymptotic framework for analyzing the out-of-sample performance for
Wasserstein robust learning and the generalization bound for its related
Lipschitz and gradient regularization problems. To the best of our knowledge,
this gives the first finite-sample guarantee for generic Wasserstein DRO
problems without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Our results
highlight that Wasserstein DRO, with a properly chosen radius, balances between
the empirical mean of the loss and the variation of the loss, measured by the
Lipschitz norm or the gradient norm of the loss. Our analysis is based on two
novel methodological developments that are of independent interest: 1) a new
concentration inequality controlling the decay rate of large deviation
probabilities by the variation of the loss and, 2) a localized Rademacher
complexity theory based on the variation of the loss.

  based on a Novel Non-Comparative Fairness Notion","10 pages, Accepted to FAccTRec-2020",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decision-support systems are information systems that offer support to
people's decisions in various applications such as judiciary, real-estate and
banking sectors. Lately, these support systems have been found to be
discriminatory in the context of many practical deployments. In an attempt to
evaluate and mitigate these biases, algorithmic fairness literature has been
nurtured using notions of comparative justice, which relies primarily on
comparing two/more individuals or groups within the society that is supported
by such systems. However, such a fairness notion is not very useful in the
identification of fair auditors who are hired to evaluate latent biases within
decision-support systems. As a solution, we introduce a paradigm shift in
algorithmic fairness via proposing a new fairness notion based on the principle
of non-comparative justice. Assuming that the auditor makes fairness
evaluations based on some (potentially unknown) desired properties of the
decision-support system, the proposed fairness notion compares the system's
outcome with that of the auditor's desired outcome. We show that the proposed
fairness notion also provides guarantees in terms of comparative fairness
notions by proving that any system can be deemed fair from the perspective of
comparative fairness (e.g. individual fairness and statistical parity) if it is
non-comparatively fair with respect to an auditor who has been deemed fair with
respect to the same fairness notions. We also show that the converse holds true
in the context of individual fairness. A brief discussion is also presented
regarding how our fairness notion can be used to identify fair and reliable
auditors, and how we can use them to quantify biases in decision-support
systems.

voxel-based segmentation of lesions or white-matter fiber tracts. A drawback of
representing tracts as volumetric labels, rather than sets of streamlines, is
that it precludes point-wise analyses of microstructural or geometric features
along a tract. Traditional tractography pipelines, which do allow such
analyses, can benefit from detailed whole-brain segmentations to guide tract
reconstruction. Here, we introduce fast, deep learning-based segmentation of
170 anatomical regions directly on diffusion-weighted MR images, removing the
dependency of conventional segmentation methods on T 1-weighted images and slow
pre-processing pipelines. Working natively in diffusion space avoids non-linear
distortions and registration errors across modalities, as well as interpolation
artifacts. We demonstrate consistent segmentation results between 0 .70 and 0
.87 Dice depending on the tissue type. We investigate various combinations of
diffusion-derived inputs and show generalization across different numbers of
gradient directions. Finally, integrating our approach to provide anatomical
priors for tractography pipelines, such as TRACULA, removes hours of
pre-processing time and permits processing even in the absence of high-quality
T 1-weighted scans, without degrading the quality of the resulting tract
estimates.

to solve large-scale eigenvalue problems in which the desired the eigenvector
can be approximated by a sparse vector with at most $k$ nonzero elements, where
$k$ is relatively small compare to the dimension of the matrix to be partially
diagonalized. This type of problem arises in applications in which the desired
eigenvector exhibits localization properties and in large-scale eigenvalue
computations in which the amount of computational resource is limited. When the
positions of these nonzero elements can be determined, we can obtain the
$k$-sparse approximation to the original problem by computing eigenvalues of a
$k\times k$ submatrix extracted from $k$ rows and columns of the original
matrix. We review a previously developed greedy algorithm for incrementally
probing the positions of the nonzero elements in a $k$-sparse approximate
eigenvector and show that the greedy algorithm can be improved by using an RL
method to refine the selection of $k$ rows and columns of the original matrix.
We describe how to represent states, actions, rewards and policies in an RL
algorithm designed to solve the $k$-sparse eigenvalue problem and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the RL algorithm on two examples originating from quantum
many-body physics.

choose between using a shared network or separate networks to represent the

objectives, while using a shared network allows useful features to be shared.
PPG is able to achieve the best of both worlds by splitting optimization into
two phases, one that advances training and one that distills features. PPG also
enables the value function to be more aggressively optimized with a higher

According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions

warming (AGW) above pre-industrial levels. AGW is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C
between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. As the
climate change is driven by the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, there is a broad consensus that the mitigation
of climate change requires transition to low GHG emission energy sources,
technologies and practices. Implementing such changes systematically from
individual to community-wide scales together with the resulting cultural
changes and leadership towards environmental consciousness and responsibility
are crucial to mitigate the looming damage of AGW. Given planetary scientists'
wide recognition of the realities of climate change, and the need for us to
maintain credibility by leading by example, it is appropriate to make own
professional behavior more environmentally responsible. While scientists are
few in numbers, and planetary scientists far fewer, high volumes of academic
travel to conferences, panels, colloquia, and research collaboration visits
together with extensive use of large, energetically demanding infrastructures
make the ""carbon footprint"" of scientists much higher than that of an average

GW170817 revealed that gamma-ray burst afterglows from jets misaligned with our
line of sight exhibit a light curve with slowly rising flux. The slope of the
rising light curve depends sensitively on the angle of the observer with
respect to the jet axis, which is likely to be perpendicular to the merger
plane of the neutron star binary. Therefore, the afterglow emission can be used
to constrain the inclination of the merging system. Here, we calculate the
gamma-ray burst afterglow emission based on the realistic jet structure derived
from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a black hole
torus system for the central engine of the gamma-ray burst. Combined with
gravitational wave parameter estimation, we fit the multi-epoch afterglow
emission of GW170817. We show that with such a jet model, the observing angle
can be tightly constrained by multi messenger observations. The best fit
observing angle of GW170817 is $\theta_{\rm v} = 0.38\pm 0.02$ rad. With such a
constraint, we can break the degeneracy between inclination angle and
luminosity distance in gravitational wave parameter estimation, and
substantially increase the precision with which the Hubble constant is
constrained by the standard siren method. Our estimation of the distance is
$D_{\rm L}=43.4\pm 1\ \rm Mpc$ and the Hubble constant constraint is $69.5\pm
4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$. As a result, multimessenger observations of
short-duration gamma-ray bursts, combined with a good theoretical understanding

dynamical systems. It has been a well established fact in control theory that
stability properties can be characterized by Lyapunov functions. Reachability
properties can also be naturally captured by Lyapunov functions for finite-time
stability. Motivated by safety-critical control applications, such as in
autonomous systems and robotics, there has been a recent surge of interests in
characterizing safety properties using barrier functions. Lyapunov and barrier
functions conditions, however, are sometimes viewed as competing objectives. In
this paper, we provide a unified theoretical treatment of Lyapunov and barrier
functions in terms of converse theorems for stability properties with safety
guarantees and reach-avoid-stay type specifications. We show that if a system
(modeled as a dynamical system with measurable perturbations) possesses a
stability with safety property, then there exists a smooth Lyapunov function to
certify such a property. This Lyapunov function is shown to be defined on the
entire set of initial conditions from which solutions satisfy this property. A
similar but slightly weaker statement is made for reach-avoid-stay
specifications. We show by a simple example that the latter statement cannot be
strengthened without additional assumptions. We further extend the results for
systems with control inputs and prove existence of converse Lyapunov-barrier
functions for reach-and-avoid specifications. While the converse
Lyapunov-barrier theorems are not constructive, as with classical converse
Lyapunov theorems, we believe that the unified necessary and sufficient
conditions with a single Lyapunov-barrier function are of theoretical interest
and can hopefully shed some light on computational approaches.

TPU-v3 cores) to train, putting them out of reach for the larger research
community. On the other hand, GAN-based image super-resolution models, such as
ESRGAN, can not only upscale images to high dimensions, but also are efficient
to train. In this paper, we present not-so-big-GAN (nsb-GAN), a simple yet
cost-effective two-step training framework for deep generative models (DGMs) of
high-dimensional natural images. First, we generate images in low-frequency
bands by training a sampler in the wavelet domain. Then, we super-resolve these
images from the wavelet domain back to the pixel-space with our novel wavelet
super-resolution decoder network. Wavelet-based down-sampling method preserves
more structural information than pixel-based methods, leading to significantly
better generative quality of the low-resolution sampler (e.g., 64x64). Since
the sampler and decoder can be trained in parallel and operate on much lower
dimensional spaces than end-to-end models, the training cost is substantially
reduced. On ImageNet 512x512, our model achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) of 10.59 -- beating the baseline BigGAN model -- at half the compute (256
TPU-v3 cores).

strongly depends on the coagulation rate considered. We first discuss
well-posedness results for the Smoluchowski's equation for a large class of

uses Schauder fixed point theorem, and the nonexistence result relies on a flux

which leads to multi-component equations describing the distribution of
particle compositions. We obtain explicit solutions in the simplest case where
the coagulation kernel is constant by using a generating function. Using an
approximation of the solution we observe that the mass localizes along a

subspace isolation where one Gaussian modality is represented by one neuron, 3)

the growth of the anti-Stokes signal in the RW and hence suppress the reversed
CARS cycles that would otherwise result into heat generation in the RW. It is
shown that the frequency-selective quasi parity-time symmetry provided by the

parallelizable spaces and this allows us to study an extended T-duality, known

U-duality, an extended Drinfel'd algebra (ExDA), called the Exceptional
Drinfel'd algebra (EDA) was proposed and a natural extension of the usual
U-duality was studied both in the context of supergravity and membrane theory.
In this paper, we clarify the general structure of ExDAs and show that an ExDA
always gives a generalized parallelizable space, which may be regarded as a
group manifold with generalized Nambu-Lie structures. We also discuss
generalized Yang-Baxter deformations that are based on coboundary ExDAs. As
important examples, we consider the $E_{n(n)}$ EDA for $n\leq 8$ and study
various aspects, both in terms of M-theory and type IIB theory.

from the driven Liouville-von Neumann (DLvN) equation - an open system approach
to transport in non-interacting systems where relaxation maintains a bias. The
two site junction they examine has destructive interference, which they show
leads to slow convergence of the DLvN to the Landauer limit with respect to

the DLvN. Here, we demonstrate that applying the more general expression to

density of states and coupling to the system) and Markovian relaxation provides
a simple analytic form that applies to arbitrary, but identically connected,
junctions. Moreover, we briefly discuss the convergence of the current to the

begin conforming to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our approach sheds

a large range of equilibrium temperatures (600 $\lesssim T_{eq} \lesssim$
4000K) and surface gravities (2.5 $\lesssim \mathrm{log} g \lesssim$ 3.5). We
did not find a statistically significant FeH signal in any of the atmospheres,

that the highest volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-9}$ are

FeH absorption is expected. We performed injection and recovery tests for each

hydrodynamic materials; however, recently, a class of semimetals has been
reported to exhibit prominent interactions. Here we study the current flow in
the layered semimetal tungsten ditelluride by imaging the local magnetic field

profile within three-dimensional tungsten ditelluride and find that it exhibits
non-uniform current density, indicating hydrodynamic flow. Our
temperature-resolve current profile measurements reveal a non-monotonic
temperature dependence, with the strongest hydrodynamic effects at
approximately 20 K. We also report ab initio calculations showing that
electron-electron interactions are not explained by the Coulomb interaction
alone, but are predominantly mediated by phonons. This provides a promising
avenue in the search for hydrodynamic flow and prominent electron interactions

mass, the ""antesonic"" condition limits the regime of stable accretion to
$c_T^2/v_\mathrm{esc}^2\leq3/16$, where $c_T$ is the isothermal sound speed in
the subsonic post-shock flow, and $v_\mathrm{esc}$ is the escape velocity at
the shock radius. Above this limit, it is impossible to satisfy both the Euler
equation and theshock jump conditions, and the system transitions to a wind.
This physics explains the existence of a critical neutrino luminosity in
steady-state models ofaccretion in the context of core-collapse supernovae.
Here, we extend the antesonic condition to flows with rotation and turbulence
using a simple one-dimensional formalism. Both effects decrease the critical
post-shock sound speed required for explosion. While quite rapid rotation is
required for a significant change to the critical condition, we show that the
level of turbulence typically achieved in supernova simulations can greatly
impact the critical value of $c_T^2/v_\mathrm{esc}^2$. A core angular velocity
corresponding to a millisecond rotation period after contraction of the
proto-neutron star results in only a $\sim\!5$ per-cent reduction of the
critical curve. In contrast, near-sonic turbulence with specific turbulent
kinetic energy $K/c_T^2=0.5-1$, leads to a decrease in the critical value of
$c_T^2/v_{\rm esc}^2$ by $\sim\!20-40$ per-cent. This analysis provides a
framework for understanding the role of post-shock turbulence in instigating
explosions in models that would otherwise fail and helps explain why
multi-dimensional simulations explode more easily than their one-dimensional
counterparts.

with photometric galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and a
large-scale filament catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results
show that the properties of galaxies around GRGs are similar with that around
the two control samples, consisting of galaxies with optical colors and
luminosity matched to the properties of the GRG host galaxies. Additionally,
the properties of surrounding galaxies depend on neither their relative
positions to the radio jet/lobe structures nor the sizes of GRGs. We also find
that the locations of GRGs and the control samples with respect to the nearby

demonstrate that there is no correlation between the GRG properties and their

not the primary cause of the large sizes of the radio structures. Finally,
regarding radio feedback, we show that the fraction of blue satellites does not
correlate with the GRG properties, suggesting that the current epoch of radio

insurance claims, such as relating to an injury, it is important to know not

  We hypothesize that a legal deposition consists of various aspects that are
discussed as part of the deponent testimony. Accordingly, we developed an
ontology of aspects in a legal deposition for accident and injury cases. Using
that, we have developed a classifier that can identify portions of text for
each of the aspects of interest. Doing so was complicated by the peculiarities
of this genre, e.g., that deposition transcripts generally consist of data in
the form of question-answer (QA) pairs. Accordingly, our automated system
starts with pre-processing, and then transforms the QA pairs into a canonical
form made up of declarative sentences. Classifying the declarative sentences
that are generated, according to the aspect, can then help with downstream
tasks such as summarization, segmentation, question-answering, and information
retrieval.
  Our methods have achieved a classification F1 score of 0.83. Having the
aspects classified with a good accuracy will help in choosing QA pairs that can
be used as candidate summary sentences, and to generate an informative summary
for legal professionals or insurance claim agents. Our methodology could be
extended to legal depositions of other kinds, and to aid services like

more and more SM modes and operators are taken into account. We study two

fields: 1) the traditional elastic positivity approach, which exploits the
elastic scattering amplitudes of states with arbitrarily superposed helicities
as well as other quantum numbers, and 2) the newly proposed extremal positivity
approach, which constructs the allowed coefficient space directly by using the

the constraining power and the efficiency of various approaches, as well as
their applicability to more complex problems. While the new extremal approach
is more constraining by construction, we also find that it is analytically
easier to use, numerically much faster than the elastic approach, and much more
applicable when more SM particle states and operators are taken into account.

determine the CKM matrix element $|{V_{cb}}|$ and mass of the $b$-quark $m_b$

the $\Upsilon (4S)$ resonance in 2019 and 2020 (March-July), corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of $34.6\;\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, is used for this
measurement. The decay $\Upsilon (4S) \rightarrow B \overline{B}$ is
reconstructed by applying the hadronic tagging algorithm provided by the Full
Event Interpretation to fully reconstruct one $B$ meson. The second $B$ meson
is reconstructed inclusively by selecting a high-momentum lepton. The $X_c$
system is identified by the remaining reconstructed tracks and clusters in the
electromagnetic calorimeter. We report preliminary results for the hadronic
mass moments $\langle M_X^n \rangle $ with $n=1,\dots,6$, measured as a
function of a lower cut on the lepton momentum in the signal $B$ rest frame.

the Standard Model effective field theory with only light active Majorana
neutrinos, we determine the current limits on the corresponding LNV physics
scale from the past E949 experiment at BNL as well as the currently operating
experiments NA62 at CERN and KOTO at J-PARC. We focus on the specific signature
of scalar currents in $K\to\pi\nu\nu$ arising from the LNV nature of the

need for dedicated searches for beyond the SM currents. We find that the rare
kaon decays probe high operator scales $\Lambda_\text{LNV} \approx 15$ to $20$
TeV in different quark and neutrino flavours compared to neutrinoless double
beta decay. Furthermore, we comment that the observation of LNV in kaon decays
can put high-scale leptogenesis under tension. Finally, we discuss the
connection with small radiatively generated neutrino masses and show how the
severe constraints therefrom can be evaded in a minimal ultraviolet-complete
scenario featuring leptoquarks.

stars selected from the second Gaia data release catalogue in the direction of
the Galactic poles. The level of completeness of the sample at heights between
0.6 and 3.5 kpc is asserted by comparison with the 2 Micron All Sky Survey
catalogue. We show that both the density distribution and velocity dispersion
are significantly more perturbed in the North than in the South, in all
analysed regions of our Galactic neighbourhoods. We provide a detailed
assessment of these North-South asymmetries at large heights. We then proceed
to evaluate how such asymmetries could affect determinations of the dynamical
matter density under equilibrium assumptions. We find that a Jeans analysis
delivers relatively similar vertical forces and integrated dynamical surface
densities at large heights above the plane in both hemispheres. At these
heights, the densities of stars and gas are very low and the surface density is
largely dominated by dark matter, which allows to estimate, separately in the
North and South, the local dark matter density derived under equilibrium
assumptions. In the presence of vertical perturbations, such values should be
considered as an upper limit. This Jeans analysis yields values of the local
dark matter density above 2~kpc, $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.013 \, {\rm
M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ ($ \sim 0.509 \, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the perturbed
Northern hemisphere, and $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.010 \, {\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$
($ \sim 0.374 \, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the much less perturbed South. As a
comparison, we determine the local dark matter density by fitting a global
phase-space distribution to the data. We end up with a value in the range of
$\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.011 - 0.014 \, {\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ in global
agreement with Jeans analysis.

Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. Our analysis finds strong
evidence of a stochastic process, modeled as a power-law, with common amplitude
and spectral slope across pulsars. The Bayesian posterior of the amplitude for
an $f^{-2/3}$ power-law spectrum, expressed as the characteristic GW strain,
has median $1.92 \times 10^{-15}$ and $5\%$--$95\%$ quantiles of $1.37$--$2.67

versus independent red-noise processes in each pulsar exceeds $10,000$.
However, we find no statistically significant evidence that this process has
quadrupolar spatial correlations, which we would consider necessary to claim a
GWB detection consistent with general relativity. We find that the process has
neither monopolar nor dipolar correlations, which may arise from, for example,
reference clock or solar system ephemeris systematics, respectively. The
amplitude posterior has significant support above previously reported upper
limits; we explain this in terms of the Bayesian priors assumed for intrinsic
pulsar red noise. We examine potential implications for the supermassive black
hole binary population under the hypothesis that the signal is indeed
astrophysical in nature.

low-energy properties drastically different from those of the standard model. A
case in point is the emergent quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the
fractionalized topological magnet known as quantum spin ice, whose magnetic
monopoles set it apart from the familiar QED of the world we live in. Here, we
show that the two greatly differ in their fine-structure constant $\alpha$,
which parametrizes how strongly matter couples to light:
$\alpha_{\mathrm{QSI}}$ is more than an order of magnitude greater than
$\alpha_{\mathrm{QED}} \approx 1/137$. Furthermore, $\alpha_{\mathrm{QSI}}$,
the emergent speed of light, and all other parameters of the emergent QED, are
tunable by engineering the microscopic Hamiltonian. We find that
$\alpha_{\mathrm{QSI}}$ can be tuned all the way from zero up to what is
believed to be the \textit{strongest possible} coupling beyond which QED
confines. In view of the small size of its constrained Hilbert space, this
marks out quantum spin ice as an ideal platform for studying exotic quantum
field theories and a target for quantum simulation. The large
$\alpha_{\mathrm{QSI}}$ implies that experiments probing candidate
condensed-matter realizations of quantum spin ice should expect to observe
phenomena arising due to strong interactions.

enhanced susceptibility -- which separates the many-body localized phase from
the diffusive ergodic phase. This regime is characterized by slow transport and
we argue that the presence of such slow dynamics is incompatible with the
localization transition in the thermodynamic limit. Instead of localizing, the
system appears to enter a universal subdiffusive relaxation regime at moderate
values of disorder, where the spectral function of the local longitudinal
magnetization is inversely proportional to the frequency, corresponding to

for the direct estimation of aortic diameters. The approach is devised and
tested over 100 magnetic resonance angiography scans without contrast agent.
All data was expert-annotated at six aortic locations typically used in
clinical practice. Our approach makes use of a 3D+2D convolutional neural
network (CNN) that takes as input a 3D scan and outputs the aortic diameter at
a given location. In a 5-fold cross-validation comparison against a fully 3D
CNN and against a 3D multiresolution CNN, our approach was consistently
superior in predicting the aortic diameters. Overall, the 3D+2D CNN achieved a
mean absolute error between 2.2-2.4 mm depending on the considered aortic
location. These errors are less than 1 mm higher than the inter-observer
variability. Thus, suggesting that our method makes predictions almost reaching
the expert's performance. We conclude that the work allows to further explore
automatic algorithms for direct estimation of anatomical structures without the
necessity of a segmentation step. It also opens possibilities for the
automation of cardiovascular measurements in clinical settings.

computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to
obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In
particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map
metaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map
representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series
of landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is
backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing
a solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the
underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization
technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and

performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation,

which users join the communities. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we first
identify 30K future conspiracists-(FC) and 30K matched non-conspiracists-(NC).
We then provide empirical evidence of importance of social factors across six
dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million Reddit
comments and posts. Specifically in social factors, we find that dyadic
interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization
outside of the conspiracy communities, are the most important social precursors
to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines. Our
results offer quantitative backing to understand social processes and echo
chamber effects in conspiratorial engagement, with important implications for
democratic institutions and online communities.

borrowers through a virtual platform and earn the possible profit generated by
the interest rate. From the perspective of lenders, they want to maximize the
profit while minimizing the risk. Therefore, many studies have used machine
learning algorithms to help the lenders identify the ""best"" loans for making
investments. The studies have mainly focused on two categories to guide the
lenders' investments: one aims at minimizing the risk of investment (i.e., the
credit scoring perspective) while the other aims at maximizing the profit
(i.e., the profit scoring perspective). However, they have all focused on one
category only and there is seldom research trying to integrate the two
categories together. Motivated by this, we propose a two-stage framework that
incorporates the credit information into a profit scoring modeling. We
conducted the empirical experiment on a real-world P2P lending data from the US

the two-stage framework. Results show that the proposed two-stage method could
identify more profitable loans and thereby provide better investment guidance

the epsilon-near-zero response, and allows a perfect absorption tuning from

computationally expensive deep neural networks or human labelers to produce
structured information, e.g., object types and positions in video. To
accelerate queries, many recent systems (e.g., BlazeIt, NoScope, Tahoma, SUPG,
etc.) train a query-specific proxy model to approximate a large target labelers
(i.e., these expensive neural networks or human labelers). These models return
proxy scores that are then used in query processing algorithms. Unfortunately,
proxy models usually have to be trained per query and require large amounts of
annotations from the target labelers.
  In this work, we develop an index (trainable semantic index, TASTI) that
simultaneously removes the need for per-query proxies and is more efficient to
construct than prior indexes. TASTI accomplishes this by leveraging semantic
similarity across records in a given dataset. Specifically, it produces
embeddings for each record such that records with close embeddings have similar
target labeler outputs. TASTI then generates high-quality proxy scores via
embeddings without needing to train a per-query proxy. These scores can be used
in existing proxy-based query processing algorithms (e.g., for aggregation,
selection, etc.). We theoretically analyze TASTI and show that a low embedding
training error guarantees downstream query accuracy for a natural class of
queries. We evaluate TASTI on five video, text, and speech datasets, and three
query types. We show that TASTI's indexes can be 10$\times$ less expensive to
construct than generating annotations for current proxy-based methods, and
accelerate queries by up to 24$\times$.

solutions to a reaction-diffusion system modeling social outbursts, such as
rioting activity, originally proposed in arXiv:1502.04725v3. The model consists
of two scalar values, the level of unrest $u$ and a tension field $v$. A key
component of the model is a bandwagon effect in the unrest, provided the
tension is sufficiently high. We focus on the so-called tension inhibitive
regime, characterized by the fact that the level of unrest has a negative
feedback on the tension. This regime has been shown to be physically relevant
for the spatiotemporal spread of the 2005 French riots. We use Geometric
Singular Perturbation Theory to study the existence of such solutions in two
situations. The first is when both $u$ and $v$ diffuse at a very small rate.
Here, the time scale over which the bandwagon effect is observed plays a key
role. The second case we consider is when the tension diffuses at a much slower
rate than the level of unrest. In this case, we are able to deduce that the
driving dynamics are modeled by the well-known Fisher-KPP equation.

$S_n$ of permutations of length $n$. Each equivalence relation is determined by
a set of patterns, and equivalent permutations are connected by
pattern-replacements in a manner similar to that of the Knuth relation.
  One of our main results generalizes the celebrated Erdos-Szekeres Theorem for
permutation pattern-avoidance to a new result for permutation
pattern-replacement. In particular, we show that under the $\{123 \cdots k, k
\cdots 321\}$-equivalence, all permutations in $S_n$ are equivalent up to
parity when $n \ge \Omega(k^2)$.
  Additionally, we extend the work of Kuszmaul and Zhou on an infinite family
of pattern-replacement equivalences known as the rotational equivalences.
Kuszmaul and Zhou proved that the rotational equivalences always yield either
one or two nontrivial equivalence classes in $S_n$, and conjectured that the
number of nontrivial classes depended only on the patterns involved in the
rotational equivalence (rather than on $n$). We present a counterexample to
their conjecture, and prove a new theorem fully classifying (for large $n$)
when there is one nontrivial equivalence class and when there are two
nontrivial equivalence classes.
  Finally, we computationally analyze the pattern-replacement equivalences
given by sets of pairs of patterns of length four. We then focus on three
cases, in which the number of nontrivial equivalence classes matches an OEIS
sequence. For two of these we present full proofs of the enumeration and for
the third we suggest a potential future method of proof.

inspection planning methodologies, supported often by dynamic Bayesian

simplify the decision problem. However, the resulting policies may be
compromised by the limited space considered in the definition of the decision
rules. Avoiding this limitation, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) provide a principled mathematical methodology for stochastic optimal
control under uncertain action outcomes and observations, in which the optimal
actions are prescribed as a function of the entire, dynamically updated, state

with POMDPs in a joint framework for optimal inspection and maintenance

proximity and stellar mass ($10^8 M_\odot$, large for a dwarf galaxy) allow for
a detailed study of its kinematic properties. The red giant branch (RGB) stars
at the galaxy's center are particularly interesting because they are aligned on
an axis perpendicular to the galaxy's more extended HI disk. We detected a
velocity gradient among the RGB population using spectra from Keck DEIMOS. This
rotation is aligned with the HI disk, but the sense of rotation is about the
major axis of the central RGB population. We measured the rotation velocity
($v$) and velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the RGB population in five
metallicity bins. We found an increase of rotation support ($v/\sigma$) with
increasing metallicity, driven primarily by decreasing dispersion. We also
deduced an increasing radial distance for lower metallicity stars at
$-0.5$~kpc/dex by relating the observed stellar kinematics to position via NGC
6822's HI velocity curve. While the inverted metallicity gradient-like could be
interpreted as evidence for an outside-in formation scenario, it may instead
indicate that stellar feedback disturbed a centrally star forming galaxy over

against edge and vertex modifications. Algorithms with low sensitivity are
desirable because they are robust to edge failure or attack. In this work, we
show a randomized $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with worst-case
sensitivity $O_{\epsilon}(1)$, which substantially improves upon the
$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm of Varma and Yoshida (arXiv 2020) that
obtains average sensitivity $n^{O(1/(1+\epsilon^2))}$ sensitivity algorithm,
and show a deterministic $1/2$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity
$\exp(O(\log^*n))$ for bounded-degree graphs. We show that any deterministic
constant-factor approximation algorithm must have sensitivity $\Omega(\log^*
n)$. Our results imply that randomized algorithms are strictly more powerful
than deterministic ones in that the former can achieve sensitivity independent
of $n$ whereas the latter cannot. We also show analogous results for vertex
sensitivity, where we remove a vertex instead of an edge. As an application of
our results, we give an algorithm for the online maximum matching with
$O_{\epsilon}(n)$ total replacements in the vertex-arrival model. By
comparison, Bernstein et al. (J. ACM 2019) gave an online algorithm that always
outputs the maximum matching, but only for bipartite graphs and with $O(n\log

  Finally, we introduce the notion of normalized weighted sensitivity, a
natural generalization of sensitivity that accounts for the weights of deleted
edges. We show that if all edges in a graph have polynomially bounded weight,
then given a trade-off parameter $\alpha>2$, there exists an algorithm that

images of the surface brightness in the X-ray band and of the thermal component
of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect in the millimetre range. For this
purpose, we apply, for the first time, the Zernike polynomial decomposition, a
common analytic approach mostly used in adaptive optics to recover aberrated
radiation wavefronts at the telescopes pupil plane. With this novel way we
expect to correctly infer the morphology of clusters and so possibly, their

discriminate the morphology of each cluster by estimating the contribution of
the different polynomials to the fit of the map. The results of this new method
are correlated with those of a previous analysis made on the same catalogue,
using two parameters that combine either morphological or dynamical-state
probes. We underline that instrumental angular resolution of the maps has an
impact mainly when we extend this approach to high-redshift clusters.

disorder in a medium. Nevertheless, certain quantum systems allow dynamical
localization solely due to the nature of internal interactions. We study a
discrete time quantum walker which exhibits disorder free localization. The
quantum walker moves on a one-dimensional lattice and interacts with on-site
spins by coherently rotating them around a given axis at each step. Since the
spins do not have dynamics of their own, the system poses the local spin
components along the rotation axis as an extensive number of conserved moments.
When the interaction is weak, the spread of the walker shows subdiffusive
behaviour having downscaled ballistic tails in the evolving probability
distribution at intermediate time scales. However, as the interaction gets
stronger the walker gets exponentially localized in the complete absence of
disorder in both lattice and initial state. Using a matrix-product-state
ansatz, we investigate the relaxation and entanglement dynamics of the on-site
spins due to their coupling with the quantum walker. Surprisingly, we find that
even in the delocalized regime, entanglement growth and relaxation occur slowly
unlike marjority of the other models displaying a localization transition.

Communication delays are considered in the transmission of the signals in the
FR control loop and ESSs, and their State of Charge (SoC) management model is
considered. The system, ESSs and SoC components are modelled in detail from a
FR perspective. The model is validated using real system and ESSs data, based
on a practical transient stability model of the North American Eastern

represents the FR process of a large interconnected power network including

to low permeability of fault compared to its surrounding porous media. One way
to predict the behavior of the flow while taking the effects of fault into
account is to use the mixed finite element method. However, the mixed method
could be time consuming due to large number of degree of freedom since both
pressure and velocity are considered in the system. A new modeling method is
presented in this paper. First, we introduce approximations of pressure based
on the relation of pressure and velocity. We furthure decouple the approximated
pressure from velocity so that it can be solved independently by continuous
Galerkin finite element method. The new problem involves less degree of freedom
than the mixed method for a given mesh . Moreover, local problem associated
with a small subdomain around the fault is additionally solved to increase the
accuracy of approximations around fault. Numerical experiments are conducted to
examine the accuracy and efficiency of the new method. Results of
three-dimensional tests show that our new method is up to 30$\times$ faster
than the the mixed method at given $L^2$ pressure error.

DBN-UCRL, which relies on Bernstein-type confidence sets defined for individual

structure, DBN-UCRL achieves a regret bound, whose leading term strictly
improves over existing regret bounds in terms of the dependencies on the size
of $\mathcal S_i$'s and the involved diameter-related terms. We further show
that when the factorization structure corresponds to the Cartesian product of
some base MDPs, the regret of DBN-UCRL is upper bounded by the sum of regret of
the base MDPs. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments on standard

employed two methods to study the motion of the photocenter of the binary

visibility periods and the second one is based on solving a system of n
equations defining the displacements at the times t_n. The first and second
methods yield very similar sigma_bn values of 0.90 and 0.87 km s-1,

decreases the inferred sigma_bn. We estimated the eccentricity-averaged
sigma_bn value to be sigma_bn=0.81 km s-1 assuming that the orbital
eccentricities of massive binary systems are distributed uniformly in the [0,
0.9] interval. The choice of the exponent gamma in the power-law distribution,

pure trions (or charged excitons), but both peaks have been recently attributed
to superpositions of 2-body exciton and 4-body trion states and correspond to
the approximate energy eigenstates in doped 2D materials. In this paper, we
present the radiative lifetimes of these exciton-trion superposition energy
eigenstates using a many-body formalism that is appropriate given the many-body
nature of the strongly coupled exciton and trion states in doped 2D materials.
Whereas the exciton component of these superposition eigenstates are optically
coupled to the material ground state, and can emit a photon and decay into the
material ground state provided the momentum of the eigenstate is within the
light cone, the trion component is optically coupled only to the excited states
of the material and can emit a photon even when the momentum of the eigenstate
is outside the light cone. In an electron-doped 2D material, when a 4-body
trion state with momentum outside the light cone recombines radiatively, and a
photon is emitted with a momentum inside the light cone, the excess momentum is
taken by an electron-hole pair left behind in the conduction band. The
radiative lifetimes of the exciton-trion superposition states, with momenta
inside the light cone, are found to be in the few hundred femtoseconds to a few
picoseconds range and are strong functions of the doping density. The radiative
lifetimes of exciton-trion superposition states, with momenta outside the light
cone, are in the few hundred picoseconds to a few nanoseconds range and are
again strongly dependent on the doping density.

percentage of residents traveling and the number of trips per person. For each

observe that during the lock-down, Red and Blue states both displayed strong

However, after states reopened we find that Red states had higher

find that the residents of both Red and Blue states displayed similar travel
patterns during the period post the reopening of states, leading us to conclude
that, on average, the residents in Red states might be mobilizing less safely

a spectral case. Current RFFs-based kernel learning methods usually work in a
two-stage way. In the first-stage process, learning the optimal feature map is
often formulated as a target alignment problem, which aims to align the learned
kernel with the pre-defined target kernel (usually the ideal kernel). In the
second-stage process, a linear learner is conducted with respect to the mapped
random features. Nevertheless, the pre-defined kernel in target alignment is
not necessarily optimal for the generalization of the linear learner. Instead,
in this paper, we consider a one-stage process that incorporates the kernel
learning and linear learner into a unifying framework. To be specific, a
generative network via RFFs is devised to implicitly learn the kernel, followed
by a linear classifier parameterized as a full-connected layer. Then the
generative network and the classifier are jointly trained by solving the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to reach a one-stage solution. This
end-to-end scheme naturally allows deeper features, in correspondence to a
multi-layer structure, and shows superior generalization performance over the
classical two-stage, RFFs-based methods in real-world classification tasks.
Moreover, inspired by the randomized resampling mechanism of the proposed
method, its enhanced adversarial robustness is investigated and experimentally
verified.

of depth estimation is often more compelling than disparity estimation. The
accuracy of disparity estimation, however, does not directly translate to the
accuracy of depth estimation, especially for faraway objects. In the context of
learning-based stereo systems, this is largely due to biases imposed by the
choices of the disparity-based loss function and the training data.
Consequently, the learning algorithms often produce unreliable depth estimates

we compare two different choices of features on a data set of manually

function in the intracluster gas (ICG) in clusters of galaxies based on the
frequency dependence of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. It is generally
accepted that the relativistic equilibrium EV distribution is the one suggested
by Juttner. However, there is an ongoing debate on the foundation of
relativistic kinetic theory, and other distributions have also been proposed.
The mildly relativistic intracluster gas (ICG) provides a unique laboratory to
test relativistic kinetic theories. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations to
generate SZ signal from a single-temperature gas assuming the Juttner EV
distribution assuming a few per cent errors. We fitted SZ models based on
non-relativistic Maxwellian, and its two relativistic generalizations, the
Juttner and modified Juttner distributions. We found that a 1% error in the SZ
signal is sufficient to distinguish between these distributions with high
significance based on their different best-fit temperatures. However, in any
LOS in a cluster, the ICG contains a range of temperatures. Using our
N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of a merging galaxy cluster and assuming a 1%
error in the SZ measurements in a LOS through a bow shock, we find that it is
possible to distinguish between Juttner and modified Juttner distributions with
high significance. Our results suggest that deriving ICG temperatures from
fitting to SZ data assuming different EV distribution functions and comparing
them to the temperature in the same cluster obtained using other observations
would enable us to distinguish between the different distributions.11 pages, 8

AmazonNET -- a convolutional based network that allows extracting of burn

well-known encoder decoder type of architecture with skip connections commonly

RGB-NIR channels to segment burn scars from the pastures by training on a new

performance by correctly identifying partially labelled burn scars and
rejecting incorrectly labelled samples, demonstrating our approach as one of
the first to effectively utilise deep learning based segmentation models in

in mountainous environments as it enables a variety of location-based
applications. However, in such environments, the service reliability of
conventional wireless positioning technologies is often disappointing. Frequent
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation and poor geometry of available anchor
nodes are two significant challenges. Due to the high maneuverability and
flexible deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV-enabled positioning
could be a promising solution to these challenges. Compared with satellites and
terrestrial base stations, UAVs are capable of flying to places where both the
propagation conditions and geometry are favorable for positioning. The eventual
aim of this research project is to design a novel UAV-enabled positioning
system that uses a low-altitude UAV platform to provide highly reliable
services for ground users in mountainous environments. In this article, we
introduce the recent progress made in the first phase of our project, including
the following. First, the structure of the proposed system and the positioning
method used are determined after comprehensive consideration of various
factors. Utilizing the digital elevation model of the realistic terrain, we
then establish a geometry-based NLoS probability model so that the NLoS
propagation can be treated as a type of fault during the reliability analysis.
Most importantly, a reliability prediction method and the corresponding metric
are developed to evaluate the system's ability to provide reliable positioning
services. At the end of this article, we also propose a voting-based method for
improving the service reliability. Numerical results demonstrate the tremendous
potential of the proposed system in reliable positioning.

show that the deformed droplet can be set into motion with a predictable
rotation speed, demonstrating nonlinear traveling waves on the fluid-fluid

resource, such as ICU beds. However, instead of using conventional optimal
control methods, RL is used to find optimal control policies. A framework was
developed to calculate optimal cyclic lockdown timings using an RL-based on-off
controller. The RL-based controller is implemented as an RL agent that
interacts with an epidemic simulator, implemented as an extended SEIR epidemic
model. The RL agent learns a policy function that produces an optimal sequence
of open/lockdown decisions such that goals specified in the RL reward function
are optimized. Two concurrent goals were used: the first one is a public health
goal that minimizes overshoots of ICU bed usage above an ICU bed threshold, and
the second one is a socio-economic goal that minimizes the time spent under
lockdowns. It is assumed that cyclic lockdowns are considered as a temporary
alternative to extended lockdowns when a region faces imminent danger of
overpassing resource capacity limits and when imposing an extended lockdown
would cause severe social and economic consequences due to lack of necessary
economic resources to support its affected population during an extended

use. Methods: The system tracks individual protons through one (X, Y)
scintillating fiber tracker plane upstream and downstream of the object and
into a 13 cm-thick scintillating block residual energy detector. The fibers in
the tracker planes are multiplexed into silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to
reduce the number of electronics channels. The light signal from the residual
energy detector is collected by 16 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Only four
signals from the PMTs are output from each event, which allows for fast signal
readout. A robust calibration method of the PMT signal to residual energy has
been developed to obtain accurate proton images. The development of
patient-specific scan patterns using multiple input energies allows for an
image to be produced with minimal excess dose delivered to the patient.
Results: The calibration of signals in the energy detector produces accurate
residual range measurements limited by intrinsic range straggling. We measured
the water-equivalent thickness (WET) of a block of solid water (physical
thickness of 6.10 mm) with a proton radiograph. The mean WET from all pixels in
the block was 6.13 cm (SD 0.02 cm). The use of patient-specific scan patterns
using multiple input energies enables imaging with a compact range detector.
Conclusions: We have developed a prototype clinical proton radiography system
for pretreatment imaging in proton radiation therapy. We have optimized the
system for use with pencil beam scanning systems and have achieved a reduction
of size and complexity compared to previous designs.

surface, yet its practical acquisition often suffers from the shortcoming of
being noisy, sparse, and possibly incomplete, which restricts its use for a
high-quality surface recovery. Point set upsampling aims to increase its
density and regularity such that a better surface recovery could be achieved.
The problem is severely ill-posed and challenging, considering that the
upsampling target itself is only an approximation of the underlying surface.
Motivated to improve the surface approximation via point set upsampling, we
identify the factors that are critical to the objective, by pairing the surface
approximation error bounds of the input and output point sets. It suggests that
given a fixed budget of points in the upsampling result, more points should be
distributed onto the surface regions where local curvatures are relatively
high. To implement the motivation, we propose a novel design of
Curvature-ADaptive Point set Upsampling network (CAD-PU), the core of which is
a module of curvature-adaptive feature expansion. To train CAD-PU, we follow
the same motivation and propose geometrically intuitive surrogates that
approximate discrete notions of surface curvature for the upsampled point set.
We further integrate the proposed surrogates into an adversarial learning based
curvature minimization objective, which gives a practically effective learning
of CAD-PU. We conduct thorough experiments that show the efficacy of our
contributions and the advantages of our method over existing ones. Our

Gaussian-shaped function of $\log(T)$, where $T$ is the temperature of the
cosmos, and thus the function is specified by three parameters; the central
temporal position, the width and the magnitude. The change in the average
nuclear reaction rates due to the presence of the NTD is assumed to be
proportional to the Maxwellian reaction rates but with temperature $T_{\rm NTD}

wide four-dimensional parametric space at about half a million points, we have
found about 130 points with $\chi^2< 1$, at which the predicted primordial
abundances of light elements are consistent with the observations. The
magnitude parameter $\varepsilon_0$ of these points turns out to be scattered
over a very wide range from $\varepsilon_0 \sim 10^{-19}$ to $\sim 10^{-1}$,

database spanning 86 months in the Monterrey metropolitan area, containing
manually curated geo-located and dated homicides, as well as from Open Street

crime sectors corresponding to different connected components. Each of these
clusters of crime presents crime evolution similar to the one at state and
national levels. We then show how crime spread from neighborhood to adjacent
neighborhoods when violence was mainly cartel-related and how it was chiefly
static at a different time. Finally, we show a relation between homicidal crime
and urban landscape by studying the distance of safe and violent neighborhoods
to the closest highway and by studying the evolution of highway and crime
distance over the cartel-related years and the following period. With this
approach, we are able to describe more accurately the evolution of homicidal

distance-based similarity is the most widely used method for spectral
clustering. However, people have already noticed that this is not suitable for
multi-scale data, as the distance varies a lot for clusters with different
densities. State of the art(ROSC and CAST ) addresses this limitation by taking
the reachability similarity of objects into account. However, we observe that
in real-world scenarios, data in the same cluster tend to present in a smooth
manner, and previous algorithms never take this into account. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, which con-siders the
smoothness of data for the first time. We first divide objects into a great
many tiny clusters. Our key idea is to cluster tiny clusters, whose centers
constitute smooth graphs. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show
that our clustering algorithm significantly outperforms state of the art.
Although in this paper, we singly focus on multi-scale situations, the idea of
data smoothness can certainly be extended to any clustering algorithms

Although these factors are seldom significant in large populations, a small
change in them can drastically affect the global behaviour in small
populations. In this paper, we perform an experimental investigation on the
effect of these factors on the coupled behaviour of a minimal network of
candle-flame oscillators. We observe that strongly coupled oscillators exhibit
the global behaviour of in-phase synchrony and amplitude death, irrespective of
the number and the topology of oscillators. However, when they are weakly
coupled, their global behaviour exhibits the intermittent occurrence of
multiple stable states in time. In addition to states of clustering, chimera,
and weak chimera, we report the experimental discovery of partial amplitude
death in a network of candle-flame oscillators. We also show that closed-loop
networks tend to hold global synchronization for longer duration as compared to
open-loop networks. We believe that our results would find application in
real-life problems such as power grids, neuronal networks, and seizure

find that the turbulent simulations collapse at the same rate as the

turbulence dissipation; b) $g\approx0.395\pm0.035$, close to the ""virial"" value

where tensile (mode I) and shear (mode II) fractures are often interwoven.
These mixed-mode fractures are usually cohesive (quasi-brittle) and frictional.
Although phase-field modeling is increasingly used for rock fracture
simulation, no phase-field formulation is available for cohesive and frictional
mixed-mode fracture. To address this shortfall, here we develop a
double-phase-field formulation that employs two different phase fields to
describe cohesive tensile fracture and frictional shear fracture individually.
The formulation rigorously combines the two phase fields through three
approaches: (i) crack-direction-based decomposition of the strain energy into
the tensile, shear, and pure compression parts, (ii) contact-dependent
calculation of the potential energy, and (iii) energy-based determination of
the dominant fracturing mode in each contact condition. We validate the
proposed model, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experimental data
on mixed-mode fracture in rocks. The validation results demonstrate that the
double-phase-field model -- a combination of two quasi-brittle phase-field
models -- allows one to directly use material strengths measured from
experiments, unlike brittle phase-field models for mixed-mode fracture in
rocks. Another standout feature of the double-phase-field model is that it can
simulate, and naturally distinguish between, tensile and shear fractures
without complex algorithms.

greatly mitigated and the convergence for the stochastic process and the firing

approach to channel parameter estimation with large-scale mmWave hybrid uniform
circular cylindrical arrays (UCyAs) which are compact in size and immune to
mutual coupling but known to suffer from infinite-dimensional array responses
and intractability. We design a new resolution-preserving hybrid beamformer and
a low-complexity beam squinting suppression method, and reveal the existence of
shift-invariance relations in the tensor models of received array signals at
the UCyA. Exploiting these relations, we propose a new tensor-based subspace
estimation algorithm to suppress the receiver noises in all dimensions (time,
frequency, and space). The algorithm can accurately estimate the channel
parameters from both coherent and incoherent signals. Corroborated by the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB), simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm is able to achieve substantially higher estimation accuracy than
existing matrix-based techniques, with a comparable computational complexity.

relations between the tracer and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in the
multicomponent system by extending the Onsager formalism (although could not be
estimated by intersecting the diffusion couples). By solving these issues in
this article, we have now proposed the equations and method for estimating
these parameters in pseudo-ternary diffusion couples in which diffusion paths
can be intersected in multicomponent space. We have chosen NiCoFeCr system for
verification of this method because of the availability of good quality
diffusion couple experiments and estimated tracer diffusion coefficients of all
the components measured by the radiotracer method. An excellent match is found
when the tracer diffusion coefficients estimated following the newly proposed
method are compared with the data estimated following the radiotracer method.
Following, the intrinsic diffusion coefficients are estimated experimentally in
a multicomponent system for the first time highlighting diffusional
interactions between the components. We have further shown that the intrinsic
diffusion coefficients are the same (if the vacancy wind effect is
negligible/neglected) when estimated from other types of diffusion couples
(pseudo-binary and body diagonal) in the same multi-component system. This
method can be now extended to the Al, Ga, Si containing systems in which the

(EsoS). The NS masses and radii obtained are subject to a joint constrain from
massive pulsars and the event GW170817. The parameter $\lambda$ needs to be
negative as in previous NS studies, however we found a minimum value for it.
The value should be $|\lambda|\lesssim0.02$ and the reason for so small value
in comparison with previous ones obtained with simpler EsoS is due to the
existence of the NS crust. The pressure in theory of gravity depends on the
inverse of the sound velocity $v_s$. Since, $v_s$ is low in the crust,
$|\lambda|$ need to be very small. We found that the increment in the star mass
is less than $1\%$, much smaller than previous ones obtained not considering
the realistic stellar structure, and the star radius cannot become larger, its
changes compared to GR is less than $3.6\%$ in all cases. The finding that
using several relativistic and non-relativistic models the variation on the NS
mass and radius are almost the same for all the EsoS, manifests that our
results are insensitive to the high density part of the EsoS. It confirms that
stellar mass and radii changes depend only on crust, where the EoS is
essentially the same for all the models. The NS crust effect implying very
small values of $|\lambda|$ does not depend on the theory's function chosen,
since for any other one the hydrostatic equilibrium equation would always have
the dependence $1/v_s$. Finally, we highlight that our results indicate that
conclusions obtained from NS studies done in modified theories of gravity
without using realistic EsoS that describe correctly the NS interior can be
unreliable.

  Manipulation Strategies for Multi-turn Response Selection","Accepted to AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the task of selecting the optimal response given a
user and system utterance history in retrieval-based multi-turn dialog systems.
Recently, pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) showed
significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. This and
similar response selection tasks can also be solved using such language models
by formulating the tasks as dialog--response binary classification tasks.
Although existing works using this approach successfully obtained
state-of-the-art results, we observe that language models trained in this
manner tend to make predictions based on the relatedness of history and
candidates, ignoring the sequential nature of multi-turn dialog systems. This
suggests that the response selection task alone is insufficient for learning
temporal dependencies between utterances. To this end, we propose utterance
manipulation strategies (UMS) to address this problem. Specifically, UMS
consist of several strategies (i.e., insertion, deletion, and search), which
aid the response selection model towards maintaining dialog coherence. Further,
UMS are self-supervised methods that do not require additional annotation and
thus can be easily incorporated into existing approaches. Extensive evaluation
across multiple languages and models shows that UMS are highly effective in
teaching dialog consistency, which leads to models pushing the state-of-the-art
with significant margins on multiple public benchmark datasets.

the single-mode optomechanical systems to promote an ultra-sensitive metrology
protocol to break the standard quantum limit. The key idea of CQNC is that the
backaction noises arising from radiation pressure and driving can be offset by
coupling the optical mode to a near-resonant ancillary mode. In this work, a
continuous weak-force sensing under CQNC is developed in a double-mode
optomechanical system consisted of two optical modes with distinct frequencies
and a mechanical mode. In particular, under the asymmetrical treatment by
driving the higher-frequency optical mode, probing the lower-frequency one, and
coupling the probe mode to the ancillary mode, our configuration can be used to
resemble the conventional CQNC sensing. It is more important to find that the
current CQNC strategy simultaneously stabilizes the double-mode system with
respect to both the constrained driving power (the Routh-Hurwitz criterion) and
the effective positive mechanical damping (the stable optical-spring
condition). Moreover, through exploiting the coupling between the probe mode
and the ancillary mode under this nontrivial extension of the CQNC strategy
(from the single-mode version to the double-mode one), the rotating-wave term
and the counter-rotating term are found to be responsible to the system
stability and the noise cancellation, respectively. In realistic situations,
our scheme can be practiced in a tripartite optomechanical setup with a

one point of discussion is the segmentation of the target text. Character-level
segmentation has been initially proposed to obtain an open vocabulary, but it
results on long sequences and long training time. Then, subword-level

produces shorter sequences that reduce the training time, while being superior
to word-level models. As such, recent works on speech translation started using
target subwords despite the initial use of characters and some recent claims of
better results at the character level. In this work, we perform an extensive

favorably in all settings, outperforming its character-level counterpart in a

mixture components (i.e., the clusters) share regions with significant overlap
or outlying clusters exist with small but non-negligible weights. Two real

comparison with others along with an application in image processing. It is
observed that our method detects the clusters with lower misclassification
rates and successfully points out the outlying (anomalous) observations from

controlled by ozone dosage, on the field cycling behavior of the atomic layer
deposited Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) films. A nearly wake-up free device was achieved
after reduction of carbon contamination and oxygen defects by increasing the
ozone dosage. The sample which was grown at 30 sec ozone pulse duration shows
about 98% of the woken-up Pr at the pristine state while those grown below 5
sec ozone pulse time show a pinched hysteresis loop, undergone a large wake-up
effect. This behavior is attributed to the increase in oxygen vacancy and
carbon concentration in the films deposited at insufficient O3 dosage which was
confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). X-ray diffraction (XRD)
scan shows that the increase of ozone pulse time yields in the reduction of
tetragonal phase; therefore, the dielectric constant reduces. The I-V
measurements reveal the increase of current density as the ozone dosage
decreases which might be due to the generation of oxygen vacancies in the
deposited film. Finally, we have investigated the dynamics of wake-up effect

a novel linear binary classifier, termed Population Structure-learned

for each class; (4) It has the same computational complexity as the SVM. A
series of evaluations are conducted on one simulated data set and eight

modalities into effective metric-learning frameworks that aim to learn a
feature similarity between training samples (support set) and test samples
(query set). However, these approaches only augment the representations of
samples with available semantics while ignoring the query set, which loses the
potential for the improvement and may lead to a shift between the modalities
combination and the pure-visual representation. In this paper, we devise an
attributes-guided attention module (AGAM) to utilize human-annotated attributes
and learn more discriminative features. This plug-and-play module enables
visual contents and corresponding attributes to collectively focus on important
channels and regions for the support set. And the feature selection is also
achieved for query set with only visual information while the attributes are
not available. Therefore, representations from both sets are improved in a
fine-grained manner. Moreover, an attention alignment mechanism is proposed to
distill knowledge from the guidance of attributes to the pure-visual branch for
samples without attributes. Extensive experiments and analysis show that our
proposed module can significantly improve simple metric-based approaches to
achieve state-of-the-art performance on different datasets and settings.

study investigates the SiPM dynamic range required for the CEPC scintillator

describe the response of an SiPM to light pulses within one recovery period by
considering the cross-talk effect, photon detection efficiency, and number of

consistent with the measured curve within 2% for an incident light pulse of up

can restore the response linearity of an SiPM for an incident light pulse in

that the hydration structure of NH$_4^+$ features bifurcated hydrogen bonds,
which leads to a rotational mechanism involving the simultaneous switching of a

rotational mechanism are supported by existing experimental measurements, and
they also help to rationalize the measured fast rotation of NH$_4^+$ in water.

multivariate part allows a divergent number of parameters. From the
non-asymptotic point of view, we focus on the rate-optimal upper and lower

risk is shown in a non-asymptotic form under a more general assumption known as
the effective dimension to the model, by which we also show the prediction
consistency when the number of multivariate covariates $p$ slightly increases

number of non-functional predictors and the effective dimension of the kernel
principal components to ensure prediction consistency in the
increasing-dimensional setting. The analysis in our proof hinges on the
spectral condition of the sandwich operator of the covariance operator and the

for a large contribution to the dark matter, we argue that the clustering may
increase the late time Universe merger rate to a level compatible with the

modelled with angle-dependent energy and baryon loading. It is found that our

infrastructures of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Edge Computing (EC).
Both, IoT and EC, can support innovative applications around end users to
facilitate their activities. Such applications are built upon the collected
data and the appropriate processing demanded in the form of requests. To limit
the latency, instead of relying on Cloud for data storage and processing, the
research community provides a number of models for data management at the EC.
Requests, usually defined in the form of tasks or queries, demand the
processing of specific data. A model for pre-processing the data preparing them
and detecting their statistics before requests arrive is necessary. In this
paper, we propose a promising and easy to implement scheme for selecting the
appropriate host of the incoming data based on a probabilistic approach. Our
aim is to store similar data in the same distributed datasets to have,
beforehand, knowledge on their statistics while keeping their solidity at high
levels. As solidity, we consider the limited statistical deviation of data,
thus, we can support the storage of highly correlated data in the same dataset.
Additionally, we propose an aggregation mechanism for outliers detection
applied just after the arrival of data. Outliers are transferred to Cloud for
further processing. When data are accepted to be locally stored, we propose a
model for selecting the appropriate datasets where they will be replicated for
building a fault tolerant system. We analytically describe our model and
evaluate it through extensive simulations presenting its pros and cons.

locations and geometries are identified from the full-disk images measured by
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and the time delays among the light

estimated using the Differential Emission Measure method. We find that three of
four flares show strong emissions in SXR channels and high temperature (>6 MK)
EUV wavelengths during the impulsive phase, i.e., AIA 131 A and 94 A, and then
they emit peak radiation subsequently in the middle temperature (~0.6-3 MK) EUV
channels. Moreover, they last for a long time and have smaller electron
densities, which are probably driven by the interaction of hot diffuse flare
loops. Only one flare emits radiation at almost the same time in all the
observed wavelengths, lasts for a relatively short time, and has a larger
electron density. It is also accompanied by a type III radio burst. The bright
emission at the EUV channel could be corresponding to the associated erupting
filament.

equilibrium mixture approach is adopted to model the presence of and the phase
transition between liquid and vapor phases. Using this approach, two cavitation
models are implemented in a separate library, although more cavitation models
can be easily added. The two are a temperature-dependent cavitation model and a
barotropic cavitation model developed by Egerer et al. (2014). One of the main
advantages of the solver is that it considers the compressibility of all
phases. This feature combined with using the density-based approach enables
capturing shock-waves created upon the collapse of cavitating structures which
are known to be one of the main mechanisms of cavitation erosion. The
implementation also includes a post-processing tool which detects aggressive
collapse-induced shock-waves based on the method proposed by Mihatsch et al.

order to validate the implemented solver and post-processing tool, four cases
with progressively increasing complexity are simulated. The results from
simulation of these cases are compared with analytical solution, similar
numerical simulations as well as available experimental results. All of these
comparisons show that the numerical results obtained by the implemented solver

study, a 2-step neural-based pipeline is presented for matching 3D facial shape
to multiple DNA-related properties (sex, age, BMI and genomic background). The
first step consists of a triplet loss-based metric learner that compresses
facial shape into a lower dimensional embedding while preserving information
about the property of interest. Most studies in the field of metric learning
have only focused on 2D Euclidean data. In this work, geometric deep learning
is employed to learn directly from 3D facial meshes. To this end, spiral
convolutions are used along with a novel mesh-sampling scheme that retains
uniformly sampled 3D points at different levels of resolution. The second step
is a multi-biometric fusion by a fully connected neural network. The network
takes an ensemble of embeddings and property labels as input and returns
genuine and imposter scores. Since embeddings are accepted as an input, there
is no need to train classifiers for the different properties and available data
can be used more efficiently. Results obtained by a 10-fold cross-validation
for biometric verification show that combining multiple properties leads to
stronger biometric systems. Furthermore, the proposed neural-based pipeline
outperforms a linear baseline, which consists of principal component analysis,
followed by classification with linear support vector machines and a Naive

This superior and unique characteristic could lead to a wealth of new
opportunities in applications of quantum and acoustic/elastic information
processing. However, current acoustic/elastic topological insulators are still
at an infancy stage where the theory and prediction only work in laboratories
and there are still many problems left open before promoting their practical
applications. One of the apparent disadvantages is their narrow working
frequency range, which is the main concern in this paper. We design a
one-dimensional phononic beam system made of a homogeneous epoxy central beam
sandwiched by two homogeneous piezoelectric beams, and covered with extremely
thin electrodes, periodically and separately placed. These electrodes are
connected to external electric circuits with negative capacitors. We show that
a topological phase transition can be induced and tuned by changing the values
of the negative capacitors. It follows that the working frequency of the
topologically protected interface mode can be widely changed, such that the
working frequency range of the topological insulator can be considerably
`broadened'. This intelligent topological device may also find wide
applications in intelligent technologies that need controllable information
processing of high precision.

The SAR estimates were verified by comparing results against two other

unknown fault classes. Another complicating factor is that different fault

proposed to estimate the size of the fault when training data contains
information from known fault realizations. An advantage of the proposed
framework is that it can also be used for quantitative analysis of fault

faults of different magnitudes. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed
methods, multiple datasets from different fault scenarios have been collected

disease; in particular, the pre-existing learning crisis is expected to be
magnified during school shutdown. Despite efforts to put distance learning
strategies in place, the threat of student dropouts, especially among
adolescents, looms as a major concern. Are interventions to motivate
adolescents to stay in school effective amidst the pandemic? Here we show that,
in Brazil, nudges via text messages to high-school students, to motivate them
to stay engaged with school activities, substantially reduced dropouts during
school shutdown, and greatly increased their motivation to go back to school
when classes resume. While such nudges had been shown to decrease dropouts
during normal times, it is surprising that those impacts replicate in the
absence of regular classes because their effects are typically mediated by
teachers (whose effort in the classroom changes in response to the nudges).
Results show that insights from the science of adolescent psychology can be
leveraged to shift developmental trajectories at a critical juncture. They also
qualify those insights: effects increase with exposure and gradually fade out
once communication stops, providing novel evidence that motivational
interventions work by redirecting adolescents' attention.

The spatial distribution of molecules around starless cores is a
powerful tool for studying the physics and chemistry governing the earliest
stages of star formation. Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical
differentiation in starless cores to determine the influence of large-scale
effects on the spatial distribution of molecules within the cores. Furthermore,
we want to put observational constraints on the mechanisms responsible in
starless cores for the desorption of methanol from the surface of dust grains
where it is efficiently produced. Methods. We mapped methanol, CH3OH, and
cyclopropenylidene, c-C3H2, with the IRAM 30m telescope in the 3 mm band
towards six starless cores embedded in different environments, and in different
evolutionary stages. Furthermore, we searched for correlations among physical
properties of the cores and the methanol distribution. Results. From our maps
we can infer that the chemical segregation between CH3OH and c-C3H2 is driven
by uneven illumination from the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The side
of the core that is more illuminated has more C atoms in the gas-phase and the
formation of carbon-chain molecules like c-C3H2 is enhanced. Instead, on the
side that is less exposed to the ISRF the C atoms are mostly locked in carbon
monoxide, CO, the precursor of methanol. Conclusions. We conclude that
large-scale effects have a direct impact on the chemical segregation that we
can observe at core scale. However, the non-thermal mechanisms responsible for

application areas. For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage,
limiting the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential
of social influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade
ago, researchers started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The
challenge is to find the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to
maximise the influence spread in networks. In typical approach we will activate
all seeds in single stage, at the beginning of the process, while in this work
we introduce and evaluate a new approach for seeds activation in temporal
networks based on sequential seeding. Instead of activating all nodes at the
same time, this method distributes the activations of seeds, leading to higher
ranges of influence spread. The results of experiments performed using real and
randomised networks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms single
stage seeding in 71% of cases by nearly 6% on average. Knowing that temporal
networks are an adequate choice for modelling dynamic processes, the results of
this work can be interpreted as encouraging to apply temporal sequential
seeding for real world cases, especially knowing that more sophisticated seed
selection strategies can be implemented by using the seed activation strategy
introduced in this work.

holes in the mass range ~50 - 135 solar masses. However, black holes with
masses within this ""high mass gap"" are expected to form as the remnants of
binary black hole mergers. These remnants can merge again dynamically in
densely populated environments such as globular clusters. The hypothesis that
the binary black hole merger GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its
high mass. Orbital eccentricity can also be a signature of dynamical formation,
since a binary that merges quickly after becoming bound may not circularize
before merger. In this work, we measure the orbital eccentricity of GW190521.
We find that the data prefer a signal with eccentricity $e \geq 0.1$ at 10 Hz
to a non-precessing, quasi-circular signal, with a log Bayes factor $\ln{\cal
B}=5.0$. When compared to precessing, quasi-circular analyses, the data prefer
a non-precessing, $e \geq 0.1$ signal, with log Bayes factors $\ln{\cal
B}\approx2$. Using injection studies, we find that a non-spinning, moderately
eccentric ($e = 0.13$) GW190521-like binary can be mistaken for a
quasi-circular, precessing binary. Conversely, a quasi-circular binary with
spin-induced precession may be mistaken for an eccentric binary. We therefore
cannot confidently determine whether GW190521 was precessing or eccentric.
Nevertheless, since both of these properties support the dynamical formation
hypothesis, our findings support the hypothesis that GW190521 formed
dynamically.

different Froude numbers, with flow parameters selected to match available

campaign is used to carefully evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model,
the influence of various model parameters, and sensitivity to grid resolution.
Results reveal that, at least for the case of stepped spillways, the number of
parameters governing the model can be reduced. A crucial identified deficiency
of the model is its sensitivity to grid resolution. To improve the performance
of the model in this respect, modifications are proposed for the interface
detection algorithm and the transport equation for the volume fraction of
entrained air. Simulations using the improved model formulation demonstrate
better agreement with reference data for all considered flow conditions. A
parameter-free criterion for predicting the inception point of air entrainment

an accelerated charge. It is emphasized that one needs to maintain a clear
distinction between the electromagnetic power received by distant observers and
the mechanical power loss undergone by the charge. In literature both
quantities are treated as almost synonymous, the two in general could, however,
be quite different. It is shown that in the case of a periodic motion, the two
formulations do yield the power loss in a time averaged sense to be the same,
even though, the instantaneous rates are quite different. It is demonstrated
that the discordance between the two power formulas merely reflects the
difference in the power going in self-fields of the charge between the retarded
and present times. In particular, in the case of a uniformly accelerated
charge, power going into the self-fields at the present time is equal to the
power that was going into the self-fields at the retarded time plus the power
going in acceleration fields, usually called radiation. From a comparison of
the far fields with the instantaneous location of the uniformly accelerated
charge, it is shown that all its fields, including the acceleration fields,
remain around the charge and are not {\em radiated away} from it.

dynamics of pebbles in a radiative disk using 2D two-fluid simulations carried
out with the RoSSBi code. The combined action of the waves induced by the
migrating planet and drag back-reaction on the gas produces a complex evolution
of the flux of pebbles. The waves excite zonal flows which act as dust traps,
and accumulate pebbles. Owing to drag back-reaction, a Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability develops, generating turbulent dust rings containing several Earth
masses of solids, where planetesimal formation is likely. The more massive the
planet, the faster the dust rings develop. In competition with planet
migration, this process triggers several dust rings, with a radial separation
scaling as $1/M_p$. We discover a transition around $13$ Earth masses. Below
that, pebbles are stopped at the inner side of the planet's orbit, but pebble
accretion on the planet is sustained. Above that, drag back-reaction in the
dust ring region flattens the pressure profile while the planet migrates, which
limits further growth by pebble accretion. This new {\it pebble isolation mass}
is about a factor of 2 lower than often reported in the literature. This
reduces the overall formation timescale of Super-Earth planets, while favoring
their survival after the disk's dissipation because further accretion is
stifled. Finally, our results support an hybrid model for the formation of
Jupiter via both pebbles and planetesimals accretion.

more than 100 years ago. Classical conditioning is only valid with respect to
events of positive probability. If we ignore this constraint and condition on
such sets, for example events of type $\{Y=y\}$ for a continuously distributed
random variable $Y$, almost any probability measure can be chosen as the
conditional measure on such sets. There have been numerous descriptions and
explanations of the paradox' appearance in the setting of conditioning on a
subset of probability zero. However, most treatments don't supply explicit
instructions on how to avoid it. We propose to close this gap by defining a
version of conditional measure which utilizes the Hausdorff measure. This makes
the choice canonical in the sense that it only depends on the geometry of the
space, thus removing any ambiguity. We describe the set of possible measures
arising in the context of the Borel--Kolmogorov paradox and classify those
coinciding with the canonical measure. The objective of this manuscript is to
provide a manual for singular conditional probability: We give an explicit

low interfacial resistance of the TiS2 cell during cycling evidences a better

deficient in iron peak elements and slightly overabundant in C, O, and heavier

modes down to exceptionally low noise levels for beta Cas. The star is also one
of very few delta Scuti pulsators known to date to show a measurable magnetic
field, and the first delta Scuti star with a dynamo magnetic field. These
characteristics make beta Cas an interesting target for future studies of
dynamo processes in the thin convective envelopes of F-type stars, of the

and deployed in safety-critical devices, even the rarest hard scenarios must be
properly addressed. In this paper, we particularly focus on hard occlusion
cases and benchmark the performance of recent state-of-the-art trackers (SOTA)
on them. We created a small-scale dataset containing different categories
within hard occlusions, on which the selected trackers are evaluated. Results
show that hard occlusions remain a very challenging problem for SOTA trackers.
Furthermore, it is observed that tracker performance varies wildly between
different categories of hard occlusions, where a top-performing tracker on one
category performs significantly worse on a different category. The varying
nature of tracker performance based on specific categories suggests that the
common tracker rankings using averaged single performance scores are not
adequate to gauge tracker performance in real-world scenarios.

space extension of a beam in linear dynamics may be represented by a complex

circuits, so that classical electrical methods might be used for the design of
such beam transport lines. However, this method has never been fully developed,
and only the transport transformation of single particular elements, like drift
spaces or quadrupoles, has been presented in the past. In this paper, we
complete the complex formalism of linear beam dynamics by obtaining a general
differential equation and solving it, to show that the general transformation
of a linear beam line is a complex Moebius transformation. This result opens
the possibility of studying the effect of the beam line on complete regions of
the complex plane and not only on a single point. Taking advantage of this
capability of the formalism, we also obtain an important result in the theory
of the transport through a periodic line, proving that the invariant points of
the transformation are only a special case of a more general structure of the
solution, which are the invariant circles of the one-period transformation.
Among other advantages, this provides a new description of the betatron

detects the locations of the superficial and deep aponeuroses, as well as
multiple fascicle fragments per image. For single images, the method gave
similar results to those produced by a non-trainable automated method (SMA;

remaining continuous variables, has a distribution belonging to a zero-mean
Gaussian model whose covariance matrix is constrained to satisfy the Markov

conditionally on a given DAG. Since the DAG which generates the observations is

  The goal of this paper is to help practitioners identify the most suitable

literature and conduct an extensive benchmark in terms of global approximation
accuracy on a large set of computational models. Investigating the synergies
between sparse regression solvers and basis adaptivity schemes, we find that
the choice of the proper solver and basis-adaptive scheme is very important, as
it can result in more than one order of magnitude difference in performance. No
single method significantly outperforms the others, but dividing the analysis
into classes (regarding input dimension and experimental design size), we are
able to identify specific sparse solver and basis adaptivity combinations for
each class that show comparatively good performance.
  To further improve on these findings, we introduce a novel solver and basis
adaptivity selection scheme guided by cross-validation error. We demonstrate
that this automatic selection procedure provides close-to-optimal results in

general than the case-by-case recommendations obtained by the benchmark.

time. Knowledge of how this distribution evolves is of practical importance for
maritime and climate studies. The analytical framework developed in Part 1
examined how this evolution is governed by the bubble-mass flux from large to
small bubble sizes, which depends on the rate of break-up events and the
distribution of child bubble sizes. These statistics are measured in Part 2 as
ensemble-averaged functions of time by simulating ensembles of breaking waves,
and identifying and tracking individual bubbles and their break-up events. The
break-up dynamics are seen to be statistically unsteady, and two intervals with
distinct characteristics were identified. In the first interval, the
dissipation rate and bubble-mass flux are quasi-steady, and the theoretical
analysis of Part 1 is supported by all observed statistics, including the
expected -10/3 power-law exponent for the super-Hinze-scale size distribution.
Strong locality is observed in the corresponding bubble-mass flux, supporting
the presence of a super-Hinze-scale break-up cascade. In the second interval,
the dissipation rate decays, and the bubble-mass flux increases as small- and
intermediate-sized bubbles become more populous. This flux remains strongly
local with cascade-like behaviour, but the dominant power-law exponent for the
size distribution increases to -8/3 as small bubbles are also depleted more
quickly. This suggests the emergence of different physical mechanisms during
different phases of the breaking-wave evolution, although size-local break-up
remains a dominant theme. Parts 1 and 2 present an analytical toolkit for
population balance analysis in two-phase flows.

that they are randomly distributed, consistent with Monte Carlo simulations

Electronic structure parameters are directly determined from angle resolved

to reduce to zero at intermediate compositions. Despite this,
polarisation-resolved photoluminescence spectra on monolayer Mo0.5W0.5S2 show
significant circular dichroism, indicating that spin-valley locking is

constraints. We describe how this method captures the imprint of primordial
local non-Gaussianity on the late-time distribution of dark matter halos, using
a set of N-body simulations as a proxy for real data analysis. For our best
single statistic, running the pipeline on several cubic volumes of size
$40~(\rm{Gpc/h})^{3}$, we detect $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}=10$ at $97.5\%$

resolve degeneracies between the topological signature of $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

Our method relies on information living at $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Mpc/h, a

the non-parametric flexibility of GPs with the ability to leverage information

the marginal log-likelihood suitable for stochastic optimization. We
empirically evaluate our model against other generative models for censored

social network users in the decision-making process and selecting appropriate
items. On the other hand, due to many different items, users cannot score a
wide range of them, and usually, there is a scattering problem for the matrix
created for users. To solve the problem, the trust-based recommender systems
are applied to predict the score of the desired item for the user. Various
criteria have been considered to define trust, and the degree of trust between
users is usually calculated based on these criteria. In this regard, it is
impossible to obtain the degree of trust for all users because of the large
number of them in social networks. Also, for this problem, researchers use
different modes of the Random Walk algorithm to randomly visit some users,
study their behavior, and gain the degree of trust between them. In the present
study, a trust-based recommender system is presented that predicts the score of
items that the target user has not rated, and if the item is not found, it
offers the user the items dependent on that item that are also part of the
user's interests. In a trusted network, by weighting the edges between the
nodes, the degree of trust is determined, and a TrustWalker is developed, which
uses the Biased Random Walk (BRW) algorithm to move between the nodes. The
weight of the edges is effective in the selection of random steps. The
implementation and evaluation of the present research method have been carried
out on three datasets named Epinions, Flixster, and FilmTrust; the results

of Mott-insulator antiferromagnetism in a K cluster array has been proposed for

explain either the $n$-dependence of the Curie temperature or that of the Curie
constant. In the present study, detailed measurements were made of the optical

multipolarities in their components. The QDs feature flat-top shapes when
either chemical potential \mu_1,2 of the droplet approaches an edge of a
triangular existence domain in the (\mu_1,\mu_2) plane. QDs with different
vorticities of their components are stable against azimuthal perturbations,
provided that the norm of one component is large. We also present multipole
states, in which the interaction with a strong fundamental component balances
the repulsion between poles with opposite signs in the other component, leading
to the formation of stable bound states. Extended stability domains are
obtained for dipole QDs; tripole ones exist but are unstable, while quadrupoles
are stable in a narrow region. The results uncover the existence of much richer
families of stable binary QDs in comparison to states with identical
components.

four members of the MUSE galaxy group have low to intermediate stellar masses
(~ 10^7-10^{10} Msun) and star formation rates (SFRs) of 0.4-24 Msun/yr,
resulting in high specific SFRs (sSFRs) for two of them, which suggest that
these galaxies are growing fast (with stellar-mass doubling times of only ~
2x10^7 years). This high incidence of starburst galaxies is likely a
consequence of interactions within the galaxy group, which is compact and has
high velocity dispersion. Based on the magnification-corrected sub-/millimetre
continuum flux density and estimated stellar mass, we infer that the ALMA
source is classified as an ordinary ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (with
associated dust-obscured SFR~200-300 Msun/yr) and lies on the star-formation
main sequence. This reported case of an ALMA/MUSE group association suggests
that some presumably isolated ALMA sources are in fact signposts of richer
star-forming environments at high redshifts.

seen by the ALICE collaboration at CERN in p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, is
investigated in the hadron resonance gas model taking into account interactions
among hadrons using S-matrix corrections based on known phase shift analyses.
Strangeness conservation is taken into account in the framework of the
canonical strangeness ensemble. A very good description is obtained for the
variation of the strangeness content in the final state as a function of the
number of charged hadrons in the mid-rapidity region using the same fixed
temperature value as obtained in the most central Pb-Pb collisions. It is shown
that the number of charged hadrons is linearly proportional to the volume of
the system. For small multiplicities the canonical ensemble with local
strangeness conservation restricted to mid-rapidity leads to a stronger
suppression of (multi-)strange baryons than seen in the data. This is
compensated by introducing a global conservation of strangeness in the whole
phase-space which is parameterized by the canonical correlation volume larger
than the fireball volume at the mid-rapidity. The results on comparing the
hadron resonance gas model with and without S-matrix corrections, are presented
in detail. It is shown that the interactions introduced by the phase shift
analysis via the S-matrix formalism are essential for a better description of

both the thick disc and halo populations very similar prominent substructures
are apparent for the generic Galactic potential, while no substructure is seen

not merger-related, but due to non-integrability of the generic potential. This
conclusion is strengthened by our frequency analysis of the orbits of stars,
which reveals the presence of prominent resonances, with $\sim 30\%$ of the
halo stars associated to resonance families. In fact, the stars in resonances
define the substructures seen in the spaces of characteristic orbital
parameters. Furthermore, we find that some stars in our sample and in debris
streams are on the same resonance as the Sagittarius dwarf, suggesting this
system has also influenced the distribution of stars in the Galactic thick disc

Thus, an in-depth system-level analysis allows us to gain a new understanding

improving the precision of neutron \b{eta} decay experiments. Neutron decay is
nowadays studied with high statistics, based on up to 109 registered decay
events, and leads to strongly improved limits on new physics beyond the
standard model, with \b{eta}s often registered in plastic scintillators. The
main systematic errors in these experiments are due to imperfect
characterization of the scintillators with respect to linearity, energy
resolution, and electron backscattering. We study whether these errors can be
diminished when the conventional photomultipliers used for scintillator readout
are replaced by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). To this end, various
theoretical and experimental tools are developed, and a procedure for handling
the extreme dark rates of SiPMs is proposed. In \b{eta} spectroscopy, so the
conclusion, plastic scintillator readout with SiPMs can significantly improve
energy response, and help providing reliable corrections for electron
backscattering.

solving its sphere-relaxation leading to a trust region subproblem (TRS). In

of bounded nucleons inside a nucleus, are some of the main standing problems in
nuclear and particle physics. In recent years, ultra-peripheral collisions
(UPC) of heavy ions have provided a new way of probing the gluon density, which
is based on coherent diffractive vector-meson productions, e.g., $J/\psi$
meson. For heavy ions, e.g., Pb, the gluon density is found to be significantly
suppressed through the UPC $J/\psi$ measurement, suggesting a strong gluon
shadowing effect in heavy nuclei. In this analysis, we aim to look at a unique
set of data taken by the STAR experiment, where $J/\psi$ mesons are
photoproduced off the deuteron target with no other particle produced, except
for the deuteron or its breakup products. The Zero Degree Calorimeter response

  Supporting Almost Constant-Time Scaling","Accepted to ICML 2021",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using logical clauses to represent patterns, Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have
recently obtained competitive performance in terms of accuracy, memory
footprint, energy, and learning speed on several benchmarks. Each TM clause
votes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a
majority vote. While the evaluation of clauses is fast, being based on binary
operators, the voting makes it necessary to synchronize the clause evaluation,
impeding parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for
desynchronizing the evaluation of clauses, eliminating the voting bottleneck.
In brief, every clause runs in its own thread for massive native parallelism.
For each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the
clauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach
the processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting
decentralized learning. This means that the TM most of the time will operate on
outdated voting tallies. We evaluated the proposed parallelization across
diverse learning tasks and it turns out that our decentralized TM learning
algorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant
loss in learning accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach
provides up to 50 times faster learning. Finally, learning time is almost
constant for reasonable clause amounts (employing from 20 to 7,000 clauses on a
Tesla V100 GPU). For sufficiently large clause numbers, computation time
increases approximately proportionally. Our parallel and asynchronous
architecture thus allows processing of massive datasets and operating with more
clauses for higher accuracy.

conductor in terms of the wave functions of carriers injected into the Fermi

helps us to identify two physically different contributions to shot noise. In
the quantum coherent regime, when current is carried by non-overlapping
wave-packets, the product of current fluctuations in different leads, the
cross-correlation noise, is determined solely by the duration of the wave
packet. In contrast, the square of the current fluctuations in one lead, the
auto-correlation noise, is additionally determined by the coherence of the
wave-packet, which is associated with the spread of the wave packet in energy.
The two contributions can be addressed separately in the weak back-scattering
regime, when the auto-correlation noise depends only on the coherence. Analysis
of shot noise in terms of these contributions allows us, in particular, to
predict that no individual travelling particles with a real wave function, such
as Majorana fermions, can be created in the Fermi sea in a clean manner, that
is, without accompanying electron-hole pairs.

origin and nature of GRBs. Polarization measurements of the prompt emission of
these extreme phenomena have long been thought to be the key to answering a
range of these questions. The POLAR detector was designed to produce the first
set of detailed and reliable polarization measurements in an energy range of
approximately 50-500 keV. During late 2016 and early 2017, POLAR detected a
total of 55 GRBs. Analysis results of 5 of these GRBs have been reported in the
past. The results were found to be consistent with a low or unpolarized flux.
However, previous reports by other collaborations found high levels of
polarization. We study the polarization for all the 14 GRBs observed by POLAR
for which statistically robust inferences are possible. Additionally,
time-resolved polarization studies are performed on GRBs with sufficient
apparent flux. A publicly available polarization analysis tool, developed
within the 3ML framework, was used to produce statistically robust results. The
method allows to combine spectral and polarimetric data from POLAR with
spectral data from the Fermi GBM and Swift-BAT to jointly model the spectral
and polarimetric parameters. The time integrated analysis finds all results to
be compatible with a low or zero polarization with the caveat that, when
time-resolved analysis is possible within individual pulses, we observe
moderate polarization with a rapidly changing polarization angle. Thus,
time-integrated polarization results, while pointing to lower polarization are
potentially an artifact of summing over the changing polarization signal and
thus, washing out the true moderate polarization. Therefore, we caution against
over interpretation of any time-integrated results and encourage one to wait
for more detailed polarization measurements from forthcoming missions such as
POLAR-2 and LEAP.

  Attacks against Transfer Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While being deployed in many critical applications as core components,
machine learning (ML) models are vulnerable to various security and privacy
attacks. One major privacy attack in this domain is membership inference, where
an adversary aims to determine whether a target data sample is part of the
training set of a target ML model. So far, most of the current membership
inference attacks are evaluated against ML models trained from scratch.
However, real-world ML models are typically trained following the transfer
learning paradigm, where a model owner takes a pretrained model learned from a
different dataset, namely teacher model, and trains her own student model by
fine-tuning the teacher model with her own data.
  In this paper, we perform the first systematic evaluation of membership
inference attacks against transfer learning models. We adopt the strategy of
shadow model training to derive the data for training our membership inference
classifier. Extensive experiments on four real-world image datasets show that
membership inference can achieve effective performance. For instance, on the
CIFAR100 classifier transferred from ResNet20 (pretrained with Caltech101), our
membership inference achieves $95\%$ attack AUC. Moreover, we show that
membership inference is still effective when the architecture of target model
is unknown. Our results shed light on the severity of membership risks stemming
from machine learning models in practice.

$E$, any local optimizer $a$ at which $h$ is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable
operator commutes with the derivative $h^{\prime}(a)$. In this paper, assuming
the existence of a subgradient in place the derivative (of $h$), we establish
`strong operator commutativity' relations: If $a$ solves the problem
$\underset{E}{\max}\,(h+\Phi)$, then $a$ strongly operator commutes with every
element in the subdifferential of $h$ at $a$; If $E$ and $h$ are convex and $a$
solves the problem $\underset{E}{\min}\,h$, then $a$ strongly operator commutes
with the negative of some element in the subdifferential of $h$ at $a$. These
results improve known (operator) commutativity relations for linear $h$ and for
solutions of variational inequality problems. We establish these results via a
geometric commutation principle that is valid not only in Euclidean Jordan

from the training set are used to train the CNN and aggregate the extracted
local features of images from the tuples to form global features. For every

equivalent to a large number of training patterns being prepared for training
the CNN for text-independent writer identification. We conducted experiments on
the JEITA-HP database of offline handwritten Japanese character patterns. With
200 characters, our method achieved an accuracy of 99.97% to classify 100
writers. Even when using 50 characters for 100 writers or 100 characters for

when they belong to the same camera model. However, with the advent of
computational photography, most recent devices heavily process the acquired

distinctiveness, especially when several exemplars of the same device model are
involved in the analysis. Considering that PRNU is an image forensic technology
that finds actual and wide use by law enforcement agencies worldwide, it is
essential to keep validating such technology on recent devices as they appear.
In this paper, we perform an extensive testing campaign on over 33.000 Flickr

to determine how widespread the issue is and which is the plausible cause.
Experiments highlight that most brands, like Samsung, Huawei, Canon, Nikon,

the primary cause of high false alarm rates cannot be directly related to
specific camera models, firmware, nor image contents. It is evident that the
effectiveness of \prnu based source identification on the most recent devices

Ensembles are generated by perturbing the wind inputs and ice cohesion field

ice trajectories as sampled by virtual drifters seeded in the model to cover
the Arctic Ocean and using metrics borrowed from the search-and-rescue

perturbations dominate the forecast uncertainty i.e. the absolute spread of the
ensemble, while the inhomogeneities in the ice cohesion field significantly
increase the degree of anisotropy in the spread i.e. trajectories drift
differently in different directions. We suggest that in order to get a full
flavor of uncertainties in a sea ice model with brittle-like rheologies, to
predict sea ice drift and trajectories, one should consider using
ensemble-based simulations where both wind forcing and sea ice cohesion are

than one cause: from the distribution of the CR sources in the Milky Way to the
nature of such sources, from the turbulence properties of interstellar plasmas
to the inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium. Coherent magnetic
structures such as the heliosphere greatly influence the CR arrival direction
distribution. It is necessary to account for and remove the heliosphere's

of solutions to the Sherali-Adams linear program), that a slight variant of the
parallel repetition of the exponential-length constant-query PCP construction
due to Arora et al. (JACM 1998) is sound against non-signaling strategies with
constant locality.
  Our proof relies on the analysis of the linearity test and agreement test
(also known as the direct product test) in the non-signaling setting.

framework that drew attention due to its direct operation on irregular,
non-uniform 3D meshes. On selected benchmarking datasets, it outperformed
state-of-the-art methods within classification and segmentation tasks.
Especially, the medical domain provides a large amount of complex 3D surface
models that may benefit from processing with MeshCNN. However, several
limitations prevent outstanding performances of MeshCNN on highly diverse
medical surface models. Within this work, we propose MedMeshCNN as an expansion
for complex, diverse, and fine-grained medical data. Methods: MedMeshCNN
follows the functionality of MeshCNN with a significantly increased memory
efficiency that allows retaining patient-specific properties during the
segmentation process. Furthermore, it enables the segmentation of pathological
structures that often come with highly imbalanced class distributions. Results:
We tested the performance of MedMeshCNN on a complex part segmentation task of
intracranial aneurysms and their surrounding vessel structures and reached a
mean Intersection over Union of 63.24\%. The pathological aneurysm is segmented
with an Intersection over Union of 71.4\%. Conclusions: These results
demonstrate that MedMeshCNN enables the application of MeshCNN on complex,
fine-grained medical surface meshes. The imbalanced class distribution deriving
from the pathological finding is considered by MedMeshCNN and patient-specific
properties are mostly retained during the segmentation process.

patients with liver disease and may be of some value in assessing steatosis.
However, there remain questions as to the role of steatosis and fibrosis as
cofactors influencing the viscoelastic measurements of the liver tissues,
particularly shear wave speed (SWS) and shear wave attenuation (SWA). In this
study, by employing the theory of composite elastic media as well as two
independent experimental measurements on fat-in-gelatin phantoms and also
finite element simulations, it is consistently shown that fat and fibrosis
jointly influence the SWS and SWA measurements. At a constant level of fat,
fibrosis stages can influence the SWA by factors of 2-4. Moreover, the rate of
increase in SWA with increasing fat is strongly influenced by the stages of
fibrosis; softer background cases (low fibrosis stages) have higher rate of SWA
increase with fat than those with stiffer moduli (higher fibrosis stages).
Meanwhile, SWS results are influenced by the presence of fat, however the
degree of variability is more subtle. The results indicate the importance of
jointly considering fat and fibrosis as contributors to SWS and SWA
measurements in complex liver tissues and in the design and interpretation of
clinical trials.

in random environments for cellular biological systems. This model displays
several remarkable features, which makes it an attractive paradigm to explain
the physical nature of biological subdiffusion. In particular, it combines
viscoelasticity with distinct non-ergodic features. We extend this model to
make it suitable for the subdiffusion of lipids in disordered biological
membranes upon including the inertial effects. For lipids, the inertial effects
occur in the range of picoseconds, and a power-law decaying viscoelastic memory
extends over the range of several nanoseconds. Thus, in the absence of
disorder, diffusion would become normal on a time scale beyond this memory
range. However, both experimentally and in some molecular-dynamical
simulations, the time range of lipid subdiffusion extends far beyond the
viscoelastic memory range. We study three 1d models of correlated quenched
Gaussian disorder to explain the puzzle: singular short-range (exponentially
correlated), smooth short-range (Gaussian-correlated), and smooth long-range
(power-law correlated) disorder. For a moderate disorder strength, transient
viscoelastic subdiffusion changes into the subdiffusion caused by the
randomness of the environment. It is characterized by a time-dependent
power-law exponent of subdiffusion, which can show nonmonotonous behavior, in
agreement with some recent molecular-dynamical simulations. Moreover, the
spatial distribution of test particles in this disorder-dominated regime is
shown to be a non-Gaussian, exponential power distribution, which also
correlates well with molecular-dynamical findings and experiments. Furthermore,
this subdiffusion is nonergodic with single-trajectory averages showing a broad
scatter, in agreement with experimental observations for subdiffusion of
various particles in living cells.

halos on their environment in a whole-sky $\Lambda$CDM light-cone simulation
extending to $z\sim 0.65$. The properties of interest are halo shape
(parametrized by its principal axes), spin and virialisation status, the
alignment of halo spin and shape, as well as the shape-shape and spin-spin
alignments among halo neighbours. Methods: We define the halo environment using
the notion of halo isolation status determined by the distance to its nearest
neighbor. This defines a maximum spherical region around each halo devoid of
other halos, above the catalog threshold mass. We consider as 'close halo
pairs', the pairs that are separated by a distance lower than a specific
threshold. In order to decontaminate our results from the known dependence of
halo dynamical properties on mass, we use a random sampling procedure in order
to compare properties of similar halo abundance distributions. Results: (a) We
find a strong dependence of halo properties on their environment, confirming
that isolated halos are more aspherical and more prolate with lower spin
values. (b) Correlations between halo properties exist and are mostly
independent of halo environment. (c) Halo spins are aligned with the minor
axis, regardless of halo shape. (d) Close halo neighbors have their major axes
statistically aligned, while they show a slight but statistically significant
preference for anti-parallel spin directions. The latter result is enhanced for
the case of close halo pairs in low-density environments. Furthermore, we find
a preference of the spin vectors to be oriented perpendicular to the line
connecting such close halo pairs.

regularization schemes, avoids gradient obfuscation, and, with additional
iterations, achieves strong robustness with significantly lower training time
than AT. Further, it retains the interesting facet of AT that networks learn

embedding is a compute-intensive process of representing graphs as a set of
vectors in a d-dimensional space, which in turn makes it amenable to ML tasks.
Many approaches have been proposed in the literature to improve the performance
of graph embedding, e.g., using distributed algorithms, accelerators, and
pre-processing techniques. Graph coarsening, which can be considered a
pre-processing step, is a structural approximation of a given, large graph with
a smaller one. As the literature suggests, the cost of embedding significantly
decreases when coarsening is employed. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the
impact of the coarsening quality on the embedding performance both in terms of

incrementally by sketching the desired shape edits, which our system
automatically translates to CAD operations. Our approach is motivated by the
close similarities between the steps industrial designers follow to draw 3D
shapes, and the operations CAD modeling systems offer to create similar shapes.
To overcome the strong ambiguity with parsing 2D sketches, we observe that in a
sketching sequence, each step makes sense and can be interpreted in the
\emph{context} of what has been drawn before. In our system, this context
corresponds to a partial CAD model, inferred in the previous steps, which we
feed along with the input sketch to a deep neural network in charge of
interpreting how the model should be modified by that sketch. Our deep network
architecture then recognizes the intended CAD operation and segments the sketch
accordingly, such that a subsequent optimization estimates the parameters of
the operation that best fit the segmented sketch strokes. Since there exists no
datasets of paired sketching and CAD modeling sequences, we train our system by
generating synthetic sequences of CAD operations that we render as line
drawings. We present a proof of concept realization of our algorithm supporting
four frequently used CAD operations. Using our system, participants are able to
quickly model a large and diverse set of objects, demonstrating Sketch2CAD to
be an alternate way of interacting with current CAD modeling systems.

gauge-fixing procedure in the Landau gauge is known to be incomplete due to the
presence of gauge-equivalent field configurations. A widespread belief is that
the proper analysis of the low energy properties in this gauge requires the
extension of the gauge-fixing procedure beyond the FP recipe. This manuscript
reviews various applications of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) model, a
phenomenological proposal for such an extension, based on the decoupling
properties of Landau gauge correlators as computed on the lattice. We
investigate the predictions of the model concerning the deconfinement
transition of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature, first in the
case of pure Yang-Mills theory and then in the case of heavy-quark Quantum
Chromodynamics. We show that most qualitative aspects and also many
quantitative features of the deconfinement transition can be accounted for
within the CF model, with only one additional parameter, adjusted from
comparison to lattice simulations. Moreover, these features emerge in a
systematic and controlled perturbative expansion, as opposed to the ill-defined
perturbative expansion within the FP model in the infrared. Applications at
finite temperature and/or density require one to consider a background
extension of the Landau gauge, the so-called Landau-deWitt gauge. The
manuscript is also intended as a thorough but pedagogical introduction to these
techniques, including the rationale for introducing a background, the role of
the Weyl chambers, and the complications that emerge due to the sign problem in
the case of a real quark chemical potential. It also investigates the fate of
the correlation functions as computed in the CF model and conjectures a
specific behavior for the corresponding functions evaluated on the lattice, in
the case of the SU(2) gauge group.

framework for solving linear programming (LP) in time depending only on the
constraint matrix in the bit complexity model. In Tardos's framework, one
reduces solving the LP $\min \langle c,{x}\rangle$, $Ax=b$, $x \geq 0$, $A \in
\mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$, to solving $O(nm)$ LPs in $A$ having small integer
coefficient objectives and right-hand sides using any exact LP algorithm. This
gives rise to an LP algorithm in time poly$(n,m\log\Delta_A)$, where $\Delta_A$
is the largest subdeterminant of $A$. A significant extension to the real model
of computation was given by Vavasis and Ye (Math. Prog. '96), giving a
specialized interior point method that runs in time poly$(n,m,\log\bar\chi_A)$,
depending on Stewart's $\bar{\chi}_A$, a well-studied condition number.
  In this work, we extend Tardos's original framework to obtain such a running
time dependence. In particular, we replace the exact LP solves with approximate
ones, enabling us to directly leverage the tremendous recent algorithmic
progress for approximate linear programming. More precisely, we show that the
fundamental ""accuracy"" needed to exactly solve any LP in $A$ is inverse
polynomial in $n$ and $\log\bar{\chi}_A$. Plugging in the recent algorithm of
van den Brand (SODA '20), our method computes an optimal primal and dual
solution using ${O}(m n^{\omega+1} \log (n)\log(\bar{\chi}_A+n))$ arithmetic
operations, outperforming the specialized interior point method of Vavasis and
Ye and its recent improvement by Dadush et al (STOC '20).
  At a technical level, our framework combines together approximate LP
solutions to compute exact ones, making use of constructive proximity theorems
-- which bound the distance between solutions of ""nearby"" LPs -- to keep the
required accuracy low.

involves a variety of scales, one of them being the heavy quark mass. Even
though the mass of the heavy quarks plays a subdominant role during the high
virtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affect longitudinal drag and
diffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks. These emissions
partially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In
the lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the
transverse momenta of the partons, scattering and radiation processes off heavy
quarks differ from those off light quarks. All these factors result in a
different nuclear modification factor for heavy versus light flavors and thus
for heavy-flavor tagged jets.

medium are modeled on an event by event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework. We
present a multi-stage calculation that explores the differences between various
heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms within a realistically expanding quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). Inside the QGP, the highly virtual and energetic portion of the
shower is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models
the showers induced by energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quarks.
Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet
modification, proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach. The JETSCAPE
framework allows for transitions, on the level of individual partons, from one
energy-loss prescription to the other depending on the parton's energy and
virtuality and the local density. This allows us to explore the effect and
interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and
radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium.

time to incorporate an irreducible numerator. This is done in the context of
the so-called vacuum and propagator seagull diagrams, which have 3 and 2 loops,
respectively, and both have a single irreducible numerator. For this purpose,
an extended version of SFI (xSFI) is developed. For the seagull diagrams with
general masses, the SFI equation system is found to extend by two additional
equations. The first is a recursion equation in the numerator power, which has
an alternative form as a differential equation for the generating function. The
second equation applies only to the propagator seagull and does not involve the
numerator. We solve the equation system in two cases: over the singular locus
and in a certain 3 scale sector where we obtain novel closed-form evaluations

planets is mostly controlled by two factors: a slow dissipation of the
gravitational energy acquired at the formation (known as thermal evolution) and
atmospheric mass loss. Here, we use MESA to self-consistently couple the
thermal evolution model of lower atmospheres with a realistic hydrodynamical
atmospheric evaporation prescription. To outline the main features of such
coupling, we simulate planets with a range of core masses (5-20 Mearth) and
initial atmospheric mass fractions (0.5-30%), orbiting a solar-like star at 0.1
au. In addition to our computed evolutionary tracks, we also study the
stability of planetary atmospheres, showing that the atmospheres of light
planets can be completely removed within 1 Gyr, and that compact atmospheres
have a better survival rate. From a detailed comparison between our results and
the output of the previous-generation models, we show that coupling between
thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation considerably affects the thermal
state of atmospheres for low-mass planets and, consequently, changes the
relationship between atmospheric mass fraction and planetary parameters. We,
therefore, conclude that self-consistent consideration of the thermal evolution
and atmospheric evaporation is of crucial importance for evolutionary modeling
and a better characterization of planetary atmospheres. From our simulations,
we derive an analytical expression between the planetary radius and atmospheric
mass fraction at different ages. In particular, we find that, for a given
observed planetary radius, the predicted atmospheric mass fraction changes as
age^0.11.

Cyclic-skew-cyclic codes are characterized as left ideals of a suitable

and they are used to construct generator matrices of the corresponding codes.
The notion of defining set is introduced, using pairs of roots of skew
polynomials on top of poynomials. A lower bound (called sum-rank BCH bound) on
the minimum sum-rank distance is given for cyclic-skew-cyclic codes whose
defining set contains certain consecutive pairs. Sum-rank BCH codes, with
prescribed minimum sum-rank distance, are then defined as the largest
cyclic-skew-cyclic codes whose defining set contains such consecutive pairs.
The defining set of a sum-rank BCH code is described, and a lower bound on its

Gittins Index and tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) solved with linear

leading, from different perspectives, to estimators with a reduced variance
compared to conventional binning. They all make use of the force acting on the
particles, in addition to their position, and allow to focus on the non-trivial
part of the problem in order to alleviate (or even remove in some cases) the
catastrophic behaviour of histograms as the bin size decreases. The
corresponding computational cost is negligible for molecular dynamics
simulations, since the forces are already computed to generate the
configurations, and the benefit of reduced-variance estimators is even larger
when the cost of generating the latter is high, in particular with ab initio
simulations. The force sampling approach may result in spurious residual
non-zero values of the density in regions where no particles are present, but
strategies are available to mitigate this artefact. We illustrate this approach

parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares
across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag
period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of
estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates
of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the ""reproduction number"". We
illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 -

territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis
of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying
parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this,
an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not
suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model
enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including
construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the

decentralize the density filter such that each agent can estimate the global

This is achieved by noting that the global observation constructed by KDE is an
average of the local kernels. Hence, dynamic average consensus algorithms are
used for each agent to track the global observation in a distributed way. We

physics of CRs in clusters, combining of observations at various wavelengths is
particularly relevant. The exploitation of such data requires using a
self-consistent approach including both the thermal and the nonthermal

The multiwavelength observables are computed based on the relevant physical
process, according to the cluster location, and based on the sampling defined
by the user. We describe the implementation of MINOT and how to use it. We also
discuss the different assumptions and approximations that are involved and
provide various examples regarding the production of output products at

such a retrieval paradigm, an end user searches for unlabeled videos by ad-hoc
queries described exclusively in the form of a natural-language sentence, with
no visual example provided. Given videos as sequences of frames and queries as
sequences of words, an effective sequence-to-sequence cross-modal matching is
crucial. To that end, the two modalities need to be first encoded into
real-valued vectors and then projected into a common space. In this paper we
achieve this by proposing a dual deep encoding network that encodes videos and
queries into powerful dense representations of their own. Our novelty is
two-fold. First, different from prior art that resorts to a specific
single-level encoder, the proposed network performs multi-level encoding that
represents the rich content of both modalities in a coarse-to-fine fashion.
Second, different from a conventional common space learning algorithm which is
either concept based or latent space based, we introduce hybrid space learning
which combines the high performance of the latent space and the good
interpretability of the concept space. Dual encoding is conceptually simple,
practically effective and end-to-end trained with hybrid space learning.
Extensive experiments on four challenging video datasets show the viability of
the new method.

geolocation solutions rely on Voronoi tessellations and approximate cell

to consider more elaborate geolocation methods with partially overlapping

retailing contracts for end consumers -- among these markets, the renewable
energy community has gained momentum over the last few years. This paper
proposes a practical and readily to be adopted modelling solution for these
communities, one that allows their members to share the economic benefits
derived from them. The proposed solution relies on an \emph{ex-post} allocation
of the electricity that is generated within energy communities (i.e., local
electricity) based on the optimisation of \emph{repartition keys}. Repartition
keys are therefore optimally computed to represent the proportion of total
local electricity to be allocated to each community member, and aim to minimise
the sum of electricity bills of all community members. Since the optimisation
takes place \emph{ex-post} the repartition keys do not modify the actual
electricity flows, but rather the financial flows of the community members.
Then, the billing process of the community will take these keys into account to
correctly send the electricity bills to each member. Building on this concept,
we also introduce two additions to the basic algorithm to enhance the stability
of the community, which a global bill minimisation may fail to ensure (e.g.,

sensible automation processes. Due to the widespread use of these applications,
a robustness analysis of this family of algorithms against adversarial noise
has become imperative. To the best of our knowledge, however, only a few works
have currently addressed this problem. In an attempt to fill this gap, in this
work, we propose a black-box adversarial attack for crafting adversarial
samples to test the robustness of clustering algorithms. We formulate the
problem as a constrained minimization program, general in its structure and
customizable by the attacker according to her capability constraints. We do not
assume any information about the internal structure of the victim clustering
algorithm, and we allow the attacker to query it as a service only. In the
absence of any derivative information, we perform the optimization with a
custom approach inspired by the Abstract Genetic Algorithm (AGA). In the
experimental part, we demonstrate the sensibility of different single and
ensemble clustering algorithms against our crafted adversarial samples on
different scenarios. Furthermore, we perform a comparison of our algorithm with
a state-of-the-art approach showing that we are able to reach or even
outperform its performance. Finally, to highlight the general nature of the
generated noise, we show that our attacks are transferable even against
supervised algorithms such as SVMs, random forests, and neural networks.

for unification of gravitation, Yang-Mills fields, and fermions. Dynamical
variables are described by odd-grade (fermionic) and even-grade (bosonic)
Grassmann matrices. Evolution takes place in Connes time. At energies much
lower than Planck scale, trace dynamics reduces to quantum field theory. In the
present paper we explain that the correct understanding of spin requires us to
formulate the theory in 8-D octonionic space. The automorphisms of the octonion
algebra, which belong to the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$, replace
space-time diffeomorphisms and internal gauge transformations, bringing them
under a common unified fold. Building on earlier work by other researchers on
division algebras, we propose the Lorentz-weak unification at the Planck scale,
the symmetry group being the stabiliser group of the quaternions inside the
octonions. This is one of the two maximal subgroups of $G_2$, the other one
being $SU(3)$, the element preserver group of octonions. This latter group,
coupled with $U(1)_{em}$, describes the electro-colour symmetry, as shown
earlier by Furey. We predict a new massless spin one boson [the Lorentz boson]
which should be looked for in experiments. Our Lagrangian correctly describes
three fermion generations, through three copies of the group $G_2$, embedded in
the exceptional Lie group $F_4$. This is the unification group for the four
fundamental interactions, and it also happens to be the automorphism group of
the exceptional Jordan algebra. Gravitation is shown to be an emergent
classical phenomenon. Whereas at the Planck scale, there is present a quantised
version of the Lorentz symmetry, mediated by the Lorentz boson. We argue that
at sub-Planck scales, the self-adjoint part of the octonionic trace dynamics
bears a relationship with string theory in eleven dimensions.

eXplainable AI (XAI) due to their proposed computational psychological, and

difficult to define. Additionally generating plausible looking explanations

paper advances a novel method for generating plausible counterfactuals (and
semifactuals) for black box CNN classifiers doing computer vision. The present
method, called PlausIble Exceptionality-based Contrastive Explanations (PIECE),
modifies all exceptional features in a test image to be normal from the

an extensional flow is well-known to exhibit a ""coil-stretch"" transition, which
for sufficiently long chains can lead to bistability. The present work reports
computations indicating that an analogous ""compact-stretched"" transition arises
in the dynamics of a thin elastic sheet. Sheets of nominally circular, square
or rectangular shape are simulated in planar and biaxial flows using a finite
element method for the sheet conformations and a regularized Stokeslet method
for the fluid flow. If a neo-Hookean constitutive model is used for the sheet
elasticity, the sheets will stretch without bound once a critical extension
rate, as characterized nondimensionally by a capillary number, is exceeded.
Nonlinear elasticity, represented with the Yeoh model, arrests the stretching,
leading to a highly-stretched steady state once the critical capillary number
is exceeded. For all shapes and in both planar and biaxial extension, a
parameter regime exists in which both weakly stretched (compact) and strongly
stretched states can be found, depending on initial conditions. I.e. this
parameter regime displays bistability. As in the long-chain polymer case, the
bistable behavior arises from the hydrodynamic interaction between distant
elements of the sheet, and vanishes if these interactions are artificially
screened by use of a Brinkman model for the fluid motion. While the sheets can
transiently display wrinkled shapes, all final shapes in planar and biaxial
extension are planar.

algorithms only focus on simply-connected surfaces and cannot be directly
applied to surfaces with holes. In this work, we propose two novel algorithms
for computing the conformal parameterization of multiply-connected surfaces. We
first develop an efficient method for conformally parameterizing an open
surface with one hole to an annulus on the plane. Based on this method, we then
develop an efficient method for conformally parameterizing an open surface with
$k$ holes onto a unit disk with $k$ circular holes. The conformality and
bijectivity of the mappings are ensured by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical
experiments and applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods.

that odd order Lagrangians describe interactions analog to electromagnetism

this analogy, we formulate the concept of the generalized induction principle
assuming the coupling between the higher fields $U_{(n),\mu}(x),\ n\geq1$ and
the higher currents $j^{(n)\mu}=\rho(x)d^nx^{\mu}/ds^n$, where $\rho(x)$ is the
spatial density of mass ($n$ even) or of electric charge ($n$ odd). In short,
this article is an invitation to reflect on a generalization of the concept of

early days of the pandemic, it became clear that it is highly contagious and
that human mobility contributes significantly to its spread. In this paper, we
study the impact of population movement on the spread of COVID-19, and we
capitalize on recent advances in the field of representation learning on graphs
to capture the underlying dynamics. Specifically, we create a graph where nodes
correspond to a country's regions and the edge weights denote human mobility
from one region to another. Then, we employ graph neural networks to predict
the number of future cases, encoding the underlying diffusion patterns that
govern the spread into our learning model. Furthermore, to account for the
limited amount of training data, we capitalize on the pandemic's asynchronous
outbreaks across countries and use a model-agnostic meta-learning based method
to transfer knowledge from one country's model to another's. We compare the
proposed approach against simple baselines and more traditional forecasting
techniques in 3 European countries. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, highlighting the usefulness of GNNs in
epidemiological prediction. Transfer learning provides the best model,
highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy of the predictions in case
of secondary waves, if data from past/parallel outbreaks is utilized.

identify a small and optimal feature vector to build robust machine learning
models. In this study, we investigate feasibility of applying a random
projection algorithm to build an optimal feature vector from the initially
CAD-generated large feature pool and improve performance of machine learning
model. We assemble a retrospective dataset involving 1,487 cases of mammograms
in which 644 cases have confirmed malignant mass lesions and 843 have benign
lesions. A CAD scheme is first applied to segment mass regions and initially
compute 181 features. Then, support vector machine (SVM) models embedded with
several feature dimensionality reduction methods are built to predict
likelihood of lesions being malignant. All SVM models are trained and tested
using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method. SVM generates a likelihood
score of each segmented mass region depicting on one-view mammogram. By fusion
of two scores of the same mass depicting on two-view mammograms, a case-based
likelihood score is also evaluated. Comparing with the principle component
analyses, nonnegative matrix factorization, and Chi-squared methods, SVM
embedded with the random projection algorithm yielded a significantly higher
case-based lesion classification performance with the area under ROC curve of
0.84+0.01 (p<0.02). The study demonstrates that the random project algorithm is
a promising method to generate optimal feature vectors to help improve

groups the countries having similar demographic and socioeconomic aspects and
