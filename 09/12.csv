well-known as Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR) related to a cosmic
background field that plays the role of a variable vacuum energy density
associated to the temperature of the expanding universe with a cosmic inflation
in its early time and an accelerated expansion for its very far future time. In
this scenario, we show that the speed of light and an invariant minimum speed
present an explicit dependence on the background temperature of the expanding
universe. Although finding the speed of light in the early universe with very
high temperature and also in the very old one with very low temperature, being
respectively much larger and much smaller than its current value, our approach
does not violate the postulate of Special Relativity (SR), which claims the
speed of light is invariant in a kinematics point of view. Moreover, it is
shown that the high value of the speed of light in the early universe was
drastically decreased and increased respectively before the beginning of the
inflationary period. So we are led to conclude that the theory of Varying Speed
of Light (VSL) should be questioned as a possible solution of the horizon
problem for the hot universe.

Segment Detector (TP-LSD), to detect line segments in an image at real-time

relying on either heuristic post-process or extra classifier. To realize
one-step detection with a faster and more compact model, we introduce the
tri-points representation, converting the line segment detection to the
end-to-end prediction of a root-point and two endpoints for each line segment.
TP-LSD has two branches: tri-points extraction branch and line segmentation
branch. The former predicts the heat map of root-points and the two
displacement maps of endpoints. The latter segments the pixels on straight
lines out from background. Moreover, the line segmentation map is reused in the
first branch as structural prior. We propose an additional novel evaluation
metric and evaluate our method on Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets,
demonstrating not only the competitive accuracy compared to the most recent

301 dense cores using the CO and SiO emission lines, yielding a detection rate
of 14%. We discover 6 episodic molecular outflows associated with low- to
high-mass cores, indicating that episodic outflows (and therefore episodic
accretion) begin at extremely early stages of protostellar evolution for a
range of core masses. The time span between consecutive ejection events is much
smaller than those found in more evolved stages, which indicates that the
ejection episodicity timescale is likely not constant over time. The estimated
outflow dynamical timescale appears to increase with core masses, which likely
indicates that more massive cores have longer accretion timescales than less
massive cores. The lower accretion rates in these 70 $\mu \rm m$ dark objects
compared to the more evolved protostars indicate that the accretion rates
increase with time. The total outflow energy rate is smaller than the turbulent
energy dissipation rate, which suggests that outflow induced turbulence cannot
sustain the internal clump turbulence at the current epoch. We often detect
thermal SiO emission within these 70 $\mu \rm m$ dark clumps that is unrelated
to CO outflows. This SiO emission could be produced by collisions, intersection
flows, undetected protostars, or other motions.

loop momenta of a Feynman integral are integrated out using residue theorem,
resulting in a sum over tree-like structures. Originally, the LTD expression
exhibits cancellations of non-causal thresholds between summands, also known as
dual cancellations. As a result, the expression exhibits numerical
instabilities in the vicinity of non-causal thresholds and for large loop
momenta. In this work we derive a novel, generically applicable, Manifestly
Causal LTD (cLTD) representation whose only thresholds are causal thresholds,
i.e. it manifestly realizes dual cancellations. Consequently, this result also
serves as a general proof for dual cancellations. We show that LTD, cLTD, and
the expression stemming from Time Ordered Perturbation Theory (TOPT) are
locally equivalent. TOPT and cLTD both feature only causal threshold
singularities, however LTD features better scaling with the number of
propagators. On top of the new theoretical perspectives offered by our
representation, it has the useful property that the ultraviolet (UV) behaviour
of the original 4D integrand is maintained for every summand. We show that the
resulting LTD integrand expression is completely stable in the UV region which
is key for practical applications of LTD to the computation of amplitudes and
cross sections. We present explicit examples of the LTD expression for a
variety of up to four-loop integrals and show that its increased computational
complexity can be efficiently mitigated by optimising its numerical
implementation. Finally, we provide computer code that automatically generates
the LTD expression for an arbitrary topology.

communication systems. They are recently proven to bear asymmetric signatures;
and hence can be efficiently mitigated using improper Gaussian signaling (IGS),
thanks to its additional design degrees of freedom. Discrete asymmetric
signaling (AS) can practically realize the IGS by shaping the signals' geometry
or probability. In this paper, we adopt the probabilistic shaping (PS) instead
of uniform symbols to mitigate the impact of HWD and derive the optimal maximum
a posterior detector. Then, we design the symbols' probabilities to minimize
the error rate performance while accommodating the improper nature of HWD.
Although the design problem is a non-convex optimization problem, we simplified
it using successive convex programming and propose an iterative algorithm. We
further present a hybrid shaping (HS) design to gain the combined benefits of
both PS and geometric shaping (GS). Finally, extensive numerical results and
Monte-Carlo simulations highlight the superiority of the proposed PS over
conventional uniform constellation and GS. Both PS and HS achieve substantial
improvements over the traditional uniform constellation and GS with up to one

very deep problem with implications to the seemingly disparate fields of

While our theoretical understanding of these systems has progressed in recent
years, numerical approaches for studying these models remains severely limited.
In this paper, we discuss a special class of numerically tractable quantum
circuits, known as quantum automaton circuits, which may be particularly well
suited for this task. These are circuits which preserve the computational
basis, yet can produce highly entangled output wave functions. Using ideas from
quantum complexity theory, especially those concerning unitary designs, we
argue that automaton wave functions have high quantum state complexity. We look
at a wide variety of metrics, including measurements of the output bit-string
distribution and characterization of the generalized entanglement properties of
the quantum state, and find that automaton wave functions closely approximate
the behavior of fully Haar random states. In addition to this, we identify the
generalized out-of-time ordered 2k-point correlation functions as a
particularly useful probe of complexity in automaton circuits. Using these
correlators, we are able to numerically study the growth of complexity well
beyond the scrambling time for very large systems. As a result, we are able to
present evidence of a linear growth of design complexity in local quantum
circuits, consistent with conjectures from quantum information theory.

images, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As
the SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in
the transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In
contrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it
is possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM

advantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series
signals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the

a limited spectral density interval. Creating a single model using spectrogram

level from calculations with quark masses corresponding to $m_\pi\sim 800$ MeV,
extrapolated to the physical quark masses. This constraint is consistent with,
and significantly more precise than, determinations from global nuclear parton
distribution function fits. Including the lattice QCD determination of the
momentum fraction in the nNNPDF global fitting framework results in the
uncertainty on the isovector momentum fraction ratio being reduced by a factor
of 2.5, and thereby enables a more precise extraction of the $u$ and $d$ parton

states and correlations in iron-based superconductors. As this substitution
takes place outside the conducting Fe planes, the electronic behaviour is less
affected by the impurity scattering experimentally and relevant key electronic
parameters can be accessed. In this short review, I present the experimental
progress made in understanding the electronic behaviour of the nematic
electronic superconductors, FeSe1-xSx. A direct signature of the nematic
electronic state is in-plane anisotropic distortion of the Fermi surface
triggered by orbital ordering effects and electronic interactions that result
in multi-band shifts detected by ARPES. Upon sulphur substitution, the
electronic correlations and the Fermi velocities decrease in the tetragonal
phase. Quantum oscillations are observed for the whole series in ultra-high
magnetic fields and show a complex spectra due to the presence of many small
orbits. Effective masses associated to the largest orbit display non-divergent
behaviour at the nematic end point (x~0.175(5)), as opposed to critical
spin-fluctuations in other iron pnictides. Magnetotransport behaviour has a
strong deviation from the Fermi liquid behaviour and linear T resistivity is
detected at low temperatures inside the nematic phase, where scattering from
low energy spin-fluctuations are likely to be present. The superconductivity is
not enhanced in FeSe1-xSx and there are no divergent electronic correlations at
the nematic end point. These manifestations indicate a strong coupling with the
lattice in FeSe1-xSx and a pairing mechanism likely promoted by spin
fluctuations.

capable of mastering challenging games such as Go, chess, or shogi. In these
works the RL agent directly observes the natural state of the game and controls
that state directly with its actions. However, when humans play such games,
they do not just reason about the moves but also interact with their physical
environment. They understand the state of the game by looking at the physical
board in front of them and modify it by manipulating pieces using touch and
fine-grained motor control. Mastering complicated physical systems with
abstract goals is a central challenge for artificial intelligence, but it
remains out of reach for existing RL algorithms. To encourage progress towards
this goal we introduce a set of physically embedded planning problems and make
them publicly available. We embed challenging symbolic tasks (Sokoban,
tic-tac-toe, and Go) in a physics engine to produce a set of tasks that require
perception, reasoning, and motor control over long time horizons. Although
existing RL algorithms can tackle the symbolic versions of these tasks, we find
that they struggle to master even the simplest of their physically embedded
counterparts. As a first step towards characterizing the space of solution to
these tasks, we introduce a strong baseline that uses a pre-trained expert game
player to provide hints in the abstract space to an RL agent's policy while
training it on the full sensorimotor control task. The resulting agent solves
many of the tasks, underlining the need for methods that bridge the gap between
abstract planning and embodied control. See illustrating video at

behind and/or shooting ahead of them. These tails are believed to be made of
dusts that are carried upward by the supersonic flow escaping the planet's
gravity field from the fiercely heated permanent day-side. Conserving angular
momentum, this day-side escape flux would lead the planet in orbit. In order to
explain the trailing tails in observation, radiation pressure, a repulsive
force pushing the escape flow away from the host star is considered to be
necessary.
  We here investigate whether escape could occur on the night-side as the
escape flow is deflected by the pressure gradient force. We demonstrate in an
idealized framework that escape flux from the night-side could dominate that
from the day-side; and the former may naturally explain the commonly-observed
trailing tails based on angular momentum conservation, without the need to
invoke radiation pressure, which has previously been thought to be the key. We
also find analytical approximations for both dayside and nightside escape
fluxes, which may be applied to study planetary evolution of disintegrating

when given a query value $q$, and a connected subgraph $\pi$ of $G$, we can
find the predecessor of $q$ in all the sets associated with the vertices of
$\pi$. The fundamental result of fractional cascading is that there exists a
data structure that uses linear space and it can answer queries in $O(\log n +
|\pi|)$ time [Chazelle and Guibas, 1986]. While this technique has received
plenty of attention in the past decades, an almost quadratic space lower bound
for ""2D fractional cascading"" [Chazelle and Liu, 2001] has convinced the
researchers that fractional cascading is fundamentally a 1D technique.
  In 2D fractional cascading, the input includes a planar subdivision for every
vertex of $G$ and the query is a point $q$ and a subgraph $\pi$ and the goal is
to locate the cell containing $q$ in all the subdivisions associated with the
vertices of $\pi$. In this paper, we show that it is possible to circumvent the
lower bound of Chazelle and Liu for axis-aligned planar subdivisions. We
present a number of upper and lower bounds which reveal that in 2D, the problem
has a much richer structure. When $G$ is a tree and $\pi$ is a path, then
queries can be answered in
$O(\log{n}+|\pi|+\min\{|\pi|\sqrt{\log{n}},\alpha(n)\sqrt{|\pi|}\log{n}\})$
time using linear space where $\alpha$ is an inverse Ackermann function;
surprisingly, we show both branches of this bound are tight, up to the inverse
Ackermann factor. When $G$ is a general graph or when $\pi$ is a general
subgraph, then the query bound becomes $O(\log n + |\pi|\sqrt{\log n})$ and
this bound is once again tight in both cases.

transferring them from simpler, related implementations. Recent work in proof
assistants has shown that Voevodsky's univalence principle allows transferring
theorems between isomorphic types, but many instances of representation
independence in programming involve non-isomorphic representations.
  In this paper, we develop techniques for establishing internal relational
representation independence results in dependent type theory, by using higher
inductive types to simultaneously quotient two related implementation types by
a heterogeneous correspondence between them. The correspondence becomes an
isomorphism between the quotiented types, thereby allowing us to obtain an
equality of implementations by univalence. We illustrate our techniques by
considering applications to matrices, queues, and finite multisets. Our results
are all formalized in Cubical Agda, a recent extension of Agda which supports

including mergers, disc instabilities and quenched spirals. These processes are
expected to dominate in different environments, and thus leave characteristic
footprints in the kinematics and stellar populations of the individual
components within the galaxies. New techniques enable us to cleanly disentangle
the kinematics and stellar populations of these components in IFU observations.
In this paper, we use buddi to spectroscopically extract the light from the
bulge, disc and lens components within a sample of 8 S0 galaxies in extreme
environments observed with MUSE. While the spectra of bulges and discs in S0
galaxies have been separated before, this work is the first to isolate the
spectra of lenses. Stellar populations analysis revealed that the bulges and
lenses have generally similar or higher metallicities than the discs, and the
$\alpha$-enhancement of the bulges and discs are correlated, while those of the
lenses are completely unconnected to either component. We conclude that the
majority of the mass in these galaxies was built up early in the lifetime of
the galaxy, with the bulges and discs forming from the same material through
dissipational processes at high redshift. The lenses, on the other hand, formed
over independent timescales at more random times within the lifetime of the
galaxy, possibly from evolved bars. The younger stellar populations and
asymmetric features seen in the field S0s may indicate that these galaxies have
been affected more by minor mergers than the cluster galaxies.

and observed in holographic homogeneous lattice models. We follow the motion of
the quasinormal modes across the dynamical phase transition in models with
either periodic inhomogeneous or helical homogeneous spatial structures,
showing that the phase relaxation rate is continuous at the critical

broken phase is universal, insensitive to the precise pattern of translation
symmetry breaking, and therefore applies to homogeneous models as well.

second throughputs and low, milliseconds, latency has become a reality. This
level of performance will fuel numerous real-time applications, such as
autonomy and augmented reality, where the computationally heavy tasks can be
performed in the cloud. The increase in the bandwidth along with the use of
dense constellations places a significant burden on the speed and accuracy of
analog-to-digital converters (ADC). A popular approach to create wideband ADCs
is utilizing multiple channels each operating at a lower speed in the
time-interleaved fashion. However, an interleaved ADC comes with its own set of
challenges. The parallel architecture is very sensitive to the inter-channel
mismatch, timing jitter, clock skew between different ADC channels as well as
the nonlinearity within individual channels. Consequently, complex
post-calibration is required using digital signal processing (DSP) after the
ADC. The traditional DSP calibration consumes a significant amount of power and
its design requires knowledge of the source and type of errors which are
becoming increasingly difficult to predict in nanometer CMOS processes. In this
paper, instead of individually targeting each source of error, we utilize a
deep learning algorithm to learn the complete and complex ADC behavior and to
compensate for it in realtime. We demonstrate this ""Deep ADC"" technique on an
8G Sample/s 8-channel time-interleaved ADC with the QAM-OFDM modulated data.
Simulation results for different QAM symbol constellations and OFDM subcarriers
show dramatic improvements of approximately 5 bits in the dynamic range with a
concomitant drastic reduction in symbol error rate. We further discuss the
hardware implementation including latency, power consumption, memory
requirements, and chip area.

hypothesis at 6.5$\sigma$, the highest significance to date. This directly
translates into a measurement of the electron number density profile, and thus
of the gas density profile. Despite the limited signal to noise, the
measurement shows at high significance that the gas density profile is more
extended than the dark matter density profile, for any reasonable baryon
abundance (formally $>90\sigma$ for the cosmic baryon abundance). We
simultaneously measure the tSZ signal, i.e. the electron thermal pressure
profile of the same CMASS objects, and reject the no-tSZ hypothesis at

temperature to 20% precision in several aperture bins, and find it comparable

to constrain the gas thermodynamics and the properties of feedback inside
galaxy groups. We present the corresponding LOWZ measurements in this paper,

thermodynamic properties of the circumgalactic and intracluster medium (CGM and
ICM) of galaxies, groups, and clusters, since they are proportional,
respectively, to the integrated electron pressure and momentum along the
line-of-sight. We present constraints on the gas thermodynamics of CMASS
galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) using new
measurements of the kSZ and tSZ signals obtained in a companion paper.
Combining kSZ and tSZ measurements, we measure within our model the amplitude
of energy injection $\epsilon M_\star c^2$, where $M_\star$ is the stellar
mass, to be $\epsilon=(40\pm9)\times10^{-6}$, and the amplitude of the
non-thermal pressure profile to be $\alpha_{\rm Nth}<0.2$ (2$\sigma$),
indicating that less than 20% of the total pressure within the virial radius is
due to a non-thermal component. We estimate the effects of including baryons in
the modeling of weak-lensing galaxy cross-correlation measurements using the
best-fit density profile from the kSZ measurement. Our estimate reduces the
difference between the original theoretical model and the weak-lensing galaxy
cross-correlation measurements in arXiv:1611.08606 by half but does not fully
reconcile it. Comparing the tSZ measurements to cosmological simulations, we
find that simulations underestimate the CGM pressure at large radii while they
fare better in comparison with the kSZ measurements. This suggests that the
energy injected via feedback models in the simulations that we compared against
does not sufficiently heat the gas at these radii. We do not find significant
disagreement at smaller radii. These measurements provide novel tests of
current and future simulations. This work demonstrates the power of joint, high
signal-to-noise kSZ and tSZ observations, upon which future cross-correlation
studies will improve.

hyperbolic signal sets matched to groups by use of Whittaker's proposal in the
uniformization of hyperelliptic curves via Fuchsian differential equations
(FDEs). This systematic process consists of the steps: 1) Obtaining the genus,
g, by embedding a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) on a Riemann surface; 2)
Select a set of symmetric points in the Poincar\'e disk to establish the
hyperelliptic curve; 3) The Fuchsian group uniformizing region comes by the use
of the FDE; 4) Quotients of the FDE linearly independent solutions, give rise
to the generators of the associated Fuchsian group. Equivalently, this implies
the determination of the decision region (Voronoi region) of a digital signal.
Hence, the following results are achieved: 1) from the solutions of the FDE,
the Fuchsian group generators are established. Since the vertices of the
fundamental polygon are at the boundary of unit disk, its area (largest
possible) implies the least symbol error probability as a performance measure
of a digital communication system; 2) a relation between the parameters of the
tessellation {p,q} and the degree of the hyperelliptic curve is established.
Knowing g, related to the hyperelliptic curve degree, and p, number of sides of
the fundamental polygon derived from Whittaker's uniformizing procedure, the
value of q is obtained from the Euler characteristic leading to one of the
{4g,4g} or {4g+2, 2g+1} or {12g-6,3} tessellation. These tessellations are
important due to their rich geometric and algebraic structures, both required

relevant role played by the noise in the junction. While a moderate noise
contribution assists the generation of the thermoelectric signal, further
unveiling the spontaneous nature of the electron-hole symmetry breaking, a
large noise contribution can induce a switching between the two stationary
thermoelectric values, thus hardening the detection of the effect and its
application. We demonstrate that the thermoelectric effect is robust to the
presence of noise for a wide range of parameters and that the spurious
fluctuations of the thermoelectric signal can be lowered by increasing the
capacitance of the junction, for instance by expanding the junction's size. Our

data removal-enabled (DaRE) forests, a variant of random forests that enables
the removal of training data with minimal retraining. Model updates for each
DaRE tree in the forest are exact, meaning that removing instances from a DaRE
model yields exactly the same model as retraining from scratch on updated data.
  DaRE trees use randomness and caching to make data deletion efficient. The
upper levels of DaRE trees use random nodes, which choose split attributes and
thresholds uniformly at random. These nodes rarely require updates because they
only minimally depend on the data. At the lower levels, splits are chosen to
greedily optimize a split criterion such as Gini index or mutual information.
DaRE trees cache statistics at each node and training data at each leaf, so
that only the necessary subtrees are updated as data is removed. For numerical
attributes, greedy nodes optimize over a random subset of thresholds, so that
they can maintain statistics while approximating the optimal threshold. By
adjusting the number of thresholds considered for greedy nodes, and the number
of random nodes, DaRE trees can trade off between more accurate predictions and
more efficient updates.
  In experiments on 13 real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset, we find
DaRE forests delete data orders of magnitude faster than retraining from

property is enforced via the choice of the matrix-valued covariance function.
Based on earlier work on spline interpolation we observe derivatives of the
generating function of a canonical transformation. A product kernel produces an
accurate implicit method, whereas a sum kernel results in a fast explicit
method from this approach. Both correspond to a symplectic Euler method in
terms of numerical integration. These methods are applied to the pendulum and
the H\'enon-Heiles system and results compared to an symmetric regression with
orthogonal polynomials. In the limit of small mapping times, the Hamiltonian
function can be identified with a part of the generating function and thereby
learned from observed time-series data of the system's evolution. Besides
comparable performance of implicit kernel and spectral regression for
symplectic maps, we demonstrate a substantial increase in performance for
learning the Hamiltonian function compared to existing approaches.

antiferromagnets viable through five orders in perturbation theory. We then
specialize to the case of holes confined to one dimension in an otherwise
two-dimensional antiferromagnetic background, which can be realized via the
application of external fields in experiments, and prove ideal fracton

random distributions of problem instances with similar computational challenge.
It has been established that one could observe a computational phase transition
in a distribution produced from coherent Ising machine(s). In terms of quantum
approximate optimisation, the ability for the quantum algorithm to function
depends critically on the ratio of a problems constraint to variable ratio

of modern research in quantum science and engineering. Rooted in the
dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational
complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of
strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach
for tackling open quantum system dynamics. We simulate the dynamics of the
Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find
the steady-state via a variational formulation. We make use of a probabilistic
formulation of quantum physics based on a positive operator-valued measure
(POVM) in combination with autoregressive neural networks, which bring
significant algorithmic flexibility due to their efficient sampling and
tractable density. We introduce improved ansatzs, String States, which
partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive neural network and improve
the description of local correlations. We benchmark our approaches on
prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely
track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy in comparison to the
recently proposed approach based on restricted Boltzmann machines. We
anticipate this approach will be widely applicable to evolving density matrices
in various contexts.

satellites. Both interactions occur within $\sim$100 Myr of each other, and the
satellites both have masses 5 to 20 times smaller than that of their MW-like
host galaxy. Using the genetic modification process of \cite{Roth2016}, we
generate a set of four zoom-in, MW-mass galaxies all of which exhibit unique
star formation histories due to small changes to their assembly histories. In
two of these four cases, the galaxy is quenched by $z = 1$. Because these are
controlled modifications, we are able to isolate the effects of two
closely-spaced minor merger events, the relative timing of which determines
whether the MW-mass main galaxy quenches. This one-two punch works to: 1. fuel
the primary halo's supermassive black hole (SMBH) at its peak accretion rate;

mismatch parameter $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$, which is a measure of the stellar
mass-to-light ratio of an ensemble of stars and thus of the 'heaviness' of its

decrease outwards. We study the effect of dissipationless (dry) mergers on the
distribution of the IMF mismatch parameter $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ in ETGs using the
results of binary major and minor merging simulations. We find that dry mergers
tend to make the $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ profiles of ETGs shallower, but do not
alter significantly the shape of the distributions in the spatially resolved
$\sigma_{\rm los}\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ space. Individual galaxies undergoing dry
mergers tend to decrease their $\alpha_{\rm e}$, due to erosion of $\alpha_{\rm

$\sigma_{\rm e}$ can either decrease or increase, depending on the merging
orbital parameters and mass ratio, but tends to decrease for cosmologically
motivated merging histories. The $\alpha_{\rm e}$-$\sigma_{\rm e}$ relation can
vary with redshift as a consequence of the evolution of individual ETGs: based
on a simple dry-merging model, ETGs of given $\sigma_{\rm e}$ are expected to
have higher $\alpha_{\rm e}$ at higher redshift, unless the accreted satellites
are so diffuse that they contribute negligibly to the inner stellar

tight-binding model based on the magnetic unit cell, and exact diagonalization
on a finite two-dimensional lattice. The key signature of this topological

superconductors with rotation invariants to obtain the Majorana parity at
disclinations. Furthermore, we consider a 90-degree helimagnet domain wall,

  MRI-free Neuropathology","Accepted at MICCAI 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neuroimaging to neuropathology correlation (NTNC) promises to enable the
transfer of microscopic signatures of pathology to in vivo imaging with MRI,
ultimately enhancing clinical care. NTNC traditionally requires a volumetric
MRI scan, acquired either ex vivo or a short time prior to death.
Unfortunately, ex vivo MRI is difficult and costly, and recent premortem scans
of sufficient quality are seldom available. To bridge this gap, we present
methodology to 3D reconstruct and segment full brain image volumes from brain
dissection photographs, which are routinely acquired at many brain banks and
neuropathology departments. The 3D reconstruction is achieved via a joint
registration framework, which uses a reference volume other than MRI. This
volume may represent either the sample at hand (e.g., a surface 3D scan) or the
general population (a probabilistic atlas). In addition, we present a Bayesian
method to segment the 3D reconstructed photographic volumes into 36
neuroanatomical structures, which is robust to nonuniform brightness within and
across photographs. We evaluate our methods on a dataset with 24 brains, using
Dice scores and volume correlations. The results show that dissection
photography is a valid replacement for ex vivo MRI in many volumetric analyses,
opening an avenue for MRI-free NTNC, including retrospective data. The code is

illustrates the unsteady phenomena of the shock wave/boundary layer interaction

motions of the shock and breathing of the separation bubble, streamwise streaks
near the wall and arc-shaped vortices in the turbulent boundary layer
downstream of the separation bubble. A spectral analysis reveals that the
low-frequency behaviour of the system is related to the interaction between
shock wave and separated shear layer, while the medium-frequency motions are
associated with the shedding of shear layer vortices. Using a three-dimensional
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), we analyse the individual contributions of
selected modes to the unsteadiness of the shock and streamwise-elongated
vortices around the reattachment region. G\""ortler-like vortices, which are
induced by the centrifugal forces originating from the strong curvature of the
streamlines in the reattachment region, are strongly correlated with the
low-frequency unsteadiness in the current BFS case. Our DMD analysis and the
comparison with an identical but laminar case provide evidence that these

distributedly on various devices. Under this setting, users' devices perform
computations on their own data and then share the results with the cloud server
to update the global model. A fundamental issue in such systems is to
effectively incentivize user participation. The users suffer from privacy
leakage of their local data during the federated model training process.
Without well-designed incentives, self-interested users will be unwilling to
participate in federated learning tasks and contribute their private data. To
bridge this gap, in this paper, we adopt the game theory to design an effective
incentive mechanism, which selects users that are most likely to provide
reliable data and compensates for their costs of privacy leakage. We formulate
our problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game and solve the game's equilibrium.
Effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by extensive

positive spaces relevant for one-loop MHV amplitudes are characterized by
certain sign-flip conditions and are associated with surprisingly simple
logarithmic forms. In the maximal sign-flip case they are finite one-loop
octagons. Particular combinations of sign-flip spaces can be glued into new
local positive geometries. These correspond to local pentagon integrands that
appear in the local expansion of the MHV one-loop amplitude. We show that,
geometrically, these pentagons do \emph{not} triangulate the original
Amplituhedron space but rather its twin ""Amplituhedron-Prime."" This new
geometry has the same boundary structure as the Amplituhedron (and therefore
the same logarithmic form) but differs in the bulk as a geometric space. On
certain two-dimensional boundaries, where the Amplituhedron geometry reduces to
a polygon, we check that both spaces map to the same dual polygon.
Interestingly, we find that the pentagons internally triangulate that dual
space. This gives a direct evidence that the chiral pentagons are natural
building blocks for a yet-to-be discovered dual Amplituhedron.

Spitzer and Herschel. We use spectroscopy from Spitzer/IRS to obtain fluxes
from fine-structure lines that trace star formation and AGN activity. Utilizing
the SED modelling and fitting tool CIGALE, we derive the physical conditions of
the ISM, both in star-forming regions and in nuclear regions dominated by the
AGN in these galaxies. We investigate how the star formation rates (SFRs) and
the fractional AGN contributions ($f_{\rm{AGN}}$) depend on stellar mass,
galaxy type, and merger stage. We find that luminous galaxies more massive than
about $10^{10} \rm{M}_{*}$ are likely to deviate significantly from the
conventional galaxy main-sequence relation. Interestingly, infrared AGN
luminosity and stellar mass in this set of objects are much tighter than SFR
and stellar mass. We find that buried AGNs may occupy a locus between bright
starbursts and pure AGNs in the $f_{\rm{AGN}}$-[Ne V]/[Ne II] plane. We
identify a modest correlation between $f_{\rm{AGN}}$ and mergers in their later
stages.

generate unit test cases by learning from real-world focal methods and
developer-written testcases. We formulate unit test case generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning task, adopting a two-step training procedure
consisting of denoising pretraining on a large unsupervised Java corpus, and
supervised finetuning for a downstream translation task of generating unit
tests. We investigate the impact of natural language and source code
pretraining, as well as the focal context information surrounding the focal
method. Both techniques provide improvements in terms of validation loss, with
pretraining yielding 25% relative improvement and focal context providing
additional 11.1% improvement. We also introduce Methods2Test, the largest
publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and
corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 780K test cases mined from
91K open-source repositories from GitHub. We evaluate AthenaTest on five
defects4j projects, generating 25K passing test cases covering 43.7% of the
focal methods with only 30 attempts. We execute the test cases, collect test
coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite
and GPT-3, finding that our approach outperforms GPT-3 and has comparable
coverage w.r.t. EvoSuite. Finally, we survey professional developers on their
preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing
effectiveness of the generated tests, showing overwhelmingly preference towards
AthenaTest.

frequencies of ~0.2 fce (electron cyclotron frequency) are commonly observed at
1 AU, and are most consistent with the whistler heat flux fan instability. We
want to determine whether similar whistler-mode waves occur inside 0.2 AU, and
how their properties compare to those at 1 AU.
  METHODS: We utilize the waveform capture data from the Parker Solar Probe
Fields instrument to develop a data base of narrowband whistler waves. The
SWEAP instrument, in conjunction with the quasi-thermal noise measurement form
Fields, provides the electron heat flux, beta, and other electron parameters.
  RESULTS: Parker Solar Probe observations inside ~0.3 AU show that the waves
are more intermittent than at 1 AU, and are often interspersed with
electrostatic whistler/Bernstein waves at higher frequencies. This is likely
due to the more variable solar wind observed closer to the Sun. The whistlers
usually occur within regions when the magnetic field is more variable and often
with small increases in the solar wind speed. The near-sun whistler-mode waves
are also narrowband and large amplitude, and associated with beta greater than
1. Wave angles are sometimes highly oblique (near the resonance cone), but
angles have been determined for only a small fraction of the events. The
association with heat flux and beta is generally consistent with the whistler
fan instability although there are intervals where the heat flux is
significantly lower than the instability limit. Strong scattering of strahl
energy electrons is seen in association with the waves, providing evidence that
the waves regulate the electron heat flux..

facilitate how providers fulfill them. A recent web API model is GraphQL, which
is both a query language and a runtime. Using GraphQL, client queries express
the data they want to retrieve or mutate, and servers respond with exactly
those data or changes. GraphQL's expressiveness is risky for service providers
because clients can succinctly request stupendous amounts of data, and
responding to overly complex queries can be costly or disrupt service
availability. Recent empirical work has shown that many service providers are
at risk. Using traditional API management methods is not sufficient, and
practitioners lack principled means of estimating and measuring the cost of the
GraphQL queries they receive. In this work, we present a linear-time GraphQL
query analysis that can measure the cost of a query without executing it. Our
approach can be applied in a separate API management layer and used with
arbitrary GraphQL backends. In contrast to existing static approaches, our
analysis supports common GraphQL conventions that affect query cost, and our
analysis is provably correct based on our formal specification of GraphQL
semantics. We demonstrate the potential of our approach using a novel GraphQL
query-response corpus for two commercial GraphQL APIs. Our query analysis
consistently obtains upper cost bounds, tight enough relative to the true
response sizes to be actionable for service providers. In contrast, existing
static GraphQL query analyses exhibit over-estimates and under-estimates
because they fail to support GraphQL conventions.

often fail to account for the temporal richness of these data, even in cases
where domain knowledge suggests that the precise temporal patterns between

treated as uniform time series, where there is a sequence but no sense of exact
timing. At worst, rough aggregate features are computed over a pre-selected
window so that static sample-based approaches can be applied (e.g. number of
open lines of credit in the previous year or maximum credit utilization over

paradigm which advocates for building models that act directly on raw or

the locally negative nature of the Regge-Wheeler potential for $m=0$. However,
the growth rate $\Omega$ of tachyonic instabilities for $m^2<0$ gets
significantly reduced compared to the flat case for all parameter values of the

and acceleration in the studied bow shock crossings is accomplished by waves at
frequencies (1-10)$f_{cp}$ (proton gyrofrequency) for the bulk heating, and
$f>10f_{cp}$ for the tail acceleration. When electrons are not in the
stochastic heating regime, $|\chi_e|<1$, they undergo a quasi-adiabatic heating
process characterized by the isotropic temperature relation
$T/B=(T_0/B_0)(B_0/B)^{1/3}$. This is obtained when the energy gain from the
conservation of the magnetic moment is redistributed to the parallel energy

$k$-rank $\ell_2$ approximation $A_{k,2}$ of the matrix
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ that corresponds to a fully connected layer (or
embedding layer). Here, $d$ is the number of the neurons in the layer, $n$ is
the number in the next one, and $A_{k,2}$ can be stored in $O((n+d)k)$ memory

  This $\ell_2$-approximation minimizes the sum over every entry to the power
of $p=2$ in the matrix $A - A_{k,2}$, among every matrix
$A_{k,2}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ whose rank is $k$. While it can be computed

Regression, $\ell_1$-regularization, and $\ell_1$-SVM that use the
$\ell_1$-norm.
  This paper suggests to replace the $k$-rank $\ell_2$ approximation by
$\ell_p$, for $p\in [1,2]$. We then provide practical and provable
approximation algorithms to compute it for any $p\geq1$, based on modern
techniques in computational geometry.
  Extensive experimental results on the GLUE benchmark for compressing BERT,

our approach achieves $28\%$ compression of RoBERTa's embedding layer with only

In the regime where the cavity degrees of freedom can be adiabatically

collective linewidth exceeds the transit-time broadening. We analyze the case
where the atomic beam direction is slanted with respect to the cavity axis. For
this situation, we find that a phase of continuous light emission similar to
steady-state superradiance is established providing the tilt of the atomic beam
is sufficiently small. However, if the atoms travel more than half a wavelength
along the cavity axis during one transit time we predict a dynamical phase
transition to a new bistable superradiant regime. In this phase the atoms
undergo collective spontaneous emission with a frequency that can be either
blue or red detuned from the free-space atomic resonance. We analyze the
different superradiant regimes and the quantum critical crossover boundaries.
In particular we find the spectrum of the emitted light and show that the
linewidth exhibits features of a critical scaling close to the phase
boundaries.

methods have long been an important means to guide complex systems towards
optimal states. Despite their importance, there have been few attempts to
experimentally visualize the microscopic dynamics that occur during annealing.
Here, we present an experimental system that enables the study of interacting
many-body dynamics by exploiting the physics of multi-droplet evaporation on a
prescribed lattice network. Ensembles of motile binary droplets are seeded into
a hexagonal lattice template where interactions are mediated through the vapor
phase and can be manipulated through the application of a global gravitational
field. We show that for finite systems (61 droplets) the interacting droplets
have an effective long-ranged interaction that results in the formation of
frustrated, metastable states. Application of a periodic, global gravitational
field can drive the system through a non-equilibrium phase transition
separating phase-locked synchronization from interaction-dominated behavior.
Finally, we directly visualize field-driven annealing that leads to terminal
states that are less frustrated. Overall, our results represent a new platform
for studying many-body physics with long-ranged interactions, enabling the
design of field-based control strategies for programming the self-assembly of

parallel to the external particle drive. If the hopping rates at the interfaces
satisfy particle-hole symmetry, the current difference across them generates a
vector flow diagram akin to a vortex sheet. We have studied the finite-size
scaling of the particle density fluctuations in both temperature regions, and
observed that it is controlled by the respective temperature values. If the
colder subsystem is maintained at the KLS critical temperature, while the
hotter subsystem's temperature is set much higher, the interface current
greatly suppresses particle exchange between the two regions. As a result of
the ensuing effective subsystem decoupling, strong fluctuations persist in the
critical region, whence the particle density fluctuations scale with the KLS
critical exponents. However, if both temperatures are set well above the
critical temperature, the particle density fluctuations scale according to the
totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP). We have also measured the entropy
production rate in both subsystems; it displays intriguing algebraic decay in
the critical region, while it saturates quickly at a small but non-zero level
in the hotter region. We have also considered another possible choice of the
hopping rates across the temperature interfaces that explicitly breaks
particle-hole symmetry. In that case the boundary rates induce a net particle
flux across the interfaces that displays power-law behavior, until ultimately
the particle exclusion constraints generate a clogging transition to an inert

structure of neural network-based controllers such that they guarantee system
stability by construction, through the use of a Lyapunov function. A recurrent
neural network architecture is used to efficiently train the controllers. The
resulting controllers only use local information and outperform optimal linear
droop as well as other state-of-the-art learning approaches.

the suppression of the high transverse momentum (transverse to the beam

the first unquenched lattice QCD calculation of $\hat{q}$. The calculation is
carried out using (2+1)-flavor of quarks, using the highly improved staggered
quark action (HISQ) and tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action. The
calculation is performed in a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 200 MeV
$<T<$ 800 MeV using MILC code package. We considered a leading-order process
where a hard parton scatters off the glue field of a thermal QCD medium by
exchanging a Glauber gluon (whose transverse momentum is larger than its
longitudinal components). The hard scale associated with the jet parton allows
the coupling of the gluon to that parton to be treated in perturbation theory.
The coupling of the gluon to the medium is treated non-perturbatively. This
non-perturbative part is expressed in terms of a non-local (two-point)
field-strength-field-strength operator product which can be Taylor expanded
after analytic continuation to the deep Euclidean region. Such an expansion
allows us to write $\hat{q}$ in terms of a series of local operators, which are
suppressed by factors of the hard parton energy. The calculated $\hat{q}$ and
its temperature dependence demonstrates reasonable agreement with the
phenomenological extraction carried out by the JET collaboration.

While recent continual learning methods are capable of alleviating the

mask-based learning method (e.g. piggyback \cite{mallya2018piggyback}) is
proposed to address these issues by learning only a binary element-wise mask in
a fast manner, while keeping the backbone model fixed. However, the binary mask
has limited modeling capacity for new tasks. A more recent work
\cite{hung2019compacting} proposes a compress-grow-based method (CPG) to
achieve better accuracy for new tasks by partially training backbone model, but
with order-higher training cost, which makes it infeasible to be deployed into

systems that uses mention pair method. With deep neural network, it can learn
hidden and deep relations between two mentions. However, there is no work on
coreference resolution for Indonesian text that uses this learning technique.
The state-of-the-art system for Indonesian text only states the use of lexical
and syntactic features can improve the existing coreference resolution system.
In this paper, we propose a new coreference resolution system for Indonesian
text with mention pair method that uses deep neural network to learn the
relations of the two mentions. In addition to lexical and syntactic features,
in order to learn the representation of the mentions words and context, we use
word embeddings and feed them to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Furthermore, we do singleton exclusion using singleton classifier component to
prevent singleton mentions entering any entity clusters at the end. Achieving
67.37% without singleton exclusion, 63.27% with trained singleton classifier,
and 75.95% with gold singleton classifier on CoNLL average F1 score, our
proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art system.

of their corresponding plaintexts. However, OPEs are vulnerable to inference

has become the de-facto standard for achieving data privacy. One of the most
attractive properties of DP is that any post-processing (inferential)
computation performed on the noisy output of a DP algorithm does not degrade
its privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private
order preserving encryption scheme, OP$\epsilon$. Under OP$\epsilon$, the
leakage of order from the ciphertexts is differentially private. As a result,
in the least, OP$\epsilon$ ensures a formal guarantee (specifically, a relaxed
DP guarantee) even in the face of inference attacks. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to combine DP with a property-preserving
encryption scheme. We demonstrate OP$\epsilon$'s practical utility in answering
range queries via extensive empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets.
For instance, OP$\epsilon$ misses only around $4$ in every $10K$ correct
records on average for a dataset of size $\sim732K$ with an attribute of domain

virtualized environment such as containers on a nearby edge server, can
significantly reduce processing time and hence end-to-end (E2E) delay. However,
when users are mobile, such containers need to be migrated to other edge
servers located closer to the MUs to keep the E2E delay low. Meanwhile, the
mobility of MUs necessitates handover among base stations in order to keep the
wireless connections between MUs and base stations uninterrupted. In this
paper, we address the joint problem of container migration and base-station
handover by proposing a coordinated migration-handover mechanism, with the
objective of achieving low E2E delay and minimizing service interruption. The
mechanism determines the optimal destinations and time for migration and
handover in a coordinated manner, along with a delta checkpoint technique that
we propose. We implement a testbed edge computing system with our proposed
coordinated migration-handover mechanism, and evaluate the performance using
real-world applications implemented with Docker container (an
industry-standard). The results demonstrate that our mechanism achieves 30%-40%
lower service downtime and 13%-22% lower E2E delay as compared to other
mechanisms. Our work is instrumental in offering smooth user experience in

full access to the underlying distribution from previous studies , and propose
sample-based estimations with theoretical guarantees. Third, along with the
population-level membership privacy risk estimation via the optimal membership
advantage, we offer the individual-level estimation via the individual privacy
risk. Fourth, our framework allows adversaries to access the trained model via
a customized query, while prior works require specific attributes.

information theory measuring the rate of growth of independent sets in graph
powers. Despite being well-studied, this quantity continues to hold several
mysteries. Lov\'asz famously proved that the Shannon capacity of $C_5$ (the
5-cycle) is at most $\sqrt{5}$ via his theta function. This bound is achieved
by a simple linear code over $\mathbb{F}_5$ mapping $x \mapsto 2x$. This
motivates the notion of linear Shannon capacity of graphs, which is the largest
rate achievable when restricting oneself to linear codes. We give a simple
proof based on the polynomial method that the linear Shannon capacity of $C_5$
is $\sqrt{5}$. Our method applies more generally to Cayley graphs over the
additive group of finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, giving an upper bound on the
linear Shannon capacity. We compare this bound to the Lov\'asz theta function,
showing that they match for self-complementary Cayley graphs (such as $C_5$),
and that the bound is smaller in some cases. We also exhibit a quadratic gap
between linear and general Shannon capacity for some graphs.

is the output layer of the network: Softmax vs conditional random field (CRF).
The second is the usage of part of speech (POS) tag embedding input layer.

north-south direction and 22 HII regions in the east-west direction and a
background galaxy, NGC 1232B, for which we present the first redshift
measurement and spectral analysis. We used the stellar population fitting
technique to study the underlying stellar population and to subtract it from
the spectra to measure the emission lines. The emission lines were used to
determine the extinction, electron density, chemical abundance, and the
star-formation rate gradient of NGC 1232. As is common in spiral galaxies, we
found a stellar population gradient with older populations at the central
regions and younger ones towards the outskirts, along with a negative oxygen
abundance gradient of -0.16 dex/re. Due to the difficulty of measuring
important emission lines, the number of objects for the abundance gradient is
small, but there is a hint that this galaxy has a broken gradient profile, with
a drop towards the center. If the collision caused any disturbance in the
galaxy, we believe it would be small and hard to detect with a limited number
of objects. From all the other measurements, we found no deviations from a
typical spiral galaxy and no significant difference between different
directions in the galaxy. The stellar population and emission line analysis of

problems in QCD. In this paper, we calculate quark condensation analytically in
a holographic QCD model dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) system
coupled to a probe scalar field. We find that the black hole phase transition
in the EMD system seriously affects $\chi_{SB}$. At small chemical potential,
$\chi_{SB}$ behaves as a crossover. For large chemical potential $\mu>\mu_c$,
$\chi_{SB}$ becomes first order with exactly the same transition temperature as
the black hole phase transition by a bypass mechanism. The phase diagram we
obtained is qualitatively consistent with the recent results from lattice QCD
simulations and NJL models.

synthesized so far has higher Hmacro and/or Hmicro than that of the predicted

Hf3PB4 is mechanically stable. The extraordinarily high values of elastic
moduli and hardness parameters are explained with the use of density of states
(DOS) and charge density mapping (CDM). The high stiffness of Hf3PB4 arises
because of the additional B atoms which results in the strong B B covalent
bonds in the crystal. The band structure and DOS calculations are used to
confirm the metallic properties with dominant contribution from the Hf-5d
states to the electronic states around the Fermi level. The technologically
important thermal parameters such Debye temperature, minimum thermal

The photometry used in the fitting includes $\rm u_{SC}$ and $\rm v_{SAGE}$

oscillator called parametron or Kerr parametric oscillator shows
self-oscillation. Quantum annealing and universal quantum computation using

parametrons under the pump field are degraded by unwanted rapidly oscillating
terms in the Hamiltonian, which we call non-resonant rapidly oscillating terms
(NROTs) coming from the violation of the rotating wave approximation.
Therefore, the pump field can be an intrinsic origin of the imperfection of
controls of parametrons. Here, we theoretically study the influence of the
NROTs on the accuracy of controls of a parametron: a cat-state creation and a
single-qubit gate. It is shown that there is a trade-off relationship between
the suppression of the nonadiabatic transitions and the validity of the
rotating wave approximation in a conventional approach. We also show that the
tailored time dependence of the detuning of the pump field can suppress both of
the nonadiabatic transitions and the disturbance of the state of the parametron

and vehicle-infrastructure communication via the sidelink interface using the
managed and the unmanaged mode of Cellular V2X (mode 3 and 4, respectively).
The simulator also implements advanced features of 5G mobile networks, such as
variable numerologies. For the transmission of of V2X messages, it adds a
non-IP interface. Artery-C integrates seamlessly into the simulation framework
Artery, which enables the simulation of standardized V2X messages at the
facilities layer as well as the coupling to the mobility simulator SUMO. A

success of the protocol also makes clear how it can fail: biasing the energy
landscape towards a state only helps in finding the ground state if the Hamming
distance from the ground state and the energy of the biased state are
correlated. We present examples where biasing towards low energy states that

flow under the influence of Coriolis force, where the traveling speeds lie
outside the range of the flow $u$. Under the $\beta$-plane approximation, if
the flow $u$ has a critical point at which $u$ attains its minimal (resp.
maximal) value, then a unique transitional $\beta$ value exists in the positive
(resp. negative) half-line such that the number of traveling wave families near
the shear flow changes suddenly from finite to infinite when $\beta$ passes
through it. On the other hand, if $u$ has no such critical points, then the
number is always finite for positive (resp. negative) $\beta$ values. This is
true for general shear flows under mildly technical assumptions, and for a
large class of shear flows including a cosine jet $u(y) = {1+\cos(\pi y)\over
2}$ (i.e. the sinus profile) and analytic monotone flows unconditionally. The
sudden change of the number of traveling wave families indicates that long time

impact of increasing penetration of photovoltaics on the distribution system.
Most existing impact assessment studies are scenario-based where derived
results are scenario specific and not generalizable. Moreover, stochasticity in
the temporal behavior of spatially distributed PVs requires a large number of
scenarios that increase with the size of the network and the level of
penetration. Therefore, we propose a new computationally efficient analytical
framework of voltage sensitivity analysis that allows for stochastic analysis
of voltage change due to random changes in PV generation. We first derive an
analytical approximation for voltage change at any node of the network due to
change in power at other nodes in an unbalanced distribution network. The
quality of this approximation is reinforced via bounds on the approximation
error. Then, we derive the probability distribution of voltage change at a
certain node due to random changes in power injections/consumptions at multiple
locations of the network. The accuracy of the proposed PVSA is illustrated
using a modified version of the IEEE 37 bus test system. The proposed PVSA can
serve as a powerful tool for proactive monitoring/control and ease the
computational burden associated with perturbation based cybersecurity
mechanisms.

the capacitated single-item lot sizing problem with backordering under demand
uncertainty, modeled by uncertain cumulative demands. The well-known interval
budgeted uncertainty representation is assumed. Two of its variants are
considered. The first one is the discrete budgeted uncertainty, in which at
most a specified number of cumulative demands can deviate from their nominal
values at the same time.The second variant is the continuous budgeted
uncertainty, in which the sum of the deviations of cumulative demands from
their nominal values, at the same time, is at most a bound on the total
deviation provided. For both cases, in order to choose a production plan that
hedges against the cumulative demand uncertainty, the robust minmax criterion
is used. Polynomial algorithms for evaluating the impact of uncertainty in the
demand on a given production plan in terms of its cost, called the adversarial
problem, and for finding robust production plans under the discrete budgeted
uncertainty are constructed. Hence, in this case, the problems under
consideration are not much computationally harder than their deterministic
counterparts. For the continuous budgeted uncertainty, it is shown that the
adversarial problem and the problem of computing a robust production plan along
with its worst-case cost are NP-hard. In the case, when uncertainty intervals
are non-overlapping, they can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and admit
fully polynomial timeapproximation schemes. In the general case, a
decomposition algorithm for finding a robust plan is proposed.

predicate-argument structure of a sentence. Previous studies in terms of
traditional models have shown syntactic information can make remarkable
contributions to SRL performance; however, the necessity of syntactic
information was challenged by a few recent neural SRL studies that demonstrate
impressive performance without syntactic backbones and suggest that syntax
information becomes much less important for neural semantic role labeling,
especially when paired with recent deep neural network and large-scale
pre-trained language models. Despite this notion, the neural SRL field still
lacks a systematic and full investigation on the relevance of syntactic
information in SRL, for both dependency and both monolingual and multilingual
settings. This paper intends to quantify the importance of syntactic
information for neural SRL in the deep learning framework. We introduce three
typical SRL frameworks (baselines), sequence-based, tree-based, and
graph-based, which are accompanied by two categories of exploiting syntactic
information: syntax pruning-based and syntax feature-based. Experiments are
conducted on the CoNLL-2005, 2009, and 2012 benchmarks for all languages

syntactic information under certain conditions. Furthermore, we show the
quantitative significance of syntax to neural SRL models together with a

models and object detection models. For the evaluation of the deep learning
models we used a cross-site evaluation approach: the deep learning models where
trained in one geographical area and then evaluated on a different geographical
area, previously unseen by the algorithm. The cross-site evaluation was
furthermore carried out twice: deep learning models trained on he Netherlands
were evaluated on Germany and vice versa. While the deep learning models were
able to detect solar panels successfully, false detection remained a problem.
Moreover, model performance decreased dramatically when evaluated in a
cross-border fashion. Hence, training a model that performs reliably across
different countries in the European Union is a challenging task. That being
said, the models detected quite a share of solar panels not present in current
solar panel registers and therefore can already be used as-is to help reduced
manual labor in checking these registers.

methods is to factorize aggregated posterior by penalizing the total

has a blind spot: there is a disparity between the sampled latent

provide a theoretical explanation that low total correlation of sampled

distributions, the mean representation with arbitrarily high total correlation
can have a corresponding sampled representation with bounded total correlation.
We also propose a method to eliminate this disparity. Experiments show that our

a factorized mean representation. Moreover, we offer a detailed explanation of
the limitations of factorizing aggregated posterior: factor disintegration. Our

Ferrimagnetic properties are observed at $6.5 < n < 8.5$. At the same time, the

antiferromagnetic interaction between the magnetic sublattice of itinerant
electron ferromagnetism at supercage clusters and that of localized moments at
beta-cage clusters. The electrical resistivity in ferrimagnetic samples at $n =

cluster. Clustering the nodes of an attributed graph, in which each node is
associated with a set of feature attributes, has attracted significant
attention. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) represent an effective approach
for integrating the two complementary factors of node attributes and structural
information for attributed graph clustering. However, oversmoothing of GCNs
produces indistinguishable representations of nodes, such that the nodes in a
graph tend to be grouped into fewer clusters, and poses a challenge due to the
resulting performance drop. In this study, we propose a smoothness sensor for
attributed graph clustering based on adaptive smoothness-transition graph
convolutions, which senses the smoothness of a graph and adaptively terminates
the current convolution once the smoothness is saturated to prevent
oversmoothing. Furthermore, as an alternative to graph-level smoothness, a
novel fine-gained node-wise level assessment of smoothness is proposed, in
which smoothness is computed in accordance with the neighborhood conditions of
a given node at a certain order of graph convolution. In addition, a
self-supervision criterion is designed considering both the tightness within
clusters and the separation between clusters to guide the whole neural network
training process. Experiments show that the proposed methods significantly
outperform 12 other state-of-the-art baselines in terms of three different
metrics across four benchmark datasets. In addition, an extensive study reveals
the reasons for their effectiveness and efficiency.

terms of the viral wave number $k_v=2\pi/\lambda_v$ corresponding to a
structure with a viral radius $r_v=\lambda_v/2$, half the size of the free
streaming scale radius $r_v=r_{fs}/2=\lambda_{fs}/4$. The virial mass $M_v$
contained in this structure corresponds to the lightest structure formed for a
WDM particle becoming non-relativistic at the scale factor $a_{nr}$ with the
corresponding $\lambda_{fs}$. The viral transfer function $T_v(a,k)=[1+
\left(k/k_v \right)^{\beta_v }]^{\gamma_v}$ is given in terms of the viral mode
$k_v$ and two constant parameters $\beta_v$ and $\gamma_v$. We compare
$T_v(a,k)$ with the Boltzmann code CLASS for WDM in the mass range 1-10 keV and
we obtain the constraint $\beta_v\gamma_v=-18$ with $\nu=1.020 \pm 0.025$. In
the standard approach the transfer function is given by
$T(a,k)=[1+\left(\alpha\, k \right)^{\beta}]^{\gamma}$ \cite{Viel:2005qj} where
$\alpha$ encodes the dynamical properties of WDM and must be numerically
adjusted by means of a Boltzmann code. In contrast, in our viral approach the
physical quantity $k_v$ is simply given in terms of the free streaming scale
$\lambda_{fs}$ and can be analytically determined. Our viral proposal has a
good agreement with CLASS and improves slightly the results from the standard
transfer function. To conclude, we have proposed a new physically motivated
transfer function $T_v(a,k)$ where the properties of WDM are encoded in the
viral wave number $k_v$, is straightforward to determine and improves the
prediction of WDM clustering properties.

cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French
population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using
Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August
was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning
of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously
infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce
that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate
(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%
and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on
the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,
Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations
are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45
(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which
occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated
incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks
induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An
incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total
number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000
respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed
close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual
immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of
October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously
thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.

we employ a conditional GAN (cGAN), where the generative model is trained by
conditioning the shape of the generated object. Moreover, in addition to RGB

four channel multi-spectral synthetic images. Quantitative experiments, carried

procedure for the identification of many respiratory diseases compared to MRI,

networks (GAN) to perform the task of lung segmentation on a given CXR. GANs
are popular to generate realistic data by learning the mapping from one domain
to another. In our work, the generator of the GAN is trained to generate a
segmented mask of a given input CXR. The discriminator distinguishes between a
ground truth and the generated mask, and updates the generator through the
adversarial loss measure. The objective is to generate masks for the input CXR,
which are as realistic as possible compared to the ground truth masks. The
model is trained and evaluated using four different discriminators referred to
as D1, D2, D3, and D4, respectively. Experimental results on three different
CXR datasets reveal that the proposed model is able to achieve a dice-score of
0.9740, and IOU score of 0.943, which are better than other reported
state-of-the art results.

distributed energy resources (DERs). As a result, the real-time efficient and
secure operation of distribution grids becomes a paramount problem. While
installing smart sensors and enhancing communication infrastructure improves
grid observability, it is computationally impossible for the distribution
system operator (DSO) to optimize setpoints of millions of DER units. This
paper proposes communication-free and model-free algorithms that can actively
control converter-connected devices, and can operate either as stand-alone or
in combination with centralized optimization algorithms. We address the problem
of loss minimization in distribution grids, and we analytically prove that our
proposed algorithms reduce the total grid losses without any prior information
about the network, requiring no communication, and based only on local
measurements. Going a step further, we combine our proposed local algorithms
with a central optimization of a very limited number of converters. The hybrid
approaches we propose have much lower communication and computation requirement
than traditional methods, while they also provide performance guarantees in
case of communication failure. We demonstrate our algorithms in four networks
of varying sizes: a 5-bus network, an IEEE 141-bus system, a real Danish

drifting QPPs are new and the most interesting, especially a bi-directional QPP
at the time of the hard X-ray and $\gamma$-ray peaks, and a sunquake start. In
the pre-impulsive phase we show an unusual drifting pulsation structure (DPS)
in association with the EUV brightenings caused by the interaction of magnetic
ropes. In the flare impulsive phase we found an exceptional radio burst
drifting from 5000 MHz to 800 MHz. In connection with this drifting burst, we
show a U-burst at about the onset time of an EUV writhed structure and a
drifting radio burst as a signature of a shock wave at high frequencies

additional energy-release process located at higher altitudes in the solar
atmosphere. These phenomena are interpreted considering a rising magnetic rope,
magnetosonic waves and particle beams. Using a density model we estimated the

capture, especially in contrast with the image representation learning, is the
object motion. However, we found that in the current mainstream video datasets,
some action categories are highly related with the scene where the action
happens, making the model tend to degrade to a solution where only the scene
information is encoded. For example, a trained model may predict a video as
playing football simply because it sees the field, neglecting that the subject
is dancing as a cheerleader on the field. This is against our original
intention towards the video representation learning and may bring scene bias on
different dataset that can not be ignored. In order to tackle this problem, we
propose to decouple the scene and the motion (DSM) with two simple operations,
so that the model attention towards the motion information is better paid.
Specifically, we construct a positive clip and a negative clip for each video.
Compared to the original video, the positive/negative is
motion-untouched/broken but scene-broken/untouched by Spatial Local Disturbance
and Temporal Local Disturbance. Our objective is to pull the positive closer
while pushing the negative farther to the original clip in the latent space. In
this way, the impact of the scene is weakened while the temporal sensitivity of
the network is further enhanced. We conduct experiments on two tasks with

surpass the SOTA methods with a remarkable 8.1% and 8.8% improvement towards

semiconductors, offers a way to break the Shockley-Queisser limit in
single-bandgap photovoltaics (PV). If the triplet excitons generated by SF can
be transferred to inorganic quantum dots (QDs), where they radiatively
recombine, SF based photon multiplication is achieved, converting a single
high-energy photon into two low-energy photons. Such a SF photon multiplication
film (SF-PMF) could raise the efficiency of the best Si-PV from 26.7% to 32.5%.
But a precise nanoscale morphology is required within such a film consisting of
the appropriate morphology for the organic phase, allowing for efficient SF,
within which the QD emitters are well dispersed on a tens of nm length scale to
enable efficient harvesting of the triplets. However, it has been a
long-standing problem that the individual components in organic-QD blends have
a tendency to aggregate and phase separate, due to a mismatch of their size,
shape and surface energies. Here, we demonstrate a QD surface engineering
approach using an electronically active, highly soluble semiconductor ligand
that is matched to the SF material, which allows us to direct the self-assembly
process yielding solution processed films with well-dispersed QDs and minimal
aggregation, as characterised by X-ray and neutron scattering and electron
microscopy. Steady state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy show that the
films support efficient SF (190% yield) in the organic phase and quantitative
triplet energy transfer across the organic-QD interface, resulting in 95% of
the triplet excitons being harvested by the QDs. Our results establish the
SF-PMF as a highly promising architecture to harness the SF process to enhance
PV efficiencies, and also provide a highly versatile approach to overcome
challenges in the blending of organic semiconductors with QDs.

dissolution mechanism is proposed, involving an initial stage where
diffusion-controlled formation of a conversion layer occurs. Once the
conversion layer is stabilised, layer dissolution reactions become
rate-limiting. Under this mechanism the transition time is sensitive to the

over heterogeneous networks such as a local area network within a multi-tenant

these heterogeneous networks, the link speeds among worker nodes vary
significantly, making it challenging for state-of-the-art machine learning
approaches to perform efficient training. Both centralized and decentralized
training approaches suffer from low-speed links. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized approach, namely NetMax, that enables worker nodes to communicate
via high-speed links and, thus, significantly speed up the training process.
NetMax possesses the following novel features. First, it consists of a novel
consensus algorithm that allows worker nodes to train model copies on their
local dataset asynchronously and exchange information via peer-to-peer
communication to synchronize their local copies, instead of a central master
node (i.e., parameter server). Second, each worker node selects one peer
randomly with a fine-tuned probability to exchange information per iteration.
In particular, peers with high-speed links are selected with high probability.
Third, the probabilities of selecting peers are designed to minimize the total
convergence time. Moreover, we mathematically prove the convergence of NetMax.
We evaluate NetMax on heterogeneous cluster networks and show that it achieves
speedups of 3.7X, 3.4X, and 1.9X in comparison with the state-of-the-art

hamper device therapies. These include low toughness and strength compared with
metals used for this purpose, and slow degradation. Blending PLLA with novel
polyethylene glycol functionalised
poly(L-lactide-co-$\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PLCL-PEG) materials has been
investigated here to tailor the mechanical properties and degradation behaviour
of PLLA. This exciting approach provides a foundation for a next generation of
bioresorbable materials whose properties can be rapidly tuned. The degradation
of PLLA was significantly accelerated by addition of PLCL-PEG. After 30 days of
degradation, several structural changes were observed in the polymer blends,
which were dependent on the level of PLCL-PEG addition. Blends with low
PLCL-PEG content displayed enthalpy relaxation, resulting in embrittlement,
while blends with high PLCL-PEG content displayed crystallisation, due to
enhanced chain mobility brought on by chain scission, also causing
embrittlement. Moderate PLCL-PEG additions (10% PLCL(70:30)-PEG and 20 - 30%
PLCL(80:20)-PEG) stabilised the structure, reducing the extent of enthalpy
relaxation and crystallisation and thus retaining ductility. Compositional
optimisation identified a sweet spot for this blend strategy, whereby the
ductility was enhanced while maintaining strength. Our results indicate that
blending PLLA with PLCL-PEG provides an effective method of tuning the

mitigate the model reliance towards the background, we propose to remove the
background impact by adding the background. That is, given a video, we randomly
select a static frame and add it to every other frames to construct a
distracting video sample. Then we force the model to pull the feature of the
distracting video and the feature of the original video closer, so that the
model is explicitly restricted to resist the background influence, focusing
more on the motion changes. We term our method as \emph{Background Erasing}

improved our ability to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar

distances, and determine the membership of Galactic stellar groups with OB
stars. We start with the identification and distance determinations of groups
with O stars. In this paper we concentrate on groups that contain stars with
the earliest spectral subtypes. METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic
stellar groups with O2-O3.5 stars and a method that combines Gaia DR2
photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust
memberships and measure distances. We also include the two clusters in that
paper to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic stellar groups. RESULTS.
We derive distances, determine the membership, and analyze the structure of
sixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to O-016,
including the 14 groups with the earliest-O-type optically-accessible stars
known in the Milky Way. We compare our distance with previous results and
establish that the best consistency is with VLBI parallaxes and the worst is
with kinematic distances. Our results indicate that massive stars can form in
relatively low-mass clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the
Bajamar star in the North America nebula. This lends support to the
hierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in
well-defined bound clusters but others are born in associations that are
unbound from the beginning: groups of newborn stars come in many shapes and
sizes. We propose that HD 64 568 and HD 64 315 AB could have been ejected
simultaneously from Villafranca O-012 S. Our results are consistent with a
difference of approx. 20 microas in the Gaia DR2 parallax zero point between
bright and faint stars. (ABRIDGED)

quantum computer due to their long coherence times and easy electrical
manipulation. However, spin-spin interactions, which are needed for entangling
gates, have only limited range as they generally rely on tunneling between
neighboring quantum dots. This severely constrains scalability. Proposals to
extend the interaction range generally focus on coherent electron transport
between dots or on extending the coupling range. Here, we study a setup where
such an extension is obtained by using a superconductor as a quantum mediator.
Because of its gap, the superconductor effectively acts as a long tunnel
barrier. We analyze the impact of spin-orbit (SO) coupling, external magnetic
fields, and the geometry of the superconductor. We show that while spin
non-conserving tunneling between the dots and the superconductor due to SO
coupling does not affect the exchange interaction, strong SO scattering in the
superconducting bulk is detrimental. Moreover, we find that the addition of an
external magnetic field decreases the strength of the exchange interaction.
Fortunately, the geometry of the superconducting link offers a lot of room to
optimize the interaction range, with gains of over an order of magnitude from a
2D film to a quasi-1D strip. We estimate that for superconductors with weak SO
coupling (\textit{e.g.}, aluminum) exchange rates of up to 100\,MHz over a
micron-scale range can be achieved with this setup in the presence of magnetic
fields of the order of 100\,mT.

(network) graph $G$, a set of sources $I \subseteq G$ initiate flooding in the
first round by every node in $I$ sending the same message to all of its
neighbours. In each subsequent round, nodes send the message to all of their
neighbours from which they did not receive the message in the previous round.
Flooding terminates when no node in $G$ sends a message in a round. The
question of termination has not been settled - rather, non-termination is
implicitly assumed to be possible.
  We show that flooding terminates on every finite graph. In the case of a
single source $g_0$, flooding terminates in $e$ rounds if $G$ is bipartite and
$j$ rounds with $e < j \leq e+d+1$ otherwise, where $e$ and $d$ are the
eccentricity of $g_0$ and diameter of $G$ respectively. For
communication/broadcast to all nodes, this is asymptotically time optimal and
obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning structures. We
extend to dynamic flooding initiated in multiple rounds with possibly multiple
messages. The cases where a node only sends a message to neighbours from which
it did not receive {\it any} message in the previous round, and where a node
sends some highest ranked message to all neighbours from which it did not
receive {\it that} message in the previous round, both terminate. All these
cases also hold if the network graph loses edges over time. Non-terminating
cases include asynchronous flooding, flooding where messages have fixed delays
at edges, cases of multiple-message flooding and cases where the network graph
acquires edges over time.

First, the localization accuracy can be degraded by the random signal
fluctuations, which would influence conventional localization algorithms that
simply learn handcrafted features from raw fingerprint data. Second, mobile
users are sensitive to the localization delay, but conventional indoor
localization algorithms are computation-intensive and time-consuming. In this

they contain the same dark mass halos. Therefore, relationships between the
observed $M_\mathrm{dyn}/M_\mathrm{b}$ distributions and distances would depend
on orbital shapes. From the relationships between our observed
$M_\mathrm{dyn}/M_\mathrm{b}$ distributions and distances, we suggest that the
satellite galaxies of the ETGs have relatively more elliptical orbits than
those of the spiral galaxies have and the $M_\mathrm{dyn}/M_\mathrm{b}$ of the
ETGs are greater than that of the spiral galaxies.

light sources is a very challenging task, especially when realistic assumptions
such as light propagation and attenuation, perspective viewing geometry and
specular light reflection are considered. Many of works tackling Photometric
Stereo (PS) problems often relax most of the aforementioned assumptions.
Especially they ignore specular reflection and global illumination effects. In
this work, we propose the first CNN based approach capable of handling these
realistic assumptions in Photometric Stereo. We leverage recent improvements of
deep neural networks for far-field Photometric Stereo and adapt them to near
field setup. We achieve this by employing an iterative procedure for shape
estimation which has two main steps. Firstly we train a per-pixel CNN to
predict surface normals from reflectance samples. Secondly, we compute the
depth by integrating the normal field in order to iteratively estimate light
directions and attenuation which is used to compensate the input images to
compute reflectance samples for the next iteration. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first near-field framework which is able to accurately
predict 3D shape from highly specular objects. Our method outperforms competing
state-of-the-art near-field Photometric Stereo approaches on both synthetic and
real experiments.

recent years, CTR prediction has been widely studied in both academia and
industry, resulting in a wide variety of CTR prediction models. Unfortunately,
there is still a lack of standardized benchmarks and uniform evaluation
protocols for CTR prediction research. This leads to non-reproducible or even
inconsistent experimental results among existing studies, which largely limits
the practical value and potential impact of their research. In this work, we
aim to perform open benchmarking for CTR prediction and present a rigorous
comparison of different models in a reproducible manner. To this end, we ran
over 7,000 experiments for more than 12,000 GPU hours in total to re-evaluate
24 existing models on multiple datasets and settings. Surprisingly, our
experiments show that with sufficient hyper-parameter search and model tuning,
many deep models have smaller differences than expected. The results also
reveal that making real progress on the modeling of CTR prediction is indeed a
very challenging research task. We believe that our benchmarking work could not
only allow researchers to gauge the effectiveness of new models conveniently

an attacker uses an optical device to record users on their mobile devices and
infer their keystrokes. The threat space for these attacks has been studied in
the past, but we argue that the defining characteristics for this threat space,
namely the strength of the attacker, are outdated. Previous works do not study
adversaries with vision systems that have been trained with deep neural
networks because these models require large amounts of training data and
curating such a dataset is expensive. To address this, we create a large-scale
synthetic dataset to simulate the attack scenario for a keystroke inference
attack. We show that first pre-training on synthetic data, followed by adopting
transfer learning techniques on real-life data, increases the performance of
our deep learning models. This indicates that these models are able to learn
rich, meaningful representations from our synthetic data and that training on
the synthetic data can help overcome the issue of having small, real-life
datasets for vision-based key stroke inference attacks. For this work, we focus
on single keypress classification where the input is a frame of a keypress and
the output is a predicted key. We are able to get an accuracy of 95.6% after

cooperate without central coordination to estimate a common state based on
local measurements and data received from neighbors. This is typically done by
running a local filter at each node using information obtained through some
procedure for fusing data across the network. A common problem with existing
methods is that the outcome of local filters at each time step depends on the
data fused at the previous step. We propose an alternative approach to
eliminate this error propagation. The proposed local filters are guaranteed to
be stable under some mild conditions on certain global structural data, and
their fusion yields the centralized Kalman estimate. The main feature of the
new approach is that fusion errors introduced at a given time step do not carry
over to subsequent steps. This offers advantages in many situations including
when a global estimate in only needed at a rate slower than that of
measurements or when there are network interruptions. If the global structural
data can be fused correctly asymptotically, the stability of local filters is
equivalent to that of the centralized Kalman filter. Otherwise, we provide
conditions to guarantee stability and bound the resulting estimation error.
Numerical experiments are given to show the advantage of our method over other
existing alternatives.

residual entropy amounts to exactly one half of its maximum value
$\lim_{T\to\infty} S(T)/N = \ln2$. In the present paper we study in detail the
role of the spin quantum number $s$ and the magnetic field $H$ in the parameter
region around the transition (flat-band) point. For that we use full exact
diagonalization up to $N=20$ lattice sites and the finite-temperature Lanczos
method up to $N=36$ sites to calculate the density of states as well as the
temperature dependence of the specific heat, the entropy and the
susceptibility. The study of chain lengths up to $N=36$ allows a careful
finite-size analysis. At the flat-band point we find extremely small
finite-size effects for spin $s=1/2$, i.e., the numerical data virtually
correspond to the thermodynamic limit. In all other cases the finite-size
effects are still small and become visible at very low temperatures. In a
sizeable parameter region around the flat-band point the former massively
degenerate ground-state manifold acts as a large manifold of low-lying
excitations leading to extraordinary thermodynamic properties at the transition
point as well as in its vicinity such as an additional low-temperature maximum
in the specific heat. Moreover, there is a very strong influence of the
magnetic field on the low-temperature thermodynamics including an enhanced
magnetocaloric effect.

They are often produced by
ejecting a volume of fluid through a circular orifice. The impulse given to the
vortex rings results in a propulsive force on the generator. Propulsive vortex
rings have been widely studied and characterised. After four convective times,
the vortex moves faster than the shear layer it originates from, and separates.
This separation corresponds to a maximum in circulation and a maximal spread of
the vorticity, quantified by the non-dimensional energy. The simultaneity of
these three events obfuscates the causality between them. To analyse the
temporal evolution of the non-dimensional energy of ring vortices independent
of their separation, we analyse the development of vortices generated in the
wake of cones. Cones with different apertures and diameters were accelerated
from rest to produce a wide variety of vortex rings and their energy,
circulation, and velocity were extracted based on time-resolved velocity field
measurements. The rings that form behind the cones have a self-induced velocity
that causes them to follow the cone and they continue to grow as the cone
travels well beyond the limiting vortex formation times scales observed for
propulsive vortices. The non-dimensional circulation, based on the vortex
diameter, and the non-dimensional energy of the drag vortex rings converge
after three convective times to values comparable to their propulsive
counterparts. This result proves that vortex pinch-off does not cause the
non-dimensional energy to reach a minimum value. The limiting values of the
non-dimensional circulation and energy are mostly independent of the cone
geometry and translational velocity and fall within an interval of 10% around
the mean value. With only 6% of variation, the velocity of the vortex is the
most unifying quantity that governs the formation of vortex rings behind cones.

spacetime is a straightforward generalisation of Weyl spacetime to include
torsion. As first suggested by Einstein, Weyl spacetime is believed to exhibit
a so-called second clock effect, which prevents the existence of experimentally
observed sharp spectral lines, since the rates of (atomic) clocks depend on
their past history. The prevailing view in the literature is that this rules
out WGTs as unphysical. Contrary to this viewpoint, we show that if one adopts
the natural covariant derivative identified in the geometric interpretation of
WGTs, properly takes into account the scaling dimension of physical quantities,
and recognises that Einstein's original objection requires the presence of
massive matter fields to represent atoms, observers and clocks, then WGTs do

interface is investigated. The weak interface can produce the deviation of the
crack path, trapping the crack at the interface, leading to stable crack growth
for certain interface geometries. This idea could be used as a technical
solution for a new type of crack arrester, with a negligible impact on the
global stiffness, strength and weight of the structure. In order to exploit
this concept, an experimental campaign based on photo-elasticity and digital
image correlation is carried out, showing the capability of curved weak
interfaces to arrest cracks. The experiment is repeated for several geometrical
configurations through the modification of the interface curvature radii. The
phenomenon of crack deviation and subsequent arrest at the interface is also
investigated with the assistance of a computational model based on the finite
element method. The computational predictions provide the rationale for the
interpretation of the experimental observations, and distinguish between the
different behaviour of concave and convex interfaces. Consequently, as is shown
in the present study, the curved interface concept fosters new routes for the
attainment of structures with enhanced fracture resistance capacities, which
are of paramount importance for materials and components used in extreme

required the use of a time-stepping procedure, which is typically costly and
unscalable. To reduce the cost and allow for computations at much larger
scales, we propose an alternative approach that is formulated based on the
unsteady Stokes equation expressed in the time-spectral domain. This
transformation results in a boundary value problem with an imaginary source
term proportional to the computed mode that is discretized and solved in a
complex-valued finite element solver using Bubnov-Galerkin formulation. This
transformed spatio-spectral formulation presents several advantages over the
traditional spatio-temporal techniques. Firstly, for cases with boundary
conditions varying smoothly in time, it provides a significant saving in
computational cost as it can resolve time-variation of the solution using a few
modes rather than thousands of time steps. Secondly, in contrast to the
traditional time integration scheme with a finite order of accuracy, this
method exhibits a super convergence behavior versus the number of computed
modes. Thirdly, in contrast to the stabilized finite element methods for fluid,
no stabilization term is employed in our formulation, producing a solution that
is consistent and more accurate. Fourthly, the proposed approach is
embarrassingly parallelizable owing to the independence of the solution modes,
thus enabling scalable calculations at a much larger number of processors. The
comparison of the proposed technique against a standard stabilized finite
element solver is performed using two- and three-dimensional canonical and
complex geometries. The results show that the proposed method can produce more
accurate results at 1% to 11% of the cost of the standard technique for the

  We establish that the $d$-dimensional cube is $\floor{(d+1)/2}$-linked, for
every $d\ne 3$; this is the maximum possible linkedness of a $d$-polytope. This
result implies that, for every $d\ge 1$, a cubical $d$-polytope is
$\floor{d/2}$-linked, which answers a question of Wotzlaw \cite{Ron09}.
  Finally, we introduce the notion of strong linkedness, which is slightly
stronger than that of linkedness. A graph $G$ is {\it strongly $k$-linked} if
it has at least $2k+1$ vertices and, for every vertex $v$ of $G$, the subgraph
$G-v$ is $k$-linked. We show that cubical 4-polytopes are strongly $2$-linked
and that, for each $d\ge 1$, $d$-dimensional cubes are strongly
$\floor{d/2}$-linked.

forcing in order to show how vertex leaks can disrupt the zero forcing process
in a graph. An edge leak is an edge that is not allowed to be forced across
during the zero forcing process. The $\ell$-edge-leaky forcing number of a
graph is the size of a smallest zero forcing set that can force the graph blue
despite $\ell$ edge leaks. This paper contains an analysis of the effect of
edge leaks on the zero forcing process instead of vertex leaks. Furthermore,
specified $\ell$-leaky forcing is introduced. The main result is that
$\ell$-leaky forcing, $\ell$-edge-leaky forcing, and specified $\ell$-leaky
forcing are equivalent. Furthermore, all of these different kinds of leaks can
be mixed so that vertex leaks, edge leaks, and specified leaks are used. This
mixed $\ell$-leaky forcing number is also the same as the (vertex) $\ell$-leaky
forcing number.

gradually generalized as efficient models in machine learning in recent years.
However, in order to achieve exact contraction, only tree-like tensor networks
such as the matrix product states and tree tensor networks have been
considered, even for modeling two-dimensional data such as images. In this
work, we construct supervised learning models for images using the projected
entangled pair states (PEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network having a similar
structure prior to natural images. Our approach first performs a feature map,
which transforms the image data to a product state on a grid, then contracts
the product state to a PEPS with trainable parameters to predict image labels.
The tensor elements of PEPS are trained by minimizing differences between
training labels and predicted labels. The proposed model is evaluated on image
classifications using the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
our model is significantly superior to existing models using tree-like tensor
networks. Moreover, using the same input features, our method performs as well
as the multilayer perceptron classifier, but with much fewer parameters and is
more stable. Our results shed light on potential applications of
two-dimensional tensor network models in machine learning.

background of the listener, which is reflected, to a considerable extent, in
country-specific music listening profiles. Previous work has already identified
several country-specific differences in the popularity distribution of music
artists listened to. In particular, what constitutes the ""music mainstream""
strongly varies between countries. To complement and extend these results, the
article at hand delivers the following major contributions: First, using
state-of-the-art unsupervised learning techniques, we identify and thoroughly
investigate (1) country profiles of music preferences on the fine-grained level
of music tracks (in contrast to earlier work that relied on music preferences
on the artist level) and (2) country archetypes that subsume countries sharing
similar patterns of listening preferences. Second, we formulate four user
models that leverage the user's country information on music preferences. Among
others, we propose a user modeling approach to describe a music listener as a
vector of similarities over the identified country clusters or archetypes.
Third, we propose a context-aware music recommendation system that leverages
implicit user feedback, where context is defined via the four user models. More
precisely, it is a multi-layer generative model based on a variational
autoencoder, in which contextual features can influence recommendations through
a gating mechanism. Fourth, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed recommendation
system and user models on a real-world corpus of more than one billion
listening records of users around the world (out of which we use 369 million in
our experiments) and show its merits vis-a-vis state-of-the-art algorithms that

  Santiago during the Covid-19 Pandemic",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main
non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to
contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such
interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that
exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is
that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility
measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the
city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data
linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing
measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on
socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while
zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around
50\% to 90\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions
are only 20\% to 50\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in
higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary
shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that
our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10\%
increase in mobility correlates with a 5\% increase in the rate of infection.
Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences
in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city.
Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income
communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be
effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic
levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable
their inhabitants to increase compliance.
