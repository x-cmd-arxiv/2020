  Decomposition","48 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider online change detection of high dimensional data streams with
sparse changes, where only a subset of data streams can be observed at each
sensing time point due to limited sensing capacities. On the one hand, the
detection scheme should be able to deal with partially observable data and
meanwhile have efficient detection power for sparse changes. On the other, the
scheme should be able to adaptively and actively select the most important
variables to observe to maximize the detection power. To address these two
points, in this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme called CDSSD. In
particular, it describes the structure of high dimensional data with sparse
changes by smooth-sparse decomposition, whose parameters can be learned via
spike-slab variational Bayesian inference. Then the posterior Bayes factor,
which incorporates the learned parameters and sparse change information, is
formulated as a detection statistic. Finally, by formulating the statistic as
the reward of a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, an adaptive sampling
strategy based on Thompson sampling is proposed. The efficacy and applicability
of our method in practice are demonstrated with numerical studies and a real
case study.

and clumps raises their star formation rate compared to what they would
experience from a gas reservoir of uniform density. This effect should be
observed in the relation between dense-gas mass $M_{dg}$ and star formation
rate $SFR$ of molecular clouds and clumps, with steeper gas density gradients
yielding higher $SFR/M_{dg}$ ratios. The content of this paper is two-fold.
Firstly, we build on the notion of magnification factor introduced by
Parmentier (2019) to redefine the dense-gas relation (i.e. the relation between
$M_{dg}$ and $SFR$). Not only does the $SFR/M_{dg}$ ratio depend on the mean
free-fall time of the gas and on its (intrinsic) star formation efficiency per
free-fall time, it also depends on the logarithmic slope $-p$ of the gas
density profile and on the relative extent of the constant-density region at
the clump center. Secondly, we show that nearby molecular clouds follow the
newly-defined dense-gas relation, provided that their dense-gas mass is defined
based on a volume density criterion. We also find the same trend for the dense
molecular clouds of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy, although
this one is scaled down by a factor of $10$ compared to nearby clouds. The
respective locii of both nearby and CMZ clouds in the $(p, SFR/M_{dg})$
parameter space is discussed.

promises improved system performance, while posing new challenges in channel

a few CE protocols for IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems

IRS, whereas in practice multiple such surfaces should be installed to truly
benefit from the concept of reconfiguring propagation environments. In light of
these challenges, this paper tackles the CE problem for the distributed
IRSs-assisted multi-user MISO system. An optimal CE protocol requiring
relatively low training overhead is developed using Bayesian techniques under
the practical assumption that the BS-IRSs channels are dominated by the
line-of-sight (LoS) components. An optimal solution for the phase shifts
vectors required at all IRSs during CE is determined and the minimum mean
square error (MMSE) estimates of the BSusers direct channels and the IRSs-users

due to the strict data dependencies across time-steps. Batching multiple
requests can increase throughput. However, RNN batching requires a large amount
of padding since the batched input sequences may largely differ in length.
Schemes that dynamically update the batch every few time-steps avoid padding.
However, they require executing different RNN layers in a short timespan,
decreasing energy efficiency. Hence, we propose E-BATCH, a low-latency and
energy-efficient batching scheme tailored to RNN accelerators. It consists of a
runtime system and effective hardware support. The runtime concatenates
multiple sequences to create large batches, resulting in substantial energy
savings. Furthermore, the accelerator notifies it when the evaluation of a
sequence is done, so that a new sequence can be immediately added to a batch,
thus largely reducing the amount of padding. E-BATCH dynamically controls the
number of time-steps evaluated per batch to achieve the best trade-off between
latency and energy efficiency for the given hardware platform. We evaluate
E-BATCH on top of E-PUR and TPU. In E-PUR, E-BATCH improves throughput by 1.8x
and energy-efficiency by 3.6x, whereas in TPU, it improves throughput by 2.1x
and energy-efficiency by 1.6x, over the state-of-the-art.

We develop new approaches to determine stellar properties, including rotation

reviewed. It is emphasized that QED subsystems are defined relative to a choice
of gauge. Each definition uses different gauge-invariant observables. This
relativity is eliminated only if a sufficient number of Markovian and
weak-coupling approximations are employed. All physical predictions are gauge
invariant, including subsystem properties such as photon number and
entanglement. However, subsystem properties naturally differ for different
physical subsystems. Gauge ambiguities arise not because it is unclear how to
obtain gauge-invariant predictions, but because it is not always clear which
physical observables are the most operationally relevant. The gauge invariance
of a prediction is necessary but not sufficient to ensure its operational
relevance. It is shown that, in controlling which gauge invariant observables
are used to define a material system, the choice of gauge affects the balance
between the material system's localization and its electromagnetic dressing.
Various implications of subsystem gauge relativity for deriving effective
models, for describing time-dependent interactions, for photodetection theory,
and for describing matter within a cavity are reviewed.

problem on a directed communication network subject to malicious cyber-attacks.
The considered attacks, named as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, are allowed
to occur aperiodically, which refers to interruptions of communication channels
carried out by intelligent adversaries. In such an insecure network
environment, the existence of cyber-attacks may result in undesirable
performance degradations or even the failures of distributed algorithm to seek
the NE of noncooperative games. Hence, the aforementioned setting can improve
the practical relevance of the problem to be addressed and meanwhile, it poses
some technical challenges to the distributed algorithm design and exponential
convergence analysis. In contrast to the existing distributed NE seeking
results over a prefect communication network, an attack-resilient distributed
algorithm is presented such that the NE can be exactly reached with an
exponential convergence rate in the presence of DoS attacks. Inspired by the
previous works in [21]-[26], an explicit analysis of the attack frequency and
duration is investigated to enable exponential NE seeking with resilience
against attacks.Examples and numerical simulation results are given to show the
effectiveness of the proposed design.

structures. And since then, a myriad of index structures are being invented and
published each and every year. In this paper we argue that the very idea of
""inventing an index"" is a misleading concept in the first place. It is the
analogue of ""inventing a physical query plan"". This paper is a paradigm shift
in which we propose to drop the idea to handcraft index structures (as done for
binary search trees over B-trees to any form of learned index) altogether. We
present a new automatic index breeding framework coined Genetic Generic
Generation of Index Structures (GENE). It is based on the observation that
almost all index structures are assembled along three principal dimensions: (1)
structural building blocks, e.g., a B-tree is assembled from two different
structural node types (inner and leaf nodes), (2) a couple of invariants, e.g.,
for a B-tree all paths have the same length, and (3) decisions on the internal
layout of nodes (row or column layout, etc.). We propose a generic indexing
framework that can mimic many existing index structures along those dimensions.
Based on that framework we propose a generic genetic index generation algorithm
that, given a workload and an optimization goal, can automatically assemble and
mutate, in other words 'breed' new index structure 'species'. In our
experiments we follow multiple goals. We reexamine some good old wisdom from
database technology. Given a specific workload, will GENE even breed an index
that is equivalent to what our textbooks and papers currently recommend for
such a workload? Or can we do even more? Our initial results strongly indicate
that generated indexes are the next step in designing index structures.

interference, frequent outages, and lower coverage. The THz band has a massive
amount of greenfield spectrum to cater to this dense-indoor deployment.
However, a limited coverage range of the THz will require networks to have more

better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is
almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size $k$, for some
$k\ge 2$. We refer to this problem as MAX NAE-$\{k\}$-SAT. For $k=2$, it is
essentially the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For $k=3$, it is related to the MAX
CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For $k\ge
4$, it is known that an approximation ratio of $1-\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$, obtained
by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming $P\ne NP$. For every
$k\ge 2$, an approximation ratio of at least $\frac{7}{8}$ can be obtained for
MAX NAE-$\{k\}$-SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a
$\frac{7}{8}$-approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all
sizes are allowed simultaneously.
  Our main result is that there is no $\frac{7}{8}$-approximation algorithm for
MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the unique games conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for
almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-$\{3,5\}$-SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where
all clauses have size $3$ or $5$), the best approximation ratio that can be
achieved, assuming UGC, is at most $\frac{3(\sqrt{21}-4)}{2}\approx 0.8739$.
Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O'Donnell and Wu for
MAX CUT to MAX NAE-$\{3\}$-SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC,
for MAX NAE-$\{3\}$-SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The
approximation ratio of the new algorithm is $\approx 0.9089$.
  We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We
describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX
NAE-$\{3,5\}$-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an
approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a
conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698.

GW190521, that can be explained as the merger of central black holes from two
ultra-dwarf galaxies of stellar mass $\sim 10^5-10^6 ~M_\odot$, which had
themselves previously undergone a merger. The GW190521 components' masses of
$85^{+21}_{-14}M_\odot$ and $66^{+17}_{-18}M_\odot$ challenge standard stellar

the merger history of ultra-dwarf galaxies at high redshifts ($1\lesssim z
\lesssim 2$) matches well the LIGO/Virgo inferred merger rate for black holes
within the mass range of the GW190521 components, resulting in a likely time
delay of $\lesssim 4$ Gyr considering the redshift of this event. We further
demonstrate that the predicted time-scales are consistent with expectations for
central black hole mergers, although with large uncertainties due to the lack
of high-resolution simulations in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Our findings show
that this black hole production and merging channel is viable and extremely
interesting as a new way to explore galaxies' black hole seeds and galaxy
formation. We recommend this scenario be investigated in detail with

the strong disorder regime, formulated by statistical physicists, and supported
by a large amount of numerical evidence over the last decade [31,32,38,70] is
as follows: for a large class of random graph models with degree exponent
$\tau\in (3,4)$, the distance between two typical points on the minimal
spanning tree (MST) on the giant component in the supercritical regime scales
like $n^{(\tau-3)/(\tau-1)}$. In this paper we give the first rigorous proof of
this conjecture.
  We consider a supercritical inhomogeneous random graph model with degree
exponent $\tau\in(3, 4)$ that is closely related to Aldous's multiplicative
coalescent, and show that the MST constructed by assigning i.i.d. continuous
weights to the edges in its giant component, endowed with the tree distance
scaled by $n^{-(\tau-3)/(\tau-1)}$, converges in distribution with respect to
the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a random compact real tree. Further, almost
surely, every point in this limiting space either has degree one (leaf), or
two, or infinity (hub), both the set of leaves and the set of hubs are dense in
this space, and the Minkowski dimension of this space equals
$(\tau-1)/(\tau-3)$.
  The multiplicative coalescent, in an asymptotic sense, describes the
evolution of the component sizes of various near-critical random graph
processes. We expect the limiting spaces in this paper to be the candidates for
the scaling limit of the MST constructed for a wide array of other heavy-tailed
random graph models.

Effelsberg telescope, we study the scintillation parameters of the millisecond
pulsar J0613-0200 over a 7 year timespan. The ""secondary spectrum"" -- the 2D
power spectrum of scintillation -- presents the scattered power as a function
of time delay, and contains the relative velocities of the pulsar, observer,
and scattering material. We detect a persistent parabolic scintillation arc,
suggesting scattering is dominated by a thin, anisotropic region. The
scattering is poorly described by a simple exponential tail, with excess power
at high delays; we measure significant, detectable scattered power at times out
to $\sim 5 \mu s$, and measure the bulk scattering delay to be between 50 to
200\,ns with particularly strong scattering throughout 2013. These delays are
too small to detect a change of the pulse profile shape, yet they would change
the times-of-arrival as measured through pulsar timing. The arc curvature
varies annually, and is well fit by a one-dimensional scattering screen $\sim
40\%$ of the way towards the pulsar, with a changing orientation during the
increased scattering in 2013. Effects of uncorrected scattering will introduce
time delays correlated over time in individual pulsars, and may need to be
considered in gravitational wave analyses. Pulsar timing programs would benefit
from simultaneously recording in a way that scintillation can be resolved, in
order to monitor the variable time delays caused by multipath propagation.

quantum algorithms, such as Hamiltonian simulation, or for loading
distributions into a quantum device to be used e.g. in the context of
optimization tasks such as machine learning. Starting with a generic ""black
box"" method devised by Grover in 2000, which employs amplitude amplification to
load coefficients calculated by an oracle, there has been a long series of
results and improvements with various additional conditions on the amplitudes
to be loaded, culminating in Sanders et al.'s work which avoids almost all
arithmetic during the preparation stage.
  In this work, we construct an optimized black box state loading scheme with
which various important sets of coefficients can be loaded significantly faster
than in $O(\sqrt N)$ rounds of amplitude amplification, up to only $O(1)$ many.
We achieve this with two variants of our algorithm. The first employs a
modification of the oracle from Sanders et al., which requires fewer ancillas
($\log_2 g$ vs $g+2$ in the bit precision $g$), and fewer non-Clifford
operations per amplitude amplification round within the context of our
algorithm. The second utilizes the same oracle, but at slightly increased cost
in terms of ancillas ($g+\log_2g$) and non-Clifford operations per
amplification round. As the number of amplitude amplification rounds enters as
multiplicative factor, our black box state loading scheme yields an up to
exponential speedup as compared to prior methods. This speedup translates
beyond the black box case.

component of efficient Combined Heat and Power (CHP), Concentrated Solar Power

reduces peak demand while helping to manage intermittent availability of energy
(e.g., from solar or wind). Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage (LHTES) is a
viable option because of its high energy storage density. Parametric analysis
of LHTES heat exchangers have been focused on obtaining data with laminar flow
in the phase changing fluid and then fitting a functional form, such as a power
law or polynomial, to those data. Alternatively, in this paper we present a
parametric framework to analyze LHTES devices by identifying all relevant fluid
parameters and corresponding dimensionless numbers. We present 64 simulations
of an LHTES device using the finite volume method at four values of the
Grashof, Prandtl and Reynolds numbers in the phase change material (PCM) and
heat transfer fluid (HTF). We observe that with sufficient energy available in
the HTF, the effects of the HTF Reynolds number and Prandtl number on the heat
transfer rate are negligible. Under these conditions, we propose a time scale
for the variation of energy stored (or melt fraction) of the LHTES device based
on the Fourier number($Fo$), Grashof number($Gr_p$) and Prandtl number($Pr_p$)
and observe a $Gr_p^1$ and $Pr_p^{(1/3)}$ dependency. We also identify two
distinct regions in the variation of the melt fraction with time, namely, the
linear and the asymptotic region. We also predict the critical value of the
melt fraction at the transition between the two regions. From these analyses,
we draw some conclusions regarding the design procedure for LHTES devices.

advantages over the standard practice of using the sharp momentum cut $k_{\rm
max}$. First, the theoretical error covariance gradually suppresses the
information from the short scales as the employed theoretical model becomes
less reliable. This allows one to avoid laborious measurements of $k_{\rm
max}$, which is an essential part of the standard methods. Second, the
theoretical error likelihood gives unbiased constrains with reliable error bars
that are not artificially shrunk due to over-fitting. In realistic settings,
the theoretical error likelihood yields essentially the same parameter
constraints as the standard analysis with an appropriately selected $k_{\rm
max}$, thereby effectively optimizing the choice of $k_{\rm max}$. We
demonstrate these points using the large-volume N-body data for the clustering
of matter and galaxies in real and redshift space. In passing, we validate the
effective field theory description of the redshift space distortions and show
that the use of the one-parameter phenomenological Gaussian damping model for
fingers-of-God causes significant biases in parameter recovery.

explicitly identifies the global $SU(2)_R$ symmetries of the Higgs and fermion

operators that are custodial preserving or violating. We carefully consider
equation-of-motion redundancies that cause custodial symmetric operators in one

generation, we demonstrate that the basis-dependent appearance of
custodial-violating operators does not invalidate our $\mathscr{T}$ parameter

tension, the $\sim 5\sigma$ discrepancy between the $H_0$ value derived from
early- and late-universe observations within $\Lambda$CDM. However, it has been
pointed out that Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data, which are in $\sim3\sigma$
tension with $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies, might alter these conclusions.
We reassess the viability of the EDE against a host of high- and low-redshift
measurements, by combining LSS observations from recent weak lensing (WL)
surveys with CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), growth function (FS) and
Supernova Ia (SNIa) data. Introducing a model whose only parameter is $f_{\rm
EDE}(z_c)$, we report a $\sim 2\sigma$ preference for non-zero $f_{\rm
EDE}(z_c)$ from Planck data alone and the tension with SH0ES is reduced below
$2\sigma$. Adding BAO, FS and SNIa does not affect this result, while the
inclusion of a prior on $H_0$ from SH0ES increase the preference for non-zero
EDE to $\sim3.6\sigma$. After checking the EDE non-linear matter power spectrum
predicted by standard semi-analytical algorithms via a set of $N$-body
simulations, we show that current WL data do not rule out EDE. We also caution
against the interpretation of constraints obtained from combining statistically
inconsistent data sets within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In light of the CMB
lensing anomalies, we show that the lensing-marginalized CMB data also favor
non-zero $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$ at $\sim2\sigma$, predicts $H_0$ in $1.4\sigma$
agreement with SH0ES and $S_8$ in $1.5\sigma$ ($0.8\sigma$) agreement with KV
(DES) data. Alternatively, we discuss promising extensions of the EDE cosmology
that could allow to fully restore cosmological concordance.

eccentricity grows abruptly after a relatively long time-scale ($\sim
400\textrm{--}700$ binary orbits), and is associated with a very small increase
in the binary eccentricity. When disc eccentricity grows, the cavity semi-major
axis reaches values $a_{\rm cav}\approx 3.5\, a_{\rm bin}$. We also find that
the disc eccentricity correlates linearly with the cavity size. Viscosity and

theories with null boundaries, utilizing the most general boundary conditions
consistent with a fixed null normal. To fix the ambiguity inherent in the
Wald-Zoupas definition of quasilocal charges, we propose a new principle, based
on holographic reasoning, that the flux be of Dirichlet form. This also
produces an expression for the analog of the Brown-York stress tensor on the
null surface. Defining the algebra of charges using the Barnich-Troessaert
bracket for open subsystems, we give a general formula for the central -- or
more generally, abelian -- extensions that appear in terms of the anomalous
transformation of the boundary term in the gravitational action. This anomaly
arises from having fixed a frame for the null normal, and we draw parallels
between it and the holographic Weyl anomaly that occurs in AdS/CFT. As an
application of this formalism, we analyze the near-horizon Virasoro symmetry
considered by Haco, Hawking, Perry, and Strominger, and perform a systematic
derivation of the fluxes and central charges. Applying the Cardy formula to the
result yields an entropy that is twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the
horizon. Motivated by the extended Hilbert space construction, we interpret
this in terms of a pair of entangled CFTs associated with edge modes on either
side of the bifurcation surface.

BOSS galaxy power spectra, analyzed using the effective field theory (EFT) of
large-scale structure (LSS), and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) from Planck. Recent studies found that these data place
stringent constraints on the maximum abundance of EDE allowed in the Universe.
We argue here that their conclusions are a consequence of their choice of
priors on the EDE parameter space, rather than any disagreement between the
data and the model. For example, when considering EFT-LSS, CMB, and
high-redshift supernovae data we find the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM models can
provide statistically indistinguishable fits ($\Delta \chi^2 = 0.12$) with a
relatively large value for the maximum fraction of energy density in the EDE
($f_{\rm ede} = 0.09$) and Hubble constant ($H_0 = 71$ km/s/Mpc) in the EDE
model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the constraining power added from the
inclusion of EFT-LSS traces to the potential tension between the power-spectrum
amplitudes $A_s$ derived from BOSS and from Planck that arises even within the
context of $\Lambda$CDM. Until this is better understood, caution should be
used when interpreting EFT-BOSS+Planck constraints to models beyond
$\Lambda$CDM. These findings suggest that EDE still provides a potential
resolution to the Hubble tension and that it is worthwhile to test the
predictions of EDE with future data-sets and further study its theoretical
possibilities.

using the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS).
ASPECS consists of two spatially-overlapping mosaics that cover the entire ALMA
3mm and 1.2mm bands. We combine the results of a line candidate search of the
1.2mm data cube with those previously obtained from the 3mm cube. Our analysis
shows that $\sim$80% of the line flux observed at 3mm arises from CO(2-1) or
CO(3-2) emitters at $z$=1-3 (`cosmic noon'). At 1.2mm, more than half of the
line flux arises from intermediate-J CO transitions ($J_{\rm up}$=3-6);
$\sim12$% from neutral carbon lines; and $< 1$% from singly-ionized carbon,
[CII]. This implies that future [CII] intensity mapping surveys in the epoch of
reionization will need to account for a highly significant CO foreground. The
CO luminosity functions probed at 1.2mm show a decrease in the number density
at a given line luminosity (in units of $L'$) at increasing $J_{\rm up}$ and
redshift. Comparisons between the CO luminosity functions for different CO
transitions at a fixed redshift reveal sub-thermal conditions on average in
galaxies up to $z\sim 4$. In addition, the comparison of the CO luminosity
functions for the same transition at different redshifts reveals that the
evolution is not driven by excitation. The cosmic density of molecular gas in
galaxies, $\rho_{\rm H2}$, shows a redshift evolution with an increase from
high redshift up to $z\sim1.5$ followed by a factor $\sim 6$ drop down to the
present day. This is in qualitative agreement with the evolution of the cosmic
star-formation rate density, suggesting that the molecular gas depletion time
is approximately constant with redshift, after averaging over the star-forming
galaxy population.

parameter space occupied by planetary orbits. In one particularly intriguing
class of multi-planet systems, the ultra-short period planet is flanked by
short-period companions, and the outer planets occupy a discernibly distinct
dynamical state. In the observational database, this phenomenon is represented
by a small number of stars hosting systems of tightly packed co-planar planets
as well as an ultra-short period planet, whose orbit of is misaligned relative
to the mutual plane of the former. In this work, we explore two different
mechanisms that can produce an ultra-short period planet that is misaligned
with the rest of its compact planetary system: natural decoupling between the
inner and outer system via the stellar quadrupole moment, and decoupling forced
by an external companion with finely-tuned orbital parameters. These two
processes operate with different timescales, and can thus occur simultaneously.
In this work, we use the K2-266 system as an illustrative example to elucidate
the dynamics of these two processes, and highlight the types of constraints
that may arise regarding the dynamical histories of systems hosting ultra-short
period planets.

these galaxies with FRB hosts from the literature, we introduce criteria based
on the probability of chance coincidence to define a sub-sample of 10
highly-confident associations (at $z=0.03-0.52$), three of which correspond to
known repeating FRBs. Overall, the FRB host galaxies exhibit a broad,
continuous range of color ($M_u-M_r = 0.9 - 2.0$), stellar mass ($M_\star =
10^{8} - 6\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$), and star-formation rate (${\rm SFR} =
0.05 - 10\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) spanning the full parameter space
occupied by $z<0.5$ galaxies. However, they do not track the color-magnitude,
SFR-$M_\star$, nor BPT diagrams of field galaxies surveyed at similar
redshifts. There is an excess of ""green valley"" galaxies and an excess of
emission-line ratios indicative of a harder radiation field than that generated
by star-formation alone. From the observed stellar mass distribution, we rule
out the hypothesis that FRBs strictly track stellar mass in galaxies ($>99\%$
c.l.). We measure a median offset of 3.3 kpc from the FRB to the estimated
center of the host galaxies and compare the host-burst offset distribution and
other properties with the distributions of long- and short-duration gamma-ray
bursts (LGRBs and SGRBs), core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe), and Type Ia SNe.
This analysis rules out galaxies hosting LGRBs (faint, star-forming galaxies)
as common hosts for FRBs ($>95\%$ c.l.). Other transient channels (SGRBs, CC-
and Type Ia SNe) have host galaxy properties and offsets consistent with the
FRB distributions. All of the data and derived quantities are made publicly

human experts. Due to the huge amount of manual effort involved, they are
difficult to scale and also tend to produce many errors ought to their limited
ability to understand natural language and the limited knowledge in their KBs.
Thus, the level of user satisfactory is often low. In this paper, we propose to
dramatically improve this situation by endowing the system the ability to
continually learn (1) new world knowledge, (2) new language expressions to
ground them to actions, and (3) new conversational skills, during conversation

For a generic 3-rd order tensor, these features are described explicitly.
  In the case of special tensors of a prescribed symmetry, the decomposition

absorption of argon excimer emission by atomic xenon has not been fully
appreciated. This absorption significantly reduces the light yield in
commercially available argon which contains trace amounts ($\rm \sim 0.1$ ppm)
of xenon. The addition of a small xenon dopant of $\sim 10$ ppm recovers this
lost light resulting in an increased light yield over un-doped argon of about a
factor of two. In this paper we introduce a model for the light production in
xenon doped argon, including absorption and re-emission, and compare it to the
measured time dependence of light emission in xenon-doped argon.

repetition cat qubit approach to universal and fault-tolerant quantum
computation. The cat qubits stabilized by two-photon dissipation exhibit an
extremely biased noise where the bit-flip error rate is exponentially
suppressed with the mean number of photons. In a recent work, we suggested that
the remaining phase-flip error channel could be suppressed using a 1D
repetition code. Indeed, using only bias-preserving gates on the cat-qubits, it
is possible to build a universal set of fault-tolerant logical gates at the
level of the repetition cat qubit. In this paper, we perform Monte-Carlo
simulations of all the circuits implementing the protected logical gates, using
a circuit-level error model. Furthermore, we analyze two different approaches
to implement a fault-tolerant Toffoli gate on repetition cat qubits. These
numerical simulations indicate that very low logical error rates could be
achieved with a reasonable resource overhead, and with parameters that are
within the reach of near-term circuit QED experiments.

We limit our attention to planar gravitational wave fronts -- this assumption

CMB's primary temperature variation pattern, we demonstrate that a BWM can mix
power from a spherical harmonic mode of a certain degree into modes of various
other degrees with vastly different $l$ values. In other words, BWM-induced
perturbations to the CMB at any angular scale depend in detail on the
unperturbed character of the CMB on all angular scales. The tools developed

exploration of symmetry breaking phenomena from 4D-STEM data sets using
rotationally invariant variational autoencoders (rrVAE), which is designed to
disentangle the general rotation of the object from other latent

illustrate the effect of site symmetry breaking. Finally, the rrVAE analysis of

written in closed-form as a simple orthonormality term and be used along with
the cross-entropy loss function. The findings indicate that orthonormality loss
function results in a) rich and diverse feature representations, b) robustness
to feature sub-selection, c) better semantic localization in the class
activation maps, and d) reduction in model calibration error. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed OS regularization by providing quantitative
and qualitative results on four benchmark datasets - CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN

using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular

characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body
assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between

degree of fuzzy-rough approximations and proper degree threshold selection for
the negative samples' undersampling from all possible interaction pairs between

theories involving the effects of dissipative forces from a viscous gaseous

protoplanetary disk with an embedded 1--10 Jupiter-mass planet. On top of the
gaseous disk, we set a distribution of $\mu$m--cm dust particles interacting
with the gas. This allows us to follow dust dynamics as solids get trapped
around the Lagrangian points of the planet. We show that large vortices
generated at the Lagrangian points are responsible for dust accumulation, where
the leading Lagrangian point $L_4$ traps a larger amount of submillimeter
(submm) particles than the trailing $L_5$, which traps mostly mm--cm particles.
However, the total bulk mass, with typical values of $\sim M_{\rm moon}$, is
more significant in $L_5$ than in $L_4$, in contrast to what is observed in the
current Solar System a few gigayears later. Furthermore, the migration of the
planet does not seem to affect the reported asymmetry between $L_4$ and $L_5$.
The main initial mass reservoir for Trojan dust lies in the same co-orbital
path of the planet, while dust migrating from the outer region (due to drag)
contributes very little to its final mass, imposing strong mass constraints for
the in situ formation scenario of Trojan planets.

randomly, requiring a random amount of charge. Additionally, each user has a
random impatience factor that quantifies their value of time, and a random
desired time to stay at a particular location. Assuming rational user behavior,
and with knowledge of the probability distribution of the random parameters, we
present high-confidence bounds on the total number of vehicles parked at the
station and the aggregate power use of all vehicles actively charging. We
demonstrate how these bounds can be used by a charging facility to determine
appropriate prices and investigate through a Monte-Carlo simulation case study
the tightness of the bounds.

situ and remotely, from a close distance, in and out of the ecliptic. The
ultimate goal is to understand how the Sun produces and controls the
heliosphere, filling the Solar System and driving the planetary environments.
With six remote-sensing and four in-situ instrument suites, the coordination
and planning of the operations are essential to address the following four
top-level science questions: (1) What drives the solar wind and where does the
coronal magnetic field originate? (2) How do solar transients drive
heliospheric variability? (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle
radiation that fills the heliosphere? (4) How does the solar dynamo work and
drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? Maximising the mission's
science return requires considering the characteristics of each orbit,
including the relative position of the spacecraft to Earth (affecting downlink
rates), trajectory events (such as gravitational assist manoeuvres), and the
phase of the solar activity cycle. Furthermore, since each orbit's science
telemetry will be downloaded over the course of the following orbit, science
operations must be planned at mission level, rather than at the level of
individual orbits. It is important to explore the way in which those science
questions are translated into an actual plan of observations that fits into the
mission, thus ensuring that no opportunities are missed. First, the overarching
goals are broken down into specific, answerable questions along with the
required observations and the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP) is
developed to achieve this. The SAP groups objectives that require similar
observations into Solar Orbiter Observing Plans (SOOPs), resulting in a
strategic, top-level view of the optimal opportunities for science observations
during the mission lifetime.

limiting the search space. It is observed from our experiments that fusion
using DWT and UDWT techniques with GA for optimal parameter estimation resulted
in a better fused image in the aspects of retaining the information and

objective metrics. The contributions of this research work are (1) reduced time
and space complexity in estimating the weight values using GA for fusion (2)

owing to feature level GA implementation and (3) identification of source image

use of the adiabatic theorem to efficiently find the ground state of a

to problems in chemistry remains a relatively sparse area of research due to
the difficulty in mapping molecular systems to the Ising model Hamiltonian. In
this paper we review two different methods for finding the ground state of
molecular Hamiltonians using Ising model-based quantum annealers. In addition,
we compare the relative effectiveness of each method by calculating the binding
energies, bond lengths, and bond angles of the H+3and H2O molecules and mapping
their potential energy curves. We also assess the resource requirements of each
method by determining the number of qubits and computation time required to
simulate each molecule using various parameter values. While each of these
methods is capable of accurately predicting the ground state properties of
small molecules, we find that they are still outperformed by modern classical
algorithms and that the scaling of the resource requirements remains a
challenge.

offer a flexible modeling approach when the number of latent components in a
dataset is unknown. However, managing the infinite dimensionality of CRMs
typically requires practitioners to derive ad-hoc algorithms, preventing the
use of general-purpose inference methods and often leading to long compute
times. We propose a general but explicit recipe to construct a simple
finite-dimensional approximation that can replace the infinite-dimensional
CRMs. Our independent finite approximation (IFA) is a generalization of
important cases that are used in practice. The independence of atom weights in
our approximation (i) makes the construction well-suited for parallel and
distributed computation and (ii) facilitates more convenient inference schemes.
We quantify the approximation error between IFAs and the target nonparametric
prior. We compare IFAs with an alternative approximation scheme -- truncated
finite approximations (TFAs), where the atom weights are constructed
sequentially. We prove that, for worst-case choices of observation likelihoods,
TFAs are a more efficient approximation than IFAs. However, in real-data
experiments with image denoising and topic modeling, we find that IFAs perform
very similarly to TFAs in terms of task-specific accuracy metrics.

were interpreted as being due to a resonant perturbation between XO-6b and a
hitherto unknown low-mass planet orbiting the same star. To understand this
enigmatic planetary system better, we analysed three sectors of data, spanning
over seven months, from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which
produces high-quality light curves that are well suited to characterizing
exoplanets and searching for TTVs. Here we present an updated orbital period of
3.7649893 $\pm$ 0.0000037 days and a transit epoch of 2456652.7157 $\pm$ 0.0022

discovery values, have greatly improved precision. Notably, we find no evidence
for TTVs: we can rule out TTVs $\gtrsim$ 2.5 minutes at the 3$\sigma$ level.
Therefore, the TESS data have sufficient precision and time baseline to reveal
readily the previously reported TTVs of approximately 10 minutes. Our findings
highlight TESS's capabilities for robust follow-up, and confirm that TTVs are
rarely seen in hot Jupiters, unlike is the case with small planets.

We argue that, despite recent progress, transformer network-based approaches
such as universal sentence encoder (USE-QA) do not always outperform
traditional information retrieval (IR) methods such as BM25 for evidence
retrieval for QA. We introduce a lexical probing task that validates this
observation: we demonstrate that neural IR methods have the capacity to capture
lexical differences between questions and answers, but miss obvious lexical
overlap signal. Learning from this probing analysis, we introduce a hybrid
approach for evidence retrieval that combines the advantages of both IR
directions. Our approach uses a routing classifier that learns when to direct
incoming questions to BM25 vs. USE-QA for evidence retrieval using very simple
statistics, which can be efficiently extracted from the top candidate evidence
sentences produced by a BM25 model. We demonstrate that this hybrid evidence
retrieval generally performs better than either individual retrieval strategy
on three QA datasets: OpenBookQA, ReQA SQuAD, and ReQA NQ. Furthermore, we show
that the proposed routing strategy is considerably faster than neural methods,
with a runtime that is up to 5 times faster than USE-QA.

traditional rule-based systems and more recently by knowledge graph embedding
methods. While logical rules can capture deterministic behavior in a KG they
are brittle and mining ones that infer facts beyond the known KG is
challenging. Probabilistic embedding methods are effective in capturing global
soft statistical tendencies and reasoning with them is computationally
efficient. While embedding representations learned from rich training data are
expressive, incompleteness and sparsity in real-world KGs can impact their
effectiveness. We aim to leverage the complementary properties of both methods
to develop a hybrid model that learns both high-quality rules and embeddings
simultaneously. Our method uses a cross feedback paradigm wherein, an embedding
model is used to guide the search of a rule mining system to mine rules and
infer new facts. These new facts are sampled and further used to refine the
embedding model. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show the
effectiveness of our method over other competitive standalone and hybrid
baselines. We also show its efficacy in a sparse KG setting and finally explore
the connection with negative sampling.

traits largely neglecting relational facets of personality. This study aims to
address this gap by providing a prediction model for a holistic personality
profiling in OSNs that included socio-relational traits (attachment
orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we
first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of
features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from OSN accounts of
users. Then, we designed a machine learning model that predicts scores for the
psychological traits of the users based on the extracted features. The proposed
model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychological
theory, i.e, utilizing interrelations among personality facets, and leads to
increased accuracy in comparison with the state of the art approaches. To
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model to two
datasets, one of random OSN users and one of organizational leaders, and
compared their psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two
groups can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles,
which opens a promising direction for future research on OSN user

severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI
was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we
explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health
outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index
indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class,
24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low.
Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of
economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling takes advantage of both the
well-established field of statistical analysis and the fast-evolving domain of
machine learning. C19VI provides an accurate and more reliable way to measure
county level vulnerability in the United States. This index aims at helping
emergency planners to develop more effective mitigation strategies especially
for the disproportionately impacted communities.

however it is challenging to measure fracture properties of a-C from
nano-indentation tests and results of reported experiments are not consistent.
Here, we use atomic-scale simulations to make quantitative and mechanistic
predictions on fracture of a-C. Systematic large-scale K-field controlled
atomic-scale simulations of crack propagation are performed for a-C samples
with densities of $\rho=2.5, \, 3.0 \, \text{ and } 3.5~\text{g/cm}^{3}$
created by liquid quenches for a range of quench rates $\dot{T}_q = 10 -
1000~\text{K/ps}$. The simulations show that the crack propagates by
nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids. Distances of $ \approx 1\,
\text{nm}$ between nucleated voids result in a brittle-like fracture toughness.
We use a crack growth criterion proposed by Drugan, Rice \& Sham to estimate
steady-state fracture toughness based on our short crack-length fracture
simulations. Fracture toughness values of $2.4-6.0\,\text{MPa}\sqrt{\text{m}}$
for initiation and $3-10\,\text{MPa}\sqrt{\text{m}}$ for the steady-state crack
growth are within the experimentally reported range. These findings demonstrate
that atomic-scale simulations can provide quantitatively predictive results
even for fracture of materials with a ductile crack propagation mechanism.

evaluation of the fractional derivatives. These important merits distinguish it
from other numerical methods for fractional PDEs. Moreover, our method is
simple and easy to handle complex geometry and local refinement, and its
computer program implementation remains the same for any dimension $d \ge 1$.
Extensive numerical experiments are provided to study the performance of our
method in both approximating the Dirichlet Laplace operators and solving PDE
problems. Compared to the recently proposed Wendland RBF method, our method
exactly incorporates the Dirichlet boundary conditions into the scheme and is
free of the Gibbs phenomenon as observed in the literature. Our studies suggest
that to obtain good accuracy the shape parameter cannot be too small or too
big, and the optimal shape parameter might depend on the RBF center points and

we characterize the $d$-parameters associated with the (111) and (100) crystal

effects arising due to electron wave function spill-out and the
surface-projected band gap emerging from atomic-layer corrugation. We then show
that the extracted $d$-parameters can be straightforwardly applied to describe
the optical response of various nanoscale metal morphologies of interest,
including metallic ultra-thin films, graphene-metal heterostructures hosting
extremely confined acoustic graphene plasmons, and crystallographic faceted
metallic nanoparticles supporting localized surface plasmons. The tabulated
$d$-parameters reported here can circumvent computationally expensive

of heavy nuclei to zeros of $L$-functions. While most ensembles studied have
continuous spectral distribution, Burkhardt et al introduced the ensemble of
$k$-checkerboard matrices, a variation of Wigner matrices with entries in
generalized checkerboard patterns fixed and constant. In this family, $N-k$ of
the eigenvalues are of size $O(\sqrt{N})$ and were called bulk while the rest
are tightly contrained around a multiple of $N$ and were called blip.
  We extend their work by allowing the fixed entries to take different constant
values. We can construct ensembles with blip eigenvalues at any multiples of
$N$ we want with any multiplicity (thus we can have the blips occur at
sequences such as the primes or the Fibonaccis). The presence of multiple blips
creates technical challenges to separate them and to look at only one blip at a
time. We overcome this by choosing a suitable weight function which allows us
to localize at each blip, and then exploiting cancellation to deal with the
resulting combinatorics to determine the average moments of the ensemble; we
then apply standard methods from probability to prove that almost surely the
limiting distributions of the matrices converge to the average behavior as the
matrix size tends to infinity. For blips with just one eigenvalue in the limit
we have convergence to a Dirac delta spike, while if there are $k$ eigenvalues
in a blip we again obtain hollow $k \times k$ GOE behavior.

treatment effects (HTE) - average treatment effects within strata of another
variable of interest such as levels of a biomarker, education, or age strata.
Inference involves estimating a stratum-specific regression and integrating it
over the distribution of confounders in that stratum - which itself must be
estimated. Standard practice involves estimating these stratum-specific
confounder distributions independently (e.g. via the empirical distribution or
Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap), which becomes problematic for sparsely populated
strata with few observed confounder vectors. In this paper, we develop a
nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian bootstrap (HBB) prior over the
stratum-specific confounder distributions for HTE estimation. The HBB partially
pools the stratum-specific distributions, thereby allowing principled borrowing
of confounder information across strata when sparsity is a concern. We show
that posterior inference under the HBB can yield efficiency gains over standard
marginalization approaches while avoiding strong parametric assumptions about
the confounder distribution. We use our approach to estimate the adverse event
risk of proton versus photon chemoradiotherapy across various cancer types.

classified by their stellar mass and position relative to the main-sequence
relation (on, above, below). Among all the CO emission lines, from \cotwoone to
CO(6-5), with redshifts accessible via the ASPECS Band~3 and the MUSE data,
\cotwoone provides the strongest constraints on the molecular gas content. We
detect \cotwoone emission in galaxies down to stellar masses of
$\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}=10.0$. Below this stellar mass, we present a new
constraint on the molecular gas content of $z\sim1.5$ main-sequence galaxies by
stacking based on the MUSE detections. We find that the molecular gas mass of
main-sequence galaxies continuously decreases with stellar mass down to
$\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}\approx9.0$. Assuming a metallicity-based CO--to--$\rm H_2$
conversion factor, the molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratio from
$\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}\sim9.0$ to $\sim10.0$ does not seem to decrease as fast as
for $\log{(M_*/M_\odot)}>10.0$, which is in line with simulations and studies

form of photometric transits in some WDs. Planets might be responsible for
scattering minor bodies that can reach stargazing orbits, where the tidal
forces of the WD can disrupt them and enhance the chances of debris to fall
onto the WD surface. The planet-planet scattering process can be triggered by
the stellar mass-loss during the post main-sequence evolution of planetary
systems. In this work, we continue the exploration of the dynamical
instabilities that can lead to WD pollution. In a previous work we explored
two-planet systems found around main-sequence (MS) stars and here we extend the
study to three-planet system architectures. We evolved 135 detected
three-planet systems orbiting MS stars to the WD phase by scaling their orbital
architectures in a way that their dynamical properties are preserved by using
the $N$-body integrator package Mercury. We find that 100 simulations (8.6 %)
are dynamically active (having planet losses, orbit crossing and scattering) on
the WD phase, where low mass planets (1-100 $\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) tend to have
instabilities in Gyr timescales while high mass planets
($>100~\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) decrease the dynamical events more rapidly as the WD
ages. Besides, 19 simulations (1.6 %) were found to have planets crossing the
Roche radius of the WD, where 9 of them had planet-star collisions. Our
three-planet simulations have an slight increase percentage of simulations that
may contribute to the WD pollution than the previous study involving two-planet
systems and have shown that planet-planet scattering is responsible of sending
planets close to the WD, where they may collide directly to the WD, become
tidally disrupted or circularize their orbits, hence producing pollution on the
WD atmosphere.

strangeness, $B$, $Q$, and $S$, charges, are calculated in the Chiral Mean
Field (CMF) model and compared to available lattice QCD data. The
susceptibilities are sensitive to the short range repulsive interactions
between different hadron species, especially to the hardcore repulsion of
hyperons. Decreasing the hyperons size, as compared to the size of the
non-strange baryons, does improve significantly the agreement of the CMF model
results with the Lattice QCD data. The electric charge-dependent
susceptibilities are sensitive to the short range repulsive volume of mesons.
The comparison with lattice QCD data suggests that strange baryons, non-strange
mesons and strange mesons have significantly smaller excluded volumes than
non-strange baryons. The CMF model with these modified hadron volumes allows
for a mainly hadronic description of the QCD susceptibilities significantly
above the chiral pseudo-critical temperature. This improved CMF model which is
based on the lattice QCD data, has been used to study the properties of both
cold QCD matter and neutron star matter. The phase structure in both cases is
essentially unchanged, i.e. a chiral first-order phase transition occurs at low
temperatures ($T_{\rm CP}\approx 17$ MeV), and hyperons survive deconfinement
to higher densities than non-strange hadrons. The neutron star maximal mass
remains close to 2.1$M_\odot$ and the mass-radius diagram is only modified

steady-rate emission point to multiple emission points that include
intermittent releases (the METEC ""R2"" tests). Additionally, we present field
measurements at an active natural gas storage facility demonstrating that the

treatment: 1) does not require decisions as to which observable systematics are

adding coherently to give rise to significant bias even if no single map leads
to a significant bias by itself; 2) characterizes both the statistical and

exploits the full spatial structure of the galaxy density field to
differentiate between cosmology-sourced and systematics-sourced fluctuations

trivially applied to any data set. The updated correlation function for the DES

statistic of the DES Y1 3$\times$2pt data set ($\Delta \chi^2 = -6.5$ with no
additional parameters). This improvement is due in nearly equal parts to both
the change in the correlation function and the added statistical and systematic

diagnosis of medical images is well established; in addition, variability in
training and attention to task among medical labelers may exacerbate this
issue. Methods for identifying and mitigating the impact of low quality labels
have been studied, but are not well characterized in medical imaging tasks. For
instance, Noisy Cross-Validation splits the training data into halves, and has
been shown to identify low-quality labels in computer vision tasks; but it has
not been applied to medical imaging tasks specifically. In this work we
introduce Stratified Noisy Cross-Validation (SNCV), an extension of noisy cross
validation. SNCV can provide estimates of confidence in model predictions by
assigning a quality score to each example; stratify labels to handle class
imbalance; and identify likely low-quality labels to analyze the causes. We
assess performance of SNCV on diagnosis of glaucoma suspect risk from retinal
fundus photographs, a clinically important yet nuanced labeling task. Using
training data from a previously-published deep learning model, we compute a
continuous quality score (QS) for each training example. We relabel 1,277
low-QS examples using a trained glaucoma specialist; the new labels agree with
the SNCV prediction over the initial label >85% of the time, indicating that
low-QS examples mostly reflect labeler errors. We then quantify the impact of
training with only high-QS labels, showing that strong model performance may be
obtained with many fewer examples. By applying the method to randomly
sub-sampled training dataset, we show that our method can reduce labelling
burden by approximately 50% while achieving model performance non-inferior to
using the full dataset on multiple held-out test sets.

imbalanced classification arising from many application domains where
high-dimensional sparse data is abundant. In such cases, each $d$ dimensional
sample has only $k$ non-zero features with $k \ll d$, and data arrives
sequentially in a streaming form. Current online AUC optimization algorithms
have high per-iteration cost $\mathcal{O}(d)$ and usually produce non-sparse
solutions in general, and hence are not suitable for handling the data
challenge mentioned above.
  In this paper, we aim to directly optimize the AUC score for high-dimensional
sparse datasets under online learning setting and propose a new algorithm,
\textsc{FTRL-AUC}. Our proposed algorithm can process data in an online fashion
with a much cheaper per-iteration cost $\mathcal{O}(k)$, making it amenable for
high-dimensional sparse streaming data analysis. Our new algorithmic design
critically depends on a novel reformulation of the U-statistics AUC objective
function as the empirical saddle point reformulation, and the innovative
introduction of the ""lazy update"" rule so that the per-iteration complexity is
dramatically reduced from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k)$. Furthermore,
\textsc{FTRL-AUC} can inherently capture sparsity more effectively by applying
a generalized Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework.
  Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsc{FTRL-AUC}
significantly improves both run time and model sparsity while achieving
competitive AUC scores compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Comparison
with the online learning method for logistic loss demonstrates that
\textsc{FTRL-AUC} achieves higher AUC scores especially when datasets are

with DFT orbitals is found to surpass the accuracy of coupled cluster singles

to engineering problems due to their complexity and running time (cost) of
matrix inversion algorithms. An optimum strategy to invert a matrix is, first,
to reduce the matrix to a simple form, only then beginning a mathematical
procedure. For symmetric matrices, the preferred simple form is tridiagonal.
This makes tridiagonal matrices of high interest in applied mathematics and
engineering problems. This study presents a time efficient, exact analytical
approach for finding the inverse, decomposition, and solving linear systems of
equations where symmetric circulant matrix appears. This matrix appears in many
researches and it is different from ordinary tridiagonal matrices as there are
two corner elements. For finding the inverse matrix, a set of matrices are
introduced that any symmetric circulant matrix could be decomposed into them.
After that, the exact analytical inverse of this set is found which gives the
inverse of circulant matrix. Moreover, solving linear equations can be carried
out using implemented decomposition where this matrix appears as a coefficient
matrix. The methods principal strength is that it is as stable as any other
direct methods (i.e., execute in a predictable number of operations). It is
straightforward, understandable, solid as a rock and an exceptionally good
psychological backup for those times when something is going wrong and you

the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory

Processing (SWAP) onboard the PRoject for Onboard Autonomy 2 (PROBA2). In
coronagraph images, a halo front is observed to be the upper counterpart of the
EUV disturbance. Based on the EUV and coronagraph images observed from three
different perspectives, we have made three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of
the wave surfaces using a new mask-fitting method. The reconstructions are
compared with those obtained from forward-fitting methods. We show that the
mask fitting method can reflect the inhomogeneous coronal medium by capturing
the concave shape of the shock wave front. Subsequently, we trace the
developing concave structure and derive the deprojected wave kinematics. The
speed of the 3D-wave nose increases from a low value below a few hundred
$\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to a maximum value of about 3800 $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$,
and then slowly decreases afterwards. The concave structure starts to
decelerate earlier and has significantly lower speeds than those of the wave
nose. We also find that the 3D-wave in the extended corona has a much higher
speed than the speed of EUV disturbances across the solar disk.

Chinese and multiple languages. Thus, we propose a lightweight scene text
recognition model named Hamming OCR. In this model, a novel Hamming classifier,

code is directly employed to replace the output embedding. We also present a
simplified transformer decoder to reduce the number of parameters by removing
the feed-forward network and using cross-layer parameter sharing technique.
Compared with traditional methods, the number of parameters in both
classification and embedding layers is independent on the size of vocabulary,
which significantly reduces the storage requirement without loss of accuracy.
Experimental results on several datasets, including four public benchmaks and a

observability, where the system does not have direct access to all relevant

set of real-world applications, but the difficulty of implementing such an

Recently, it has been demonstrated that restricting LTL synthesis to systems
with finite executions by using LTL with finite-horizon semantics (LTLf) allows
for significantly simpler implementations in practice. With the conceptual
simplicity of LTLf, it becomes possible to explore extensions such as partial
observability in practice for the first time. Previous work has analyzed the
problem of LTLf synthesis under partial observability theoretically and
suggested two possible algorithms, one with 3EXPTIME and another with 2EXPTIME
complexity. In this work, we first prove a complexity lower bound conjectured
in earlier work. Then, we complement the theoretical analysis by showing how
the two algorithms can be integrated in practice into an established framework
for LTLf synthesis. We furthermore identify a third, MSO-based, approach
enabled by this framework. Our experimental evaluation reveals very different
results from what the theory seems to suggest, with the 3EXPTIME algorithm
often outperforming the 2EXPTIME approach. Furthermore, as long as it is able
to overcome an initial memory bottleneck, the MSO-based approach can often
outperforms the others.

researchers have studied {\em good-for-games\/} (GFG) automata --
nondeterministic automata that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a
way that only depends on the past. Several applications of automata in formal
methods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic
automata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\em minimization\/}
problem for DBW and DCW is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG
B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi automata. On the other hand, minimization of GFG
co-B\""uchi automata with {\em transition-based\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs) can be
solved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set
$\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in
$\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal
deterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper
we study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe
components (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not
in $\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating
the automaton with transitions in $\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal
GFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in
polynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs),
and their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal
automata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and
implies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for
which the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton,
which do have a canonical minimal form.

handle operational uncertainties and incurring customer disutility, impeding
their wide spread adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a
new multiagent Reinforcement Learning (RL) based decision-making environment
for implementing a Real-Time Pricing (RTP) DR technique in a prosumer dominated
microgrid. The proposed technique addresses several shortcomings common to
traditional DR methods and provides significant economic benefits to the grid
operator and prosumers. To show its better efficacy, the proposed DR method is
compared to a baseline traditional operation scenario in a small-scale
microgrid system. Finally, investigations on the use of prosumers energy
storage capacity in this microgrid highlight the advantages of the proposed
method in establishing a balanced market setup.

  Correspondences for Visual Localization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual localization to compute 6DoF camera pose from a given image has wide
applications such as in robotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc. Two
kinds of descriptors are important for the visual localization. One is global
descriptors that extract the whole feature from each image. The other is local
descriptors that extract the local feature from each image patch usually
enclosing a key point. More and more methods of the visual localization have
two stages: at first to perform image retrieval by global descriptors and then
from the retrieval feedback to make 2D-3D point correspondences by local
descriptors. The two stages are in serial for most of the methods. This simple
combination has not achieved superiority of fusing local and global
descriptors. The 3D points obtained from the retrieval feedback are as the
nearest neighbor candidates of the 2D image points only by global descriptors.
Each of the 2D image points is also called a query local feature when
performing the 2D-3D point correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel
parallel search framework, which leverages advantages of both local and global
descriptors to get nearest neighbor candidates of a query local feature.
Specifically, besides using deep learning based global descriptors, we also
utilize local descriptors to construct random tree structures for obtaining
nearest neighbor candidates of the query local feature. We propose a new
probabilistic model and a new deep learning based local descriptor when
constructing the random trees. A weighted Hamming regularization term to keep
discriminativeness after binarization is given in the loss function for the
proposed local descriptor. The loss function co-trains both real and binary
descriptors of which the results are integrated into the random trees.

The objective is to minimize the fixed cost of establishing the MF fleet plus a
risk measure (expectation or mean conditional value-at-risk) of the operational
cost over all demand distributions defined by an ambiguity set. In the first
model, we use an ambiguity set based on the demand's mean, support, and mean

Aims. Our study investigates whether there are correlations in the periodic
behavior of Type III radio bursts, indicative of non-thermal electron
acceleration processes, and coronal EUV emission, assessing heating and
cooling, in an active region when there are no large flares. Methods. We use
coordinated observations of Type III radio bursts from the FIELDS instrument on
Parker Solar Probe (PSP), of extreme ultraviolet emissions by the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA and white light observations by SDO/HMI, and of
solar flare x-rays by Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) on April
12, 2019. Several methods for assessing periodicities are utilized and compared
to validate periods obtained. Results. Periodicities of about 5 minutes in the
EUV in several areas of an active region are well correlated with the
repetition rate of the Type III radio bursts observed on both PSP and Wind.
Detrended 211A and 171A light curves show periodic profiles in multiple
locations, with 171A peaks lagging those seen in 211A. This is suggestive of
impulsive events that result in heating and then cooling in the lower corona.
NuSTAR x-rays provide evidence for at least one microflare during the interval
of Type III bursts, but there is not a one-to-one correspondence between the
x-rays and the Type-III bursts. Our study provides evidence for periodic
acceleration of non-thermal electrons (required to generate Type III radio
bursts) when there were no observable flares either in the x-ray data or the
EUV. The acceleration process, therefore, must be associated with small
impulsive events, perhaps nanoflares.

seeking human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The
problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization program where the upper level
optimizes the dynamic toll rates using the network fundamental diagram (NFD)
and the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic
assignment model (SBDTA) considering different combinations of SO-seeking CAVs.
We apply a feedback-based controller to solve for the optimal spatially
differentiated distance-based congestion charge from which SO-seeking CAVs are
exempt; but UE-seeking HVs are subject to the charge for entering the city
center. To capture the distinct microscopic behavior of CAVs in the mixed
autonomy traffic, we also implement an adaptive link fundamental diagram (FD)
within the SBDTA model. The proposed joint control scheme encourages CAV owners
to seek SO routing resulting in less total system travel time. It also
discourages UE-seeking HVs from congesting the city center. We demonstrate the

explained by the weakening of the wall-blocking effect and by the appearance of
a slip velocity at the interface of the porous medium, which reduces the shear
rate in the channel. Therefore, particle rotation and the consequent velocity

a closed set of equations for the suspension viscosity, which can be used to

and the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a metal for a set of quantum-critical (QC)
systems with an effective dynamical electron-electron interaction $V(\Omega_m)
\propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma$-model). In previous papers we
studied the cases $0<\gamma <1$ and $\gamma \approx 1$. We argued that the
pairing by a gapless boson is fundamentally different from BCS/Eliashberg
pairing by a massive boson as for the former there exists an infinite number of
topologically distinct solutions for the gap function $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ at
$T=0$ ($n=0,1,2...$), each with its own condensation energy $E_{c,n}$. Here we
extend the analysis to larger $1< \gamma <2$. We argue that the discrete set of
solutions survives, and the spectrum of $E_{c,n}$ gets progressively denser as
$\gamma$ approaches $2$ and eventually becomes continuous at $\gamma \to 2$.
This increases the strength of ""longitudinal"" gap fluctuations, which tend to
reduce the actual superconducting $T_c$ and give rise to a pseudogap region of
preformed pairs. We also detect two features on the real axis for $\gamma >1$
which become critical at $\gamma\to 2$. First, the density of states evolves
towards a set of discrete $\delta-$functions. Second, an array of dynamical
vortices emerges in the upper frequency half-plane. These two features come
about because on a real axis, the real part of the interaction, $V' (\Omega)
\propto \cos(\pi \gamma/2)/|\Omega|^\gamma$, becomes repulsive for $\gamma >1$,
and the imaginary $V^{''} (\Omega) \propto \sin(\pi \gamma/2)/|\Omega|^\gamma$,
gets progressively smaller at $\gamma \to 2$. The features on the real axis are
consistent with the development of a continuum spectrum of $E_{c,n}$ obtained
using $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ on the Matsubara axis. We consider the case $\gamma
=2$ separately in the next paper.

attacks have shed light on a vulnerability in federated learning, which inject
poisoned data into certain DIs to corrupt the availability of the federated

the privacy of DIs and the availability of the final federated model. In this

Concretely, SFPA provides privacy-preserving random forest-based federated

confidentiality of DI-related information. Meanwhile, a secure defense strategy

addressed by a quantum computer. Previously, we have shown that the H-SEARCH;
which is the problem of finding a Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) among all possible
binary matrices of corresponding order, is a hard problem that can be solved by
a quantum computer. However, due to the limitation on the number of qubits and
connections in present day quantum processors, only low orders H-SEARCH are
implementable. In this paper, we show that by adopting classical
construction/search techniques of the H-matrix, we can develop new quantum
computing methods to find higher order H-matrices. Especially, the Turyn-based
quantum computing method can be further developed to find an arbitrarily high
order H-matrix by balancing the classical and quantum resources. This method is
potentially capable to find some unknown H-matrices of practical and scientific
interests, where a classical computer alone cannot do because of the
exponential grow of the complexity. We present some results of finding H-matrix
of order more than one hundred and a prototypical experiment to find even
higher order matrix by using the classical-quantum resource balancing method.
Although heuristic optimizations generally only achieve approximate solutions,
whereas the exact one should be determined by exhaustive listing; which is
difficult to perform, in the H-SEARCH we can assure such exactness in
polynomial time by checking the orthogonality of the solution. Since quantum
advantage over the classical computing should have been measured by comparing
the performance in solving a problem up to a definitive solution, the proposed
method may lead to an alternate route for demonstrating practical quantum
supremacy in the near future.

white dwarf, but the mass of their progenitors is still an open problem. In
near-Chandrasekhar-mass (near-M_Ch) models of SNe Ia, the central density
reaches >10^9 g cm^{-3}. The electron chemical potential becomes higher than
the Q-values of electron capture (EC) transitions between fp-shell nuclei, so a
portion of the available electrons is captured by iron group elements and thus
neutron-rich isotopes are formed. Since EC reaction rates are sensitive to the
density, the degree of neutronization is a key to distinguish near- and
sub-M_Ch models. In order to compare observations and theoretical models, an
accurate treatment of EC reactions is necessary. In previous theoretical works,
however, effects of electron screening on ECs are ignored. Screening lowers EC
rates and thus leads to a higher electron fraction. We implement electron
screening on ECs to calculate explosive SN Ia nucleosynthesis in a near-M_Ch
single degenerate model. It is found that some of neutron-rich nuclear
abundances, namely those of 46,48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, 58Fe, 64Ni and 67,70Zn,
decrease when screening effects on ECs are considered. Of these, 50Ti, 54Cr and
58Fe are particularly interesting because a significant portion of the solar
abundance of these nuclei is presumed to originate from SNe Ia. We conclude
that implementing the screening effect on ECs in modern SN Ia models is
desirable to precisely calculate abundances of neutron-rich nuclides.

standard approach considers that the irreversibility of this phenomenon is the
result of an additional term in the backward Hamiltonian. Here, we use the
non-Hermitian formalism, where the time evolution is non-unitary. Additionally,
we compare the characteristic decay times of this phenomenon with the
decoherence ones. We conclude that the Loschmidt echo and the decoherence can
be considered as two aspects of the same phenomenon, and that there is a
mathematical relationship between their corresponding characteristic times.

However, very few studies have focused on hierarchical feature extraction and
explore the association between the hierarchical labels and the text. In this
paper, we propose a Label-based Attention for Hierarchical Mutlti-label Text

module is designed to hierarchically extract important information from the
text based on the labels from different hierarchy levels. Besides, hierarchical
information is shared across levels while preserving the hierarchical
label-based information. Separate local and global document embeddings are
obtained and used to facilitate the respective local and global
classifications. In our experiments, LA-HCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
neural network-based HMTC algorithms on four public HMTC datasets. The ablation
study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed label-based attention
module as well as the novel local and global embeddings and classifications. By
visualizing the learned attention (words), we find that LA-HCN is able to
extract meaningful information corresponding to the different labels which
provides explainability that may be helpful for the human analyst.

trained with the samples of benign and intrusive network traffic. Training
samples belong to either majority or minority classes depending upon the number
of available instances. Majority classes consist of abundant samples for the
normal traffic as well as for recurrent intrusions. Whereas, minority classes
include fewer samples for unknown events or infrequent intrusions. NIDSs
trained on such imbalanced data tend to give biased predictions against
minority attack classes, causing undetected or misclassified intrusions. Past
research works handled this class imbalance problem using data-level approaches
that either increase minority class samples or decrease majority class samples
in the training data set. Although these data-level balancing approaches
indirectly improve the performance of NIDSs, they do not address the underlying
issue in NIDSs i.e. they are unable to identify attacks having limited training
data only. This paper proposes an algorithm-level approach called I-SiamIDS,
which is a two-layer ensemble for handling class imbalance problem. I-SiamIDS
identifies both majority and minority classes at the algorithm-level without
using any data-level balancing techniques. The first layer of I-SiamIDS uses an
ensemble of b-XGBoost, Siamese-NN and DNN for hierarchical filtration of input
samples to identify attacks. These attacks are then sent to the second layer of
I-SiamIDS for classification into different attack classes using m-XGBoost. As
compared to its counterparts, I-SiamIDS showed significant improvement in terms
of Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score and values of AUC for both NSL-KDD and
CIDDS-001 datasets. To further strengthen the results, computational cost

their rates can be calculated with very small theoretical uncertainties.These

propose an efficient convolutional neural network architecture for video

attention mechanism in a global perspective to consider pairwise temporal

it models the relations within paired frames as well as the relations among all
pairs, thus capturing the global attention across all frames of one video; 2)
it reflects the importance of each frame to the whole video, leading to diverse
attention on these frames. Thus, SUM-GDA is beneficial for generating diverse
frames to form satisfactory video summary. Extensive experiments on three data

extension outperform other competing state-of-the-art methods with remarkable

sample size. In our model a sample is described by a one-dimensional finite
lattice on which Fermi particles injected at both ends move under various
potentials and noise from the environment. We obtain a simple current formula.
The formula has broad applicability and is used to study various potentials.
When the noise is absent, it provides the asymptotic behavior of the current in
terms of a transfer matrix. In particular, for dynamically defined potential
cases, a relation between exponential decay of the current and the Lyapunov
exponent of a relevant transfer matrix is obtained. For example, it is shown
that the current decays exponentially for the Anderson model. On the other
hand, when the noise exists but the potential does not, an explicit form of the
current is obtained, which scales as 1/N for large sample size N. Moreover, we
provide an extension to higher dimensional systems. For a three-dimensional
case, it is shown that the current increases in proportion to cross section and
decreases in inverse proportion to the length of the sample.

the specific gain that camera images can bring to 3D detection is seldom
explored by previous works. Second, many fusion algorithms run slowly, which is
essential for applications with high real-time requirements(autonomous
driving). To this end, we propose an end-to-end trainable single-stage
multi-modal feature adaptive network in this paper, which uses image
information to effectively reduce false positive of 3D detection and has a fast
detection speed. A multi-modal adaptive feature fusion module based on channel
attention mechanism is proposed to enable the network to adaptively use the
feature of each modal. Based on the above mechanism, two fusion technologies
are proposed to adapt to different usage scenarios: PointAttentionFusion is
suitable for filtering simple false positive and faster; DenseAttentionFusion
is suitable for filtering more difficult false positive and has better overall
performance. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate significant
improvement in filtering false positive over the approach using only point

and has the fastest speed compared to the published state-of-the-art

areas of robotics research. Inverse kinematic (IK) solvers have been explored
as a solution to provide kinematic structures with anthropomorphic movements.
In particular, numeric solvers based on geometry, such as FABRIK, have shown
potential for producing human-like motion at a low computational cost.
Nevertheless, these methods have shown limitations when solving for robot
kinematic constraints. This work proposes a framework inspired by FABRIK for
human pose imitation in real-time. The goal is to mitigate the problems of the
original algorithm while retaining the resulting humanlike fluidity and low
cost. We first propose a human constraint model for pose imitation. Then, we
present a pose imitation algorithm (PIC), and it's soft version (PICs) that can
successfully imitate human poses using the proposed constraint system. PIC was
tested on two collaborative robots (Baxter and YuMi). Fifty human
demonstrations were collected for a bi-manual assembly and an incision task.
Then, two performance metrics were obtained for both robots: pose accuracy with
respect to the human and the percentage of environment occlusion/obstruction.
The performance of PIC and PICs was compared against the numerical solver
baseline (FABRIK). The proposed algorithms achieve a higher pose accuracy than
FABRIK for both tasks (25%-FABRIK, 53%-PICs, 58%-PICs). In addition, PIC and
it's soft version achieve a lower percentage of occlusion during incision
(10%-FABRIK, 4%-PICs, 9%-PICs). These results indicate that the PIC method can
reproduce human poses and achieve key desired effects of human imitation.

holes, quasiblack holes, and other electrically charged compact objects are
investigated in the present work. The compact objects are obtained by solving
the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations assuming spherical symmetry in a
static spacetime. The spacetime is split in two regions by a spherical surface
of coordinate radius $a$. The interior region contains a nonisotropic charged
fluid with a de Sitter type equation of state, $p_r = -\rho_m$, $p_r$ and
$\rho_m$ being respectively the radial pressure and the energy density of the
fluid. The charge distribution is chosen as a well behaved power-law function.
The exterior region is the electrovacuum Reissner-Nordstr\""om metric, which is
joined to the interior metric through a spherical thin shell (a thin matter
layer) placed at the radius $a$. The matter of the shell is assumed to be a
perfect fluid satisfying a linear barotropic equation of state, ${\cal
P}=\omega\sigma$, with ${\cal P}$ and $\sigma$ being respectively the pressure
and energy density of the shell, with $\omega$ being a constant. The exact
solutions obtained are analyzed in some detail by exploring the interesting
regions of parameter space, complementing the analysis of previous works on
similar models. This is the first important contribution of the present study.
The stability of the solutions are then investigated considering perturbations
around the equilibrium position of the shell. This is the second and the most
important contribution of this work. We find that there are stable objects in
relatively large regions of the parameter space. In particular, there are
stable regular black holes for all values of the parameter $\omega$ of
interest. Other stable ultracompact objects as quasiblack holes, gravastars,
and even overcharged stars are allowed in certain regions of the parameter
space.

that cannot yet be captured. But learning incrementally leads to the
catastrophic forgetting problem that historical knowledge is overwritten by
newly learned knowledge. Therefore, it is important to train GNN model to learn
new patterns and maintain existing patterns simultaneously, which few works

approximation algorithm to detect new coming patterns efficiently based on
information propagation. Secondly, we combine two perspectives of data
replaying and model regularization for existing pattern consolidation.
Specially, a hierarchy-importance sampling strategy for nodes is designed and a
weighted regularization term for GNN parameters is derived, achieving greater
stability and generalization of knowledge consolidation. Our model is evaluated
on real and synthetic data sets and compared with multiple baselines. The
results of node classification prove that our model can efficiently update

used to study a variety of biomedical systems and describe the physical
interactions between cells and their local surroundings. These models generally
consist of a balance equation for the cell density, one for the density of the
extracellular matrix (ECM), and a force-balance equation describing the
mechanical equilibrium of the cell-ECM system. Assuming this system can be
regarded as an isotropic linear viscoelastic material, the force-balance
equation is often defined using the Kelvin-Voigt model of linear
viscoelasticity to represent the stress-strain relation of the ECM. However,
due to the multifaceted bio-physical nature of the ECM constituents, there are
rheological aspects that cannot be effectively captured by this model and,
therefore, depending on the type of biological tissue considered, other
constitutive models of linear viscoelasticity may be better suited. In this
work, we systematically assess the pattern formation potential of different
stress-strain constitutive equations for the ECM within a mechanical model of
pattern formation in biological tissues. The results obtained through linear
stability analysis support the idea that constitutive equations capturing
viscous flow and permanent set (Maxwell model, Jeffrey model) have a pattern
formation potential much higher than the others (Kelvin-Voigt model, standard
linear solid model), further confirmed by the results of our numerical
simulations. Our findings suggest that further empirical work is required to
acquire detailed quantitative information on the mechanical properties of
components of the ECM in different biological tissues in order to furnish
mechanochemical models of pattern formation with stress-strain constitutive
equations for the ECM that provide a more faithful representation of the
underlying tissue rheology.

is considered one of the most fundamental graph mining problems in many real
applications. Despite previous efforts, existing systems face two main
challenges. First, inherent symmetry existing in patterns can introduce a large
amount of redundant computation. Second, different matching orders for a
pattern have significant performance differences and are quite hard to predict.
When these factors are mixed, this problem becomes extremely complicated. High
efficient pattern matching remains an open problem currently. To address these
challenges, we propose GraphPi, a high performance distributed pattern matching
system. GraphPi utilizes a new algorithm based on 2-cycles in group theory to
generate multiple sets of asymmetric restrictions, where each set can eliminate
redundant computation completely. We further design an accurate performance
model to determine the optimal matching order and asymmetric restriction set
for efficient pattern matching. We evaluate GraphPi on Tianhe-2A supercomputer.
Results show that GraphPi outperforms the state-ofthe-art system, by up to 105X
for 6 real-world graph datasets on a single node. We also scale GraphPi to
1,024 computing nodes (24,576 cores).

the effects of intrinsic optical phonon and extrinsic coulomb scattering caused
by charged impurities at the graphene--substrate interface. Instead of using
full-BTE solutions, we employ iterative solutions of the BTE and the
comprehensive model for the temporal evolutions of hot-carrier temperature and
hot-optical-phonon occupations to reduce computational costs. Undoped graphene
exhibits large positive photoconductivity owing to the increase in thermally
excited carriers and the reduction in charged impurity scattering. The
frequency dependencies of the photoconductivity in undoped graphene having high
concentrations of charged impurities significantly deviate from those observed
in the simple Drude model, which can be attributed to temporally varying
charged impurity scattering during terahertz (THz) probing in the hot-carrier
cooling process. Heavily doped graphene exhibits small negative
photoconductivity similar to that of the Drude model. In this case, charged
impurity scattering is substantially suppressed by the carrier-screening
effect, and the temperature dependencies of the Drude weight and optical phonon
scattering governs the negative photoconductivity. In lightly doped graphene,
the appearance of negative and positive photoconductivity depends on the
frequency and the crossover from negative photoconductivity to positive emerges
from increasing the charged impurity concentration. This indicates the change
of the dominant scattering mechanism from optical phonons to charged
impurities. Our approach provides a quantitative understanding of non-Drude
behaviors and the temporal evolution of photoconductivity in graphene.

been tackled by various generation models, such as kinematics based models and
stochastic models. In this study, we use a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to realize handwriting generation with the careful future planning
ability. In fact, the handwriting process of human beings is also supported by
their future planning ability; for example, the ability is necessary to
generate a closed trajectory like '0' because any shortsighted model, such as a
Markovian model, cannot generate it. For the algorithm, we employ generative
adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). Typical RL algorithms require the manual
definition of the reward function, which is very crucial to control the
generation process. In contrast, GAIL trains the reward function along with the
other modules of the framework. In other words, through GAIL, we can understand
the reward of the handwriting generation process from handwriting examples. Our
experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively show that the learned
reward catches the trends in handwriting generation and thus GAIL is well
suited for the acquisition of handwriting behavior.

pattern of a holographic RIS. Our analysis reveals that the beam pattern of an
ideal holographic RIS can be well approximated by that of an ultra-dense RIS,
which has a more practical hardware architecture. In addition, we propose a
closed-loop channel estimation (CE) scheme to effectively estimate the
broadband channels that characterize THz massive MIMO systems aided by
holographic RISs. The proposed CE scheme includes a downlink coarse CE stage
and an uplink finer-grained CE stage. The uplink pilot signals are judiciously
designed for obtaining good CE performance. Moreover, to reduce the pilot
overhead, we introduce a compressive sensing-based CE algorithm, which exploits
the dual sparsity of THz MIMO channels in both the angular domain and delay

the non-holographic ones, and the effectiveness of the proposed CE scheme.

processors want to reach agreement on an $\ell$-bit message or value, but up to
$t$ of the processors are dishonest or faulty. The challenge of this BA problem
lies in achieving agreement despite the presence of dishonest processors who
may arbitrarily deviate from the designed protocol. The quality of a BA
protocol is measured primarily by using the following three parameters: the
number of processors $n$ as a function of $t$ allowed (resilience); the number
of rounds (round complexity, denoted by $r$); and the total number of
communication bits (communication complexity, denoted by $b$). For any
error-free BA protocol, the known lower bounds on those three parameters are
$n\geq 3t+1$, $r\geq t+1$ and $b\geq\Omega(\max\{n\ell, nt\})$, respectively,
where a protocol that is guaranteed to be correct in all executions is said to
be error free. In this work by using coding theory, together with graph theory
and linear algebra, we design a coded BA protocol (termed as COOL) that
achieves consensus on an $\ell$-bit message with optimal resilience,
asymptotically optimal round complexity, and asymptotically optimal
communication complexity when $\ell \geq t\log t$, simultaneously. The proposed
COOL is an error-free and deterministic BA protocol that does not rely on
cryptographic technique. It is secure against computationally unbounded
adversary. With the achievable performance by the proposed COOL and the known
lower bounds, we characterize the optimal communication complexity exponent as
\[\beta^*(\alpha,\delta)=\max\{1+\alpha,1+\delta\}\] for $\beta=
\lim_{n\to\infty}\log b/\log n$, $\alpha=\lim_{n \to \infty} \log \ell/\log n$

Sr2Ca2CoMn2O9 consists of spin-chains, made of the regular stacking of one CoO6
trigonal prism with two MnO6 octahedra. The (Co2+ Mn4+ Mn4+) unit stabilizes a
(up-down-up) spin-state along the chains which are distributed on a triangular
lattice. This compound undergoes a partially disordered antiferromagnetic
transition at TN ~ 28 K. The dielectric constant exhibits a clear peak at TN
only in presence of an external magnetic field (above 5 kOe), evidencing the
presence of MD coupling, which is further confirmed by field-dependent
dielectric measurements. We argue that spatial inversion symmetry can be broken
as a result of exchange-striction along each spin chain, inducing uncompensated
local dipoles. At low temperatures, a dipolar relaxation phenomenon is
observed, bearing strong similarities with the blocking effect typical of the
spin dynamics in this compound. Such a spin-dipole relationship is referred to
as a multi-blocking effect, in relation with the concept of magnetodielectric
multiglass previously introduced for related materials.

the physical region of the parameter space. In particular, if the algorithm

builds a trace of the gauge group matrices along a closed loop in the time

liquids under planar confinement. We drive the liquid-liquid interface, which
is held together by capillary forces, out of thermodynamic equilibrium using DC
electrohydrodynamic shearing. As a result, the interface goes through multiple
spontaneous symmetry breakings, leading to various organized non-equilibrium
states. First, at low shearing, the shear-deformed interface becomes unstable
and a 1D quasi-static corrugation pattern emerges. At slightly higher shearing,
we observe topological changes that lead to emergence of active self-propulsive
fluidic filaments and filament networks, as well as ordered bicontinuous
fluidic lattices. Finally, the system transitions into active self-propulsive
droplets, quasi-stationary dissipating polygonal and toroidal droplets, and
ultimately to a chaotic active emulsion of non-coalescing droplets with complex

continuum non-equilibrium pattern formation and discrete active particles,
which are often considered separate fields of study. The diversity of observed

investigate a large class of graphs, which generalizes several classic puzzles,

efficient methods for shifting tokens to reach the desired configurations. On
the other hand, when the goal is to find a shortest sequence of shifting
operations, we show that the problem is NP-hard, even for puzzles with tokens
of only two different colors.

  Myrto Lefkopoulou Distinguished Lectureship at the Harvard T. H. Chan School
  of Public Health on September 17th 2020",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that
one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within
covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values.
Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is
often warranted because it hinges on investigators' ability to accurately
measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding.
Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with
certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that
covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding
mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims
made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions. Causal learning from
proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal
causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as
imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn
about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured
covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are
given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal
g-computation algorithm for estimation. These may be viewed as generalizations
of Robins' foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account
explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and
time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal
g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.

target? We study this question with a simple tree formation game which is
related to the well-known fair single-source connection game by Anshelevich et
al. (FOCS'04) and selfish spanning tree games by Gourv\`es and Monnot
(WINE'08). In our game agents correspond to nodes in a network that activate a
single outgoing edge to connect to the common target node (possibly via other
nodes). Agents pay for their path to the common target, and edge costs are
shared fairly among all agents using an edge. The main novelty of our model is
dynamic edge costs that depend on the in-degree of the respective endpoint.
This reflects that connecting to popular nodes that have increased internal
coordination costs is more expensive since they can charge higher prices for
their routing service.
  In contrast to related models, we show that equilibria are not guaranteed to
exist, but we prove the existence for infinitely many numbers of agents.
Moreover, we analyze the structure of equilibrium trees and employ these
insights to prove a constant upper bound on the Price of Anarchy as well as
non-trivial lower bounds on both the Price of Anarchy and the Price of
Stability. We also show that in comparison with the social optimum tree the
overall cost of an equilibrium tree is more fairly shared among the agents.
Thus, we prove that self-organization of rational agents yields on average only
slightly higher cost per agent compared to the centralized optimum, and at the
same time, it induces a more fair cost distribution. Moreover, equilibrium
trees achieve a beneficial trade-off between a low height and low maximum
degree, and hence these trees might be of independent interest from a
combinatorics point-of-view. We conclude with a discussion of promising
extensions of our model.

a set of entity-relation-matrices as the input, which quantifies the affinities
among different entities in the database. Moreover, a sampling mechanism is
carefully designed to establish a direct connection between the input and the
information captured by the output embeddings. To complete the representation
learning toolbox, we also outline a simple yet effective post-processing

(PWNe) is based on one-zone models treating the nebula as a uniform system. In
particular for the late phase of evolved systems, many of the generally used
prescriptions are based on educated guesses for which a proper assessment
lacks. Using an advanced radiative code we evaluate the systematic impact of
various parameters, like the properties of the supernova ejecta, of the inner
pulsar, as well of the ambient medium, upon the extent of the reverberation
phase of PWNe. We investigate how different prescriptions shift the starting
time of the reverberation phase, how this affects the amount of the
compression, and how much of this can be ascribable to the radiation processes.
Some critical aspects are the description of the reverse shock evolution, the
efficiency by which at later times material from the ejecta accretes onto the
swept-up shell around the PWN, and finally the density, velocity and pressure
profiles in the surrounding supernova remnant. We have explicitly treated the
cases of the Crab Nebula, and of J1834.9--0846, taken to be representatives of
the more and the less energetic pulsars, respectively. Especially for the
latter object the prediction of large compression factors is confirmed, even
larger in the presence of radiative losses, also confirming our former

train of pulses etc. are discussed. The orientation and alignment both can
occur in adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions with the rotational period of
the molecule into consideration. The discussion is mostly limited to
non-adiabatic rotational excitation (NAREX). A particular focus is put on the
so called half-cycle pulse (HCP) and square pulse (SQP). The effect of ramped
pulses is also under focus. The effect of collision on the various laser
parameters is also given concern. We summarize the current discussion by
presenting a consistent theoretical approach for describing the action of such
pulses on movement of molecules. The impact of a particular pulse shapes on the
post-pulse dynamics is calculated and analysed. The concept of alignment is
extended from one-dimensional alignment to three-dimensional alignment with the
proper choice of molecule and the polarised light. We conclude the article by
discussing the potential applications of intense laser orientation and
alignment.

6.7--7.8 Hz (quality factor 1.5--4.0). Spectral modeling resulted in inner disk
radius of $\sim$ 12--16 km with $\Gamma$ $\sim$ 2.31--2.44 indicating that disk
is close to the ISCO and a similar value of disk radius was noticed based on
the reflection model. Different methods were used to constrain the corona size

information science, requires that the quantum characteristics of the
frequency-converted photon must be the same as the input photon except for the
color. In nonlinear optics, the wave mixing effect far away from the resonance
condition is often used to realize QFC because it can prevent the vacuum field
reservoir from destroying the quantum state of the converted photon
effectively. Under conditions far away from resonance, experiments typically
require strong pump light to generate large nonlinear interactions to achieve
high-efficiency QFC. However, strong pump light often generates additional
noise photons through spontaneous Raman or parametric conversion processes.
Herein, we theoretically study another efficient QFC scheme based on a resonant
four-wave mixing system. Due to the effect of electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT), this resonant QFC scheme can greatly suppress vacuum field
noise at low light levels; consequently, the converted photon can inherit the
quantum state of the input photon with high fidelity. Our research demonstrates
that if the conversion efficiency of the EIT-based QFC is close to 100%, the
wave function and quadrature variance of the converted photon are almost the
same as the input probe photon.

coordinates in metric space, which naturally define the coarse-grained nodes.
By contrast, complex networks defy the usual techniques, due to their
small-world character and lack of explicit geometric embedding. Current network
renormalization approaches require strong assumptions (e.g. community
structure, hyperbolicity, scale-free topology), thus remaining incompatible
with generic graphs and ordinary lattices. Here we introduce a graph
renormalization scheme valid for any hierarchy of coarse-grainings, thereby
allowing for the definition of `block-nodes' across multiple scales. This
approach reveals a necessary and specific dependence of network topology on
additive hidden variables attached to nodes, plus optional dyadic factors.
Renormalizable networks turn out to be consistent with a unique specification
of the fitness model, while they are incompatible with preferential attachment,
the configuration model or the stochastic blockmodel. These results highlight a
deep conceptual distinction between scale-free and scale-invariant networks,
and provide a geometry-free route to renormalization. If the hidden variables
are annealed, they lead to realistic scale-free networks with density-dependent
cut-off, assortatitivy and finite local clustering, even in the sparse regime
and in absence of geometry. If they are quenched, they can guide the
renormalization of real-world networks with node attributes and
distance-dependence or communities. As an application, we derive an accurate
multiscale model of the International Trade Network applicable across
hierarchically nested geographic partitions.

an effective model for the two-dimensional (2D) surface states by starting from
a three-dimensional (3D) Hamiltonian for bulk MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and taking into

that the diminished surface gap may be caused by a much smaller and more

the surface states are mainly embedded in the first two septuple layers from
the terminating surface. From our analytical results, the influence of the bulk

  To describe the topology and geometry of a simple orbifold in terms of its
combinatorics, we focus on {\em simple handlebodies} (that is, simple orbifolds
which can be obtained from simple polytopes by gluing some disjoint specific
codimension-one faces). We prove the following two main results in terms of
combinatorics, which can be understood as ""Combinatorial Sphere Theorem"" and
""Combinatorial Flat Torus Theorem"" on simple handlebodies:
  (A) A simple handlebody is orbifold-aspherical if and only if it is flag.

orbifold-aspherical simple handlebody $Q$ if and only if it contains an

  Furthermore, based on such two results and some results of geometry, it is
shown that the existence of some curvatures on a certain manifold cover

the combinatorics of $Q$. In 3-dimensional case, together with the theory of

forms a characteristic socio-economic structure. In the model, competing
societies evolve, which themselves comprise multiple evolving families that
grow through family labour. Each family has two strategy parameters: the time
children leave the parental home and the distribution of inheritance among
siblings. The evolution of these parameters demonstrates that four basic family
systems emerge; families can become either nuclear or extended, and have either
an equal or unequal inheritance distribution. Nuclear families emerge where
land resources are sufficient, whereas extended families emerge where land
resources are limited. Equal inheritance emerges where the amount of wealth
required for a family to survive is large, whereas unequal inheritance emerges
where the required wealth is small. Analyses on the wealth distribution of
families demonstrate a higher level of poverty in extended families, and that
the accumulation of wealth is accelerated for unequal inheritance. By comparing
wealth distributions in the model with historical data, family systems are
associated with characteristic economic structures and modern social
ideologies. Empirical data analyses using the cross-cultural ethnographic

conditions, family systems, and socio-economic structures. Theoretical studies

that provide on-site personalized tourist spot recommendations. While generally
helpful, most available options offer choices based solely on static
information on places of interest without consideration of such dynamic factors
as weather, time of day, and congestion, and with a focus on helping the
tourist decide what single spot to visit next. Such limitations may prevent
visitors from optimizing the use of their limited resources (i.e., time and
money). Some existing studies allow users to calculate a semi-optimal tour
visiting multiple spots in advance, but their on-site use is difficult due to
the large computation time, no consideration of dynamic factors, etc. To deal
with this situation, we formulate a tour score approach with three components:
static tourist information on the next spot to visit, dynamic tourist
information on the next spot to visit, and an aggregate measure of satisfaction
associated with visiting the next spot and the set of subsequent spots to be
visited. Determining the tour route that produces the best overall tour score
is an NP-hard problem for which we propose three algorithms on the greedy
method. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we applied the
three algorithms to 20 points of interest in Higashiyama, Kyoto, Japan, and
confirmed that the output solution was superior to the model route for Kyoto,
with computation times of the three algorithms of $1.9\pm0.1$, $2.0\pm0.1$, and
$27.0\pm1.8$ s.

  contributed equally",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic few-shot font generation is a practical and widely studied problem
because manual designs are expensive and sensitive to the expertise of
designers. Existing few-shot font generation methods aim to learn to
disentangle the style and content element from a few reference glyphs, and
mainly focus on a universal style representation for each font style. However,
such approach limits the model in representing diverse local styles, and thus
makes it unsuitable to the most complicated letter system, e.g., Chinese, whose
characters consist of a varying number of components (often called ""radical"")
with a highly complex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel font
generation method by learning localized styles, namely component-wise style
representations, instead of universal styles. The proposed style
representations enable us to synthesize complex local details in text designs.
However, learning component-wise styles solely from reference glyphs is
infeasible in the few-shot font generation scenario, when a target script has a
large number of components, e.g., over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of
reference glyphs, we simplify component-wise styles by a product of component
factor and style factor, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Thanks to
the combination of strong representation and a compact factorization strategy,
our method shows remarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only
8 reference glyph images) than other state-of-the-arts, without utilizing
strong locality supervision, e.g., location of each component, skeleton, or
strokes. The source code is available at https://github.com/clovaai/lffont.

issues in physics today. Astrophysical studies and terrestrial experiments led
by ultracold neutron storage measurements have investigated neutron to
mirror-neutron oscillations and imposed constraints on the theoretical
parameters. Recently, further analysis of these ultracold neutron storage
experiments has yielded statistically significant anomalous signals that may be
interpreted as neutron to mirror-neutron oscillations, assuming nonzero mirror
magnetic fields. The neutron electric dipole moment collaboration performed a
dedicated search at the Paul Scherrer Institute and found no evidence of
neutron to mirror-neutron oscillations. Thereby, the following new lower limits
on the oscillation time were obtained: $\tau_{nn'} > 352~$s at $B'=0$ (95%

nascent research field in mapping a population of brain networks in health and
disease. Although limited, existing BNA estimation methods have several
limitations. First, they primarily rely on a similarity network diffusion and
fusion technique, which only considers node degree as a topological measure in
the cross-network diffusion process, thereby overlooking rich topological
measures of the brain network (e.g., centrality). Second, both diffusion and
fusion techniques are implemented in fully unsupervised manner, which might
decrease the discriminative power of the estimated BNAs. To fill these gaps, we
propose a supervised multi-topology network cross-diffusion (SM-netFusion)
framework for estimating a BNA satisfying : (i) well-representativeness
(captures shared traits across subjects), (ii) well-centeredness (optimally
close to all subjects), and (iii) high discriminativeness (can easily and
efficiently identify discriminative brain connections that distinguish between
two populations). For a specific class, given the cluster labels of the
training data, we learn a weighted combination of the topological diffusion
kernels derived from degree, closeness and eigenvector centrality measures in a
supervised manner. Specifically, we learn the cross-diffusion process by
normalizing the training brain networks using the learned diffusion kernels.
Our SM-netFusion produces the most centered and representative template in
comparison with its variants and state-of-the-art methods and further boosted
the classification of autistic subjects by 5-15%. SM-netFusion presents the
first work for supervised network cross-diffusion based on graph topological
measures, which can be further leveraged to design an efficient graph feature

  Deletion","3 pages, 0 figures",,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique
and a stable set. Given a graph $G$ and weight function $w: V(G) \to
\mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0}$, the Split Vertex Deletion (SVD) problem asks to find a
minimum weight set of vertices $X$ such that $G-X$ is a split graph. It is easy
to show that a graph is a split graph if and only it it does not contain a
$4$-cycle, $5$-cycle, or a two edge matching as an induced subgraph. Therefore,
SVD admits an easy $5$-approximation algorithm. On the other hand, for every
$\delta >0$, SVD does not admit a $(2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm, unless
P=NP or the Unique Games Conjecture fails.
  For every $\epsilon >0$, Lokshtanov, Misra, Panolan, Philip, and Saurabh

recently proposed to predict a set of medical images from a single modality
(e.g, FLAIR MRI from T1 MRI). However, such frameworks are primarily designed
to operate on images, limiting their generalizability to non-Euclidean
geometric data such as brain graphs. While a growing number of connectomic
studies has demonstrated the promise of including brain graphs for diagnosing
neurological disorders, no geometric deep learning work was designed for
multiple target brain graphs prediction from a source brain graph. Despite the
momentum the field of graph generation has gained in the last two years,
existing works have two critical drawbacks. First, the bulk of such works aims
to learn one model for each target domain to generate from a source domain.
Thus, they have a limited scalability in jointly predicting multiple target
domains. Second, they merely consider the global topological scale of a graph
(i.e., graph connectivity structure) and overlook the local topology at the
node scale of a graph (e.g., how central a node is in the graph). To meet these
challenges, we introduce MultiGraphGAN architecture, which not only predicts
multiple brain graphs from a single brain graph but also preserves the
topological structure of each target graph to predict. Its three core
contributions lie in: (i) designing a graph adversarial auto-encoder for
jointly predicting brain graphs from a single one, (ii) handling the mode
collapse problem of GAN by clustering the encoded source graphs and proposing a
cluster-specific decoder, (iii) introducing a topological loss to force the
reconstruction of topologically sound target brain graphs. Our MultiGraphGAN
significantly outperformed its variants thereby showing its great potential in
multi-view brain graph generation from a single graph.

a new type of mysterious variables was discovered, the so-called blue

BLAPs can be reasonably well reproduced if they are indeed such surviving

of the bulk matter at both relativistic and non-relativistic energies. We point
out that the very large $v_1$ for $D$ mesons can be generated only if there is
a longitudinal asymmetry between the bulk matter and the charm quarks and if
the latter have a large non-perturbative interaction in the QGP medium. A quite
good agreement with the data of STAR and ALICE is obtained if the diffusion
coefficient able to correctly predict the $R_{AA}(p_T)$, $v_{2}(p_T)$ and
$v_{3}(p_T)$ of $D$ meson is employed. Furthermore, the mechanism for the
build-up of the $v_1(y)$ is associated to a quite small formation time that can
be expected to be more sensitive to the initial high-temperature dependence of
the charm diffusion coefficient. We discuss also the splitting of $v_1$ for
$D^0$ and $\bar D^0$ due to the electromagnetic field that is again much larger
than the one observed for charged particles and in agreement with the data by

ionizing sources of radiation, which can be considered as analogs to the major
contributors of the reionization of the Universe in early epochs. It is
therefore of great importance to provide a reliable absolute scale for the
equivalent effective temperature (T*) for these sources. We study a sample of
local (z< 0.2) star-forming galaxies showing optical nebular HeII emission
using the so-called softness diagrams, involving emission lines of two elements
in two consecutive stages of ionization (e.g., [SII]/[SIII] vs. [OII]/[OIII]).
We use for the first time the HeI/heII ratio in these diagrams in order to
explore the higher range of T* expected in these objects.We build grids of
photoionization models covering different black-body temperatures, model
cluster atmospheres, and density-bounded geometries to explain the conditions
observed in the sample. We verified that the use of the softness diagrams
including the emission-line ratio HeI/HeII combined with black-body
photoionization models can provide an absolute scale of T* for these objects.
The application of a Bayesian-like code indicates T* in the range 50-80 kK for
the sample of galaxies, with a mean value higher than 60 kK. The average of
these high temperature values can only be reproduced using cluster model
populations with nearly metal-free stars, although such ionizing sources cannot
explain either the highest T* values, beyond 1 sigma, or the dispersion
observed in the softness diagrams. According to our photoionization models,
most sample galaxies could be affected to some extent by ionizing photon
leaking, presenting a mean photon absorption fraction of 26% or higher
depending on the metallicity assumed for the ionizing cluster.

(HR) (i.e., adding new graph nodes/edges) remains unexplored although this
would circumvent the need for costly data collection and manual labelling of
anatomical brain regions (i.e. parcellation). To fill this gap, we introduce
GSR-Net (Graph Super-Resolution Network), the first super-resolution framework
operating on graph-structured data that generates high-resolution brain graphs
from low-resolution graphs. First, we adopt a U-Net like architecture based on
graph convolution, pooling and unpooling operations specific to non-Euclidean
data. However, unlike conventional U-Nets where graph nodes represent samples
and node features are mapped to a low-dimensional space (encoding and decoding
node attributes or sample features), our GSR-Net operates directly on a single
connectome: a fully connected graph where conventionally, a node denotes a
brain region, nodes have no features, and edge weights denote brain
connectivity strength between two regions of interest (ROIs). In the absence of
original node features, we initially assign identity feature vectors to each
brain ROI (node) and then leverage the learned local receptive fields to learn
node feature representations. Second, inspired by spectral theory, we break the
symmetry of the U-Net architecture by topping it up with a graph
super-resolution (GSR) layer and two graph convolutional network layers to
predict a HR graph while preserving the characteristics of the LR input. Our
proposed GSR-Net framework outperformed its variants for predicting

coupled to quantum light, described by projected low-energy models such as
those obtained within tight-binding methods. Drawing from recent results in the
field of quantum optics, we present a general approach to write down quantum
light-matter Hamiltonian in either dipole or Coulomb gauge which are explicitly
connected by a unitary transformation, thus ensuring gauge equivalence even
after projection. The projected dipole gauge Hamiltonian features a linear
light-matter coupling and an instantaneous self-interaction for the electrons,
similar to the structure in the full continuum theory. On the other hand, in
the Coulomb gauge the photon field enters in a highly non-linear way, through
phase factors that dress the electronic degrees of freedom. We show that our
approach generalises the well-known Peierls approximation, to which it reduces
when only local, on-site orbital contributions to light-matter coupling are
taken into account. As an application, we study a two-orbital model of
interacting electrons coupled to a uniform cavity mode, recently studied in the
context of excitonic superradiance and associated no-go theorems. Using both
gauges we recover the absence of superradiant phase in the ground state and
show that excitations on top of it, described by polariton modes, contain
instead non-trivial light-matter entanglement. Our results highlight the
importance of treating the non-linear light-matter interaction of the Coulomb
gauge non-perturbatively, to obtain a well-defined ultrastrong coupling limit

requirements with minimal performance degradation. Conventional wisdom of
pruning algorithms suggests that: (1) Pruning methods exploit information from
training data to find good subnetworks; (2) The architecture of the pruned
network is crucial for good performance. In this paper, we conduct sanity
checks for the above beliefs on several recent unstructured pruning methods and
surprisingly find that: (1) A set of methods which aims to find good
subnetworks of the randomly-initialized network (which we call ""initial
tickets""), hardly exploits any information from the training data; (2) For the
pruned networks obtained by these methods, randomly changing the preserved
weights in each layer, while keeping the total number of preserved weights
unchanged per layer, does not affect the final performance. These findings
inspire us to choose a series of simple \emph{data-independent} prune ratios
for each layer, and randomly prune each layer accordingly to get a subnetwork
(which we call ""random tickets""). Experimental results show that our zero-shot
random tickets outperform or attain a similar performance compared to existing
""initial tickets"". In addition, we identify one existing pruning method that
passes our sanity checks. We hybridize the ratios in our random ticket with
this method and propose a new method called ""hybrid tickets"", which achieves
further improvement. (Our code is publicly available at

through the use of a bivariate logistic dependence structure while maintaining
generalized extreme value (GEV) marginal distributions. Modeling dependence in
this manner allows us to better estimate extreme quantiles when block maxima
exhibit short-ranged dependence. We demonstrate via a simulation study that our
first-order Markov GEV model performs well when successive block maxima are

apply our method to two polar annual minimum air temperature data sets that

selection step in using Euclidean or learned similarity measure between
vectorized training and testing brain networks. Such sample connectomic
representation might include irrelevant and redundant features that could
mislead the training sample selection step. Undoubtedly, this fails to exploit
and preserve the topology of the brain connectome. To overcome this major
drawback, we propose Residual Embedding Similarity-Based Network selection
(RESNets) for predicting brain network evolution trajectory from a single
timepoint. RESNets first learns a compact geometric embedding of each training
and testing sample using adversarial connectome embedding network. This nicely
reduces the high-dimensionality of brain networks while preserving their
topological properties via graph convolutional networks. Next, to compute the
similarity between subjects, we introduce the concept of a connectional brain
template (CBT), a fixed network reference, where we further represent each
training and testing network as a deviation from the reference CBT in the
embedding space. As such, we select the most similar training subjects to the
testing subject at baseline by comparing their learned residual embeddings with
respect to the pre-defined CBT. Once the best training samples are selected at
baseline, we simply average their corresponding brain networks at follow-up
timepoints to predict the evolution trajectory of the testing network. Our
experiments on both healthy and disordered brain networks demonstrate the
success of our proposed method in comparison to RESNets ablated versions and

Another example is constraint dominance programming (CDP), in which search is
organized into a sequence of levels. The contribution of this work is to enable
a native interaction between SAT solvers and the automated modelling system
Savile Row to support efficient incremental modelling and solving. This allows
adding new decision variables, posting new constraints and removing existing
constraints (via assumptions) between incremental steps. Two additional
benefits of the native coupling of modelling and solving are the ability to
retain learned information between SAT solver calls and to enable SAT

gland in MR images can support the clinical assessment of prostate cancer, as
well as the planning and monitoring of focal and loco-regional therapeutic
interventions. Despite the availability of multi-planar MR scans due to
standardized protocols, the majority of segmentation approaches presented in
the literature consider the axial scans only. Methods: We propose an
anisotropic 3D multi-stream CNN architecture, which processes additional scan
directions to produce a higher-resolution isotropic prostate segmentation. We
investigate two variants of our architecture, which work on two (dual-plane)
and three (triple-plane) image orientations, respectively. We compare them with
the standard baseline (single-plane) used in literature, i.e., plain axial
segmentation. To realize a fair comparison, we employ a hyperparameter
optimization strategy to select optimal configurations for the individual
approaches. Results: Training and evaluation on two datasets spanning multiple
sites obtain statistical significant improvement over the plain axial
segmentation ($p<0.05$ on the Dice similarity coefficient). The improvement can
be observed especially at the base ($0.898$ single-plane vs. $0.906$
triple-plane) and apex ($0.888$ single-plane vs. $0.901$ dual-plane).
Conclusion: This study indicates that models employing two or three scan
directions are superior to plain axial segmentation. The knowledge of precise
boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures.
Thus, the proposed models have the potential to improve the outcome of prostate
cancer diagnosis and therapies.

star has high luminosity (>10$^{5.75}$ L_Sun), ensuring supergiant status, has
a temperature similar to LBVs, is photometrically and spectroscopically
variable, and is surrounded by warm dust. Its near-infrared spectrum shows the

the new classification is the fact that we compute a new distance and

underlying mechanism for PL enhancement by these treatments is not clear, which
prevents a rational design of passivation strategies. In this work, a simple

using a family of cation donors, which we show to be much more effective than

We develop a detailed mechanistic picture for the action of these cation donors
and demonstrate that one of them, Li-TFSI (bistriflimide), enhances the PL of
both MoS2 and WS2 to a level double that compared to the widely discussed and
currently best performing super acid H-TFSI treatment. In addition, the ionic
salts used in chemical treatments are compatible with a range of greener
solvents and are easier to handle than super-acids, which provides the
possibility of directly treating TMDSs during device fabrication. This work
sets up rational selection rules for ionic chemicals to passivate TMDSs and

environment depends on Planck's constant, as well as the temperature. At high
temperatures, the Weyl representation, that is, the thermal Wigner function,
becomes indistinguishable from the corresponding classical distribution in
phase space, whereas the low temperature limit singles out the quantum ground
state of the system's Hamiltonian. In all regimes, thermal averages of
arbitrary observables are evaluated by integrals, as if the thermal Wigner
function were a classical distribution.
  The extension of the semiclassical approximation for quantum propagators to
an imaginary thermal time, bridges the complex intervening region between the
high and the low temperature limit. This leads to a simple quantum correction
to the classical high temperature regime, irrespective of whether the motion is
regular or chaotic. A variant of the full semiclassical approximation with a
real thermal time, though in a doubled phase space, avoids any search for
particular trajectories in the evaluation of thermal averages. The double

the cosmic density of stellar mass, star formation rate and atomic gas (HI), to
constrain the evolution of baryons associated with galaxies averaged over
cosmic time and space. The cosmic HI and H_2 densities are roughly equal at
z~1.5. The H_2 density then decreases by a factor 6^{+3}_{-2} to today's value,
whereas the HI density stays approximately constant. The stellar mass density
is increasing continuously with time and surpasses that of the total gas
density (HI and H_2) at redshift z~1.5. The growth in stellar mass cannot be
accounted for by the decrease in cosmic H_2 density, necessitating significant
accretion of additional gas onto galaxies. With the new H_2 constraints, we
postulate and put observational constraints on a two step gas accretion
process: (i) a net infall of ionized gas from the intergalactic/circumgalactic
medium to refuel the extended HI reservoirs, and (ii) a net inflow of HI and
subsequent conversion to H_2 in the galaxy centers. Both the infall and inflow
rate densities have decreased by almost an order of magnitude since z~2.
Assuming that the current trends continue, the cosmic molecular gas density
will further decrease by about a factor of two over the next 5 Gyr, the stellar
mass will increase by approximately 10%, and cosmic star formation activity
will decline steadily toward zero, as the gas infall and accretion shut down.

Suppressing the nonlinear effects of a reset element for the desired frequency
range while maintaining it for the rest is beneficial, especially when it is
used in the framework of a ""Constant in gain, Lead in phase"" (CgLp) filter.
CgLp is a newly introduced nonlinear filter, bound to circumvent the well-known
linear control limitation -- the waterbed effect. The ideal behaviour of such a
filter in the frequency domain is unity gain while providing a phase lead for a
broad range of frequencies. However, CgLp's ideal behaviour is based on the
describing function, which is a first-order approximation that neglects the
effects of the higher-order harmonics in the output of the filter. Although
CgLp is fundamentally a nonlinear filter, its nonlinearity is not required for
all frequencies. Thus, it is shown in this paper that using the proposed reset
element architecture, CgLp gets closer to its ideal behaviour for a range of
frequencies, and its performance will be improved accordingly.

input and output texts. In this approach, each sequence-to-sequence
transduction is represented as a sequence of edit operations, where each
operation either replaces an entire source span with target tokens or keeps it
unchanged. We evaluate our method on five NLP tasks (text normalization,
sentence fusion, sentence splitting & rephrasing, text simplification, and
grammatical error correction) and report competitive results across the board.
For grammatical error correction, our method speeds up inference by up to 5.2x
compared to full sequence models because inference time depends on the number
of edits rather than the number of target tokens. For text normalization,
sentence fusion, and grammatical error correction, our approach improves
explainability by associating each edit operation with a human-readable tag.

to be the case for the thermoelectric clathrate Ba$_8$Al$_{16}$Si$_{30}$:
Although this material exhibits a band gap in its groundstate, a
temperature-driven partial order-disorder transition leads to its effective
closing. This finding is enabled by a novel approach to calculate the
temperature-dependent effective band structure of alloys. Our method fully
accounts for the effects of short-range order and can be applied to complex
alloys with many atoms in the primitive cell, without relying on effective

collaboratively. However, when some Byzantine agents behave adversarially,
decentralized TD($\lambda$) is unable to learn an accurate linear approximation
for the true value function. We propose a trimmed-mean based

asymptotically AdS$_4$ black holes with emphasis on its efficacy to capture
higher derivative corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The formalism
has the important advantage of being based on near-horizon symmetries and does
not require knowledge of the full interpolating supergravity solution, nor of
its AdS$_4$ asymptotics. For the static case, we focus on applying the entropy
function formalism in the presence of various higher derivative terms motivated
in conformal supergravities; we find agreement with recently reported results
utilizing the full black hole solutions and Wald's entropy formula. For the
rotating case, we demonstrate that a modified version of the formalism
generates a background that coincides precisely with the Bardeen-Horowitz limit
of known rotating, electrically charged AdS$_4$ black holes and provides a
swift approach to the black hole entropy, including higher derivatives
corrections. We conclude that Sen's classical entropy function formalism is a
viable and highly efficient approach to capturing higher-derivative corrections
to the entropy of asymptotically AdS$_4$ black holes albeit naturally missing
certain relations arising from global aspects of the full black hole solution.

Lindblad master equation, with either local or global spin operators acting as
dissipative operators. Analogously to what happens at continuous quantum
transitions, we observe a regime where the system develops a nontrivial dynamic
scaling behavior, which is realized when the dissipation parameter $u$
(globally controlling the decay rate of the dissipation within the Lindblad
framework) scales as the energy difference $\Delta$ of the lowest levels of the

Cahn-Hilliard-reaction-diffusion PDE system stemming from a recently introduced
tumor growth model. The inverse problem of identifying relevant parameters is
studied here by relying on techniques from optimal control theory of PDE
systems. The parameters to be identified play the role of controls, and a
suitable cost functional of tracking-type is introduced to account for the
discrepancy between some a priori knowledge of the parameters and the controls
themselves. The analysis is carried out for several classes of models, each one
depending on a specific relaxation (of parabolic or viscous type) performed on
the original system. First-order necessary optimality conditions are obtained
on the fully relaxed system, in both the two and three-dimensional case. Then,
the optimal control problem on the non-relaxed models is tackled by means of
asymptotic arguments, by showing convergence of the respective adjoint systems
and the minimization problems as each one of the relaxing coefficients
vanishes. This allows obtaining the desired necessary optimality conditions,
hence to solve the parameter identification problem, for the original PDE
system in case of physically relevant double-well potentials.

widely modeled as a graph, is crucial for mapping dynamic interactions between
different anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) in health and disease.
Interestingly, brain graph evolution models remain almost absent in the
literature. Here we design an adversarial brain network normalizer for
representing each brain network as a transformation of a fixed centered
population-driven connectional template. Such graph normalization with respect
to a fixed reference paves the way for reliably identifying the most similar
training samples (i.e., brain graphs) to the testing sample at baseline
timepoint. The testing evolution trajectory will be then spanned by the
selected training graphs and their corresponding evolution trajectories. We
base our prediction framework on geometric deep learning which naturally
operates on graphs and nicely preserves their topological properties.
Specifically, we propose the first graph-based Generative Adversarial Network
(gGAN) that not only learns how to normalize brain graphs with respect to a
fixed connectional brain template (CBT) (i.e., a brain template that
selectively captures the most common features across a brain population) but
also learns a high-order representation of the brain graphs also called
embeddings. We use these embeddings to compute the similarity between training
and testing subjects which allows us to pick the closest training subjects at
baseline timepoint to predict the evolution of the testing brain graph over
time. A series of benchmarks against several comparison methods showed that our
proposed method achieved the lowest brain disease evolution prediction error
using a single baseline timepoint. Our gGAN code is available at

Results: We used histological and topographical identifications to observe ISF
flow along venous vessels in rabbits. By MRI in alive subjects, the inherent
ISF flow pathways in legs, abdomen and thorax were enhanced by paramagnetic
contrast from ankle dermis. By fluorescence stereomicroscopy and layer-by-layer
dissection after the rabbits were sacrificed, the perivascular and adventitial
connective tissues (PACT) along the saphenous veins and inferior vena cava were
found to be stained by sodium fluorescein from ankle dermis, which coincided
with the findings by MRI. By confocal microscopy and histological analysis, the
stained PACT pathways were verified to be the fibrous connective tissues and
consisted of longitudinally assembled fibers. By usages of nanoparticles and
surfactants, a PACT pathway was found to be accessible for a nanoparticle under
100nm and contain two parts: a tunica channel part and an absorptive part. In
real-time observations, the calculated velocity of a continuous ISF flow along
fibers of a PACT pathway was 3.6-15.6 mm/sec. Conclusion: These data further
revealed more kinetic features of a continuous ISF flow along vascular vessel.
A multiscale, multilayer, and multiform interstitial/interfacial fluid flow

of kinetic and dynamic mechanisms for ISF flow, which might be another
principal fluid dynamic pattern besides convective/vascular and diffusive

such opportunity. We develop a method for the reconstruction of the solar

method is based on the facts that the Ca II K intensity correlates well with
the unsigned magnetic flux, while the sign of the flux is derived from the
corresponding H$\alpha$ map which provides the information of the dominant
polarities. Based on this reconstructed magnetic map, we study the evolution of

analysis of the reconstructed magnetic flux provides an overall view of
magnetic field evolution: emergent magnetic flux, its further transformations
with the formation of unipolar magnetic regions (UMRs) and remnant flux surges.
We identify the reversals of the polar field and critical surges of following

can play a crucial role in driving gaseous outflows on galaxy scales. Galaxies
hosting young radio AGN, whose jets are in the first phases of expansion
through the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), are the ideal targets to
probe the energetic significance of this mechanism. In this paper, we
characterise the warm ionised gas outflows in a sample of nine young radio
sources from the 2Jy sample, combining X-shooter spectroscopy and Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) imaging data. We find that the warm outflows have similar
radial extents (~0.06-2 kpc) as radio sources, consistent with the idea that
`jet mode' AGN feedback is the dominant driver of the outflows detected in
young radio galaxies. Exploiting the broad spectral coverage of the X-shooter
data, we have used the ratios of trans-auroral emission lines of [SII] and
[OII] to estimate the electron densities, finding that most of the outflows
have gas densities ($\log( n_e~cm^{-3})~3-4.8 $), which we speculate could be
the result of compression by jet-induced shocks. Combining our estimates of the
emission-line luminosities, radii, and densities, we find that the kinetic
powers of the warm outflows are a relatively small fraction of the energies
available from the accretion of material onto the central supermassive black
hole (SMBH), reflecting AGN feedback efficiencies below 1% in most cases.
Overall, the warm outflows detected in our sample are strikingly similar to
those found in nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), but more
energetic and with a high feedback efficiencies on average than the general
population of nearby AGN of similar bolometric luminosity; this is likely to

with emerging applications in renewable energy generation, energy storage, and
electric motor drives. However, their well-known advantages come at the price
of complicated balancing, high-bandwidth isolated monitoring, and numerous
sensors that can prevent MMCs from expanding into highly cost driven markets.
Therefore, an obvious trend in research is developing control and topologies
that depend less on measurements and benefit from simpler control.
Diode-clamped topologies are considered among the more applicable solutions.
The main problem with a diode-clamped topology is that it can only balance the
module voltages of a string in one direction; therefore, it cannot provide a
completely balanced operation. This paper proposes an effective balancing
technique for the diode-clamped topology. The proposed solution exploits the dc
component of the arm current by introducing a symmetrically level-adjusted
phase-shifted modulation scheme, and ensures the balancing current flow is
always in the correct direction. The main advantages of this method are
sensorless operation, no added computation and control effort, and low overall
cost. Analysis and detailed simulations provide insight into the operation of
the system as well as the new balancing technique and the experimental results
confirm the provided discussions.

In this setting, one has to choose specific access model for the input, as the
algorithm does not have time to pre-process or even to see the whole input. A
fundamental question remained open on the relationship between the two common
models for graphs -- with and without access to the ""random edge"" query --
namely whether it is possible to sample an edge uniformly at random in the
model without access to the random edge queries.
  In this paper, we answer this question positively. Specifically, we give an
algorithm solving this problem that runs in expected time $O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}
\log n)$. This is only a logarithmic factor slower than the lower bound given
in [5]. Our algorithm uses the algorithm from [7] which we analyze in a more
careful way, leading to better bounds in general graphs. We also show a way to
sample edges $\epsilon$-close to uniform in expected time $O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}
\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$, improving upon the best previously known algorithm.
  We also note that sampling edges from a distribution sufficiently close to
uniform is sufficient to be able to simulate sublinear algorithms that use the
random edge queries while decreasing the success probability of the algorithm
only by $o(1)$. This allows for a much simpler algorithm that can be used to
emulate random edge queries.

has been studied from the theoretical and numerical point of view. First, it
has been found that friction vector decoupling causes the reduction of the
computed friction force and the rotation of the friction force vector. Second,
it has been demonstrated that decoupled-friction models lack of rotational
invariance, i.e. model results depend on the alignment of the reference

the dynamics of multistate quantum systems to a set of two-state systems and
uncoupled single states. It assumes two sets of states wherein any state in the
first set can be coupled to any state in the second set but the states within
each set are not coupled between themselves. Another important condition is the
degeneracy of the states in each set, although all couplings between the states
from different sets can be detuned from resonance by the same detuning. The
degeneracy condition limits the application of the MS transformation in various
physically interesting situations, e.g. in the presence of electric and/or
magnetic fields or light shifts, which lift the degeneracy in each set of
states, e.g. when these sets comprise the magnetic sublevels of levels with
nonzero angular momentum. This paper extends the MS transformation to such
situations, in which the states in each of the two sets are nondegenerate. To
this end, we develop an alternative way for the derivation of Morris-Shore
transformation, which can be applied to non-degenerate sets of states. We
present a generalized eigenvalue approach, by which, in the limit of small
detunings from degeneracy, we are able to generate an effective Hamiltonian
that is dynamically equivalent to the non-degenerate Hamiltonian. The effective
Hamiltonian can be mapped to the Morris-Shore basis with a two-step similarity
transformation. After the derivation of the general framework, we demonstrate
the application of this technique to the popular Lambda three-state system, and
the four-state tripod, double-Lambda and diamond systems. In all of these
systems, our formalism allows us to reduce their quantum dynamics to simpler
two-state systems even in the presence of various detunings, e.g. generated by
external fields of frequency drifts.

nonequilibrium evolutions in the model. These data were obtained following
quenches of well-equilibrated homogeneous configurations, with density close to
the critical value, to various temperatures inside the miscibility gap, having
vapor-""liquid"" as well as vapor-""solid"" coexistence. For the vapor-liquid phase
separation we observe that $\ell$, the average domain length, grows with time
($t$) as $t^{1/2}$, a behavior that has connection with hydrodynamics. At low
enough temperature, a sharp crossover of this time dependence to a much slower,
temperature dependent, growth is identified within the time scale of our
simulations, implying ""solid""-like final state of the high density phase. This
crossover is, interestingly, accompanied by strong differences in domain
morphology and other structural aspects between the two situations. For aging,
we have presented results for the order-parameter autocorrelation function.
This quantity exhibits data-collapse with respect to $\ell/\ell_w$, $\ell$ and
$\ell_w$ being the average domain lengths at times $t$ and $t_w$ ($\leq t$),
respectively, the latter being the age of a system. Corresponding scaling
function follows a power-law decay: $~\sim (\ell/\ell_w)^{-\lambda}$, for $t\gg
t_w$. The decay exponent $\lambda$, for the vapor-liquid case, is accurately
estimated via the application of an advanced finite-size scaling method. The
obtained value is observed to satisfy a bound.

a common practice in numerous multimedia applications, such as adaptive video
streaming, quality monitoring, and other digital TV applications. Here we
explore a significant, yet relatively unexplored problem: measuring perceptual
quality on videos arising from both luma and chroma distortions from
compression. Toward investigating this problem, it is important to understand
the kinds of chroma distortions that arise, how they relate to luma compression
distortions, and how they can affect perceived quality. We designed and carried
out a subjective experiment to measure subjective video quality on both luma
and chroma distortions, introduced both in isolation as well as together.
Specifically, the new subjective dataset comprises a total of $210$ videos
afflicted by distortions caused by varying levels of luma quantization
commingled with different amounts of chroma quantization. The subjective scores
were evaluated by $34$ subjects in a controlled environmental setting. Using
the newly collected subjective data, we were able to demonstrate important
shortcomings of existing video quality models, especially in regards to chroma
distortions. Further, we designed an objective video quality model which builds
on existing video quality algorithms, by considering the fidelity of chroma
channels in a principled way. We also found that this quality analysis implies
that there is room for reducing bitrate consumption in modern video codecs by
creatively increasing the compression factor on chroma channels. We believe
that this work will both encourage further research in this direction, as well
as advance progress on the ultimate goal of jointly optimizing luma and chroma
compression in modern video encoders.

networked control systems. Incident handling can be divided into five steps:
detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. For networked
control systems, the containment step can be conducted through physical
disconnection of an attacked subsystem. In accordance with the disconnection,
the equipped attack detection unit should be reconfigured to maintain its
detection capability. In particular, separating the detection subunit
associated with the disconnected subsystem is considered as a specific
reconfiguration scheme in this study. This paper poses the problem of
disconnection-aware attack detection and isolation with the separation-based
detector reconfiguration. The objective is to find an attack detection unit
that preserves its detection and isolation capability even under any possible
disconnection and separation. The difficulty arises from network topology
variation caused by disconnection that can possibly lead to stability loss of
the distributed observer inside the attack detection unit. A solution is
proposed based on an existing controller design technique referred to as
retrofit control. Furthermore, an application to low-voltage power distribution
networks with distributed generation is exhibited. Numerical examples evidence
the practical use of the proposed method through a benchmark distribution

hardware failures which leads to low resources' utilization. One way to improve
resource utilization and thus reduce the total cost of ownership is to offer
unused resources (referred to as ephemeral resources) at a lower price.
However, reselling resources needs to meet the expectations of its customers in
terms of Quality of Service. The goal is so to maximize the amount of reclaimed
resources while avoiding SLA penalties. To achieve that, cloud providers have
to estimate their future utilization to provide availability guarantees. The
prediction should consider a safety margin for resources to react to
unpredictable workloads. The challenge is to find the safety margin that
provides the best trade-off between the amount of resources to reclaim and the
risk of SLA violations. Most state-of-the-art solutions consider a fixed safety
margin for all types of metrics (e.g., CPU, RAM). However, a unique fixed
margin does not consider various workloads variations over time which may lead
to SLA violations or/and poor utilization. In order to tackle these challenges,
we propose ReLeaSER, a Reinforcement Learning strategy for optimizing the
ephemeral resources' utilization in the cloud. ReLeaSER dynamically tunes the
safety margin at the host-level for each resource metric. The strategy learns
from past prediction errors (that caused SLA violations). Our solution reduces
significantly the SLA violation penalties on average by 2.7x and up to 3.4x. It
also improves considerably the CPs' potential savings by 27.6% on average and
up to 43.6%.

we combined with archival radio and X-ray observations. We have produced a new,
resolved spectral index map of the source with a resolution of 7$''$ and we
studied the spatial correlation of radio and X-ray emission to investigate the
interplay between thermal and non-thermal plasma. The new LOFAR data have
changed our view of the Kite by discovering two steep-spectrum ($\alpha<-1.5$)
plumes of emission connected to the arcs. The spectral analysis shows, for the
first time, a spatial trend of the spectrum along the arcs with evidence of
curved synchrotron spectra and a spatial correlation with the X-ray surface
brightness. On the basis of our results, we propose that the Kite was
originally an X-shaped radio galaxy whose fossil radio plasma, after the end of
the activity of the central active galactic nucleus, has been compressed due to
motions of the thermal plasma in which it is encompassed. The interplay between
the compression and advection of the fossil plasma, with the restarting of the
nuclear activity of the central galaxy, could have enhanced the radio emission
of the fossil plasma producing the arcs of the Kite. We present also the first,
low-frequency observation of a jellyfish galaxy in the same field, in which we
detect extended, low-frequency emission without a counterpart at higher

These systems are aimed at modelling the stability of fixed points in large
systems defined on complex networks, such as, ecosystems consisting of a large
number of species that interact through a food-web. We develop an exact theory
for the spectral distribution and the leading eigenvalue of the corresponding
sparse Jacobian matrices. This theory reveals that the nature of local
interactions have a strong influence on system's stability. We show that, in
general, linear dynamical systems defined on random graphs with a prescribed
degree distribution of unbounded support are unstable if they are large enough,
implying a tradeoff between stability and diversity. Remarkably, in contrast to
the generic case, antagonistic systems that only contain interactions of the
predator-prey type can be stable in the infinite size limit. This qualitatively
feature for antagonistic systems is accompanied by a peculiar oscillatory
behaviour of the dynamical response of the system after a perturbation, when
the mean degree of the graph is small enough. Moreover, for antagonistic
systems we also find that there exist a dynamical phase transition and critical
mean degree above which the response becomes non-oscillatory.

in [1] physics-integrated (or PDE-integrated (partial differential equation))
machine learning (ML) framework is furtherly investigated. The Navier-Stokes
equations are solved using the Tensorflow ML library for Python programming
language via the Chorin's projection method. The Tensorflow solution is
integrated with a deep feedforward neural network (DFNN). Such integration
allows one to train a DFNN embedded in the Navier-Stokes equations without
having the target (labeled training) data for the direct outputs from the DFNN;
instead, the DFNN is trained on the field variables (quantities of interest),
which are solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations (velocity and pressure
fields). To demonstrate performance of the framework, two additional case
studies are formulated: 2D turbulent lid-driven cavities with predicted by a
DFNN (a) turbulent viscosity and (b) derivatives of the Reynolds stresses.
Despite its complexity and computational cost, the proposed physics-integrated
ML shows a potential to develop a ""PDE-integrated"" closure relations for
turbulent models and offers principal advantages, namely: (i) the target
outputs (labeled training data) for a DFNN might be unknown and can be
recovered using the knowledge base (PDEs); (ii) it is not necessary to extract
and preprocess information (training targets) from big data, instead it can be
extracted by PDEs; (iii) there is no need to employ a physics- or
scale-separation assumptions to build a closure model for PDEs. The advantage
(i) is demonstrated in the Part I paper [1], while the advantage (ii) is the

incrementally propagates position estimates. This makes SLAM fast but also
makes it vulnerable to local pose estimation failures. As local pose estimation
is ill-conditioned, local pose estimation failures happen regularly, making the
overall SLAM system brittle. This paper attempts to correct this problem. We
note that while local pose estimation is ill-conditioned, pose estimation over
longer sequences is well-conditioned. Thus, local pose estimation errors
eventually manifest themselves as mapping inconsistencies. When this occurs, we
save the current map and activate two new SLAM threads. One processes incoming
frames to create a new map and the other, recovery thread, backtracks to link
new and old maps together. This creates a Dual-SLAM framework that maintains
real-time performance while being robust to local pose estimation failures.
Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows Dual-SLAM can reduce failures by a
dramatic $88\%$.

the periodic kick in time-reversal symmetry breaking in-plane magnetic field
and four-fold rotational symmetry breaking mass term while these Floquet MCMs
are preserved by anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry. The first driving
protocol always leads to four zero energy MCMs (i.e. one Majorana per corner)
as a sign of a {\it{strong}} SOTSC phase. Interestingly, the second protocol
can result in a {\it{weak}} SOTSC phase, harbouring eight zero energy MCMs (two
Majorana states per corner), in addition to the {\it{strong}} SOTSC phase. We
characterize the topological nature of these phases by Floquet quadrupolar

experimental advancement in the driven systems and proximity induced

unprecedented success of machine learning models in numerous tasks, such as
machine translation, face recognition and recommendation. The majority of
existing representation learning approaches often require a large number of
consistent and noise-free labels. However, due to various reasons such as
budget constraints and privacy concerns, labels are very limited in many
real-world scenarios. Directly applying standard representation learning
approaches on small labeled data sets will easily run into over-fitting
problems and lead to sub-optimal solutions. Even worse, in some domains such as
education, the limited labels are usually annotated by multiple workers with
diverse expertise, which yields noises and inconsistency in such crowdsourcing
settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which aims to learn
effective representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels.
Specifically, we design a grouping based deep neural network to learn
embeddings from a limited number of training samples and present a Bayesian
confidence estimator to capture the inconsistency among crowdsourced labels.
Furthermore, to expedite the training process, we develop a hard example
selection procedure to adaptively pick up training examples that are
misclassified by the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world
data sets demonstrate the superiority of our framework on learning
representations from limited data with crowdsourced labels, comparing with
various state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
analysis on each of the main components of our proposed framework and also
introduce the promising results it achieved in our real production to fully
understand the proposed framework.

dense vectors. A great deal of effort has been put into using sentence
embeddings to improve several important natural language processing tasks.
Relation extraction is such an NLP task that aims at identifying structured
relations defined in a knowledge base from unstructured text. A promising and
more efficient approach would be to embed both the text and structured
knowledge in low-dimensional spaces and discover semantic alignments or
mappings between them. Although a number of techniques have been proposed in
the literature for embedding both sentences and knowledge graphs, little is
known about the structural and semantic properties of these embedding spaces in
terms of relation extraction. In this paper, we investigate the aforementioned
properties by evaluating the extent to which sentences carrying similar senses
are embedded in close proximity sub-spaces, and if we can exploit that
structure to align sentences to a knowledge graph. We propose a set of
experiments using a widely-used large-scale data set for relation extraction
and focusing on a set of key sentence embedding methods. We additionally
provide the code for reproducing these experiments at
https://github.com/akalino/semantic-structural-sentences. These embedding
methods cover a wide variety of techniques ranging from simple word embedding
combination to transformer-based BERT-style model. Our experimental results
show that different embedding spaces have different degrees of strength for the
structural and semantic properties. These results provide useful information
for developing embedding-based relation extraction methods.

water, using calorimetry. Lead occurs together with traces of radioisotopes,
e.g. Lead-210, producing $\gamma$-emissions with energies ranging from 10 keV
to several 100 keV when they decay; this range is detectable in silicon
sensors. In this paper we test a CMOS camera (Oxford Instruments Neo 5.5) for
its general performance as a detector of x-rays and low energy $\gamma$-rays
and assess its sensitivity relative to the World Health Organization upper
limit on lead in drinking water. Energies from 6 keV to 60 keV are examined.
The CMOS camera has a linear energy response over this range and its energy
resolution is for the most part slightly better than 2 %. The Neo sCMOS is not
sensitive to x-rays with energies below $\sim\!\!10 keV$. The smallest
detectable rate is 40$\pm$3 mHz, corresponding to an incident activity on the
chip of 7$\pm$4 Bq. The estimation of the incident activity sensitivity from
the detected activity relies on geometric acceptance and the measured
efficiency vs. energy. We report the efficiency measurement, which is
0.08$\pm$0.02 % (0.0011$\pm$0.0002 %) at 26.3 keV (59.5 keV). Taking
calorimetric information into account we measure a minimal detectable rate of
4$\pm$1 mHz (1.5$\pm$0.1 mHz) for 26.3 keV (59.5 keV) $\gamma$-rays, which
corresponds to an incident activity of 1.0$\pm$0.6 Bq (57$\pm$33 Bq). Toy Monte
Carlo and Geant4 simulations agree with these results. These results show this
CMOS sensor is well-suited as a $\gamma$- and x-ray detector with sensitivity
at the few to 100 ppb level for Lead-210 in a sample.

proposed. The conformation equilibrium between open (up) and closed (down)
conformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike is studied from the
first-principle. The conformational state population is deduced from the free
energy change in conformation transition of S protein. We demonstrated that the
free energy includes two parts, one from the multi-minima of conformational
potential and another from the variation of structural elasticity. Both factors
are dependent of amino acid mutation. The former is related to the change of
affinity of RBD to ACE 2 due to the mutation in the subdomain RBM (receptor
binding motif) of RBD. The latter is caused by the change of elastic energy of
S protein. When the affinity has increased significantly and/or the elastic
energy has been reduced substantially the equilibrium is biased to the open
conformation. Only then can the virus infection process continue. Possible new
SARS-CoV-2 variants from amino acid mutations in 5-9 sites on RBD interface are
predicted. The elastic energy variation needed for conformation transition is
estimated quantitatively. Taking the elastic-structural change into account
more virus variants are possible. Both the D614G mutation, the K986P mutation
and the new variants 501Y in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be interpreted
from the presented theory. The comparison of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 with
SARS-CoV-1 is made from the point of conformation equilibrium. Why the virus
entrance takes priority in lower temperature and higher humidity is interpreted
by the present theory. The conformational transition influenced by
electromagnetic field is also discussed briefly.

exploiting pseudo-gradient play and consensus-based schemes, various
distributed NE seeking algorithms are presented over either fixed or switching
communication topologies so that the convergence to the NE is reached in a
prescribed time. In particular, a prescribed-time distributed NE seeking
algorithm is firstly developed under a fixed graph to find the NE in a
prior-given and user-defined time, provided that a static controller gain can
be selected based on certain global information such as the algebraic
connectivity of the communication graph and both the Lipschitz and monotone
constants of the pseudo-gradient associated with players' objective functions.
Secondly, a prescribed-time and fully distributed NE seeking algorithm is
proposed to remove global information by designing heterogeneous dynamic gains
that turn on-line the weights of the communication topology. Further, we extend
this algorithm to accommodate jointly switching topologies. It is theoretically
proved that the global convergence of those proposed algorithms to the NE is
rigorously guaranteed in a prescribed time based on a time function
transformation approach. In the last, numerical simulation results are

Besides the cases of zeroth- and first-order tensors, most techniques focus on
symmetric second-order tensors. Only a few works concern totally symmetric
tensors of higher-order. Work on other tensors of higher-order than two is
exceptionally rare. We believe that one major reason for this gap is the lack
of knowledge about suitable tensor decompositions for the general higher-order
tensors. We focus here on three dimensions as most applications are concerned
with three-dimensional space. A lot of work on symmetric second-order tensors
uses the spectral decomposition. The work on totally symmetric higher-order
tensors deals frequently with a decomposition based on spherical harmonics.
These decompositions do not directly apply to general tensors of higher-order
in three dimensions. However, another option available is the deviatoric
decomposition for such tensors, splitting them into deviators. Together with
the multipole representation of deviators, it allows to describe any tensor in
three dimensions uniquely by a set of directions and non-negative scalars. The
specific appeal of this methodology is its general applicability, opening up a
potentially general route to tensor interpretation. The underlying concepts,
however, are not broadly understood in the engineering community. In this
article, we therefore gather information about this decomposition from a range
of literature sources. The goal is to collect and prepare the material for
further analysis and give other researchers the chance to work in this
direction. This article wants to stimulate the use of this decomposition and
the search for interpretation of this unique algebraic property. A first step
in this direction is given by a detailed analysis of the multipole
representation of symmetric second-order three-dimensional tensors.

Lorentz-violating parameters in the neutrino sector. In the past, the most
stringent bounds have been placed by calculating the probability of neutrino
decay into a lepton pair, a process made kinematically feasible by Lorentz
violation in the neutrino sector, above a certain threshold. However, even more
stringent bounds can be placed on the Lorentz-violating parameters if one takes
into account, additionally, the possibility of neutrino splitting, i.e., of
neutrino decay into a neutrino of lower energy, accompanied by ""neutrino-pair
Cerenkov radiation"". This process has negligible threshold and can be used to
improve the bounds on Lorentz-violating parameters in the neutrino sector.

representations of its geometrical attributes. Database-driven numerical
solvers for large model domains can only accurately predict large-scale flow
behaviour when they incorporate upscaled descriptions of that structure. The
upscaling is particularly challenging for rocks with multimodal porosity
structures such as carbonates, where several different types of structures are
interacting. It is the connectivity both within and between these different
structures that controls the porosity-permeability relationship at the larger
length scales. Recent advances in machine learning combined with numerical
modelling and structural analysis have allowed us to probe the relationship
between structure and permeability more deeply. We have used this integrated
approach to tackle the challenge of upscaling multimodal and multiscale porous
media. We present a novel method for upscaling multimodal porosity-permeability
relationships using machine learning based multivariate structural regression.
A m-CT image of limestone was divided into sub-volumes and permeability was
computed using the DBS model. The porosity-permeability relationship from Menke
et al. was used to assign permeability values to the microporosity. Structural
attributes of each sub-volume were extracted and then regressed against the
solved permeability using an Extra-Trees regression model to derive an upscaled
porosity-permeability relationship. Ten upscaled test cases were then modelled
at the Darcy scale using the regression and benchmarked against full DBS
simulations, a numerically upscaled Darcy model, and a K-C fit. We found good
agreement between the full DBS simulations and both the numerical and machine
learning upscaled models while the K-C model was a poor predictor in all cases.

short-term memory networks (E3D-LSTM) blocks, and fully-connected (FC) blocks.
Specifically, 3D-CNN blocks highlight extracting short-term spatiotemporal
dependence in each fragment (i.e., closeness, period, and trend); E3D-LSTM
blocks further extract long-term spatiotemporal dependence over all fragments;
FC blocks extract nonlinear correlations of external factors. Finally, the
latent representations of E3D-LSTM and FC blocks are fused to obtain the final
prediction. For two real-world datasets, it is shown that MSTF-Net outperforms
seven state-of-the-art models.

outcomes are fundamental inputs into both research and policy. We synthesize
the growing literature that uses satellite imagery to understand these
outcomes, with a focus on approaches that combine imagery with machine
learning. We quantify the paucity of ground data on key human-related outcomes
and the growing abundance and resolution (spatial, temporal, and spectral) of
satellite imagery. We then review recent machine learning approaches to
model-building in the context of scarce and noisy training data, highlighting
how this noise often leads to incorrect assessment of models' predictive
performance. We quantify recent model performance across multiple sustainable
development domains, discuss research and policy applications, explore
constraints to future progress, and highlight key research directions for the
field.

Currently, the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implemented remains a system
consisting of several applications dedicated to specific areas. These systems
have become an indispensable element within any hospital. The goal of our study
is to discover how the ERP has been used in Moroccan healthcare sector and how
these software should be implemented and used to improve healthcare services.

  Comprehension (II) : Establishing the Geometry of Invariant Concepts, Themes,
  and Namespaces",,,,,"cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a pool of observations selected from a sensor stream, input data can be
robustly represented, via a multiscale process, in terms of invariant concepts,
and themes. Applying this to episodic natural language data, one may obtain a
graph geometry associated with the decomposition, which is a direct encoding of
spacetime relationships for the events. This study contributes to an ongoing
application of the Semantic Spacetime Hypothesis, and demonstrates the
unsupervised analysis of narrative texts using inexpensive computational
methods without knowledge of linguistics. Data streams are parsed and
fractionated into small constituents, by multiscale interferometry, in the
manner of bioinformatic analysis. Fragments may then be recombined to construct
original sensory episodes---or form new narratives by a chemistry of
association and pattern reconstruction, based only on the four fundamental
spacetime relationships. There is a straightforward correspondence between
bioinformatic processes and this cognitive representation of natural language.
Features identifiable as `concepts' and `narrative themes' span three main
scales (micro, meso, and macro). Fragments of the input act as symbols in a
hierarchy of alphabets that define new effective languages at each scale.

  Comprehension (I) : Bootstrapping Meaning from Episodic Narrative viewed as a
  Feature Landscape",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of extracting important and meaningful parts of a sensory data
stream, without prior training, is studied for symbolic sequences, by using
textual narrative as a test case. This is part of a larger study concerning the
extraction of concepts from spacetime processes, and their knowledge
representations within hybrid symbolic-learning `Artificial Intelligence'. Most
approaches to text analysis make extensive use of the evolved human sense of
language and semantics. In this work, streams are parsed without knowledge of
semantics, using only measurable patterns (size and time) within the changing
stream of symbols -- as an event `landscape'. This is a form of interferometry.
Using lightweight procedures that can be run in just a few seconds on a single
CPU, this work studies the validity of the Semantic Spacetime Hypothesis, for
the extraction of concepts as process invariants. This `semantic preprocessor'
may then act as a front-end for more sophisticated long-term graph-based
learning techniques. The results suggest that what we consider important and
interesting about sensory experience is not solely based on higher reasoning,
but on simple spacetime process cues, and this may be how cognitive processing
is bootstrapped in the beginning.
