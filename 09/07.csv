students as technical tools with no link to the reality. This fact generates
into the students a loss of interest with a consequent removal of motivation in
the study of such topics and more widely in pursuing scientific curricula. With
this note we put to the fore a simple example of practical interest where the
above concepts prove central; our aim is thus to motivate students and to
reverse the dropout trend by proposing an introduction to the theory starting
from practical applications. More precisely, we will show how using a mixture
of geometry, calculus and integrals one can easily share a watermelon into
regular slices with equal volume.

which helps relieve traffic congestion and avoid road accidents. However, it
hinders the wide implementation of this service that traditional models fail to
efficiently allocate the available fleet to deal with the imbalance of supply
(autonomous taxis) and demand (trips), the poor cooperation of taxis, hardly
satisfied resource constraints, and on-line platform's requirements. To figure
out such urgent problems from a global and more farsighted view, we employ a
Constrained Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes (CMMDP) to model fleet
allocation decisions, which can be easily split into sub-problems formulated as
a 'Dynamic assignment problem' combining both immediate rewards and future
gains. We also leverage a Column Generation algorithm to guarantee the
efficiency and optimality in a large scale. Through extensive experiments, the
proposed approach not only achieves remarkable improvements over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of the individual's efficiency (arriving
at 12.40%, 6.54% rise of income and utilization, respectively) and the
platform's profit (reaching 4.59% promotion) but also reveals a time-varying
fleet adjustment policy to minimize the operation cost of the platform.

quadratic-bilinear reduced-order models (ROMs), which are low-dimensional
approximations of large-scale dynamical systems. For nonlinear ROMs, it is not
only important to show that the origin is locally asymptotically stable, but
also to quantify if the operative range of the ROM is included in the region of
convergence. While accuracy and structure preservation remain the main focus of
development for nonlinear ROMs, computational methods that go beyond the
existing highly conservative analytical results have been lacking thus far. In
this work, for a given quadratic Lyapunov function, we first derive an
analytical estimate of the stability domain, which is rather conservative but
can be evaluated efficiently. With the goal to enlarge this estimate, we
provide an optimal ellipsoidal estimate of the stability domain by solving a
convex optimization problem. This provides us with valuable information about
stability properties of the ROM, an important aspect of predictive simulation.
We do not assume a specific ROM method, so a particular appeal is that the
approach is applicable to quadratic-bilinear models obtained via data-driven
approaches, where ROM stability properties cannot - per definition - be derived
from the full-order model. Numerical results for a LQG-balanced ROM of Burgers'
equation, a proper orthogonal decomposition ROM of FitzHugh-Nagumo, and a
non-intrusive ROM of Burgers' equation demonstrate the scalability and
quantitative advantages of the proposed approach. The optimization-based
estimates of the stability domain are found to be up to four orders of
magnitude less conservative than analytical estimates.

ecosystems. Although 3GPP introduced the concept of self-organization networks
(SONs) in 4G and 5G documents to automate network management, even this
progressive concept will face several challenges as it may not be sufficiently
agile in coping with the immense levels of complexity, heterogeneity, and
mobility in the envisioned beyond-5G integrated networks. In the presented
vision, we discuss how future integrated networks can be intelligently and
autonomously managed to efficiently utilize resources, reduce operational
costs, and achieve the targeted Quality of Experience (QoE). We introduce the
novel concept of ""self-evolving networks (SENs)"" framework, which utilizes
artificial intelligence, enabled by machine learning (ML) algorithms, to make
future integrated networks fully automated and intelligently evolve with
respect to the provision, adaptation, optimization, and management aspects of
networking, communications, computation, and infrastructure nodes' mobility. To
envisage the concept of SEN in future integrated networks, we use the
Intelligent Vertical Heterogeneous Network (I-VHetNet) architecture as our
reference. The paper discusses five prominent scenarios where SEN plays the
main role in providing automated network management. Numerical results provide
an insight on how the SEN framework improves the performance of future
integrated networks. The paper presents the leading enablers and examines the

electromyographic data is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse medical
applications. Mathematically, this process is an inverse problem. Furthermore,
electromyographic data are highly sensitive to changes in the electrical
conductivity that describes the structure of the tissue. Modeling the
inevitable measurement error as a stochastic quantity leads to a Bayesian
approach. Solving the discretized Bayes-inverse problem means drawing samples
from the posterior distribution of parameters, e.g., the conductivity, given
measurement data. Using, e.g., a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for this purpose
involves solving the forward problem for different parameter combinations which
requires a high computational effort. Low-rank tensor formats can reduce this
effort by providing a data-sparse representation of all occurring linear
systems of equations simultaneously and allow for their efficient solution. The
application of Bayes' theorem proves the well-posedness of the Bayes-inverse
problem. The derivation and proof of a low-rank representation of the forward
problem allow for the precomputation of all solutions of this problem under
certain assumptions, resulting in an efficient and theory-based sampling
algorithm. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results, but also
indicate that a high number of samples is needed to obtain reliable estimates
for the parameters. The Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm, using the
precomputed forward solution in a tensor format, draws this high number of
samples and therefore enables solving problems which are infeasible using
classical methods.

stability and sample quality of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
However, there is currently limited understanding of why SN is effective. In
this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN
training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps
unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization. This
connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs
requires no hyper-parameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have
poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which
only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, SN preserves
this property throughout training. Building on this theoretical understanding,
we propose a new spectral normalization technique: Bidirectional Scaled
Spectral Normalization (BSSN), which incorporates insights from later
improvements to LeCun initialization: Xavier initialization and Kaiming
initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSSN gives better gradient control
than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that it outperforms SN in sample quality
and training stability on several benchmark datasets.

correctness of data flow analyses that target this class of programs. These
analyses are in the same spirit as the ""sync-CFG"" analysis proposed in earlier
literature. To achieve this, we first propose a novel concrete semantics for
DRF programs, called L-DRF, that is thread-local in nature---each thread
operates on its own copy of the data state. We show that abstractions of our
semantics allow us to reduce the analysis of DRF programs to a sequential
analysis. This aids in rapidly porting existing sequential analyses to sound
and scalable analyses for DRF programs. Next, we parameterize L-DRF with a
partitioning of the program variables into ""regions"" which are accessed
atomically. Abstractions of the region-parameterized semantics yield more
precise analyses for ""region-race"" free concurrent programs. We instantiate
these abstractions to devise efficient relational analyses for race free
programs, which we have implemented in a prototype tool called RATCOP. On the
benchmarks, RATCOP was able to prove up to 65% of the assertions, in comparison
to 25% proved by our baseline. Moreover, in a comparative study with a recent

$\mathcal{S}$ contains $k$ sets which cover $U$, from the case that at least
$h$ sets in $\mathcal{S}$ are needed to cover $U$. Lin (ICALP'19) recently
showed a gap creating reduction from the $(k,k+1)$-SetCover problem on universe
of size $O_k(\log |\mathcal{S}|)$ to the
$\left(k,\sqrt[k]{\frac{\log|\mathcal{S}|}{\log\log |\mathcal{S}|}}\cdot
k\right)$-SetCover problem on universe of size $|\mathcal{S}|$. In this paper,
we prove a more scalable version of his result: given any error correcting code
$C$ over alphabet $[q]$, rate $\rho$, and relative distance $\delta$, we use
$C$ to create a reduction from the $(k,k+1)$-SetCover problem on universe $U$
to the $\left(k,\sqrt[2k]{\frac{2}{1-\delta}}\right)$-SetCover problem on
universe of size $\frac{\log|\mathcal{S}|}{\rho}\cdot|U|^{q^k}$.
  Lin established his result by composing the input SetCover instance (that has
no gap) with a special threshold graph constructed from extremal combinatorial
object called universal sets, resulting in a final SetCover instance with gap.
Our reduction follows along the exact same lines, except that we generate the
threshold graphs specified by Lin simply using the basic properties of the
error correcting code $C$.
  We use the same threshold graphs mentioned above to prove inapproximability
results, under W[1]$\neq$FPT and ETH, for the $k$-MaxCover problem introduced
by Chalermsook et al. (SICOMP'20). Our inapproximaiblity results match the
bounds obtained by Karthik et al. (JACM'19), although their proof framework is
very different, and involves generalization of the distributed PCP framework.
Prior to this work, it was not clear how to adopt the proof strategy of Lin to
prove inapproximability results for $k$-MaxCover.

conducted today. This phenomenon presents applications in a variety of fields,
especially in collecting information related to the attitude or satisfaction of
users concerning a particular subject. However, the task of managing such a
process becomes noticeably more difficult when it is applied in cultures that
tend to combine two languages in order to express ideas and thoughts. By
interleaving words from two languages, the user can express with ease, but at
the cost of making the text far less intelligible for those who are not
familiar with this technique, but also for standard opinion mining algorithms.
In this paper, we describe the systems developed by our team for SemEval-2020
Task 9 that aims to cover two well-known code-mixed languages: Hindi-English
and Spanish-English.
  We intend to solve this issue by introducing a solution that takes advantage
of several neural network approaches, as well as pre-trained word embeddings.
Our approach (multlingual BERT) achieves promising performance on the
Hindi-English task, with an average F1-score of 0.6850, registered on the

need for relevant song recommendations. However, user preferences are highly
subjective in nature and change according to context (e.g., music that is
suitable in the morning is not as suitable in the evening). Moreover, the music
one user may prefer in a given context may be different from what another user
prefers in the same context (i.e., what is considered good morning music
differs across users). Accurately representing these preferences is essential
to creating accurate and effective song recommendations. User preferences for
songs can be based on high level audio features, such as tempo and valence. In
this paper, we therefore propose a contextual re-ranking algorithm, based on
audio feature representations of user preferences in specific contextual
conditions. We evaluate the performance of our re-ranking algorithm using the
#NowPlaying-RS dataset, which exists of user listening events crawled from
Twitter and is enriched with song audio features. We compare a global (context
for all users) and personalized (context for each user) model based on these
audio features. The global model creates an audio feature representation of
each contextual condition based on the preferences of all users. Unlike the
global model, the personalized model creates user-specific audio feature
representations of contextual conditions, and is measured across 333 distinct
users. We show that the personalized model outperforms the global model when
evaluated using the precision and mean average precision metrics.

non-stationarity is modeled using a Poisson arrival process, which changes the
mean of the rewards on each arrival. The proposed strategy compares the
empirical mean of the recent rewards of an arm with the estimate of the mean of
the rewards from its history. It detects a change when the empirical mean
deviates from the mean estimate by a value larger than a threshold. Then, we
characterize the lower bound on the duration of the time-window for which the
bandit framework must remain stationary for TS-CD to successfully detect a
change when it occurs. Consequently, our results highlight an upper bound on
the parameter for the Poisson arrival process, for which the TS-CD achieves
asymptotic regret optimality with high probability. Finally, we validate the
efficacy of TS-CD by testing it for edge-control of radio access technique

have been obtained on the inflaton couplings with reheating fields, and dark
matter parameters in terms of CMB constrained inflationary scalar spectral
index. It is observed that the conventional reheating scenario generically
predicts the maximum reheating temperature $T_{re}^{max} \simeq 10^{15}$ GeV,
corresponding to an almost instantaneous transition from the end of inflation
to radiation domination. This fact will naturally lead to the problem of
non-perturbative inflaton decay, which is in direct conflict with the
perturbative reheating itself. Taking into account this by incorporating
effective non-perturbative dynamics as the initial phase, our model of
two-phase reheating scenarios also predicts model-independent maximum reheating
temperature, which does not correspond to the instantaneous process. Further,
$T_{re}^{max}$ is predicted to lie within $(10^{13}, 10^{10})$ GeV if CMB
constraints on inflaton couplings with different reheating field are taken into
account. We have further studied in detail the dark matter phenomenology in a
model-independent manner and show how dark matter parameter space can be
constrained through CMB parameters via the inflaton spectral index. Considering
dark matter production during reheating via the Freeze-in mechanism, its
parameter space has been observed to be highly constrained by our two-phase
reheating than the constraints predicted by the conventional reheating

Commonly used PI approaches based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or

based on intravoxel incoherent motion, also exist, but are so far not routinely

difficulties with standardizing perfusion measures. In this work we therefore
propose a data-assimilation approach (PIANO) which estimates the velocity and
diffusion fields of an advection-diffusion model that best explains the
contrast dynamics. PIANO accounts for spatial dependencies and neither requires
estimating the AIF nor relies on a particular contrast agent bolus shape.
Specifically, we propose a convenient parameterization of the estimation

efficiency and accuracy rather than mimic the input manifold. On the contrary,
competitive learning is a powerful tool for replicating the input distribution

these two techniques: unsupervised gradient-based and competitive learning. The
theory is based on the intuition that neural networks are able to learn
topological structures by working directly on the transpose of the input
matrix. At this purpose, the vanilla competitive layer and its dual are
presented. The former is just an adaptation of a standard competitive layer for

equivalence is extensively proven both theoretically and experimentally.
However, the dual layer is better suited for handling very high-dimensional
datasets. The proposed approach has a great potential as it can be generalized
to a vast selection of topological learning tasks, such as non-stationary and
hierarchical clustering; furthermore, it can also be integrated within more
complex architectures such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

is a common challenge in visual analytics (VA) systems. We discuss lessons
learned from a case study designing VA tools for Canadian avalanche
forecasters. Avalanche forecasting is a complex and collaborative risk-based
decision-making and analysis domain, demanding experience and knowledge-based
interpretation of human reported and uncertain data. Differences in reporting
practices, organizational contexts, and the particularities of individual
reports result in a variety of potential interpretations that have to be
negotiated as part of the forecaster's sensemaking processes. We describe our
preliminary research using glyphs to support sensemaking under ambiguity.
Ambiguity is not unique to public avalanche forecasting. There are many other
domains where the way data are measured and reported vary in ways not accounted
explicitly in the data and require analysts to negotiate multiple potential
meanings. We argue that ambiguity is under-served by visualization research and
would benefit from more explicit VA support.

fraction of the constraints of a given $k$-LIN instance over an abelian group,
even if there is an assignment that satisfies $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the
constraints, for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. Engebretsen et al. [Theoretical
Computer Science, 312(1):17--45, 2004] later showed that the same hardness
result holds for $k$-LIN instances over any finite non-abelian group.
  Unlike the abelian case, where we can efficiently find a solution if the
instance is satisfiable, in the non-abelian case, it is NP-complete to decide
if a given system of linear equations is satisfiable or not, as shown by
Goldmann and Russell [Information and Computation, 178(1):253--262. 2002].
  Surprisingly, for certain non-abelian groups $G$, given a satisfiable $k$-LIN
instance over $G$, one can in fact do better than just outputting a random
assignment using a simple but clever algorithm. The approximation factor
achieved by this algorithm varies with the underlying group. In this paper, we
show that this algorithm is {\em optimal} by proving a tight hardness of
approximation of satisfiable $k$-LIN instance over {\em any} non-abelian $G$,
assuming $P \neq NP$.

neural oscillations are thought to play a key role in the sampling of speech at
varying temporal scales. However, very little is known about the role of
oscillations in covert speech. In this study, we aimed to determine to what
extent each oscillatory frequency band is used to process words in covert
speech and speech perception tasks. Secondly, we asked whether the {\theta} and
{\gamma} activity in the two tasks are related through phase-amplitude coupling
(PAC). First, continuous wavelet transform was performed on epoched signals and
subsequently two-tailed t-tests between two classes were conducted to determine
statistical distinctions in frequency and time. While the perception task
dynamically uses all frequencies with more prominent {\theta} and {\gamma}
activity, the covert task favoured higher frequencies with significantly higher
{\gamma} activity than perception. Moreover, the perception condition produced
significant {\theta}-{\gamma} PAC suggesting a linkage of syllabic and
phonological sampling. Although this was found to be suppressed in the covert
condition, we found significant pseudo-coupling between perception {\theta} and
covert speech {\gamma}. We report that covert speech processing is largely
conducted by higher frequencies, and that the {\gamma}- and {\theta}-bands may
function similarly and differently across tasks, respectively. This study is
the first to characterize covert speech in terms of neural oscillatory
engagement. Future studies are directed to explore oscillatory characteristics

molecular length epsilon approaches 0, we consider sequences with bounded
energy whose support resides within an epsilon-neighborhood of a fixed
codimension one interface. We show that the FCH energy is uniformly bounded
below, independent of epsilon >0, and identify assumptions on tangential
variation of sequences that guarantee the existence of subsequences that
converge to a weak solution of a rescaled bilayer profile equation, and show
that sequences with limited tangential variation enjoy a lim inf inequality.
For fixed codimension one interfaces we construct bounded energy sequences
which converge to the bilayer profile and others with larger tangential
variation which do not converge to the bilayer profile but whose limiting
energy can violate the lim inf inequality, depending upon the energy
parameters.

  variational quantum algorithms","11 pages, 2 figures, 4 algorithms",,,,"quant-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Calculating the energy gradient in parameter space has become an almost
ubiquitous subroutine of variational near-term quantum algorithms. ""Faithful""
classical emulation of this subroutine mimics its quantum evaluation, and
scales as O(P^2) gate operations for P variational parameters. This is often
the bottleneck for the moderately-sized simulations, and has attracted HPC
strategies like ""batch-circuit"" evaluation. We here present a novel derivation
of an emulation strategy to precisely calculate the gradient in O(P) time and
using O(1) state-vectors, compatible with ""full-state"" state-vector simulators.
The prescribed algorithm resembles the optimised technique for automatic
differentiation of reversible cost functions, often used in classical machine
learning, and first employed in quantum simulators like Yao.jl. In contrast,
our scheme derives directly from a recurrent form of quantum operators, and may
be more familiar to a quantum computing community. Our strategy is very simple,
uses only 'apply gate', 'clone state' and 'inner product' primitives and is
hence straightforward to implement and integrate with existing simulators. It
is compatible with gate parallelisation schemes, and hardware accelerated and
distributed simulators. We describe the scheme in an instructive way, including
details of how common gate derivatives can be performed, to clearly guide
implementation in existing quantum simulators. We furthermore demonstrate the
scheme by implementing it in Qiskit, and perform some comparative benchmarking
with faithful simulation. Finally, we remark upon the difficulty of extending
the scheme to density-matrix simulation of noisy channels.

Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate (FDR) control that
utilizes e-values, called the e-BH procedure, and compare it with the standard
procedure for p-values. One of our central results is that, unlike the usual BH

correction -- for any dependence structure between the e-values. We illustrate
that the new procedure is convenient in various settings of complicated
dependence, structured and post-selection hypotheses, and multi-armed bandit
problems. Moreover, the BH procedure is a special case of the e-BH procedure
through calibration between p-values and e-values. Overall, the e-BH procedure
is a novel, powerful and general tool for multiple testing under dependence,
that is complementary to the BH procedure, each being an appropriate choice in
different applications.

Many countries have implemented timely intensive suppression to minimize the

demand of health resources. Other country-based factors such as sociocultural
issues, ageing population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of
taking interventions to improve morality in early phase. To better understand
the relationship of these factors across different countries with COVID-19 CFR
is of primary importance to prepare for potentially second wave of COVID-19
infections. In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning
based factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors affecting
CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. We formulate the prediction of CFR
progression as a ML regression problem with observed CFR and other
countries-based factors. In this formulation, all CFR related factors were
categorized into 6 sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature
selection method combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate
initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Then we adopted two
typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) and one state-of-the-art
MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse
group Lasso (FSGL) method allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of
country-based factors for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also
enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the whole early

large-scale motions, the statistical steady state of a turbulent system is
independent of microphysical dissipation properties. The behavior, which is
fundamental to nearly all fluid-like systems from industrial processes to
galaxies, occurs because nonlinear processes generate smaller and smaller
scales in the flow, until the dissipation -- no matter how small -- can
thermalize the energy input. Using direct numerical simulations and theoretical
arguments, we show that in strongly magnetized plasma turbulence such as that
recently observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft, the zeroth law is
routinely violated. Namely, when such turbulence is ""imbalanced"" -- when the
large-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\'en waves propagating in one
direction (the most common situation in space plasmas) -- nonlinear
conservation laws imply the existence of a ""barrier"" at scales near the ion
gyroradius. This causes energy to build up over time at large scales. The
resulting magnetic-energy spectra bear a strong similarity to those observed in
situ, exhibiting a sharp, steep kinetic transition range above and around the
ion-Larmor scale, with flattening at yet smaller scales, thus resolving the
decade-long puzzle of the position and variability of ion-kinetic spectral
breaks in plasma turbulence. The ""barrier"" effect also suggests that how a
plasma is forced at large scales (the imbalance) may have a crucial influence
on thermodynamic properties such as the ion-to-electron heating ratio.

tasks require an accurate understanding of domain phrases, whereas such
fine-grained phrase-level knowledge is not explicitly modeled by BERT's

associations can enhance the language modeling of E-commerce, but they are not
factual knowledge thus using them indiscriminately may introduce noise. To
tackle the problem, we propose a unified pre-training framework, namely,
E-BERT. Specifically, to preserve phrase-level knowledge, we introduce Adaptive

preliminary word knowledge to learning complex phrases, based on the fitting

makers increasingly have access to algorithmic Risk Assessment Instruments
(RAIs). RAIs estimate the risk of an adverse outcome such as recidivism or
child neglect, potentially informing high-stakes decisions such as whether to
release a defendant on bail or initiate a child welfare investigation. It is
important to ensure that RAIs are fair, so that the benefits and harms of such
decisions are equitably distributed.
  The most widely used algorithmic fairness criteria are formulated with
respect to observable outcomes, such as whether a person actually recidivates,
but these criteria are misleading when applied to RAIs. Since RAIs are intended
to inform interventions that can reduce risk, the prediction itself affects the
downstream outcome. Recent work has argued that fairness criteria for RAIs
should instead utilize potential outcomes, i.e. the outcomes that would occur
in the absence of an appropriate intervention. However, no methods currently
exist to satisfy such fairness criteria.
  In this paper, we target one such criterion, counterfactual equalized odds.
We develop a post-processed predictor that is estimated via doubly robust
estimators, extending and adapting previous post-processing approaches to the
counterfactual setting. We also provide doubly robust estimators of the risk
and fairness properties of arbitrary fixed post-processed predictors. Our
predictor converges to an optimal fair predictor at fast rates. We illustrate

the field theories with unfree gauge symmetry share the common feature: they

whether and how to prioritize access for minority populations that have been
particularly affected by the pandemic, and been the subject of historical and
structural disadvantage, particularly Black and Indigenous individuals. We
simulate the 2018 CDC Vaccine Allocation guidelines using data from the
American Community Survey under different assumptions on total vaccine supply.
Black and Indigenous individuals combined receive a higher share of vaccines
compared to their population share for all assumptions on total vaccine supply.
However, their vaccine share under the 2018 CDC guidelines is considerably
lower than their share of COVID-19 deaths and age-adjusted deaths. We then
simulate one method to incorporate disadvantage in vaccine allocation via a
reserve system. In a reserve system, units are placed into categories and units
reserved for a category give preferential treatment to individuals from that
category. Using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for disadvantage,
we show that a 40% high-ADI reserve increases the number of vaccines allocated
to Black or Indigenous individuals, with a share that approaches their COVID-19
death share when there are about 75 million units. Our findings illustrate that
whether an allocation is equitable depends crucially on the benchmark and
highlight the importance of considering the expected distribution of outcomes
from implementing vaccine allocation guidelines.

helical cooling at each rational surface caused by the pellet fragments are
found to be responsible for MHD destabilization after the injection.
Significant current driven mode growth is observed as the fragments cross low
order rational surfaces, resulting in rapidly inward propagating stochastic
magnetic field, ultimately causing the core temperature collapse. The Thermal
Quench (TQ) is triggered as the fragments arrive on the $q=1$ or $q=2$ surface
depending on the exact $q$ profile and thus mode structure. When injecting from
a single toroidal location, strong radiation asymmetry is found before and
during the TQ as a result of the unrelaxed impurity density profile along the
field line and asymmetric outward heat flux. Such asymmetry gradually relaxes
over the course of the TQ, and is entirely eliminated by the end of it.
Simulation results indicate that the aforementioned asymmetric radiation
behavior could be significantly mitigated by injection from toroidally opposite
locations, provided that the time delay between the two injectors is shorter
than $1ms$. It is also found that the MHD response are sensitive to the
relative timing and injection configuration in these multiple injection cases.

are difficult to measure, such as coverage and stability. Our solutions
significantly reduce the routing table size, ensuring that the routing table

attention on the high-level alignment based on the whole image or object of
interest, which naturally, cannot fully utilize the fine-grained channel
information. In this paper, we realize adaptation from a thoroughly different
perspective, i.e., channel-wise alignment. Motivated by the finding that each
channel focuses on a specific pattern (e.g., on special semantic regions, such
as car), we aim to align the distribution of source and target domain on the
channel level, which is finer for integration between discrepant domains. Our
method mainly consists of self channel-wise and cross channel-wise alignment.
These two parts explore the inner-relation and cross-relation of attention
regions implicitly from the view of channels. Further more, we also propose a
RPN domain classifier module to obtain a domain-invariant RPN network.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method performs notably better
than existing methods with about 5% improvement under various domain-shift
settings. Experiments on different task (e.g. instance segmentation) also
demonstrate its good scalability.

before the analytics process; once analysis begins, the set of data attributes
considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction from analysis
precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise
in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data
analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we
present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with
the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information
foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset
is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available
attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls
knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from
external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on
knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual
analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually
explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query
construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to
help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess
the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations
without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the
generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of
the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data
foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in
support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics

decompose the 2D-XAS data into different spatial domains and their

gauge fields of all spins through a BPS-like pattern of charges. We study the
interaction between two such particles at leading order. The sum over spins
cancels the UV divergences that occur when the two particles are brought close

present a novel form of equilibrium where an instability at the mean field
level is arrested by higher order correlations making the droplet states
sensitive probes of fluctuations. In a recent paper, we argued that thermal
fluctuations can play an important role for droplets even at low temperatures
where the non-condensed density is much smaller than the condensate density. We
used the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory together with local density
approximation for fluctuations to obtain a generalized Gross Pitaevskii (GP)
equation and solved it with a Gaussian variational ansatz to show that the
transition between the low density and droplet states can be significantly
modified by the temperature. In this paper, we first solve the same GP equation
numerically with a time splitting spectral method to check the validity of the
Gaussian variational ansatz. Our numerical results are in good agreement with
the Gaussian ansatz for a large parameter regime and show that the density of
the gas is most strongly modified by temperature near the abrupt transition
between a pancake shaped cloud and the droplet. For cigar shaped condensates,
as in the recent Er experiments, the dependence of the density on temperature
remains quite small throughout the smooth transition. We then consider the
effect of temperature on the collective oscillation frequencies of the droplet
using both a time dependent Gaussian variational ansatz and real time numerical
evolution. We find that the oscillation frequencies depend significantly on the
temperature close to the transition for the experimentally relevant temperature
regime ($\simeq 100$nK).

cutting rules. In contrast, the implications for in-in correlators in curved
spacetime and the associated wavefunction of the universe, which are measured
by cosmological surveys, are much less transparent. For fields of any mass in
de Sitter spacetime with general local interactions, which need not be
invariant under de Sitter isometries, we show that unitarity implies an
infinite set of relations among the coefficients $ \psi_{n} $ of the
wavefunction of the universe with $ n $ fields, which we name Cosmological

  Sentiment Analysis","Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal sentiment analysis is an important research area that predicts
speaker's sentiment tendency through features extracted from textual, visual
and acoustic modalities. The central challenge is the fusion method of the
multimodal information. A variety of fusion methods have been proposed, but few
of them adopt end-to-end translation models to mine the subtle correlation
between modalities. Enlightened by recent success of Transformer in the area of
machine translation, we propose a new fusion method, TransModality, to address
the task of multimodal sentiment analysis. We assume that translation between
modalities contributes to a better joint representation of speaker's utterance.
With Transformer, the learned features embody the information both from the
source modality and the target modality. We validate our model on multiple
multimodal datasets: CMU-MOSI, MELD, IEMOCAP. The experiments show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

survival prognosis. A poor prognosis might demand for a more aggressive
treatment and therapy plan, while a favorable prognosis might enable a less
risky surgery plan. Thus, accurate survival prognosis is an important step in
treatment planning. Recently, deep learning approaches have been used
extensively for brain tumor segmentation followed by the use of deep features
for prognosis. However, radiomics-based studies have shown more promise using
engineered/hand-crafted features. In this paper, we propose a three-step
approach for multi-class survival prognosis. In the first stage, we extract
image slices corresponding to tumor regions from multiple magnetic resonance
image modalities. We then extract radiomic features from these 2D slices.
Finally, we train machine learning classifiers to perform the classification.
We evaluate our proposed approach on the publicly available BraTS 2019 data and
achieve an accuracy of 76.5% and precision of 74.3% using the random forest
classifier, which to the best of our knowledge are the highest reported results
yet. Further, we identify the most important features that contribute in
improving the prediction.

thought to store information regarding where and when a planet accretes its
material. Predicting this chemical composition theoretically is a crucial step
in linking observational studies to the underlying physics that govern planet
formation. As a follow-up to a study of hot Jupiters in our previous work, we
present a population of warm Jupiters (semi-major axis between 0.5-4 AU)
extracted from the same planetesimal formation population synthesis model as
used in our previous work. We compute the astrochemical evolution of the
protoplanetary disks included in this population to predict the
carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratio evolution of the disk
gas, ice, and refractory sources, the accretion of which greatly impacts the
resulting C/O and N/O in the atmosphere of giant planets. We confirm that the
main sequence (between accreted solid mass and atmospheric C/O) we found
previously is largely reproduced by the presented population of synthetic warm
Jupiters. And as a result, the majority of the population fall along the
empirically derived mass-metallicity relation when the natal disk has solar or
lower metallicity. Planets forming from disks with high metallicity ([Fe/H] $>$
0.1) result in more scatter in chemical properties which could explain some of
the scatter found in the mass-metallicity relation. Combining predicted C/O and
N/O ratios shows that Jupiter does not fall among our population of synthetic
planets, suggesting that it likely did not form in the inner 5 AU of the solar
system before proceeding into a Grand Tack. This result is consistent with
recent analysis of the chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere which
suggests that it accreted most of its heavy element abundance farther than tens
of AU away from the Sun.

  mesh",,,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a third-order compact gas-kinetic scheme is firstly proposed
for three-dimensional computation for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes
solutions. The scheme achieves its compactness due to the time-dependent gas
distribution function in GKS, which provides not only the fluxes but also the
time accurate flow variables in the next time level at a cell interface. As a
result, the cell averaged first-order spatial derivatives of flow variables can
be obtained naturally through the Gauss's theorem. Then, a third-order compact
reconstruction involving the cell averaged values and their first-order spatial
derivatives can be achieved. The trilinear interpolation is used to treat
possible non-coplanar elements on general hexahedral mesh. The constrained
least-square technique is applied to improve the accuracy in the smooth case.
To deal with both smooth and discontinuous flows, a new HWENO reconstruction is
designed in the current scheme by following the ideas in Zhu, 2018. No
identification of troubled cells is needed in the current scheme. In contrast
to the Riemann solver-based method, the compact scheme can achieve a
third-order temporal accuracy with the two-stage two-derivative temporal
discretization, instead of the three-stage Runge-Kutta method. Overall, the
proposed scheme inherits the high accuracy and efficiency of the previous ones
in two-dimensional case. The desired third-order accuracy can be obtained with
curved boundary. The robustness of the scheme has been validated through many
cases, including strong shocks in both inviscid and viscous flow computations.
Quantitative comparisons for both smooth and discontinuous cases show that the
current third-order scheme can give competitive results against the fifth-order
non-compact GKS under the same mesh. A large CFL number around 0.5 can be used
in the present scheme.

  Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2020)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) involves predicting a single label for a bag
of instances, given positive or negative labels at bag-level, without accessing
to label for each instance in the training phase. Since a positive bag contains
both positive and negative instances, it is often required to detect positive
instances (key instances) when a set of instances is categorized as a positive
bag. The attention-based deep MIL model is a recent advance in both bag-level
classification and key instance detection (KID). However, if the positive and
negative instances in a positive bag are not clearly distinguishable, the
attention-based deep MIL model has limited KID performance as the attention
scores are skewed to few positive instances. In this paper, we present a method
to improve the attention-based deep MIL model in the task of KID. The main idea
is to use the neural network inversion to find which instances made
contribution to the bag-level prediction produced by the trained MIL model.
Moreover, we incorporate a sparseness constraint into the neural network
inversion, leading to the sparse network inversion which is solved by the
proximal gradient method. Numerical experiments on an MNIST-based image MIL
dataset and two real-world histopathology datasets verify the validity of our
method, demonstrating the KID performance is significantly improved while the
performance of bag-level prediction is maintained.

  inversion without actually inverting any matrix","20 pages, 16 figures, 1 table",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG hep-ex physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix inversion problems are often encountered in experimental physics, and
in particular in high-energy particle physics, under the name of unfolding. The
true spectrum of a physical quantity is deformed by the presence of a detector,
resulting in an observed spectrum. If we discretize both the true and observed
spectra into histograms, we can model the detector response via a matrix.
Inferring a true spectrum starting from an observed spectrum requires therefore
inverting the response matrix. Many methods exist in literature for this task,
all starting from the observed spectrum and using a simulated true spectrum as
a guide to obtain a meaningful solution in cases where the response matrix is
not easily invertible.
  In this Manuscript, I take a different approach to the unfolding problem.
Rather than inverting the response matrix and transforming the observed
distribution into the most likely parent distribution in generator space, I
sample many distributions in generator space, fold them through the original
response matrix, and pick the generator-level distribution that yields the
folded distribution closest to the data distribution. Regularization schemes
can be introduced to treat the case where non-diagonal response matrices result
in high-frequency oscillations of the solution in true space, and the
introduced bias is studied.
  The algorithm performs as well as traditional unfolding algorithms in cases
where the inverse problem is well-defined in terms of the discretization of the
true and smeared space, and outperforms them in cases where the inverse problem
is ill-defined---when the number of truth-space bins is larger than that of
smeared-space bins. These advantages stem from the fact that the algorithm does
not technically invert any matrix and uses only the data distribution as a
guide to choose the best solution.

because KvN mechanics provides a Hilbert space formulation of classical
mechanics that is very similar to the quantum mechanical formalism.
  Both in KvN mechanics and quantum mechanics, a propagator in a homogeneous
gravitational field is simply related with a free propagator. As a result, the
wave function in a homogeneous gravitational field in a freely falling
reference frame differs from the free wave function only in phase.
  Fisher information, which quantifies our ability to estimate mass from
coordinate measurements, does not depend on the magnitude of the homogeneous
gravitational field, and this fact constitutes the formulation of Einstein's

contrast to the expected high spin $S$=1 state from Hund's first rule. The
presence of such $S$=0 Ni$^{2+}$ in hole doped nickelate would be analogous to

zero eccentricity, we estimate minimum orbital periods of $\sim$100 years for
both systems. According to theoretical evolutionary models, we derive masses in
the range of 0.074-0.078 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.072-0.076 M$_{\odot}$ for the
primary and secondary of UGCS J08451066$+$2148171 for an age of 700$\pm$100
Myr. In the case of UGCS J08301935$+$2003293, the primary is a low-mass star at
the stellar/substellar boundary (0.070-0.078 M$_{\odot}$) while the companion
candidate might be a brown dwarf (0.051-0.065 M$_{\odot}$). These are the first
two binaries composed of L dwarfs in Praesepe. They are benchmark systems to
derive the location of the substellar limit at the age and metallicity of
Praesepe, determine the age of the cluster based on the lithium depletion
boundary test, derive dynamical masses, and improve low-mass stellar and
substellar evolutionary models at a well-known age and metallicity.

  logarithmic scaling, reentrant phase transitions, and crossover behaviors","10 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study absorbing phase transitions in the one-dimensional branching
annihilating random walk with long-range repulsion. The repulsion is
implemented as hopping bias in such a way that a particle is more likely to hop
away from its closest particle. The bias strength due to long-range interaction
has the form $\varepsilon x^{-\sigma}$, where $x$ is the distance from a
particle to its closest particle, $0\le \sigma \le 1$, and the sign of
$\varepsilon$ determines whether the interaction is repulsive (positive
$\varepsilon$) or attractive (negative $\varepsilon$). A state without
particles is the absorbing state. We find a threshold $\varepsilon_s$ such that
the absorbing state is dynamically stable for small branching rate $q$ if
$\varepsilon < \varepsilon_s$. The threshold differs significantly, depending
on parity of the number $\ell$ of offspring. When $\varepsilon>\varepsilon_s$,
the system with odd $\ell$ can exhibit reentrant phase transitions from the
active phase with nonzero steady-state density to the absorbing phase, and back
to the active phase. On the other hand, the system with even $\ell$ is in the
active phase for nonzero $q$ if $\varepsilon>\varepsilon_s$. Still, there are
reentrant phase transitions for $\ell=2$. Unlike the case of odd $\ell$,
however, the reentrant phase transitions can occur only for $\sigma=1$ and
$0<\varepsilon < \varepsilon_s$. We also study the crossover behavior for $\ell
= 2$ when the interaction is attractive (negative $\varepsilon$), to find the
crossover exponent $\phi=1.123(13)$ for $\sigma=0$.

biomechanical effects of lumbar belts used to treat low back pain. Methods:
This model was taken from trunk radiographies of a person and simplified so as
to make a parametric study by varying morphological parameters of the patient,
characteristic parameters of the lumbar belt and mechanical parameters of body
and finally to determine the parameters influencing the effects of low back
pain when of wearing the lumbar belt. The loading of lumbar belt is modelled by
Laplace's law. These results were compared with clinical study. Results: All
the results of this parametric study showed that the choice of belt is very
important depending on the patient's morphology. Surprisingly, the therapeutic
treatment is not influenced by the mechanical characteristics of the body
structures except the mechanical properties of intervertebral discs.
Discussion: The numerical model can serve as a basis for more in-depth studies
concerning the analysis of efficiency of lumbar belts in low back pain. In
order to study the impact of the belt's architecture, the pressure applied to
the trunk modelled by Laplace's law could be improved. This model could also be
used as the basis for a study of the impact of the belt over a period of
wearing time. Indeed, the clinical study shows that movement has an important
impact on the distribution of pressure applied by the belt.

controllers for dynamical systems with multiple state delays, focusing on the
mathematical characterization of the potential sensitivity of stability with
respect to infinitesimal parametric perturbations. These perturbations
originate for instance from neglecting feedback delay, a finite difference
approximation of the derivative action, or neglecting fast dynamics. The
analysis of these potential sensitivity problems leads us to the introduction
of a `robustified' notion of stability called \emph{strong stability}, inspired
by the corresponding notion for neutral functional differential equations. We
prove that strong stability can be achieved by adding a low-pass filter with a
sufficiently large cut-off frequency to the control loop, on the condition that
the filter itself does not destabilize the nominal closed-loop system.
Throughout the paper, the theoretical results are illustrated by examples that
can be analyzed analytically, including, among others, a third-order unstable
system where both proportional and derivative control action are necessary for
achieving stability, while the regions in the gain parameter-space for
stability and strong stability are not identical. Besides the analysis of
strong stability, a computational procedure is provided for designing strongly
stabilizing PID controllers. Computational case-studies illustrating this
design procedure complete the presentation.

conduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the
proposed framework with an existing Access Control List (ACL)-based scheme. The
experimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money
than the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary

$M_{\rm ig}$, we can specify the first point $x_0= M_{\rm ig}/M_{\rm sc}$ on
the model light curve, and calculate the corresponding peak brightness and
$t_3$ time from this first point. Our $(t_3, M_{V,\rm max})$ points cover well
the distribution of existing novae. The lower the mass accretion rate, the
brighter the peak. The maximum brightness is limited to $M_{V,\rm max} \gtrsim
-10.4$ by the lowest mass-accretion rate of $\dot M_{\rm acc} \gtrsim1 \times
10^{-11}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. A significant part of the observational MMRD trend
corresponds to the $\dot M_{\rm acc}\sim5\times10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ line
with different WD masses. A scatter from the trend line indicates a variation
in their mass-accretion rates. Thus, the global trend of an MMRD relation does
exist, but its scatter is too large for it to be a precision distance indicator
of individual novae. We tabulate $(t_3, M_{V,\rm max})$ for many sets of $(\dot
M_{\rm acc},M_{\rm WD})$.

  This is a forward construction of blow-up solutions, as opposed to authors'

remarkable conjugation identity, which enables the method of supersymmetric

Schr\""odinger maps at the linearized level and allows us to find a repulsivity

  The nonlocal nonlinearities become obstacles in many places. For instance, we
need to capture non-perturbative contributions from the nonlocal nonlinearities
and absorb them into phase corrections in a spirit of [25]. More importantly,
we need to take a nonlinear pathway to construct modified profiles. This is
suggested from [25] and becomes available thanks to the self-duality. From

ferromagnetic content show an almost isotropic drop in resistance in a magnetic
field. With increasing ferromagnetic content, percolating ferromagnetic phases
cause an anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. By changing the parameters of the

considered to analyze homogeneous steady states. The model includes an
effective mechanism to transfer the kinetic energy injected by vibration in the
vertical direction to the horizontal degrees of freedom of grains. The set of
Enskog kinetic equations for the velocity distribution functions of each
component is derived first to analyze the homogeneous state. As in the
one-component case, an exact scaling solution is found where the time
dependence of the distribution functions occurs entirely through the granular
temperature $T$. As expected, the kinetic partial temperatures $T_i$ of each
component are different and hence, energy equipartition is broken down. In the
steady state, explicit expressions for the temperature $T$ and the ratio of
partial kinetic temperatures $T_i/T_j$ are obtained by considering Maxwellian
distributions defined at the partial temperatures $T_i$. The (scaled) granular
temperature and the temperature ratios are given in terms of the coefficients
of restitution, the solid volume fraction, the (scaled) parameters of the
collisional model, and the ratios of mass, concentration, and diameters. In the
case of a binary mixture, the theoretical predictions are exhaustively compared
with both direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with
a good agreement. The deviations are identified to be originated in the
non-Gaussianity of the velocity distributions and on microsegregation patterns,
which induce spatial correlations not captured in the Enskog theory.

boundary, and give new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the positivity of the
mass. Motivation to such consideration comes from studying the quasi-local mass
of the boundary surface. If the boundary isometrically embeds in the Euclidean
space, we apply the formula to obtain convergence of the Brown-York mass along
large surfaces tending to $\infty$ which include the scaling of any fixed
coordinate-convex surface.

According to the Eurobarometer, the percentage of EU citizens employing online
social networks on a daily basis has increased from 18% in 2010 to 48% in 2019.
The entwinement between social media and the unfolding of political dynamics
has motivated the interest of researchers for the analysis of users online
behavior - with particular emphasis on group polarization during debates and
echo-chambers formation. In this context, attention has been predominantly
directed towards the study of online relations between users while semantic
aspects have remained under-explored. In the present paper, we aim at filling
this gap by adopting a two-steps approach. First, we identify the discursive
communities animating the political debate in the run up of the 2018 Italian
Elections as groups of users with a significantly-similar retweeting behavior.
Second, we study the semantic mechanisms that shape their internal discussions
by monitoring, on a daily basis, the structural evolution of the semantic
networks they induce. Above and beyond specifying the semantic peculiarities of
the Italian electoral competition, our approach innovates studies of online
political discussions in two main ways. On the one hand, it grounds semantic
analysis within users' behaviors by implementing a method, rooted in
statistical theory, that guarantees that our inference of socio-semantic
structures is not biased by any unsupported assumption about missing
information; on the other, it is completely automated as it does not rest upon
any manual labelling (either based on the users' features or on their sharing
patterns). These elements make our method applicable to any Twitter discussion
regardless of the language or the topic addressed.

infection combined with quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of related mortality. Practices
for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For
example, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is
the highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for
COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population,
while the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting
limited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg.
Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality
ratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and
deaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results:
The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for
COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is
0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability
of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for
COVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2
infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from
COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with
respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to
undertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Such measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their
close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and
diminish the related mortality.

considered a candidate to establish a sample of FGK stars with white dwarf (WD)
companions that can be used to test binary evolution models. To verify the WD
nature of the companion, UV spectroscopy was performed by Parsons et al.
(2016). By a detailed model-atmosphere analysis we show that the UV source is
an extremely hot WD with effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ =
$105\,000\pm5000$ K, mass $M/M_\odot = 0.54\pm0.02$, radius $R/R_\odot =
0.040^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$, and luminosity $L/L_\odot= 176^{+55}_{-49}$, i.e.,
the compact object is just about to enter the WD cooling sequence.
Investigating spectra of the cool star ($T_\mathrm{eff}$ = $4945\pm250$ K) we
found that it is a K-type subgiant with $M/M_\odot = 0.8-2.4$, $R/R_\odot =
5.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$, and $L/L_\odot= 19^{+5}_{-5}$, that is rapidly rotating
with $v \sin(i)=81$ km s$^{-1}$. Optical light curves reveal a period of two
days and an o-band peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.06 mag. We suggest, that it is
caused by stellar rotation in connection with star spots. With the radius we
infer an extremely high rotational velocity of
$v_{\mathrm{rot}}=151^{+18}_{-13}$ km s$^{-1}$, thus marking the star as one of
the most rapidly rotating subgiants known. This explains chromospheric activity
observed by H$\alpha$ emission and emission-line cores in CaII H and K as well
as NUV flux excess. From equal and constant radial velocities of the WD and the
K subgiant as well as from a fit to the spectral energy distribution we infer
that they form a physical, wide though unresolved binary system. Both
components exhibit similar metal abundances and show iron-group elements with
slightly oversolar (up to 0.6 dex) abundance, meaning that atomic diffusion in
the WD atmosphere is not yet active due to a residual, weak radiation-driven
wind. (abridged)

mechanism, and the overall sink strength of the microstructure controlling the

parametric investigation of diffusion and RIS properties in dilute Fe-$B$ ($B$

temperature/radiation flux/sink strength maps. As in previous works, we
distinguish three kinetic domains for the diffusion and RIS properties: the
recombination domain, the sink domain, and the thermal domain. Both our
analytical approach and numerical applications demonstrate that the diffusion
and RIS behaviors of PDs and solute atoms largely differ from one kinetic
domain to another. Moreover, at high radiation flux, low temperature, and large
sink strength, FARs tend to destroy the solute RIS profiles and therefore
reduce the overall amount of RIS by forcing the mixing of solute and host
atoms, especially close to PD sinks. Finally, we provide quantitative criteria

simulations on the mass dependence of the galaxy major merger fraction at low
redshift over an unprecedentedly wide range of stellar masses (10^9 to 10^12
solar masses).
  Methods. We first carry out forward modelling of ideal synthetic images of
major mergers and non-mergers selected from the Next Generation Illustris
Simulations (IllustrisTNG) to include major observational effects. We then
train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using realistic mock
observations of galaxy samples from the simulations. Subsequently, we apply the
trained CNNs to real the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) images of galaxies selected
from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Based on the major merger
samples, which are detected in a consistent manner in the observations and
simulations, we determine the dependence of major merger fraction on stellar
mass at z around 0.15 and make comparisons between the two.
  Results. The detected major merger fraction in the GAMA/KiDS observations has
a fairly mild decreasing trend with increasing stellar mass over the mass range
10^9 < M_sun < M_star < 10^11.5 M_sun. There is good agreement in the mass
dependence of the major merger fraction in the GAMA/KiDS observations and the
IllustrisTNG simulations over 10^9.5 M_sun < M_star < 10^10.5 M_sun. However,
the observations and the simulations show some differences at M_star >
10^10.5M_sun, possibly due to the supermassive blackhole feedback in its
low-accretion state in the simulations which causes a sharp transition in the
quenched fractions at this mass scale. The discrepancy could also be due to the
relatively small volume of the simulations and/or differences in how stellar
masses are measured in simulations and observations.

mineralization during the formation of hard tissues. Earlier studies have
described the mechanical behavior of bone at different scales highlighting
material features across hierarchical structures. Here we present a study that
aims to understand the mechanical properties of mineralized collagen fibrils
upon tensile/compressive transient loads, investigating how the kinetic energy
propagates and it is dissipated at the molecular scale, thus filling a gap of
knowledge in this area. These specific features are the mechanisms that Nature
has developed to passively dissipate stress and prevent structural failures. In
addition to the mechanical properties of the mineralized fibrils, we observe
distinct nanomechanical behaviors for the two regions (i.e., overlap and gap)
of the D-period to highlight the effect of the mineralization. We notice
decreasing trends for both wave speeds and Young s moduli over input velocity
with a marked strengthening effect in the gap region due to the accumulation of
the hydroxyapatite. In contrast, the dissipative behavior is not affected by
either loading conditions or the mineral percentage, showing a stronger
dampening effect upon faster inputs compatible to the bone behavior at the
macroscale. Our results improve the understanding of mineralized collagen
composites unveiling the energy dissipative behavior of such materials. This
impacts, besides the physiology, the design and characterization of new

to understand the vibration dynamics of collagenous structures (e.g., eardrum,
cochlear membranes) upon impulsive loads. By using a bottom-up atomistic

Using a one-dimensional string model as a model system, we investigate the
roles of hydration and load direction on wave propagation along the collagen

energy-dissipation strongly depend on the loading direction. Also, the hydrated
collagen peptide can dissipate five times more energy than dehydrated one. Our
work suggests a distinct role of collagen in term of wave transmission of
different tissues such as tendon and eardrum. This study can step towards
understanding the mechanical behaviour of collagen upon transient loads, impact

how to acquire high-quality single crystals in a facile and efficient manner.
As one of the most widely employed method of single-crystal growth,
conventional chemical vapor transport (CVT) generally encountered problems
including the excess nucleation that leads to small crystal clusters and slow
growth rate. To address these issues, a seed crystal is introduced to suppress
the nucleation and an inner tube is adopted as both a separator and a flow
restrictor, favoring the growth of large-size and high-quality TMD single

millimeter-sized MoSe2 and MoTe2 single crystals, and the greatly shortened

discussed. Furthermore, a phototransistor based on exfoliated multi-layered

informed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces where CO$_2$
is monitored. Our modelling suggests that regular attendance at an office for
work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic but only if
relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate
ventilation (i.e. at least 10\,l/s/p following UK guidance), appropriate
hygiene controls, distancing measures, and that all commuting presents minimal
infection risk. Crucially, modelling even moderate changes to the conditions
within the office, or basing estimates for the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2
variant B1.1.7 current data, typically results in the prediction that for a
single infector within the office the airborne route alone gives rises to more
than one secondary infection.

continuous mechanical motions and discrete stochastic chemical kinetics. The
present work provides a detailed analysis of the central limit theorem (CLT),
with a time-inhomogeneous Gaussian process, near a deterministic limit cycle in
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Based on the theory of random perturbations of dynamical
systems and the WKB approximation respectively, results are developed in
parallel from both standpoints of stochastic trajectories and transition
probability density and their relations are elucidated. We show rigorously the
correspondence between the local Gaussian fluctuations and the curvature of the
large deviation rate function near its infimum, connecting the CLT and the
large deviation principle of diffusion processes. We study uniform asymptotic
behavior of stochastic limit cycles through the interchange of limits of time
$t\to\infty$ and $\epsilon\to 0$. Three further characterizations of stochastic
limit cycle oscillators are obtained: (i) An approximation of the probability
flux near the cycle; (ii) Two special features of the vector field for the
cyclic motion; (iii) A local entropy balance equation along the cycle with
clear physical meanings. Lastly and different from the standard treatment, the
origin of the $\epsilon$ in the theory is justified by a novel scaling
hypothesis via constructing a sequence of stochastic differential equations.

dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and
deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI).
We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare
professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with
front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as
a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building
block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of
a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which
enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a
metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to
be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of
QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS
hospitals. Finally, we report evaluation results that demonstrate the

enables reconstructing the spatial connectivity and organization of white
matter of the brain. Fiber tractography takes advantage of diffusion Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (dMRI) which allows measuring the apparent diffusivity of
cerebral water along different spatial directions. Unfortunately, collecting
such data comes at the price of reduced spatial resolution and substantially
elevated acquisition times, which limits the clinical applicability of dMRI.
This problem has been thus far addressed using two principal strategies. Most
of the efforts have been extended towards improving the quality of signal
estimation for any, yet fixed sampling scheme (defined through the choice of
diffusion-encoding gradients). On the other hand, optimization over the
sampling scheme has also proven to be effective. Inspired by the previous
results, the present work consolidates the above strategies into a unified
estimation framework, in which the optimization is carried out with respect to
both estimation model and sampling design {\it concurrently}. The proposed
solution offers substantial improvements in the quality of signal estimation as
well as the accuracy of ensuing analysis by means of fiber tractography. While
proving the optimality of the learned estimation models would probably need
more extensive evaluation, we nevertheless claim that the learned sampling
schemes can be of immediate use, offering a way to improve the dMRI analysis
without the necessity of deploying the neural network used for their
estimation. We present a comprehensive comparative analysis based on the Human

$\mathcal{L} \Gamma \hookrightarrow L^\infty(\Omega) \rtimes \Gamma$ the
natural inclusion of the group von Neumann algebra into the crossed product.
When $\mu(\Omega) = \infty$, we have that this natural embedding is not
trace-preserving and therefore does not extends boundedly to the associated
noncommutative $L^p$-spaces. Nevertheless, we show that when $\Omega$ has an
invariant mean there is an isometric embedding of $L^p(\mathcal{L} \Gamma)$
into an ultrapower of $L^p(\Omega \rtimes \Gamma)$ that intertwines Fourier
multipliers and is $\mathcal{L} \Gamma$-bimodular. As a consequence we obtain
the lower transference bound \[
  \big\| T_m: L^p(\mathcal{L} \Gamma) \to L^p(\mathcal{L} \Gamma) \big\|

  The condition of having an invariant mean is quite restrictive. Therefore, we
explore whether other equivariant embeddings $\Phi: \mathcal{L} \Gamma \to
L^\infty(\Omega)$ yield a more general transference result. We show that the
transference proof above works verbatim whenever $\Phi$ is completely positive,
amenable (in the sense of inducing an amenable correspondence) and intertwines
Fourier multipliers at the $L^2$-level. Although no new transference results
are obtained, both the classification of equivariant maps and the study their
amenability may be of independent interest to some readers.

accomplishes a smooth impedance matching between the cryostat and the open air.
Here, we study the transmission of two-mode squeezed thermal states, developing
a technique to design the optimal shape of a coplanar antenna to preserve the

adaptive control allocators to handle both magnitude and rate saturation

for automatic detection of MSEs with machine learning, i.e. with deep learning
based on raw EEG and EOG data as input. We analyzed MWT data of 76 patients.
Experts visually scored wakefulness, and according to recently developed
scoring criteria MSEs, microsleep episode candidates (MSEc), and episodes of
drowsiness (ED). We implemented segmentation algorithms based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and a combination of a CNN with a long-short term memory
(LSTM) network. A LSTM network is a type of a recurrent neural network which
has a memory for past events and takes them into account. Data of 53 patients

testing. Our algorithms showed a good performance close to human experts. The
detection was very good for wakefulness and MSEs and poor for MSEc and ED,
similar to the low inter-expert reliability for these borderline segments. We
provide a proof of principle that it is feasible to reliably detect MSEs with

oscillates in space for larger distances. We theoretically investigate the
scattering properties and compute the scattering phase shifts and scattering
lengths between two heavy impurities in an ideal Fermi gas at zero temperature.
While the induced interaction between impurities is weakly attractive for weak
impurity-medium interactions, we find that impurities strongly and attractively

sign change of the induced scattering length and even strong repulsion. These
resonances occur whenever a three-body Efimov bound state appears at the

particular factor (termed {\em content}) from other factors (referred to as
{\em style}). What constitutes the content is typically specified by users
through explicit labels in the data, while all unlabeled/unknown factors are
regarded as style. Recently, it has been shown that such content-labeled data
can be effectively exploited by modifying the deep latent factor models (e.g.,
VAE) such that the style and content are well separated in the latent
representations. However, the approach assumes that the content factor is
categorical-valued (e.g., subject ID in face image data, or digit class in the
MNIST dataset). In certain situations, the content is ordinal-valued, that is,
the values the content factor takes are {\em ordered} rather than categorical,
making content-labeled VAEs, including the latent space they infer, suboptimal.
In this paper, we propose a novel extension of VAE that imposes a partially
ordered set (poset) structure in the content latent space, while simultaneously
making it aligned with the ordinal content values. To this end, instead of the
iid Gaussian latent prior adopted in prior approaches, we introduce a
conditional Gaussian spacing prior model. This model admits a tractable joint
Gaussian prior, but also effectively places negligible density values on the
content latent configurations that violate the poset constraint. To evaluate
this model, we consider two specific ordinal structured problems: estimating a
subject's age in a face image and elucidating the calorie amount in a food meal
image. We demonstrate significant improvements in content-style separation over
previous non-ordinal approaches.

edges of a $2$-regular $n$-vertex graph $G$ are arriving one-by-one in a stream
and we are promised that $G$ is a disjoint union of either $k$-cycles or
$2k$-cycles for some small $k$; the goal is to distinguish between these two
cases. Verbin and Yu [SODA 2011] introduced this problem and showed that any
single-pass streaming algorithm solving it requires $n^{1-\Omega(\frac{1}{k})}$
space. This result and the technique behind it -- the Boolean Hidden
Hypermatching communication problem -- has since been used extensively for
proving streaming lower bounds for various problems.
  Despite its significance and broad range of applications, the lower bound
technique of Verbin and Yu comes with a key weakness that is inherited by all
subsequent results: the Boolean Hidden Hypermatching problem is hard only if
there is exactly one round of communication and can be solved with logarithmic
communication in two rounds. Therefore, all streaming lower bounds derived from
this problem only hold for single-pass algorithms.
  We prove the first multi-pass lower bound for the gap cycle counting problem:
Any $p$-pass streaming algorithm that can distinguish between disjoint union of
$k$-cycles vs $2k$-cycles -- or even $k$-cycles vs one Hamiltonian cycle --
requires $n^{1-\frac{1}{k^{\Omega(1/p)}}}$ space. As a corollary of this
result, we can extend many of previous lower bounds to multi-pass algorithms.
For instance, we can now prove that any streaming algorithm that
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximates the value of MAX-CUT, maximum matching size, or
rank of an $n$-by-$n$ matrix, requires either $n^{\Omega(1)}$ space or
$\Omega(\log{(\frac{1}{\epsilon})})$ passes. For all these problems, prior work
left open the possibility of even an $O(\log{n})$ space algorithm in only two
passes.

recently. The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider observed in
ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions a process related to the photon splitting
- light by light scattering. In addition, a team of Italian, Polish and British
astrophysicists obtained the first observational evidence of the existence of
vacuum birefringence in the magnetic field of an isolated neutron star -
another physical phenomenon also related to the photon splitting. These new
developments triggered this essay, written several years ago.

the analytic structure of the flat-space S-matrix. In particular, these
principles give rise to the Steinmann relations, which require that the double
discontinuities of scattering amplitudes in partially-overlapping momentum
channels vanish. Conversely, at cosmological scales, the imprint of causality
and unitarity is in general less well understood---the wavefunction of the
universe lives on the future space-like boundary, and has all time evolution
integrated out. In the present work, we show how the flat-space Steinmann
relations emerge from the structure of the wavefunction of the universe, and
derive similar relations that apply to the wavefunction itself. This is done
within the context of scalar toy models whose perturbative wavefunction has a
first-principles definition in terms of cosmological polytopes. In particular,
we use the fact that the scattering amplitude is encoded in the scattering
facet of cosmological polytopes, and that cuts of the amplitude are encoded in
the codimension-one boundaries of this facet. As we show, the flat-space
Steinmann relations are thus implied by the non-existence of codimension-two
boundaries at the intersection of the boundaries associated with pairs of
partially-overlapping channels. Applying the same argument to the full
cosmological polytope, we also derive Steinmann-type constraints that apply to
the full wavefunction of the universe. These arguments show how the
combinatorial properties of cosmological polytopes lead to the emergence of
flat-space causality in the S-matrix, and provide new insights into the
analytic structure of the wavefunction of the universe.

the influence of the control gains, in terms of the oscillations and the rise

energy loss in nuclei due to multiple parton scattering within the recently
improved high-twist approach, where gauge invariance can be ensured by a
delicate setup of the initial partons' transverse momenta. Our new result is
consistent with the previous calculations of light quark energy loss in the
massless limit and heavy quark energy loss in the soft gluon radiation limit,
respectively. We show numerically the correction to the heavy quark energy loss
as compared with previous result and with soft gluon radiation approximation.
The necessity to go beyond soft gluon radiation limit is demonstrated for a
global description of light and heavy flavor data in heavy-ion collisions.

saliency detection by learning from the data labeling process. Existing RGB-D
saliency detection models treat this task as a point estimation problem by
predicting a single saliency map following a deterministic learning pipeline.
We argue that, however, the deterministic solution is relatively ill-posed.
Inspired by the saliency data labeling process, we propose a generative
architecture to achieve probabilistic RGB-D saliency detection which utilizes a
latent variable to model the labeling variations. Our framework includes two
main models: 1) a generator model, which maps the input image and latent
variable to stochastic saliency prediction, and 2) an inference model, which
gradually updates the latent variable by sampling it from the true or
approximate posterior distribution. The generator model is an encoder-decoder
saliency network. To infer the latent variable, we introduce two different
solutions: i) a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder with an extra encoder to
approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variable; and ii) an
Alternating Back-Propagation technique, which directly samples the latent
variable from the true posterior distribution. Qualitative and quantitative
results on six challenging RGB-D benchmark datasets show our approach's
superior performance in learning the distribution of saliency maps. The source

and various estimation methods have been developed. However, existing methods
are not efficient for some reasons: (i) the sparse structure is not always
incorporated in causal order estimation, and (ii) the whole information of the

a new estimation method for a linear DAG model with non-Gaussian noises. The
proposed method is based on the log-likelihood of independent component
analysis (ICA) with two penalty terms related to the sparsity and the
consistency condition. The proposed method enables us to estimate the causal
order and the parameters simultaneously. For stable and efficient optimization,
we propose some devices, such as a modified natural gradient. Numerical

the number of centers $k$, a $k$-clustering problem with (uniform) lower bounds
gets a number $B$. The solution space is restricted to clusterings where every
cluster has at least $B$ points. We demonstrate how to approximate $k$-median
with lower bounds via a reduction to facility location with lower bounds, for
which $O(1)$-approximation algorithms are known.
  Then we propose a new constrained clustering problem with lower bounds where
we allow points to be assigned multiple times (to different centers). This
means that for every point, the clustering specifies a set of centers to which
it is assigned. We call this clustering with weak lower bounds. We give a
$(6.5+\epsilon)$-approximation for $k$-median clustering with weak lower bounds
and an $O(1)$-approximation for $k$-means with weak lower bounds.
  We conclude by showing that at a constant increase in the approximation
factor, we can restrict the number of assignments of every point to $2$ (or, if
we allow fractional assignments, to $1+\epsilon$). This also leads to the first
bicritera approximation algorithm for $k$-means with (standard) lower bounds
where bicriteria is interpreted in the sense that the lower bounds are violated
by a constant factor.

the star forming gas is organised in interstellar filaments, a finding that is
supported by numerical simulations of the supersonic interstellar medium (ISM)
where dense filamentary structures are ubiquitous. We aim to understand the
formation of these dense structures by performing observations covering the
$^{12}$CO(4-3), $^{12}$CO(3-2), and various CO(2-1) isotopologue lines of the
Musca filament, using the APEX telescope. The observed CO intensities and line
ratios cannot be explained by PDR (photodissociation region) emission because
of the low ambient far-UV field that is strongly constrained by the
non-detections of the [C II] line at 158 $\mu$m and the [O I] line at 63
$\mu$m, observed with the upGREAT receiver on SOFIA, as well as a weak [C I]
609 $\mu$m line detected with APEX. We propose that the observations are
consistent with a scenario in which shock excitation gives rise to warm and
dense gas close to the highest column density regions in the Musca filament.
Using shock models, we find that the CO observations can be consistent with
excitation by J-type low-velocity shocks. A qualitative comparison of the
observed CO spectra with synthetic observations of dynamic filament formation
simulations shows a good agreement with the signature of a filament accretion
shock that forms a cold and dense filament from a converging flow. The Musca
filament is thus found to be dense molecular post-shock gas. Filament accretion
shocks that dissipate the supersonic kinetic energy of converging flows in the
ISM may thus play a prominent role in the evolution of cold and dense
filamentary structures.

surfaces of general type and the failure of the BMY inequality in positive
characteristic. We consider semistable fibrations $\pi:S \longrightarrow C$
where $S$ is a smooth projective surface and $C$ is a smooth projective curve.
Using the exact sequence relating the locally exact differential forms on $S$,
$C$, and $S/C$, we prove an inequality relating $c_1^2$ and $c_2$ for ordinary
surfaces which admit generically ordinary semistable fibrations. This
inequality differs from the BMY inequality by a correcting term which vanishes
if the fibration is ordinary.

characterized by a deficiency of disk material close to the star. In a
subgroup, inner holes in these disks can stretch out to a few tens of au while
there is still mass accretion onto the central star observed. We analyse the
proposition that this type of wide transition disks is generated by the
interaction of the disk with a system of embedded planets. We performed 2D
hydrodynamics simulations of a flat disk using either a locally isothermal
equation of state or considering also radiative effects. Two 3 to 9 Jupiter
mass planets were embedded in the disk and their dynamical evolution due to
disk-planet interaction was followed for over 100 000 years. The simulations
account for mass accretion onto the star and planets. We included models with
parameters geared to the system PDS 70. To assess the observability of features
in our models we performed synthetic ALMA observations.
  For systems with a more massive inner planet there are phases where both
planets migrate outward engaged in a 2:1 mean motion resonance via the
Masset-Snellgrove mechanism. In sufficiently massive disks the formation of a
vortex in the outer disk can trigger rapid outward migration of the outer
planet where its distance increases by tens of au within a few thousand years.
Later, the outer planet migrates back inwards settling again into resonance
with the inner planet. We call this emerging composite phenomenon a 'migration
jump'. Outward migration and the migration jumps are accompanied by a high mass
accretion rate onto the star. The synthetic images reveal numerous
substructures depending on the type of dynamical behaviour. Our results suggest
that the outward migration of two embedded planets is a prime candidate for the
explanation of the observed high stellar mass accretion rate in wide transition
disks.

range of both fundamental and technical factors. Our model is built around the
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and uses a long list of engineered input
features based on quarterly financial announcement data from 1,106 companies in
the Russell 1000 index between 1997 and 2018. We perform numerous experiments

literature. First, we show how Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift can be analysed
using machine learning methods and demonstrate such methods' prowess in
producing credible forecasting on the drift direction. It is the first time
PEAD dynamics are studied using XGBoost. We show that the drift direction is in
fact driven by different factors for stocks from different industrial sectors
and in different quarters and XGBoost is effective in understanding the
changing drivers. Second, we show that an XGBoost well optimised by a Genetic
Algorithm can help allocate out-of-sample stocks to form portfolios with higher
positive returns to long and portfolios with lower negative returns to short, a
finding that could be adopted in the process of developing market neutral
strategies. Third, we show how theoretical event-driven stock strategies have

representations (e.g., slot-value pairs) from speech recognized texts, which

problem caused by ASR-errors, previous works may apply input adaptations to the
speech recognized texts, or correct ASR errors in predicted values by searching
the most similar candidates in pronunciation. However, these two methods are
applied separately and independently. In this work, we propose a new robust SLU
framework to guide the SLU input adaptation with a rule-based value error
recovery module. The framework consists of a slot tagging model and a
rule-based value error recovery module. We pursue on an adapted slot tagging
model which can extract potential slot-value pairs mentioned in ASR hypotheses
and is suitable for the existing value error recovery module. After the value
error recovery, we can achieve a supervision signal (reward) by comparing
refined slot-value pairs with annotations. Since operations of the value error
recovery are non-differentiable, we exploit policy gradient based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) to optimize the SLU model. Extensive experiments on the public

improve the robustness of SLU and outperform the baselines by significant

few-layered 2D Sb/graphene heterostructures by atomic-resolution (scanning)
transmission electron microscopy. We find the co-existence of two Sb
morphologies: First is a 2D growth morphology of layered beta-Sb with
beta-Sb(001)||graphene(001) texture. Second are one-dimensional (1D) Sb
nanowires which can be matched to beta-Sb with beta-Sb[2-21] perpendicular to
graphene(001) texture and are structurally also closely related to
thermodynamically non-preferred cubic Sb(001)||graphene(001). Importantly, both
Sb morphologies show rotational van-der-Waals epitaxy with the graphene
support. Both Sb morphologies are well resilient against environmental bulk
oxidation, although superficial Sb-oxide layer formation merits consideration,
including formation of novel epitaxial Sb2O3(111)/beta-Sb(001)

giant, has recently been proposed to be a symbiotic star largely based on its
hard X-ray properties. The star does not display, in low-resolution optical
spectra, the high excitation lines typically seen in the spectra of symbiotic
stars. In the present work, UV, optical, and near-infrared observations are
presented, aimed at exploring and strengthening the proposed symbiotic
classification for this star. Our Far-UV 1300-1800$\AA$ spectrum of SU Lyn,
obtained with the ASTROSAT mission's UVIT payload, shows emission lines of Si
IV, C IV, OIII and N III in a spectrum typical of symbiotic stars. The UV
spectrum robustly confirms SU Lyn's symbiotic nature. The detection of high
excitation lines in a high-resolution optical spectrum further consolidates its
symbiotic nature. As is being recognized, the potential existence of other
similar symbiotic systems could significantly impact the census of symbiotic
stars in the galaxy.

find that the shape of the population interface serves as an indicator for the
evolutionary dynamics within the heterogeneous population. In particular,
invasion front undulations become enhanced when the invading population is near
a mutational meltdown transition or when the surrounding ""bystander"" population

the benefits of batch training with GPUs. By analyzing the back-propagation

compatible with auto-differentiation (e.g., in PyTorch and TensorFlow) and
provide better GPU utilization. Our implementation in PyTorch showed
significant training speed-ups (by factors of 54x - 94x for training various

clouds of maize plants. However, automatic stem-leaf segmentation of maize
shoots from three-dimensional (3D) point clouds remains challenging, especially
for new emerging leaves that are very close and wrapped together during the
seedling stage. To address this issue, we propose an automatic segmentation
method consisting of three main steps: skeleton extraction, coarse segmentation
based on the skeleton, fine segmentation based on stem-leaf classification. The
segmentation method was tested on 30 maize seedlings and compared with manually
obtained ground truth. The mean precision, mean recall, mean micro F1 score and
mean over accuracy of our segmentation algorithm were 0.964, 0.966, 0.963 and
0.969. Using the segmentation results, two applications were also developed in
this paper, including phenotypic trait extraction and skeleton optimization.
Six phenotypic parameters can be accurately and automatically measured,
including plant height, crown diameter, stem height and diameter, leaf width
and length. Furthermore, the values of R2 for the six phenotypic traits were
all above 0.94. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm could
automatically and precisely segment not only the fully expanded leaves, but
also the new leaves wrapped together and close together. The proposed approach
may play an important role in further maize research and applications, such as
genotype-to-phenotype study, geometric reconstruction and dynamic growth
animation. We released the source code and test data at the web site

an important role for gaining a better quantitative understanding of how fluid
dynamics is altered by the presence of obstacles and which forces are exerted
on the solids by the moving fluid. Such problems appear in various contexts,
ranging from numerous technical applications such as turbines to medical
problems such as the regulation of hemodyamics by valves. Typically, the
numerical treatment of such problems is posed within a fluid structure
interaction (FSI) framework. General FSI models are able to capture
bidirectional interactions, but are challenging to solve and computationally
expensive. Simplified methods offer a possible remedy by achieving better
computational efficiency to broaden the scope to demanding application problems
with focus on understanding the effect of solids on altering fluid dynamics. In
this study we report on the development of a novel method for such

dynamics context using concepts from porous media theory. Based on the
Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations which augments the Navier-Stokes equation with
a Darcy drag term our method represents solid obstacles as time-varying regions
containing a porous medium of vanishing permeability. Numerical stabilization
and turbulence modeling is dealt with by using a residual based variational
multiscale formulation. The key advantages of our approach -- computational
efficiency and ease of implementation -- are demonstrated by solving a standard
benchmark problem of a rotating blood pump posed by the Food and Drug
Administration Agency (FDA). Validity is demonstrated by conducting a mesh
convergence study and by comparison against the extensive set of experimental
data provided for this benchmark.

frequency and energy of impulsive events in the outer solar atmosphere in an
attempt to understand the predominant energy supply mechanism in the corona.
Here, we apply a burst detection algorithm to high-resolution imaging data
obtained by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph to further investigate
the derived power-law index, $\gamma$, of bright impulsive events in the
transition region. Applying the algorithm with a constant minimum event
lifetime (of either $60$ s or $110$ s) indicated that the target under
investigation, such as Plage and Sunspot, has an influence on the observed
power-law index. For regions dominated by sunspots, we always find $\gamma <2$;
however, for datasets where the target is a plage region, we often find that
$\gamma >2$ in the energy range [$\sim10^{23}$, $\sim10^{26}$] erg. Applying
the algorithm with a minimum event lifetime of three timesteps indicated that
cadence was another important factor, with the highest cadence datasets
returning $\gamma >2$ values. The estimated total radiative power obtained for
the observed energy distributions is typically 10-25 % of what would be
required to sustain the corona indicating that impulsive events in this energy
range are not sufficient to solve coronal heating. If we were to extend the
power-law distribution down to an energy of $10^{21}$ erg, and assume parity
between radiative energy release and the deposition of thermal energy, then
such bursts could provide 25-50 % of the required energy to account for the
coronal heating problem.

plantations are heavily reliant on groundwater, the over-exploitation of which
risks impacting groundwater regimes, quality, and accessibility for nearby
GDVs. Cost effective methods of GDV identification will enable strategic
protection of these critical ecological systems, through improved and
sustainable groundwater management by communities and industry. Recent
application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) earth observation data in
Australia has demonstrated the utility of radar for identifying terrestrial
groundwater-dependent ecosystems at scale. We propose a robust classification
method to advance identification of GDVs at scale using processed SAR data
products adapted from a recent previous method. The method includes the
development of SARGDV, a binary classification model, which uses the extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in conjunction with three data cubes
composed of Sentinel-1 SAR interferometric wide images. The images were
collected as a one-year time series over Mount Gambier, a region in South
Australia, known to support GDVs. The SARGDV model demonstrated high
performance for classifying GDVs with 77% precision, 76% true positive rate and
96% accuracy. This method may be used to support the protection of GDV
communities globally by providing a long term, cost-effective solution to
identify GDVs over variable regions and climates, via the use of freely
available, high-resolution, globally available Sentinel-1 SAR data sets.

of FPM has been reported. However, an imperceptible artifact caused by edge
effect caught our attention and may also degrade the precision of phase imaging
in FPM with a cross-shape artifact in the Fourier space. We found that the
precision of reconstructed phase at the same subregion depends on the different

limits the quantitative phase measurements via FPM. And this artifact is caused
by the aperiodic image extension of fast Fourier transform (FFT). Herein, to
remove the edge effect and improve the accuracy, two classes of opposite
algorithms termed discrete cosine transform (DCT) and perfect Fourier transform
(PFT) were reported respectively and discussed systematically. Although both
approaches can remove the artifacts in FPM and may be extended to other Fourier

machine learning algorithms, is able to fully exploit the massive sensing data
generated by Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the limited transmit
power at IoT devices, collecting the sensing data in EL systems is a
challenging task. To address this challenge, this paper proposes to integrate
unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could
improve the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However,
different devices may transmit different data for different machine learning
jobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the
devices' energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This
paper further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy
consumption model and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure
as a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint
path, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a
large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is
nontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related
to UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be
served only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly
reduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS)
based algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal
solution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task
scenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the
full path EL schemes.

an ill-posed problem. Regularization improves the stability of the inversion
and, based on Occam's razor principle, a smoothing constraint is typically
used. However, the conductivity profiles are not always expected to be smooth.
Here, we develop a new inversion scheme in which we transform the model to the
wavelet space and impose a sparsity constraint. This sparsity constrained
inversion scheme will minimize an objective function with a least-squares data
misfit and a sparsity measure of the model in the wavelet domain. A model in
the wavelet domain has both temporal as spatial resolution, and penalizing
small-scale coefficients effectively reduces the complexity of the model.
Depending on the expected conductivity profile, an optimal wavelet basis
function can be chosen. The scheme is thus adaptive. Finally, we apply this new
scheme on a frequency domain electromagnetic sounding (FDEM) dataset, but the
scheme could equally apply to any other 1D geophysical method.

approaches lies in ensuring the feasibility of the predicted solutions to
physical system constraints. Due to the inherent approximation errors, the
solutions predicted by DNNs may violate the operating constraints, e.g., the
transmission line capacities, limiting their applicability in practice. To
address this challenge, we develop DeepOPF+ as a DNN approach based on the
so-called ""preventive"" framework. Specifically, we calibrate the generation and
transmission line limits used in the DNN training, thereby anticipating
approximation errors and ensuring that the resulting predicted solutions remain
feasible. We theoretically characterize the calibration magnitude necessary for
ensuring universal feasibility. Our DeepOPF+ approach improves over existing
DNN-based schemes in that it ensures feasibility and achieves a consistent
speed up performance in both light-load and heavy-load regimes. Detailed
simulation results on a range of test instances show that the proposed DeepOPF+
generates 100% feasible solutions with minor optimality loss. Meanwhile, it
achieves a computational speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to

the formers are also settling under the effect of gravity. The sedimentation of
small particles indeed changes the critical Stokes number above which
collisions occur. This is explained by the presence of a shielding effect
caused by the unstable manifolds of a stagnation-saddle point of an effective
velocity field perceived by the small particles. It is also found that there
exists a secondary critical Stokes number above which no collisions occur. This
is due to the fact that large-Stokes number particles settle faster, making it
more difficult for the larger one to catch them up. Still, in this regime, the
flow disturbances create a complicated particle distribution in the wake of the
collector, sometimes allowing for collisions from the back. This can lead to
collision efficiencies higher than unity at large values of the Froude number.

that successful leptogenesis is possible for $M_{1,2}$ lying in the interval
$M_{1,2} = (0.3 - 100)$ GeV. Our results show also, in particular, that for
vanishing initial $N_{1,2}$ abundance, flavour effects can play an important
role in the generation of the baryon asymmetry, leading to an enhancement of
the asymmetry by a factor up to $\sim 300$ with respect to the ""unflavoured""

and e-processes all enable sequential inference for composite and nonparametric
classes of distributions at arbitrary stopping times. Examining the literature,
one finds that at the heart of all these (quite different) approaches has been
the identification of nonnegative (super)martingales. Thus, informally,
nonnegative (super)martingales are known to be sufficient for
\emph{anytime-valid} sequential inference, even in composite and nonparametric
settings. Our central contribution is to show that nonnegative martingales are
also universal -- after appropriately defining \emph{admissibility}, we show
that all admissible constructions of confidence sequences, p-processes, or
e-processes must necessarily utilize nonnegative martingales. Our proofs
utilize several modern mathematical tools for composite testing and estimation
problems: max-martingales, Snell envelopes, transfinite induction, and new
Doob-L\'evy martingales make appearances in previously unencountered ways.
Informally, if one wishes to perform anytime-valid sequential inference, then
any existing approach can be recovered or dominated using nonnegative
martingales. We provide several nontrivial examples, with special focus on
testing symmetry, where our new constructions render past methods inadmissible.
We also prove the subGaussian supermartingale to be admissible.

large spatial coherence with light and matter. When such an electron emits a
photon, it can do so either as if its charge were confined to a point within a
coherence length, the region where a square modulus of a wave function
$|\psi|^2$ is localized, or as a continuous cloud of space charge spread over
it. This problem was addressed in a recent study R.~Remez, et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 123}, 060401 (2019) where a conclusion was drawn in favor of the
first (point) interpretation. Here we argue that there is an alternative
explanation for the measurements reported in that paper, which relies on purely
classical arguments and does not allow one to refute the second interpretation.
We propose an experiment of Smith-Purcell radiation from a non-relativistic
vortex electron carrying orbital angular momentum, which can unambiguously lead
to the opposite conclusion. Beyond the paraxial approximation, the vortex
packet has a non-point electric quadrupole moment, which grows as the packet
spreads and results in a non-linear $L^3$-growth of the radiation intensity
with the length $L$ of the grating when $L$ is much larger than the packet's
Rayleigh length. Such a non-linear effect has never been observed for single
electrons and, if detected, it would be a hallmark of the non-point nature of
charge in a wave packet. Thus, two views on $|\psi|^2$ are complementary to
each other and an electron radiates either as a point charge or as a continuous
charge flow depending on the experimental conditions and on its quantum state.
Our conclusions hold for a large class of non-Gaussian packets and emission
processes for which the radiation formation length can exceed the Rayleigh
length, such as Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, diffraction
radiation, and so forth.

features map onto concepts. First and foremost, this ability depends on
perceptual discriminability; e.g., observers must be able to see the difference
between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings.
However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic
discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping
between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts
alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous
evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems
that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength
between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength
between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only
maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic
discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is
unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present
study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of
semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar
graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure
colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing
semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual
distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were
dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating
trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.

Despite the exceptional performance of various architectures in practice, we

architectures to preserve all the information of the input data? Identifying
the information lossless condition for deep neural architectures is important,
because tasks such as image restoration require keep the detailed information
of the input data as much as possible. Using the definition of mutual
information, we show that: a deep neural architecture can preserve maximum
details about the given data if and only if the architecture is invertible. We
verify the advantages of our Invertible Restoring Autoencoder (IRAE) network by
comparing it with competitive models on three perturbed image restoration
tasks: image denoising, jpeg image decompression and image inpainting.
Experimental results show that IRAE consistently outperforms non-invertible
ones. Our model even contains far fewer parameters. Thus, it may be worthwhile
to try replacing standard components of deep neural architectures, such as
residual blocks and ReLU, with their invertible counterparts. We believe our
work provides a unique perspective and direction for future deep learning
research.

results, which delineate a tension with their standard model predictions at the

over the redshift interval $0.25 \leq z \leq 3.75$, derived from a combination
of ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Based on a
near-IR selected galaxy sample selected over a raw survey area of 3 deg$^{2}$
and spanning $\geq 4$ dex in stellar mass, we fit the GSMF with both single and
double Schechter functions, carefully accounting for Eddington bias to derive
both observed and intrinsic parameter values. We find that a double Schechter
function is a better fit to the GSMF at all redshifts, although the single and
double Schechter function fits are statistically indistinguishable by $z=3.25$.
We find no evidence for significant evolution in $M^{\star}$, with the
intrinsic value consistent with $\log_{10}(M^{\star} /
M_{\odot})=10.55\pm{0.1}$ over the full redshift range. Overall, our
determination of the GSMF is in good agreement with recent simulation results,
although differences persist at the highest stellar masses. Splitting our
sample according to location on the UVJ plane, we find that the star-forming
GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full
redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since $z\simeq 2.5$. In
contrast, both the normalization and functional form of the passive GSMF
evolves dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double
Schechter function at $z \leq 1.5$. As a result, we find that while passive
galaxies dominate the integrated stellar-mass density at $z \leq 0.75$, they
only contribute $\lesssim 10$ per cent by $z\simeq 3$. Finally, we provide a
simple parameterization that provides an accurate estimate of the GSMF, both
observed and intrinsic, at any redshift within the range $0 \leq z \leq 4$.

(Floquet) quantum many-body systems based on flow equations. Specifically, we
introduce a continuous unitary flow of Floquet operators in an extended Hilbert
space, whose fixed point is both diagonal and time-independent, allowing us to
directly obtain the Floquet modes. We first apply this method to a periodically
driven Anderson insulator, for which it is exact, and then extend it to driven
many-body localized systems within a truncated flow equation ansatz. In
particular we compute the emergent Floquet local integrals of motion that
characterise a periodically driven many-body localized phase. We demonstrate
that the method remains well-controlled in the weakly-interacting regime, and
allows us to access larger system sizes than accessible by numerically exact
methods, paving the way for studies of two-dimensional driven many-body
systems.

attractive approach towards various data-based problems of theoretical physics
in the past decade. There has been a clear trend to deeper architectures
containing increasingly more powerful and involved layers. Contrarily, Taylor
coefficients of DNNs still appear mainly in the light of interpretability
studies, where they are computed at most to first order. However, especially in
theoretical physics numerous problems benefit from accessing higher orders, as
well. This gap motivates a general formulation of neural network (NN) Taylor
expansions. Restricting our analysis to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and
introducing quantities we refer to as propagators and vertices, both depending
on the MLP's weights and biases, we establish a graph-theoretical approach.
Similarly to Feynman rules in quantum field theories, we can systematically
assign diagrams containing propagators and vertices to the corresponding
partial derivative. Examining this approach for S-wave scattering lengths of
shallow potentials, we observe NNs to adapt their derivatives mainly to the
leading order of the target function's Taylor expansion. To circumvent this
problem, we propose an iterative NN perturbation theory. During each iteration
we eliminate the leading order, such that the next-to-leading order can be
faithfully learned during the subsequent iteration. After performing two
iterations, we find that the first- and second-order Born terms are correctly
adapted during the respective iterations. Finally, we combine both results to
find a proxy that acts as a machine-learned second-order Born approximation.

The model shows that there is a clear dependence of the local wavenumber of the
confined spin wave on the local angle of the wall and excitation frequency
used, which leads to the definition of a local index of refraction in the wall
as a function of such angle and frequency. Therefore, the model applies to 1-D
propagating modes, although it also has physical implications for 2-D scenarios
where a domain wall merges with a saturated magnetic region. Micromagnetic
simulations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model and also
give insight on the effects of curved finite structures may have on the
propagating characteristics of spin waves in domain walls.

fundamental and technological interest. Here we use wideband ferromagnetic
resonance to study spin-pumping effects in bilayers that combine a soft

in YBCO by analyzing the magnetization dynamics in Py. We find that the Gilbert
damping exhibits a drastic drop as the heterostructures are cooled across the
normal-superconducting transition and then, depending on the S/F interface
morphology, either stays constant or shows a strong upturn. This unique
behavior is explained considering quasiparticle density of states at the YBCO
surface, and is a direct consequence of zero-gap nodes for particular
directions in the momentum space. Besides showing the fingerprint of d-wave
superconductivity in spin-pumping, our results demonstrate the potential of
high-temperature superconductors for fine tuning of the magnetization dynamics

construction of each module consists of a series of assembly and quality
control steps, which were engineered to be identical for all production sites.
In order to develop the tooling and procedures for assembly and testing of
these modules, two series of major prototyping programs were conducted: an
early program using readout chips designed using a 250 nm fabrication process
(ABCN-25) and a subsequent program using a follow-up chip set made using 130 nm
processing (ABC130 and HCC130 chips). This second generation of readout chips
was used for an extensive prototyping program that produced around 100
barrel-type modules and contributed significantly to the development of the
final module layout. This paper gives an overview of the components used in
ABC130 barrel modules, their assembly procedure and findings resulting from
their tests.

without the need for specialized statistical training. Conquery aims to
simplify big data analysis for novice database users in the medical sector.
Methods: Conquery is a document-oriented distributed timeseries database and
analysis platform. Its main application is the analysis of per-person medical
records by non-technical medical professionals. Complex analyses are realized
in the Conquery frontend by dragging tree nodes into the query editor. Queries
are evaluated by a bespoke distributed query-engine for medical records in a
column-oriented fashion. We present a custom compression scheme to facilitate
low response times that uses online calculated as well as precomputed metadata

research. It has been widely used in biological researches, such as structural
imaging of vasculature, brain structural and functional imaging, and tumor
detection. The conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-
PAM) employs focused gaussian beam to achieve high lateral resolution by a
microscope objective with high numerical apertures. Since the focused gaussian
beam only has narrow depth range in focus, little detail in depth direction can
be revealed. Here, we developed a synthetic multi-focus optical-resolution
photoacoustic microscope using multi-scale weighted gradient-based fusion.
Based on the saliency of the image structure, a gradient-based multi-focus
image fusion method is used, and a multi-scale method is used to determine the
gradient weights. We pay special attention to a dual-scale scheme, which
effectively solves the fusion problem caused by anisotropic blur and
registration error. First, the structure-based large-scale focus measurement
method is used to reduce the effect of anisotropic blur and registration error
on the detection of the focus area, and then the gradient weights near the edge
wave are used by applying the small-scale focus measure. Simulation was
performed to test the performance of our method, different focused images were
used to verify the feasibility of the method. Performance of our method was
analyzed by calculating Entropy, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Edge strength. The
result of simulation shown that this method can extend the depth of field of
PAM two times without the sacrifice of lateral resolution. And the in vivo
imaging of the zebra fish further demonstrates the feasibility of our method.

for the recovery of gradient-sparse signals from undersampled Gaussian
measurements. Recently established bounds for the required sampling rate state
that uniform recovery of all $s$-gradient-sparse signals in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is
only possible with $m \gtrsim \sqrt{s n} \cdot \text{PolyLog}(n)$ measurements.
Such a condition is especially prohibitive for high-dimensional problems, where
$s$ is much smaller than $n$. However, previous empirical findings seem to
indicate that the latter sampling rate does not reflect the typical behavior of
total variation minimization. Indeed, this work provides a rigorous analysis
that breaks the $\sqrt{s n}$-bottleneck for a large class of natural signals.
The main result shows that non-uniform recovery succeeds with high probability
for $m \gtrsim s \cdot \text{PolyLog}(n)$ measurements if the jump
discontinuities of the signal vector are sufficiently well separated. In
particular, this guarantee allows for signals arising from a discretization of
piecewise constant functions defined on an interval. The present paper serves
as a short summary of the main results in our recent work [arxiv:2001.09952].

widely used in marine engineering due to its computational efficiency. The
particular challenge of the primal and the corresponding adjoint VoF-approach
refers to the sharp interface treatment featuring discontinuous physical
properties. Both the continuous adjoint two-phase system (integration-by-parts)
and the corresponding dual compressive convection schemes (summation-by-parts)
are derived for two prominent compressive convection schemes, namely the High
Resolution Interface Capturing Scheme (HRIC) and Compressive Interface
Capturing Scheme for Arbitrary Meshes (CICSAM). The dual scheme rigorously
mirrors the primal Normalized-Variable-Diagram (NVD) stencils. Attention is
restricted to steady state applications. Thus both the primal and the dual
procedures are performed in pseudo time and the backward integration of the
dual approach is performed around the (pseudo-temporal) converged primal field.
The paper analyses the primal and adjoint equations for an engineering model
problem. An analytical solution to the model problem is initially presented,
which displays that the adjoint part does not offer a unique, non-trivial
solution. As a remedy, an additional diffusive concentration term is introduced
to the adjoint concentration equation. Numerical results obtained from the
modified approach are benchmarked against the analytical solution for the model
problem. Supplementary, the influence of the modification on the sensitivities
obtained from simulations for the two-dimensional flow around a submerged
hydrofoil are discussed. The final application refers to a shape-optimization

fluid flow using FEM is presented. One of the most interesting features of this
approach is the small computational effort required to solve the motion of the
rigid body, comparable to a pure fluid solver. The model is based on the idea
of extending the fluid velocity inside the rigid body and solving the flow
equations with a penalization term to enforce rigid motion inside the solid. In
order to get the velocity field in the fluid domain the Navier-Stokes equations
for an incompressible viscous flow are solved using a fractional-step procedure
combined with the two-step Taylor-Galerkin for the fractional linear momentum.
Once the velocity field in the fluid domain is computed, calculation of the
rigid motion is obtained by averaging translation and angular velocities over
the solid. One of the main challenges when dealing with the fluid-solid
interaction is the proper modelling of the interface which separates the solid
moving mass from the viscous fluid. In this work the combination of the level
set technique and the two-step Taylor-Galerkin algorithm for tracking the
fluid-solid interface is proposed. The good properties exhibited by the
two-step Taylor-Galerkin, minimizing oscillations and numerical diffusion, make
this method suitable to accurately advect the solid domain avoiding distortions
at its boundaries, and thus preserving the initial size and shape of the rigid
body. The proposed model has been validated against empirical solutions,
experimental data and numerical simulations found in the literature. In all
tested cases, the numerical results have shown to be accurate, proving the
potential of the proposed model as a valuable tool for the numerical analysis

undergoing contraction processes via generic node deletion scenarios, namely,
random deletion, preferential deletion and propagating deletion. Focusing on
configuration model networks, which exhibit a given degree distribution
$P_0(k)$ and no correlations, we show using a rigorous argument that upon
contraction the degree distributions of these networks converge towards a
Poisson distribution. To this end, we use the relative entropy $S_t=S[P_t(k) ||
\pi(k|\langle K \rangle_t)]$ of the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ of the
contracting network at time $t$ with respect to the corresponding Poisson
distribution $\pi(k|\langle K \rangle_t)$ with the same mean degree $\langle K
\rangle_t$ as a distance measure between $P_t(k)$ and Poisson. The relative
entropy is suitable as a distance measure since it satisfies $S_t \ge 0$ for
any degree distribution $P_t(k)$, while equality is obtained only for $P_t(k) =
\pi(k|\langle K \rangle_t)$. We derive an equation for the time derivative
$dS_t/dt$ during network contraction and show that the relative entropy
decreases monotonically to zero during the contraction process. We thus
conclude that the degree distributions of contracting configuration model
networks converge towards a Poisson distribution. Since the contracting
networks remain uncorrelated, this means that their structures converge towards
an Erd{\H o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph structure, substantiating earlier results
obtained using direct integration of the master equation and computer
simulations [I. Tishby, O. Biham and E. Katzav, {\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 100},

with degenerate degree distributions (random regular graphs), exponential
degree distributions and power-law degree distributions (scale-free networks).

calculate SCC efficiently and accurately, we proposed a graph embedding local
self-attention encoder (GELAE) model, in which, a novel invariant structure
representation of the coupling system in terms of bond length, bond angle and
dihedral angle was presented firstly, and then a local self-attention module
embedded with the adjacent matrix of a graph was designed to extract
effectively the features of coupling systems, finally, with a modified
classification loss function, the SCC was predicted. To validate the
superiority of the proposed method, we conducted a series of comparison
experiments using different structure representations, different attention
modules, and different losses. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared to the traditional chemical bond structure representations, the
rotation and translation invariant structure representations proposed in this
work can improve the SCC prediction accuracy; with the graph embedded local
self-attention, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the prediction model in the
validation set decreases from 0.1603 Hz to 0.1067 Hz; using the classification

application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear
partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that
adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately
the stubborn spots in the solution of ""stiff"" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a
fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights
are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the
neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult
and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft
multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms
used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the
weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by
training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the
weights. We show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using
Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient
descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to
produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix
for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of
the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of
infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth
equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the
different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and
nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art
PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.

provide access to time-domain studies of electronic dynamics in the natural

two techniques that are representative of the two main branches of attosecond
science: pump-probe measurements using attosecond pulses and high-harmonic
spectroscopy (HHS). In the first part, we discuss attosecond photoelectron
spectroscopy with cylindrical microjets and its application to measure time
delays between liquid and gaseous water. We present the experimental
techniques, the new data-analysis methods and the experimental results. We
describe in detail the conceptual and theoretical framework required to fully
describe attosecond chronoscopy in liquids at a quantum-mechanical level. This
includes photoionization delays, scattering delays, as well as a coherent
description of electron transport and (laser-assisted) photoemission and
scattering. As a consequence, we show that attosecond chronoscopy of liquids
is, in general, sensitive to both types of delays, as well as the electron
mean-free paths. Through detailed modeling, involving state-of-the-art quantum
scattering and Monte-Carlo trajectory methods, we show that the photoionization
delays dominate in attosecond chronoscopy of liquid water at photon energies of
20-30 eV. This conclusion is supported by a near-quantitative agreement between
experiment and theory. In the second part, we introduce HHS of liquids based on
flat microjets. These results represent the first observation of high-harmonic

Spark, due to its productivity, portability from JVM-based execution, and
support for a rich set of libraries. However, the performance of these
applications can widely vary depending on the runtime flags chosen out of all
existing JVM flags. Manually tuning these flags is both cumbersome and
error-prone. Automated tuning approaches can ease the task, but current
solutions either require considerable processing time or target a subset of
flags to avoid time and space requirements. In this paper, we present
OneStopTuner, a Machine Learning based novel framework for autotuning JVM
flags. OneStopTuner controls the amount of data generation by leveraging batch
mode active learning to characterize the user application. Based on the
user-selected optimization metric, OneStopTuner then discards the irrelevant
JVM flags by applying feature selection algorithms on the generated data.
Finally, it employs sample efficient methods such as Bayesian optimization and
regression guided Bayesian optimization on the shortlisted JVM flags to find
the optimal values for the chosen set of flags. We evaluated OneStopTuner on
widely used Spark benchmarks and compare its performance with the traditional
simulated annealing based autotuning approach. We demonstrate that for
optimizing execution time, the flags chosen by OneStopTuner provides a speedup
of up to 1.35x over default Spark execution, as compared to 1.15x speedup by
using the flag configurations proposed by simulated annealing. OneStopTuner was
able to reduce the number of executions for data-generation by 70% and was able
to suggest the optimal flag configuration 2.4x faster than the standard
simulated annealing based approach, excluding the time for data-generation.

people were advised to follow precautionary measures by themselves. These
timely decisions taken by the Indian government helped in decelerating the
spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic
continues to spread and hence, there is an urgent need to plan and control the
spread of this disease. This is possible by finding the future predictions
about the spread. Scientists across the globe are working towards estimating
the future growth of COVID-19. This paper proposes a Modified SEIRD

infections in India and its five states having the highest number of total
cases. In this model, exposed compartment contains individuals which may be
asymptomatic but infectious. Deep Learning based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

projections obtained from the proposed Modified SEIRD model have also been
compared with the projections made by LSTM for next 30 days. The
epidemiological data up to 15th August 2020 has been used for carrying out
