  Middleware for Internet of Things",,,"10.1109/ASET48392.2020.9118238",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet of Things (IoT) has become the buzzword for the development of Smart
City and its applications. In this context, development of supporting software
forms the core part of the IoT infrastructure. A Middleware sits in between the
IoT devices and interacts between them to exchange data among the components of
the automated architecture. The Middleware services include hand shaking, data
transfer and security among its core set of functionalities. It also includes
cross-cutting functional services such as authentication, logging and caching.
A software that can run these Middleware services requires a careful choice of
a good software modelling technique. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a
software development methodology that can be used to independently encapsulate
the core and cross-cutting functionalities of the Middleware services of the
IoT infrastructure. In this paper, an attempt has been made using a simulation
environment to independently model the two orthogonal functionalities of the
Middleware with the focus to improve its modularity. Further, a quantitative
measurement of the core design property of cohesion has been done to infer on
the improvement in the reusability of the modules encapsulated in the
Middleware of IoT. Based on the measurement, it was found that the modularity
and reusability of functionalities in the Middleware software has improved in
the AspectJ version compared to its equivalent Java version.

  space dimensions","Submitted",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present paper, we show an improved lower bound for the lifespan of the
solutions to the ideal MHD equations in the case of space dimension $d=2$. In
particular, for small initial magnetic fields $b_0$ of size (say)
$\varepsilon>0$, the lifespan $T_\varepsilon>0$ of the corresponding solution
goes to $+\infty$ in the limit $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+$.
  Such a result does not follow from standard quasi-linear hyperbolic theory.
For proving it, three are the crucial ingredients: first of all, to work in
endpoint Besov spaces $B^s_{\infty,r}$, under the condition $s>1$ and
$r\in[1,+\infty]$ or $s=r=1$; moreover, to use the Els\""asser formulation of
the ideal MHD, recasted in its vorticity formulation; finally, to take
advantage of the special structure of the non-linear terms.
  We also rigorously establish the equivalence between the original formulation
of the ideal MHD and its Els\""asser formulation for a large class of weak
solutions. The construction of explicit counterexamples shows the sharpness of
our assumptions. Related non-uniqueness issues are discussed as well.

nonlinear Parametric Reduced Order Models (PROMs) is proposed. This approach is
based upon the Riemannian geometry of the manifold formed by the quotient of
the set of full-rank N-by-q matrices by the orthogonal group of dimension q. By
using a set of untrained parametrized Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
subspaces of dimension q, the subspace for a new untrained parameter is
obtained as the generalized Karcher barycenter which solution is sought after
by solving a simple fixed point problem. Contrary to existing PROM approaches,
the proposed barycentric PROM is by construction easier to implement and more
flexible with respect to change in parameter values. To assess the potential of
the barycentric PROM, numerical experiments are conducted on the parametric
flow past a circular cylinder and the flow in a lid driven cavity when the
value of Reynolds number varies. It is demonstrated that the proposed
barycentric PROM approach achieves competitive results with considerably
reduced computational cost.

particular video clip corresponding to a query sentence in an untrimmed video.
Though progress has been made continuously in this field, some issues still
need to be resolved. First, most of the existing methods rely on the
combination of multiple complicated modules to solve the task. Second, due to
the semantic gaps between the two different modalities, aligning the
information at different granularities (local and global) between the video and
the language is significant, which is less addressed. Last, previous works do
not consider the inevitable annotation bias due to the ambiguities of action
boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose a simple two-branch
Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) module with intuitive structure design, which
alternatively modulates two modalities for better matching the information both
locally and globally. In addition, we introduce a new task-specific regression
loss function, which improves the temporal grounding accuracy by alleviating
the impact of annotation bias. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our
method, and the results show that just with this simple model, it can
outperform the state of the arts on both Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions

We formulate a restart criterion based on the mean dissipation of the kinetic

Using the Symplectic Euler discretization scheme, we obtain an iterative
optimization algorithm. We have considered a discrete mean dissipation restart
scheme, but we have also introduced a new restart procedure based on ensuring
at each iteration a decrease of the objective function greater than the one
achieved by a step of the classical gradient method. For the discrete
conservative algorithm, this last restart criterion is capable of guaranteeing
a convergence result. We apply the same restart scheme to the Nesterov
Accelerated Gradient (NAG-C), and we use this restarted NAG-C as benchmark in
the numerical experiments. In the smooth convex problems considered, our method
shows a faster convergence rate than the restarted NAG-C. We propose an
extension of our discrete conservative algorithm to composite optimization: in
the numerical tests involving non-strongly convex functions with
$\ell^1$-regularization, it has better performances than the well known
efficient Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm, accelerated with an
adaptive restart scheme.

seek new platforms with strong light-matter interactions to facilitate quantum
behaviors at moderate light intensities. One promising platform to reach such
strong light-matter interacting regimes is offered by polaritonic metasurfaces,
which represent ultrathin artificial media structured on nano-scale and
designed to support polaritons - half-light half-matter quasiparticles.
Topological polaritons, or 'topolaritons', offer an ideal platform in this
context, with unique properties stemming from topological phases of light
strongly coupled with matter. Here we explore polaritonic metasurfaces based on
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) supporting in-plane polarized
exciton resonances as a promising platform for topological polaritonics. We
enable a spin-Hall topolaritonic phase by strongly coupling valley polarized
in-plane excitons in a TMD monolayer with a suitably engineered all-dielectric
topological photonic metasurface. We first show that the strong coupling
between topological photonic bands supported by the metasurface and excitonic
bands in MoSe2 yields an effective phase winding and transition to a
topolaritonic spin-Hall state. We then experimentally realize this phenomenon
and confirm the presence of one-way spin-polarized edge topolaritons. Combined
with the valley polarization in a MoSe2 monolayer, the proposed system enables
a new approach to engage the photonic angular momentum and valley degree of
freedom in TMDs, offering a promising platform for photonic/solid-state
interfaces for valleytronics and spintronics.

It
routinely occurs in granular and porous media, can strongly alter such

in many processes employed by microelectronics, pharmaceutical, food and other
industries. The century-old Kelvin equation is commonly used to describe
condensation phenomena and shown to hold well for liquid menisci with diameters
as small as several nm. For even smaller capillaries that are involved in
condensation under ambient humidity and, hence, of particular practical
interest, the Kelvin equation is expected to break down, because the required
confinement becomes comparable to the size of water molecules. Here we take
advantage of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals to create
atomic-scale capillaries and study condensation inside. Our smallest
capillaries are less than 4 angstroms in height and can accommodate just a
monolayer of water. Surprisingly, even at this scale, the macroscopic Kelvin
equation using the characteristics of bulk water is found to describe
accurately the condensation transition in strongly hydrophilic (mica)
capillaries and remains qualitatively valid for weakly hydrophilic (graphene)
ones. We show that this agreement is somewhat fortuitous and can be attributed
to elastic deformation of capillary walls, which suppresses giant oscillatory
behavior expected due to commensurability between atomic-scale confinement and
water molecules. Our work provides a much-needed basis for understanding of
capillary effects at the smallest possible scale important in many realistic
situations.

data on clients' devices does not provide sufficient privacy, as the model
parameters shared by clients can leak information about their training data. A
'secure aggregation' protocol enables the server to aggregate clients' models
in a privacy-preserving manner. However, existing secure aggregation protocols
incur high computation/communication costs, especially when the number of model
parameters is larger than the number of clients participating in an iteration

dropouts. The main building block of FastSecAgg is a novel multi-secret sharing
scheme, FastShare, based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which may be of
independent interest. FastShare is information-theoretically secure, and
achieves a trade-off between the number of secrets, privacy threshold, and
dropout tolerance. Riding on the capabilities of FastShare, we prove that
FastSecAgg is (i) secure against the server colluding with 'any' subset of some
constant fraction (e.g. $\sim10\%$) of the clients in the honest-but-curious

depiction of the near-surface layers of stars with convective envelopes than
parameterizations, such as mixing length theory, do. In this paper, we explore
how this model improvement impacts on seismic and non-seismic properties of
stellar models across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We show that the
improved description of the outer boundary layers alters the predicted global
stellar properties at different evolutionary stages. In a hare and hound

for instance, often shifts the inferred stellar age estimates by more than 10
per cent. Improper boundary conditions may thus introduce systematic errors
that exceed the required accuracy of the PLATO space mission. Moreover, we
discuss different approximations for how to compute stellar oscillation
frequencies. We demonstrate that the so-called gas $\Gamma_1$ approximation
performs reasonably well for all main-sequence stars. Using a Monte Carlo
approach, we show that the model frequencies of our hybrid solar models are
consistent with observations within the uncertainties of the global solar

observations, confirming that FRBs originate from cosmological distances. The
high occurrence rate of FRBs and the development of new instruments to observe
them create opportunities for FRBs to be utilized for a host of astrophysical
and cosmological studies. We focus on the rare, and as yet undetected, subset
of FRBs that undergo repeated bursts and are strongly gravitationally lensed by
intervening structure. An extremely precise timing of burst arrival times is
possible for strongly lensed repeating FRBs, and we show how this timing
precision enables the search for long wavelength gravitational waves, including
those sourced by supermassive black hole binary systems. The timing of burst
arrival for strongly lensed repeating FRBs is sensitive to gravitational wave
sources near the FRB host galaxy, which may lie at cosmological distances and
would therefore be extremely challenging to detect by other means. Timing of
strongly lensed FRBs can also be combined with pulsar timing array data to
search for correlated time delays characteristic of gravitational waves passing

data but has struggled when data is limited. Few-shot learning algorithms,
which seek to address this limitation, are designed to generalize well to new
tasks with limited data. Typically, models are evaluated on unseen classes and
datasets that are defined by the same fundamental task as they are trained for
(e.g. category membership). One can also ask how well a model can generalize to
fundamentally different tasks within a fixed dataset (for example: moving from
category membership to tasks that involve detecting object orientation or
quantity). To formalize this kind of shift we define a notion of ""independence
of tasks"" and identify three new sets of labels for established computer vision
datasets that test a model's ability to generalize to tasks which draw on
orthogonal attributes in the data. We use these datasets to investigate the
failure modes of metric-based few-shot models. Based on our findings, we
introduce a new few-shot model called Fuzzy Simplicial Networks (FSN) which
leverages a construction from topology to more flexibly represent each class
from limited data. In particular, FSN models can not only form multiple
representations for a given class but can also begin to capture the
low-dimensional structure which characterizes class manifolds in the encoded
space of deep networks. We show that FSN outperforms state-of-the-art models on
the challenging tasks we introduce in this paper while remaining competitive on
standard few-shot benchmarks.

is considered as a viable alternative to manual inspections. An important
objective of automated UAV inspection is to minimize the flight time of the
UAVs to inspect all the turbines. A first contribution of this paper is thus
formulating an optimization problem to compute the optimal routes for turbine
inspection satisfying the above goal. On the other hand, the limited
computational capability on UAVs can be used to increase the power generation
of wind turbine. Power generation from the turbines can be optimized by
controlling the yaw angle of the turbines. Forecasting wind conditions such as
wind speed and wind direction is crucial for solving both optimization
problems. Therefore, UAVs can utilize their limited computational capability to
perform wind forecasting. In this way, UAVs form edge intelligence in offshore
wind farm. With the forecasted wind conditions, we design two algorithms to
solve the formulated problems, and then evaluate the proposed methods with
realworld data. The results reveal that the proposed methods offer an
improvement of 44% of the power generation from the turbine compared to
hour-ahead forecasting and 25% reduction of the flight time of the UAVs

main contributions: first, we modify the classical algorithm of
\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, Vempala and Vigoda (\emph{J.~ACM}, 56(3), 2009) to improve
its sample complexity; second, we quantize this new algorithm, improving upon
the previously fastest quantum algorithm for this problem, due to Harrow and
Wei (SODA 2020). The conventional approach to estimating partition functions
requires approximating the means of Gibbs distributions at a set of inverse
temperatures that form the so-called cooling schedule. The length of the
cooling schedule directly affects the complexity of the algorithm. Combining
our improved version of the algorithm of \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, Vempala and
Vigoda with the paired-product estimator of Huber (\emph{Ann.\ Appl.\ Probab.},
25(2),~2015), our new quantum algorithm uses a shorter cooling schedule than
previously known. This length matches the optimal length conjectured by
\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, Vempala and Vigoda. The quantum algorithm also achieves a
quadratic advantage in the number of required quantum samples compared to the
number of random samples drawn by the best classical algorithm, and its
computational complexity has quadratically better dependence on the spectral
gap of the Markov chains used to produce the quantum samples.

overcome the aforementioned difficulty by solving a sequence of better

one important example of a big economy where the electricity is already

this work we investigated the electricity load curves in the last 20 years in

the impact of increasing renewables in the national grid, at an hourly basis.
The analysis shows that growing electricity demand and the expected reduction
in the hydropower share will significantly increase the reliability of the
national grid, due to higher peak load and also due to the intermittency of
Solar and Wind. Without any gigawatt scale hydropower projected for the near
future, increasing the share of these renewables should push hydropower to
operate hundreds of hours every year above typical peak power levels
experienced in the past. In order to avoid or reduce the threat related to this
trend one of our scenarios suggests that solar water heaters could be massively
deployed in Brazil, what would positively impact the system reliability by
reducing the electricity demand mostly at peak loads during early evenings.

transition is expected, beyond which the line is tilted macroscopically. We
investigate this transition in the fixed tilt angle ensemble and within a
one-way model where backward jumps are neglected. From recent results about
directed polymers and their connections to random matrix theory, we find that
for a single line and a single strong defect this transition in presence of
point disorder coincides with the Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP) transition for the
appearance of outliers in the spectrum of a perturbed random matrix in the GUE.
This transition is conveniently described in the polymer picture by a
variational calculation. In the delocalized phase, the ground state energy
exhibits Tracy-Widom fluctuations. In the localized phase we show, using the
variational calculation, that the fluctuations of the occupation length along
the columnar defect are described by $f_{KPZ}$, a distribution which appears
ubiquitously in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. We then consider a
smooth density of columnar defect energies. Depending on how this density
vanishes at its lower edge we find either (i) a delocalized phase only (ii) a
localized phase with a delocalization transition. We analyze this transition
which is an infinite-rank extension of the BBP transition. The fluctuations of
the ground state energy of a single elastic line in the localized phase (for
fixed columnar defect energies) are described by a Fredholm determinant based

find by analytical solution of the master equation a strong disorder fixed
point, characterized by a fixed point distribution of the couplings with a
finite dynamical exponent, which describes the system consistently in the
regime $\alpha > 1/2$. A numerical implementation of the SDRG method yields a
power law spatial decay of the average concurrence, which is also confirmed by
exact numerical diagonalization. However, we find that the lowest-order SDRG
approach is not sufficient to obtain the typical value of the concurrence. We
therefore implement a correction scheme which allows us to obtain the leading
order corrections to the random singlet state. This approach yields a power-law
spatial decay of the typical value of the concurrence, which we derive both by
a numerical implementation of the corrections and by analytics. Next, using
numerical SDRG, the entanglement entropy (EE) is found to be logarithmically
enhanced for all $\alpha$, corresponding to a critical behavior with an
effective central charge $c = {\rm ln} 2$, independent of $\alpha$. This is
confirmed by an analytical derivation. Using numerical exact diagonalization
(ED), we confirm the logarithmic enhancement of the EE and a weak dependence on
$\alpha$. For a wide range of distances $l$, the EE fits a critical behavior
with a central charge close to $c=1$, which is the same as for the clean
Haldane-Shastry model with a power-la-decaying interaction with $\alpha =2$.
Consistent with this observation, we find using ED that the concurrence shows
power law decay, albeit with smaller power exponents than obtained by SDRG.

is centrally-concentrated for the secondary galaxy, and more radially extended
for the primary. This behaviour is weakly dependent on orbital geometry. We
also find that galaxies with elevated global star formation rate (SFR)
experience intense nuclear SFR enhancement, driven by high levels of either
star formation efficiency (SFE) or available cold-dense gas fuel. Galaxies with
suppressed global SFR also contain a nuclear cold-dense gas reservoir, but low
SFE levels diminish SFR in the central region. Concretely, in the majority of
cases, SFR-enhancement in the central kiloparsec is fuel-driven (55% for the
secondary, 71% for the primary) -- whilst central SFR-suppression is
efficiency-driven (91% for the secondary, 97% for the primary). Our numerical
predictions underscore the need of substantially larger, and/or

appearances of mini-Neptunes is important to understand various aspects of
their atmospheres, including radiative/convective energy transport, boundary
conditions for the interior, and their potential habitability. In the present
study, we explore these aspects of mini-Neptunes using self-consistent models
of their atmospheres. We begin by exploring the effects of irradiation,
internal flux, metallicity, clouds and hazes on the atmospheric temperature
profiles and thermal emission spectra of temperate mini-Neptunes. In
particular, we investigate the impact of these properties on the
radiative-convective boundary and the thermodynamic conditions in the lower
atmosphere, which serves as the interface with the interior and/or a potential
surface. Building on recent suggestions of habitability of the mini-Neptune
K2-18 b, we find a range of physically-motivated atmospheric conditions that
allow for liquid water under the H_2-rich atmospheres of such planets. We find
that observations of thermal emission with JWST/MIRI spectrophotometry can
place useful constraints on the habitability of temperate mini-Neptunes such as
K2-18 b, and provide more detailed constraints on the chemical and thermal
properties of warmer planets such as GJ 3470 b. Our results underpin the
potential of temperate mini-Neptunes such as K2-18 b as promising candidates in

self-regulated by external fields from surrounding structures. We constrain our

deceleration parameters derived jointly from supernovae at redshifts $0.023 -

expected from AGN-driven outflows. We estimate mass outflow rates up to a few
Mo/yr and kinetic efficiencies between 0.1-0.4 per cent, in line with those of
galaxies hosting AGNs of similar luminosity. The momentum rates of these
ionised outflows are comparable to those measured for the UFOs at sub-pc
scales, consistent with a momentum-driven wind propagation. Pure energy-driven
winds are excluded unless about 100x additional momentum is locked in massive
molecular winds. By comparing the outflow properties of our sources with those
of a small sample of well-studied QSOs hosting UFOs from the literature, we
find that winds seem to systematically lie either in a momentum-driven or in an
energy-driven regime, indicating that these two theoretical models bracket very

method of quantifying resources for continuous-variable quantum systems based
on the robustness measure, applicable to a plethora of physically relevant
resources such as optical nonclassicality, entanglement, genuine
non-Gaussianity, and coherence. We demonstrate in particular that the measure
has a direct operational interpretation as the advantage enabled by a given

constitutes a well-behaved, bona fide resource quantifier in any convex
resource theory, contrary to a related negativity-based measure known as the
standard robustness. Furthermore, we show the robustness to be directly

operator -- and establish general methods for evaluating the measure.
Explicitly applying our results to the relevant resources, we demonstrate the

thermal machines. Recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics have shown
that fluctuations in many far-from-equilibrium systems are constrained by the
rate of entropy production via so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations.
These relations imply that increasing the reliability or precision of an
engine's power output comes at a greater thermodynamic cost. Here we study the
thermodynamics of precision for small thermal machines in the quantum regime.
In particular, we derive exact relations between the power, power fluctuations,
and entropy production rate for several models of few-qubit engines (both
autonomous and cyclic) that perform work on a quantised load. Depending on the
context, we find that quantum coherence can either help or hinder where power
fluctuations are concerned. We discuss design principles for reducing such
fluctuations in quantum nano-machines, and propose an autonomous three-qubit

grains can induce the alignment of dust grains in respect to the alignment axis
(AA), which can be either the direction of the magnetic field, or the direction
of the radiation. We show that carbonaceous grains can be aligned with their
axes both parallel and perpendicular to the AA and we explore the conditions
where the particular mode of alignment takes place. We identify a new process
of alignment of charged carbonaceous grains in a turbulent magnetized
interstellar medium with respect to an electric field. This field acts on
grains accelerated in a turbulent medium and gyro-rotating about a magnetic
field. The electric field can also arise from the temporal variations of
magnetic field strength in turbulent compressible media. The direction of the
electric field is perpendicular to a magnetic field and the carbonaceous grains
precess in the electric field because of their electric moments. If this
precession is faster than Larmor precession in the magnetic field, the
alignment of such grains is with their long axes parallel to magnetic field. We
explore the parameter space for which the new mechanism aligns grains with long
axes parallel to the magnetic field. We compare this mechanism with another
process that provides the same type of alignment, namely, the RAT alignment of
grains with insufficiently fast internal relaxation. We describe the conditions
for which the particular mode of carbonaceous grain alignment is realized and
discuss what information can be obtained by measuring the resulting
polarization.

  In a generic perturbative class of states, we propose a unitary operation in
the causal wedge whose backreaction brings all of the previously causally
inaccessible `peninsula' into causal contact with the boundary. This class of
cases includes entanglement wedges associated to boundary sub-regions that are
unions of disjoint spherical caps, and the protocol works to first order in the
size of the peninsula. The unitary is closely related to the so-called Connes
Cocycle flow, which is a unitary that is both well-defined in QFT and localised
to a sub-region. Our construction requires a generalization of the work by
Ceyhan & Faulkner to regions which are unions of disconnected spherical caps.
We discuss this generalization in the Appendix. We argue that this cocycle

improved method for the modelling of H II regions, photoelectric heating from a

simulations of isolated $M_\mathrm{vir} = 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ galaxies

non-linear coupling of the different feedback channels. We find that
photoionization and supernova feedback are both independently capable of
regulating star formation to the same level, while photoelectric heating is
inefficient. Photoionization produces a considerably smoother star formation
history than supernovae. When all feedback channels are combined, the
additional suppression of star formation rates is minor. However, outflow rates
are substantially reduced relative to the supernova only simulations. We show
that this is directly caused by a suppression of supernova clustering by the
photoionization feedback, disrupting star forming clouds prior to the first
supernovae. We demonstrate that our results are robust to variations of our
star formation prescription, feedback models and the gas fraction of the disk.
Our results also imply that the burstiness of star formation and the mass

unitaries and measurements, in which any qubit can couple to any other, and
related settings where some of the complications of low-dimensional models are
reduced. We also propose field theory descriptions for spatially local systems
of any finite dimensionality. To build intuition, we first solve the simplest
""minimal cut"" toy model for entanglement dynamics in all-to-all circuits,
finding scaling forms and exponents within this approximation. We then show
that certain all-to-all measurement circuits allow exact results by exploiting
local tree-like structure in the circuit geometry. For this reason, we make a
detour to give general universal results for entanglement phase transitions
random tree tensor networks, making a connection with classical directed
polymers on a tree. We then compare these results with numerics in all-to-all
circuits, both for the MPT and for the simpler ""Forced Measurement Phase
Transition"" (FMPT). We characterize the two different phases in all-to-all
circuits using observables sensitive to the amount of information propagated

that can be understood from simple models. Finally we propose
Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson-like field theories for the MPT, the FMPT, and
entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. This analysis shows a

based on the robustness measure, and show it to admit a direct operational

enables in channel discrimination tasks over all resourceless states. We show
that the robustness acts as a faithful and strongly monotonic measure in any
resource theory described by a convex and closed set of free states, and can be
computed through a convex conic optimization problem.
  Specializing to continuous-variable quantum mechanics, we obtain additional
bounds and relations, allowing an efficient computation of the measure and
comparison with other monotones. We demonstrate applications of the robustness
to several resources of physical relevance: optical nonclassicality,
entanglement, genuine non-Gaussianity, and coherence. In particular, we
establish exact expressions for various classes of states, including Fock
states and squeezed states in the resource theory of nonclassicality and
general pure states in the resource theory of entanglement, as well as tight
bounds applicable in general cases.

properly derive the post-Newtonian coupling of quantum-mechanical systems to
gravity based on first principles. This sets it apart from more heuristic
approaches that are commonly employed, for example, in the description of
quantum-optical experiments under gravity.
  Regarding single particles, we compare simple canonical quantisation of a
free particle in curved spacetime to formal expansions of the minimally coupled
Klein-Gordon equation, which may be motivated from QFT in curved spacetimes.
Specifically, we develop a general WKB-like post-Newtonian expansion of the KG
equation to arbitrary order in $c^{-1}$. Furthermore, for stationary
spacetimes, we show that the Hamiltonians arising from expansions of the KG
equation and from canonical quantisation agree up to linear order in particle
momentum, independent of any expansion in $c^{-1}$.

derivation of the first order post-Newtonian quantum Hamiltonian describing the

external electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the latter being described

irrelevant responses for any given context. However, no such data is publicly

relevant response and multiple randomly selected responses from other contexts
(random negatives). To allow for better training and robust evaluation of
model-based metrics, we introduce the DailyDialog++ dataset, consisting of (i)
five relevant responses for each context and (ii) five adversarially crafted
irrelevant responses for each context. Using this dataset, we first show that

  systems against sequential attacks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network structures in a wide array of systems such as social networks,
transportation, power and water distribution infrastructures, and biological
and ecological systems can exhibit critical thresholds or tipping points beyond
which there are disproportionate losses in the system functionality. There is
growing concern over tipping points and failure tolerance of such systems as
tipping points can lead to an abrupt loss of intended functionality and
possibly non-recoverable states. While attack tolerance of networked systems
has been intensively studied for the disruptions originating from a single
point of failure, there have been instances where real-world systems are
subject to simultaneous or sudden onset of concurrent disruption at multiple
locations. Using open-source data from the United States Airspace Airport
network and Indian Railways Network, and random networks as prototype class of
systems, we study their responses to synthetic attack strategies of varying
sizes. For both types of networks, we observe the presence of warning regions,
which serve as a precursor to the tipping point. Further, we observe the
statistically significant relationships between network robustness and size of
simultaneous distribution, which generalizes to the networks with different
topological attributes for random failures and targeted attacks. We show that
our approach can determine the entire robustness characteristics of networks of
disparate architecture subject to disruptions of varying sizes. Our approach
can serve as a paradigm to understand the tipping point in real-world systems,
and the principle can be extended to other disciplines to address critical
issues of risk management and resilience.

structure of the outer solar system. When modeling this instability, a key
constraint comes from Jupiter's fifth eccentric mode (quantified by its
amplitude M55), which is an important driver of the solar system's secular
evolution. Starting from commonly-assumed near-circular orbits, the present-day
giant planets' architecture lies at the limit of numerically generated systems,
and M55 is rarely excited to its true value. Here we perform a dynamical
analysis of a large batch of artificially triggered instabilities, and test a
variety of configurations for the giant planets' primordial orbits. In addition
to more standard setups, and motivated by the results of modern hydrodynamical
simulations of the giant planets' evolution within the primordial gaseous disk,
we consider the possibility that Jupiter and Saturn emerged from the nebular
gas locked in 2:1 resonance with non-zero eccentricities. We show that, in such
a scenario, the modern Jupiter-Saturn system represents a typical simulation
outcome, and M55 is commonly matched. Furthermore, we show that Uranus and
Neptune's final orbits are determined by a combination of the mass in the
primordial Kuiper belt and that of an ejected ice giant.

thermodynamic systems. Most practical devices are made up of interacting
sub-system, and are often modelled using either local master equations (LMEs)
or global master equations (GMEs). While the limiting cases in which either the
LME or the GME breaks down are well understood, there exists a 'grey area' in
which both equations capture steady-state heat currents reliably, but predict
very different transient heat flows. In such cases, which one should we trust?
Here, we show that, when it comes to dynamics, the local approach can be more
reliable than the global one for weakly interacting open quantum systems. This
is due to the fact that the secular approximation, which underpins the GME, can
destroy key dynamical features. To illustrate this, we consider a minimal
transport setup and show that its LME displays exceptional points (EPs). These
singularities have been observed in a superconducting-circuit realisation of
the model [1]. However, in stark contrast to experimental evidence, no EPs
appear within the global approach. We then show that the EPs are a feature
built into the Redfield equation, which is more accurate than the LME and the
GME. Finally, we show that the local approach emerges as the weak-interaction
limit of the Redfield equation, and that it entirely avoids the secular
approximation.

procedures to obtain physical scans of real bone with a specific pathology

adversarial networks (GANs) to develop such a method. We adapted style-transfer
techniques, which have been largely used in other contexts, in order to
transfer style between image pairs while preserving its informational content.
In a first step, we trained a volumetric generative model in a progressive
manner using a Wasserstein objective and gradient penalty (PWGAN-GP) to create
patches of realistic bone structure in-silico. The training set contained 7660
purely spongeous bone samples from twelve human vertebrae (T12 or L1) with
isotropic resolution of 164um and scanned with a high resolution peripheral
quantitative CT (Scanco XCT). After training, we generated new samples with
tailored micro-structure properties by optimizing a vector z in the learned
latent space. To solve this optimization problem, we formulated a
differentiable goal function that leads to valid samples while compromising the
appearance (content) with target 3D properties (style). Properties of the
learned latent space effectively matched the data distribution. Furthermore, we
were able to simulate the resulting bone structure after deterioration or
treatment effects of osteoporosis therapies based only on expected changes of
micro-structural parameters. Our method allows to generate a virtually infinite
number of patches of realistic bone micro-structure, and thereby likely serves
for the development of bone-biomarkers and to simulate bone therapies in
advance.

of the well-known multi-armed bandit (MAB), thus providing a solution for
improving existing state-of-the-art cache management methods. Each arm (or
expert) represents a distinct cache replacement policy, which advises on the
page to evict from the cache when needed. Feedback on the eviction comes in the
form of a ""miss"", but at an indeterminate time after the action is taken, and
the cost of the eviction is set to be inversely proportional to the response
time. The feedback is ignored if it comes after a threshold value for the
delay, which we set to be equal to the size of the page eviction history. Thus,
for delays beyond the threshold, its cost is assumed to be zero. Consequently,
we call this problem with delayed feedback and decaying costs. We introduce an
adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm EXP4-DFDC that provides a solution to
the problem. We derive an optimal learning rate for EXP4-DFDC that defines the
balance between exploration and exploitation and proves theoretically that the
expected regret of our algorithm is a vanishing quantity as a function of time.
As an application, we show that LeCaR, a recent top-performing machine learning
algorithm for cache replacement, can be enhanced with adaptive learning using
our formulations. We present an improved adaptive version of LeCaR, called
OLeCaR, with the learning rate set as determined by the theoretical derivation
presented here to minimize regret for EXP4-DFDC. It then follows that LeCaR and
OLeCaR are theoretically guaranteed to have vanishing regret over time.

adding different information into the systems. These methods include

Recently, several promising approaches have emerged in this area. We claim that

while in reality performing worse. We reveal a tradeoff between accuracy and
the 3D volume of the regressed subspace. We believe that unlike other
relocalization approaches, in the case of relative pose regression, the
regressed subspace 3D volume is less dependent on the scene and more affect by
the method used to score the overlap, which determined how closely sampled
viewpoints are. We propose three new metrics to remedy the issue mentioned
above. The proposed metrics incorporate statistics about the regression
subspace volume. We also propose a new pose regression network that serves as a
new baseline for this task. We compare the performance of our trained model on
Microsoft 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets both with the standard
metrics and the newly proposed metrics and adjust the overlap score to reveal
the tradeoff between the subspace and performance. The results show that the
proposed metrics are more robust to different overlap threshold than the
conventional approaches. Finally, we show that our network generalizes well,
specifically, training on a single scene leads to little loss of performance on
the other scenes.

directly, leading to an issue of ""missing baryons"" at low redshift.
Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have indicated that a significant
portion of them will be converted into the so-called Warm-Hot Intergalactic
Medium (WHIM), with gas temperature ranging between 10$^5$-10$^7$K. While the
cooler phase of this gas has been observed using O VI and Ne VIII absorbers at
UV wavelengths, the hotter fraction detection relies mostly on observations of
O VII and O VIII at X-ray wavelengths. Here, we target the forbidden line of
[Fe XXI] $\lambda$ 1354$\unicode{x212B}$ which traces 10$^7$K gas at UV
wavelengths, using more than one hundred high-spectral resolution
(R$\sim$49,000) and high signal to noise VLT/UVES quasar spectra, corresponding
to over 600 hrs of VLT time observations. A stack of these at the position of
known DLAs lead to a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $\mathrm{log[N([Fe\,XXI])]<}$17.4
(${EW_{rest}<22}$m$\unicode{x212B}$), three orders of magnitude higher than the
expected column density of the WHIM $\mathrm{log[N([Fe\,XXI])]<}$14.5. This
work proposes an alternative to X-ray detected 10$^7$K WHIM tracers, by
targeting faint lines at UV wavelengths from the ground benefiting from higher
instrumental throughput, enhanced spectral resolution, longer exposure times
and increased number of targets. The number of quasar spectra required to reach
this theoretical column density with future facilities including 4MOST,
ELT/HIRES, MSE and the Spectroscopic Telescope appears challenging at present.
Probing the missing baryons is essential to constrain the accretion and
feedback processes which are fundamental to galaxy formation.

from correctly classified data points. Most if not all the previously suggested
defense mechanisms attend to just one of those two goals, and as such, could be

simultaneously addresses both defense goals: We flatten the gradients of the
loss surface, making adversarial examples harder to find, using a novel
stochastic regularization term that explicitly decreases the sensitivity of
individual neurons to small input perturbations. In addition, we push the
decision boundary away from correctly classified inputs by leveraging Jacobian
regularization. We present a solid theoretical basis and an empirical testing

training by clinicians and extending this training on a large scale
internationally is untenable; this compounds the health disparities that
already exist among children with cleft. In this work, we present the objective
hypernasality measure (OHM), a speech analytics algorithm that automatically
measures hypernasality in speech, and validate it relative to a group of
trained clinicians. Methods: We trained a deep neural network (DNN) on
approximately 100 hours of a publicly-available healthy speech corpus to detect
the presence of nasal acoustic cues generated through the production of nasal
consonants and nasalized phonemes in speech. Importantly, this model does not
require any clinical data for training. The posterior probabilities of the deep
learning model were aggregated at the sentence and speaker-levels to compute
the OHM.
  Results: The results showed that the OHM was significantly correlated with
the perceptual hypernasality ratings in the Americleft database ( r=0.797,
~p$<$0.001), and with the New Mexico Cleft Palate Center (NMCPC) database
(r=0.713,p<$0.001). In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the OHM
and articulation errors; the sensitivity of the OHM in detecting the presence
of very mild hypernasality; and establishing the internal reliability of the
metric. Further, the performance of OHM was compared with a DNN regression
algorithm directly trained on the hypernasal speech samples. Significance: The
results indicate that the OHM is able to rate the severity of hypernasality on
par with Americleft-trained clinicians on this dataset.

explicitly incorporate known graph structure resulting in suboptimal negatives.

demonstrate that SANS finds semantically meaningful negatives and is

spread of populations undergoing a spatial range expansion. Such waves are
generally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics are driven by the very
tip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where
cooperation in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which
fluctuations are suppressed. These concepts have been well studied
experimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a
density-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about
experimental populations that exhibit density-dependent dispersal.
  Using bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present novel experimental
measurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host
E. coli, is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The
coupling between host density, phage dispersal and cell lysis caused by viral
infection results in an effective density-dependent diffusion coefficient akin
to cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations, we
show that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed
expansion. Moreover, we find that a second, independent density-dependent
effect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges as a result of the viral
incubation period, during which phage is trapped inside the host unable to
disperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time
dramatically affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken
together, our results indicate both that bacteriophage can be used as a
controllable laboratory population to investigate the impact of
density-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and
adaptability of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is
currently assumed.

This is slightly smaller than, but consistent with, previous determinations.

optimal step size achieves the fastest provable worst-case convergence rate
with quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, we further extend our analysis to
stochastic games and study the impact of multiplicative noise on different
algorithms. We show that it is impossible for an algorithm with one step of
memory to achieve acceleration if it only queries the gradient once per batch
(in contrast with the stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting, where
such acceleration has been demonstrated). However, we exhibit an algorithm
which achieves acceleration with two gradient queries per batch.

  Data","version 1",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of monotone missing data has been broadly studied during the last
two decades and has many applications in different fields such as
bioinformatics or statistics. Commonly used imputation techniques require
multiple iterations through the data before yielding convergence. Moreover,
those approaches may introduce extra noises and biases to the subsequent
modeling. In this work, we derive exact formulas and propose a novel algorithm
to compute the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of a multiple class,
monotone missing dataset when all the covariance matrices of all categories are
assumed to be equal, namely EPEM. We then illustrate an application of our
proposed methods in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). As the computation is
exact, our EPEM algorithm does not require multiple iterations through the data
as other imputation approaches, thus promising to handle much less
time-consuming than other methods. This effectiveness was validated by
empirical results when EPEM reduced the error rates significantly and required
a short computation time compared to several imputation-based approaches. We
also release all codes and data of our experiments in one GitHub repository to
contribute to the research community related to this problem.

methods for SI cancellation have mostly considered the polynomial
representation of the SI signal at the receiver. These methods are shown to
operate well in practice while requiring high computational complexity.
Alternatively, neural networks (NNs) are envisioned as promising candidates for
modeling the SI signal with reduced computational complexity. Consequently, in
this paper, two novel low complexity NN structures, referred to as the
ladder-wise grid structure (LWGS) and moving-window grid structure (MWGS), are
proposed. The core idea of these two structures is to mimic the non-linearity
and memory effect introduced to the SI signal in order to achieve proper SI
cancellation while exhibiting low computational complexity. The simulation
results reveal that the LWGS and MWGS NN-based cancelers attain the same
cancellation performance of the polynomial-based canceler while providing
49.87% and 34.19% complexity reduction, respectively.

direction is changed relative to the symmetry directions of the array. At lower
disk densities there is no clogging for any driving direction, but as the disk
density increases, the average disk velocity decreases and develops a drive
angle dependence. For certain driving angles, the flow is reduced or drops to
zero when the system forms a heterogeneous clogged state consisting of high
density clogged regions coexisting with empty regions. The clogged states are
fragile and can be unclogged by changing the driving angle. For large obstacle
sizes, we find a uniform clogged state that is distinct from the collective
clogging regime. Within the clogged phases, depinning transitions can occur as
a function of increasing driving force, with strongly intermittent motion
appearing just above the depinning threshold. The clogging is robust against
the random removal or dilution of the obstacle sites, and the disks are able to
form system-spanning clogged clusters even under increasing dilution. If the
dilution becomes too large, however, the clogging behavior is lost.

structure, the encoder stack of a transformer is repeated along a new
multi-pass dimension, keeping the parameters tied, and information is allowed
to proceed unidirectionally both towards deeper layers within an encoder stack

continuous) and hard (i.e., discrete) connections between parallel encoder
stacks, relying on a neural architecture search to find the best connection
pattern in the hard case. We perform an extensive ablation study of the
proposed MPT architecture and compare it with other state-of-the-art
transformer architectures. Surprisingly, Base Transformer equipped with MPT can
surpass the performance of Large Transformer on the challenging machine

characterize quantum entanglement in extended many-body systems. Given a pure

obtained in terms of the $Schmidt~ values$, or eigenvalues $\lambda_{\alpha}$
of the reduced density matrix $\rho_A$ for region $A$. In this paper we draw
attention instead to the $Schmidt~ vectors$, or eigenvectors
$|v_{\alpha}\rangle$ of $\rho_A$. We consider the ground state of critical
quantum spin chains whose low energy/long distance physics is described by an
emergent conformal field theory (CFT). We show that the Schmidt vectors
$|v_{\alpha}\rangle$ display an emergent universal structure, corresponding to
a realization of the Virasoro algebra of a boundary CFT (a chiral version of
the original CFT). Indeed, we build weighted sums $H_n$ of the lattice
Hamiltonian density $h_{j,j+1}$ over region $A$ and show that the matrix
elements $\langle v_{\alpha}H_n |v_{\alpha'}\rangle$ are universal, up to
finite-size corrections. More concretely, these matrix elements are given by an
analogous expression for $H_n^{\tiny \text{CFT}} = \frac 1 2 (L_n + L_{-n})$ in
the boundary CFT, where $L_n$'s are (one copy of) the Virasoro generators. We
numerically confirm our results using the critical Ising quantum spin chain and
other (free-fermion equivalent) models.

Moreover, proceeding from GTMDs to generalised parton distributions (GPDs), it
is found that the pion's mass distribution form factor is harder than its
electromagnetic form factor, which is harder than the gravitational pressure
distribution form factor; the pressure in the neighbourhood of the pion's core
is commensurate with that at the centre of a neutron star; the shear pressure
is maximal when confinement forces become dominant within the pion; and the
spatial distribution of transversely polarised quarks within the pion is
asymmetric. Regarding transverse momentum dependent distribution functions

The simplest Wigner distribution associated with the pion's twist-two

for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerators in many application
domains in recent years, thanks to its competitive quality of results (QoR) and
short development cycles compared with the traditional register-transfer level
design approach. Yet, limited by the sequential C semantics, it remains
challenging to adopt the same highly productive high-level programming approach
in many other application domains, where coarse-grained tasks run in parallel
and communicate with each other at a fine-grained level. While current HLS
tools do support task-parallel programs, the productivity is greatly limited
(1) in the code development cycle due to the poor programmability, (2) in the
correctness verification cycle due to restricted software simulation, and (3)
in the QoR tuning cycle due to slow code generation. Such limited productivity
often defeats the purpose of HLS and hinder programmers from adopting HLS for
task-parallel FPGA accelerators.
  In this paper, we extend the HLS C++ language and present a fully automated
framework with programmer-friendly interfaces, unconstrained software
simulation, and fast hierarchical code generation to overcome these limitations
and demonstrate how task-parallel programs can be productively supported in
HLS. Experimental results based on a wide range of real-world task-parallel
programs show that, on average, the lines of kernel and host code are reduced
by 22% and 51%, respectively, which considerably improves the programmability.
The correctness verification and the iterative QoR tuning cycles are both
greatly shortened by 3.2x and 6.8x, respectively. Our work is open-source at

'Which parameters provides an upmost optimal convergence solution of an

experimental concept in which five different algorithms were tested with
different objective functions to discover which parameter would result well for
the best convergence. To find the correct parameter a method called
'on-the-fly' was applied. I run the experiments with five different
optimization algorithms. One of the test runs showed that each parameter has an
increasing or decreasing convergence accuracy towards the subjective function
depending on which specific optimization algorithm you choose. Each parameter
has an increasing or decreasing convergence accuracy toward the subjective
function. One of the results in which evolutionary algorithm was applied with
only the recombination technique did well at finding the best optimization. As
well that some results have an increasing accuracy visualization by combing
mutation or several parameters in one test performance. In conclusion, each
algorithm has its own set of the parameter that converge differently. Also
depending on the target formula that is used. This confirms that the fly method
a suitable approach at finding the best parameter. This means manipulations and
observe the effects in process to find the right parameter works as long as the

their brain network data, along with identifying influential regions of
interest (ROIs) (referred to as nodes). Existing approaches either treat all
edge weights as a long vector or summarize the network information with a few
summary measures. Both these approaches ignore the full network structure, may
lead to less desirable inference in small samples and are not designed to
identify significant network nodes. We propose a novel binary logistic
regression framework with the network as the predictor and a binary response,
the network predictor coefficient being modeled using a novel class
global-local shrinkage priors. The framework is able to accurately detect nodes
and edges in the network influencing the classification. Our framework is
implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
Theoretically, we show asymptotically optimal classification for the proposed
framework when the number of network edges grows faster than the sample size.
The framework is empirically validated by extensive simulation studies and
analysis of a brain connectome data.

showing a global cause-effect visualization for all variables; (2) lacking
generalization of both accuracy and fairness to unseen tasks. In this work, we
first discover discrimination from data using a causal Bayesian knowledge graph
which not only demonstrates the dependency of the protected variable on target

novel algorithm based on risk difference in order to quantify the
discriminatory influence for each protected variable in the graph. Furthermore,
to protect prediction from unfairness, a fast-adapted bias-control approach in
meta-learning is proposed, which efficiently mitigates statistical disparity

leveraging the mean difference between (un)protected groups for regression

influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as
symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns

difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer

enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize
learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the

that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to

processing of organic solar cells and that increases in power conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) of the P3HT/PC60BM active layer are possible under certain
shearing and thermal histories of the P3HT/PC60BM gels. Here oscillatory and
steady torsional flows were used to investigate the gel formation dynamics of
P3HT with a recently proposed non-fullerene o-IDTBR under sub-ambient
conditions. The gel strengths defined on the basis of linear viscoelastic
material functions as determined via small-amplitude oscillatory shear were
observed to be functions of the P3HT and o-IDTBR concentrations, the solvent
used and the shearing conditions. Overall, the gels which formed upon quenching
to sub-zero temperatures were found to be stable during small-amplitude
oscillatory shear (linear viscoelastic range) but broke down even at the
relatively low shear rates associated with steady torsional flows, suggesting
that the shearing conditions used during the processing of gels of P3HT with
small molecule acceptor blends can alter the gel structure and possibly affect
the resulting active layer performance.

annotated data sets, the acquisition of which can be costly, requiring expert
domain knowledge. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this challenge by
exploiting the behavior of the neural function on large unlabeled data. The
smoothness of the neural function is a commonly used assumption exploited in
SSL. A successful example is the adoption of mixup strategy in SSL that
enforces the global smoothness of the neural function by encouraging it to
behave linearly when interpolating between training examples. Despite its
empirical success, however, the theoretical underpinning of how mixup
regularizes the neural function has not been fully understood. In this paper,
we offer a theoretically substantiated proposition that mixup improves the
smoothness of the neural function by bounding the Lipschitz constant of the
gradient function of the neural networks. We then propose that this can be
strengthened by simultaneously constraining the Lipschitz constant of the
neural function itself through adversarial Lipschitz regularization,
encouraging the neural function to behave linearly while also constraining the
slope of this linear function. On three benchmark data sets and one real-world
biomedical data set, we demonstrate that this combined regularization results
in improved generalization performance of SSL when learning from a small amount
of labeled data. We further demonstrate the robustness of the presented method
against single-step adversarial attacks. Our code is available at

complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum
resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the
Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically
motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these
complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e.
a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary
importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so
that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is
key to finding useful applications of these promising devices within the field

a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically
simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule

in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We
show that merging both algorithms fulfil the necessary condition to describe

quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing.

ionization bounded at the outer radius, coincident with the dust reverberation
radius, and transforms into an X-ray emitting plasma inside the Balmer

a distinct possibility if the BLR is indeed Compton thick.

decomposition of the sodium borohydride (SBH) hydrolysis reaction in the

the Castep package program bottomed on DFT. The aim of the research is to
distinguish the catalytic effects of fcc cobalt surfaces on the decomposition
of hydrogen from SBH and to identify the effects of the environments made by
the hydrolysis of H2O at the most efficient the surface on H decomposition.
Therefore, the common surface types of the face-centered cobalt crystal were
used to determine the effect of fcc surface structure on H extrication from SBH
and H2O extrication. The activation energies required for H extrication from
SBH on the catalyst surface with the lowest activation barrier were determined
for each possible reaction medium containing different density of chemical
species. According to our results, the value of activation energy increases as
the ratio of OH radicals increases.

  dimension in bilayer systems","10 pages",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrete dimension is introduced via an extended Dirac operator to include
the interlayer interactions in a geometric framework of generic
$d+1$-dimensional bilayer systems. The photon and its Kaluza-Klein partners in
this extended space-time will involve a pair of vector fields together with a
scalar field, which describes a pair of local jumping between the layers. The
quartic potential of the scalar field triggers an abelian Higgs mechanism,
which gives a mass to one vector field, which describes a short-range
interaction. The discrete derivative along the extra dimension generates a
non-diagonal mass matrix, whose eigenstates mix the fermions on two layers with
a mixing angle. The couplings of the Kaluza-Klein siblings of photon including
massless, massive, and scalar ones with the mass eigenstates of fermions will
also depend on the mixing angle. Thus interlayer interactions in bilayer
systems are manifested elegantly by these new features via the extra discrete
dimension. In specific cases, the short-range force, weak and strong coupling
regimes of the fermions with different masses can lead to new physical
consequences to be discovered in different realistic $2+1$ and
$3+1$-dimensional bilayer systems.

the so-called streaming networks, in which edges are continuously arriving

namely node, edge, and time, can be manipulated to reduce such clutter and
improve readability. This paper presents an online and nonuniform timeslicing
method, thus considering the underlying network structure and addressing
streaming network analyses. We conducted experiments using two real-world
networks to compare our method against uniform and nonuniform timeslicing
strategies. The results show that our method automatically selects timeslices
that effectively reduce visual clutter in periods with bursts of events. As a

bent. While numerous studies have characterized this flexoelectric coupling,
its impact on the mechanical response, due to the energy cost of polarization
upon bending, is largely unexplored. This intriguing contribution of strain
gradient elasticity is expected to become visible at small length scales where
strain gradients are geometrically enhanced, especially in high permittivity
insulators. Here we present nano-mechanical measurements of freely suspended

dependence of Young's modulus upon small deflections. Furthermore, the modulus
inferred from a predominantly bending deformation is three times larger than
that of a predominantly stretching deformation for membranes thinner than 20

~2.2e-6 N, which could be used in new operational regimes of

microstructural diversity of skeletal fragments requires extensive prior
knowledge of fossil morphotypes in microfacies and long training sessions under

sedimentologists and paleontologists, especially novices. However, a machine
classifier can help address this challenge. In this study, we collected a
microfacies image dataset comprising both public data from 1,149 references and
our own materials (including 30,815 images of 22 fossil and abiotic grain
groups). We employed a high-performance workstation to implement four classic
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which have proven to be highly
efficient in computer vision over the last several years. Our framework uses a
transfer learning technique, which reuses the pre-trained parameters that are
trained on a larger ImageNet dataset as initialization for the network to
achieve high accuracy with low computing costs. We obtained up to 95% of the
top one and 99% of the top three test accuracies in the Inception ResNet v2

as dolomite and pyrite. Although it had some difficulty on samples having
similar morphologies, such as the bivalve, brachiopod, and ostracod, it
nevertheless obtained 0.88 precision. Our machine learning framework
demonstrated high accuracy with reproducibility and bias avoidance that was
comparable to those of human classifiers. Its application can thus eliminate
much of the tedious, manually intensive efforts by human experts conducting
routine identification.

behaves as a thermodynamic-like response function for suspensions of active
Brownian particles. The compressibility computed from the active pressure - a
combination of the collision and unique swim pressures - is capable of
predicting the critical point for motility induced phase separation, as
expected from the mechanical stability criterion. We relate this mechanical
definition to the static structure factor via an active form of the
thermodynamic compressibility equation and find the two to be equivalent, as
would be the case for equilibrium systems. This equivalence indicates that
compressibility behaves like a thermodynamic response function, even when
activity is large. Finally, we discuss the importance of the phase interface
when defining an active chemical potential. Previous definitions of the active
chemical potential are shown to be accurate above the critical point but
breakdown in the coexistence region. Inclusion of the swim pressure in the
mechanical compressibility definition suggests that the interface is essential
for determining phase behavior.

Prior studies have shown that relaxing and adapting the STTRAM retention time
to runtime application needs can substantially reduce overall cache energy
without significant latency overheads, due to the lower STTRAM write energy and
latency in shorter retention times. In this paper, as a first step towards
efficient prefetching across the STTRAM cache hierarchy, we study prefetching
in reduced retention STTRAM L1 caches. Using SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks, we
analyze the energy and latency impact of different prefetch distances in
different STTRAM cache retention times for different applications. We show that
expired_unused_prefetches---the number of unused prefetches expired by the
reduced retention time STTRAM cache---can accurately determine the best
retention time for energy consumption and access latency. This new metric can
also provide insights into the best prefetch distance for memory bandwidth
consumption and prefetch accuracy. Based on our analysis and insights, we
propose Prefetch-Aware Retention time Tuning (PART) and Retention time-based
Prefetch Control (RPC). Compared to a base STTRAM cache, PART and RPC
collectively reduced the average cache energy and latency by 22.24% and 24.59%,

""codes"" itself in a data-responsive way by composing relevant programs from a
set of shareable, modular programs. This can be considered analogous to
building Lego structures from simple Lego bricks. Notably, our bricks change
their shape through learning. External memory is used to create, store and
retrieve modular programs. Like today's stored-program computers, Neurocoder
can now access diverse programs to process different data. Unlike manually
crafted computer programs, Neurocoder creates programs through training.
Integrating Neurocoder into current neural architectures, we demonstrate new
capacity to learn modular programs, handle severe pattern shifts and remember
old programs as new ones are learnt, and show substantial performance
improvement in solving object recognition, playing video games and continual

frictionless spherical particles undergoing isotropic compression. Prior
simulations of the soft-particle model, where the repulsive interactions scale
as a power-law in the interparticle overlap with exponent $\alpha$, have found
that the ensemble-averaged shear modulus $\langle G \rangle$ increases with
pressure $P$ as $\sim P^{(\alpha-3/2)/(\alpha-1)}$ at large pressures. However,
a deep theoretical understanding of this scaling behavior is lacking. We show
that the shear modulus of jammed packings of frictionless, spherical particles
has two key contributions: 1) continuous variations as a function of pressure
along geometrical families, for which the interparticle contact network does
not change, and 2) discontinuous jumps during compression that arise from
changes in the contact network. We show that the shear modulus of the first
geometrical family for jammed packings can be collapsed onto a master curve:
$G^{(1)}/G_0 = (P/P_0)^{(\alpha-2)/(\alpha-1)} - P/P_0$, where $P_0 \sim
N^{-2(\alpha-1)}$ is a characteristic pressure that separates the two power-law
scaling regions and $G_0 \sim N^{-2(\alpha-3/2)}$. Deviations from this form
can occur when there is significant non-affine particle motion near changes in
the contact network. We further show that $\langle G (P)\rangle$ is not simply
a sum of two power-laws, but $\langle G \rangle \sim (P/P_c)^a$, where $a
\approx (\alpha -2)/(\alpha-1)$ in the $P \rightarrow 0$ limit and $\langle G
\rangle \sim (P/P_c)^b$, where $b \gtrsim (\alpha -3/2)/(\alpha-1)$ above a
characteristic pressure $P_c$. In addition, the magnitudes of both
contributions to $\langle G\rangle$ from geometrical families and changes in
the contact network remain comparable in the large-system limit for $P >P_c$.

often an important task in functional data analysis. In the literature, a

misspecification, while a model-free method only provides a correlation measure
which is inadequate to test independence. In this paper, we adopt the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the dependency between
two random functions. We develop a two-step procedure by first pre-smoothing
each function based on its discrete and noisy measurements and then applying
the HSIC to recovered functions. To ensure the compatibility between the two
steps such that the effect of the pre-smoothing error on the subsequent HSIC is
asymptotically negligible, we propose to use wavelet soft-thresholding for
pre-smoothing and Besov-norm-induced kernels for HSIC. We also provide the
corresponding asymptotic analysis. The superior numerical performance of the
proposed method over existing ones is demonstrated in a simulation study.
Moreover, in an magnetoencephalography (MEG) data application, the functional
connectivity patterns identified by the proposed method are more anatomically

deteriorate after a disruption, if they are not being repaired by an entity.
There exist a set of dependencies in the form of precedence constraints between
the components, captured by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The objective of
the entity is to maximize the number of components whose states are brought
back to the fully repaired state within a given time. We prove that the general
problem is NP-hard, and therefore we characterize near-optimal control policies
for special instances of the problem. We show that when the deterioration rates
are larger than or equal to the repair rates and the precedence constraints are
given by a DAG, it is optimal to continue repairing a component until its state
reaches the fully recovered state before switching to repair any other
component. Under the aforementioned assumptions and when the deterioration and
the repair rates are homogeneous across all the components, we prove that the
control policy that targets the healthiest component at each time-step while
respecting the precedence and time constraints fully repairs at least half the
number of components that would be fully repaired by an optimal policy.
Finally, we prove that when the repair rates are sufficiently larger than the
deterioration rates, the precedence constraints are given by a set of disjoint
trees that each contain at most k nodes, and there is no time constraint, the
policy that targets the component with the least value of health minus the

photonic spiking neurons implemented with paired nonlinear optical oscillators

recognition technology has become pervasive in policing, intelligence
gathering, and consumer applications. Recently, face recognition technology has
been deployed on bodyworn cameras to keep officers safe, enabling situational
awareness and providing evidence for trial. However, limited academic research
has been conducted on this topic using traditional techniques on datasets with
small sample size. This paper aims to bridge the gap in the state-of-the-art
face recognition using bodyworn cameras (BWC). To this aim, the contribution of
this work is two-fold: (1) collection of a dataset called BWCFace consisting of
a total of 178K facial images of 132 subjects captured using the body-worn
camera in in-door and daylight conditions, and (2) open-set evaluation of the
latest deep-learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures
combined with five different loss functions for face identification, on the
collected dataset. Experimental results on our BWCFace dataset suggest a
maximum of 33.89% Rank-1 accuracy obtained when facial features are extracted
using SENet-50 trained on a large scale VGGFace2 facial image dataset. However,
performance improved up to a maximum of 99.00% Rank-1 accuracy when pretrained
CNN models are fine-tuned on a subset of identities in our BWCFace dataset.
Equivalent performances were obtained across body-worn camera sensor models
used in existing face datasets. The collected BWCFace dataset and the
pretrained/ fine-tuned algorithms are publicly available to promote further
research and development in this area. A downloadable link of this dataset and
the algorithms is available by contacting the authors.

probabilistic transition and observation functions of standard POMDPs to belong
to a so-called uncertainty set. Such uncertainty, referred to as epistemic
uncertainty, captures uncountable sets of probability distributions caused by,
for instance, a lack of data available. We develop an algorithm to compute
finite-memory policies for uPOMDPs that robustly satisfy specifications against
any admissible distribution. In general, computing such policies is
theoretically and practically intractable. We provide an efficient solution to
this problem in four steps. (1) We state the underlying problem as a nonconvex
optimization problem with infinitely many constraints. (2) A dedicated
dualization scheme yields a dual problem that is still nonconvex but has
finitely many constraints. (3) We linearize this dual problem and (4) solve the
resulting finite linear program to obtain locally optimal solutions to the
original problem. The resulting problem formulation is exponentially smaller
than those resulting from existing methods. We demonstrate the applicability of
our algorithm using large instances of an aircraft collision-avoidance scenario
and a novel spacecraft motion planning case study.

earthquakes. The availability of data on the condition of civil infrastructure
immediately after an earthquake is of great importance for emergency
management. Stakeholders require this information to take effective actions and
to better recover from the disaster. The data-driven SHM has shown great
promises to achieve this goal in near real-time. There have been several
proposals to automate the inspection process from different sources of input
using deep learning. The existing models in the literature only provide a final
prediction output, while the risks of utilizing such models for safety-critical
assessments should not be ignored. This paper is dedicated to developing deep
Bayesian U-Nets where the uncertainty of predictions is a second output of the
model, which is made possible through Monte Carlo dropout sampling in test
time. Based on a grid-like data structure, the concept of semantic damage
segmentation (SDS) is revisited. Compared to image segmentation, it is shown
that a much higher level of precision is necessary for damage diagnosis. To
validate and test the proposed framework, a benchmark dataset, 10,800 nonlinear
response history analyses on a 10-story-10-bay 2D reinforced concrete moment
frame, is utilized. Compared to the benchmark SDS model, Bayesian models
exhibit superior robustness with enhanced global and mean class accuracies.
Finally, the model's uncertainty output is studied by monitoring the softmax
class variance of different predictions. It is shown that class variance
correlates well with locations where the model makes mistakes. This output can
be used in combination with the prediction results to increase the reliability
of this data-driven framework in structural inspections.

found continuum compact objects in M0.014-0.054, which have no counterpart in
the H42$\alpha$ recombination line. They are detected in the SO emission line,

larger than the virial mass, it is bound gravitationally. This is also detected
in the CCS emission line. The embedded star would be too young to ionize the
surrounding molecular cloud. The VP is traced by poloidal magnetic field.
Because the strength of the magnetic field is estimated to be $\sim m$Gauss
using the CF method, the VP is supported against fragmentation. The star
formation in the HMC of M0.014-0.054 is likely induced by the CCC between the
stable filaments, which may be a common mechanism in the SgrAMC.

homogeneity, i.e., every computing unit has the same computational capability,
and can communicate with every other unit with the same latency and bandwidth.
However, this strong assumption of a uniform topology rarely holds in practical
settings, where computing units are connected through complex networks. To
address this issue, Blanas et al. recently proposed a topology-aware massively
parallel computation model that integrates the network structure and
heterogeneity in the modeling cost. The network is modeled as a directed graph,
where each edge is associated with a cost function that depends on the data
transferred between the two endpoints. The computation proceeds in synchronous
rounds, and the cost of each round is measured as the maximum cost over all the
edges in the network.
  In this work, we take the first step into investigating three fundamental
data processing tasks in this topology-aware parallel model: set intersection,
cartesian product, and sorting. We focus on network topologies that are tree
topologies, and present both lower bounds, as well as (asymptotically) matching
upper bounds. The optimality of our algorithms is with respect to the initial
data distribution among the network nodes, instead of assuming worst-case
distribution as in previous results. Apart from the theoretical optimality of
our results, our protocols are simple, use a constant number of rounds, and we
believe can be implemented in practical settings as well.

the DM particles can self-annihilate, and, therefore, provide a new source of
energy for the star. We investigate this phenomenon for capture of DM particles
by the first generation of stars [Population III (Pop III) stars], by using the
multiscatter capture formalism. Pop III stars are particularly good DM captors,
since they form in DM-rich environments, at the center of$~\sim 10^6 M_\odot$

section ($\sigma)$ at the current deepest exclusion limits provided by the

III stars can lead, via the Eddington limit, to upper bounds in stellar masses
that can be as low as a few $M_\odot$ if the ambient DM density ($\rho_X$) at
the location of the Pop III star is sufficiently high. Conversely, when Pop III
stars are identified, one can use their observed mass ($M_\star$) to place
bounds on $\rho_X\sigma$. Using adiabatic contraction to estimate the ambient
DM density in the environment surrounding Pop III stars, we place projected
upper limits on $\sigma$, for $M_\star$ in the $100-1000~M_\odot$ range, and
find bounds that are competitive with, or deeper than, those provided by the
most sensitive current direct detection experiments for both spin independent

intriguingly, we find that Pop III stars with mass $M_\star \gtrsim 300

role not only in energy release in the solar atmosphere, but also in fusion,
astrophysical, and other space plasma environments. One of the challenges in
explaining solar observations in which reconnection is thought to play a
critical role is to account for the transition of the dynamics from a slow
quasi-continuous phase to a fast and impulsive energetic burst of much shorter
duration. Despite the theoretical progress in identifying mechanisms that might
lead to rapid onset, a lack of observations of this transition has left models
poorly constrained. High-resolution spectroscopic observations from NASA's
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) now reveal tell-tale signatures of
the abrupt transition of reconnection from a slow phase to a fast, impulsive
phase during UV bursts or explosive events in the Sun's atmosphere. Our
observations are consistent with numerical simulations of the plasmoid
instability, and provide evidence for the onset of fast reconnection mediated
by plasmoids and new opportunities for remote-sensing diagnostics of
reconnection mechanisms on the Sun.

generates a good trial wave function for projecting a large scale original
Hamiltonian to a local subsystem with a small number of basis. The resultant
ground state of the projected Hamiltonian can locally approximate the true
ground state. However, the lack of the variational principle makes it difficult
to judge the quality of the choice of the potential. Here we focus on the
entanglement spectrum (ES) as a judging criterion; accurate evaluation of the
ES guarantees that the corresponding reduced density matrix well reproduces all
physical quantities on the local subsystem. We apply the DMET to the Hubbard
model on the one-dimensional chain, zigzag chain, and triangular lattice and
test several variants of potentials and cost functions. It turns out that ES
serves as a more sensitive quantity than the energy and double occupancy to
probe the quality of the DMET outcomes. A symmetric potential reproduces the ES
of the phase that continues from a noninteracting limit. The Mott transition as
well as symmetry-breaking transitions can be detected by the singularities in
the ES. However, the details of the ES in the strongly interacting parameter
region depends much on these variants, meaning that the present DMET algorithm
allowing for numerous variant is insufficient to fully characterize the
particular phases that require characterization by the ES.

computationally hard and many problems of this type are hard to solve even
approximately. Complexity theory characterizes the optimal approximation ratios
achievable in polynomial time in the worst case. On the other hand, when the
objective function is random, worst case approximation ratios are overly
pessimistic. Mean field spin glasses are canonical families of random energy
functions over the discrete hypercube $\{-1,+1\}^N$. The near-optima of these
energy landscapes are organized according to an ultrametric tree-like
structure, which enjoys a high degree of universality. Recently, a precise
connection has begun to emerge between this ultrametric structure and the
optimal approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time in the typical case.
A new approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm has been proposed that
leverages this connection. The asymptotic behavior of this algorithm has been
analyzed, conditional on the nature of the solution of a certain variational
problem.
  In this paper we describe the first implementation of this algorithm and the
first numerical solution of the associated variational problem. We test our
approach on two prototypical mean-field spin glasses: the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, and the $3$-spin Ising spin glass. We
observe that the algorithm works well already at moderate sizes ($N\gtrsim
1000$) and its behavior is consistent with theoretical expectations. For the SK
model it asymptotically achieves arbitrarily good approximations of the global
optimum. For the $3$-spin model, it achieves a constant approximation ratio
that is predicted by the theory, and it appears to beat the `threshold energy'
achieved by Glauber dynamics. Finally, we observe numerically that the
intermediate states generated by the algorithm have the properties of ancestor
states in the ultrametric tree.

realizing error suppression in practice. While fault-tolerant design works in
principle, it has not previously been demonstrated in an error-corrected
physical system with native noise characteristics. In this work, we
experimentally demonstrate fault-tolerant preparation, measurement, rotation,
and stabilizer measurement of a Bacon-Shor logical qubit using 13 trapped ion
qubits. When we compare these fault-tolerant protocols to non-fault tolerant
protocols, we see significant reductions in the error rates of the logical
primitives in the presence of noise. The result of fault-tolerant design is an
average state preparation and measurement error of 0.6% and a Clifford gate
error of 0.3% after error correction. Additionally, we prepare magic states
with fidelities exceeding the distillation threshold, demonstrating all of the
key single-qubit ingredients required for universal fault-tolerant operation.
These results demonstrate that fault-tolerant circuits enable highly accurate

the differential performance of the gender classification algorithms across

differences in the deep learning algorithms and (b) training set imbalance, as
a potential source of bias causing differential performance across gender and
race. Experimental investigations are conducted on two latest large-scale

experimental results suggested that the algorithms with architectural
differences varied in performance with consistency towards specific gender-race
groups. For instance, for all the algorithms used, Black females (Black race in
general) always obtained the least accuracy rates. Middle Eastern males and
Latino females obtained higher accuracy rates most of the time. Training set
imbalance further widens the gap in the unequal accuracy rates across all
gender-race groups. Further investigations using facial landmarks suggested
that facial morphological differences due to the bone structure influenced by
genetic and environmental factors could be the cause of the least performance
of Black females and Black race, in general.

In dealing with the free boundary problem, one of the key points is determining
the position of the shock front. To this end, a free boundary problem for the

difficulties arise due to the additional 0-order terms and singularities along

gas through ${\rm H}_2$ cooling, and possessing unique properties. Although
unlikely to be directly detected in UV/infrared surveys, the radiation from
these molecular-cooling galaxies (MCGs) could leave an imprint in the 21-cm
signal from the Cosmic Dawn. Here we quantify their detectability with upcoming
radio interferometers. We generate mock 21-cm power spectra using a model for
both MCGs as well as more massive, atomic-cooling galaxies (AGCs), allowing
both populations to have different properties and scaling relations. The galaxy
parameters are chosen so as to be consistent with: (i) high-redshift UV
luminosity functions; (ii) the upper limit on the neutral fraction from QSO
spectra; (iii) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the CMB; and (iv) the
timing of the recent putative EDGES detection. The latter implies a significant
contribution of MCGs to the Cosmic Dawn, if confirmed to be cosmological. We
then perform Bayesian inference on two models including and ignoring MCG
contributions. Comparing their Bayesian evidences, we find a strong preference
for the model including MCGs, despite the fact that it has more free
parameters. This suggests that if MCGs indeed play a significant role in the
Cosmic Dawn, it should be possible to infer their properties from upcoming
21-cm power spectra. Our study illustrates how these observations can
discriminate among uncertain galaxy formation models with varying complexities,
by maximizing the Bayesian evidence.

structural models for the adsorption of liquid molecules on a surface, but
their reliability depend on whether the surfaces comprise insulating or

of the water contact angle on insulators, where the periodic-honeycomb array of
water molecules was adopted as the adsorption model for the water on the
insulating surface and succeeded in the insulating cases. This study, however,
focus on the water contact angle on a metallic surface, and propose a simple ab
initio based estimation scheme. We not only adopt the previously proposed
structural modeling based on the periodic-honyecomb array, but also consider an
ensemble of isolated water oligomers that have different molecular coverage
(ML) values. We established a statistic model to predict a contact angle of the
water wetting on a Cu(111) surface: The coverage-dependent contact angles
obtained from each of the isolated clusters was fit to a quadratic regression,
and the contact angle was interpolated by referring to a ML value of water
layer in literature. This interpolated value lay within the deviation of
experimental angles. In addition, the Boltzmann-average over the isolated
clusters was found to agree well with the interpolated one. This indicates that
the Boltzmann-average is useful for estimating the contact angle of other
metallic surfaces without knowing a ML value a priori.

strong broad \ha\ indicates that these AGNs are low-luminosity type 1 AGNs. We
measured the velocity, velocity dispersion and flux of stellar continuum and
gas emission lines (i.e., \hb\ and \oiii) as a function of distance from the

discretization method provides many physical and solving-oriented properties,
which may be advantageous for resolving computationally intensive turbulent

equations with the well-known Taylor-Hood elements is also introduced in order
to provide a comparison. The four different main principles of simulating
turbulent flows are explained: the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation,
large eddy simulation, variational multiscale method and the direct numerical
simulation. The large eddy simulation and variational multiscale have shown
good promise in the computation of traditionally difficult turbulent cases.
This accuracy can be only surpassed by directly solving the Navier-Stokes
equations, but comes with excessively high computational costs. The very common
strategy is the Reynolds-average approach, since it is the most cost-effective.
Those modelling principles have been applied to the two discretization
techniques and validated through the basic plane channel flow test case. All

Spectrometer (CANDLES) discerns the $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{48}$Ca using a
CaF$_2$ scintillator as the detector and source. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
collect scintillation photons. At the Q-value of $^{48}$Ca, the current energy
resolution (2.6%) exceeds the ideal statistical fluctuation of the number of
photoelectrons (1.6%). Because of CaF$_2$'s long decay constant of 1000 ns, a
signal integration within 4000 ns is used to calculate the energy. The baseline
fluctuation ($\sigma_{baseline}$) is accumulated in the signal integration,
thus degrading the energy resolution. This paper studies $\sigma_{baseline}$ in
the CANDLES detector, which severely degrades the resolution by 1% at the
Q-value of $^{48}$Ca. To avoid $\sigma_{\rm baseline}$, photon counting can be
used to obtain the number of photoelectrons in each PMT; however, a significant
photoelectron signal overlapping probability in each PMT causes missing
photoelectrons in counting and reduces the energy resolution. ""Partial photon

However, since large Hall response originating from Berry curvature has been
reported in quite limited materials, the detailed mechanism remains unclear at
present. Here, we report the discovery of a large AHE triggered by a
pressure-induced magnetic phase transition in elemental $\alpha$-Mn. The AHE is
absent in the non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase at ambient pressure,
whereas a large AHE is observed in the weak ferromagnetic phase under high
pressure despite the small averaged moment of $\sim 0.02 \mu_B$/Mn. Our results
indicate that the emergence of the AHE in $\alpha$-Mn is governed by the
symmetry of the underlying magnetic structure, providing a direct evidence of a
switch between a zero and non-zero contribution of the Berry curvature across
the phase boundary. $\alpha$-Mn can be an elemental and tunable platform to
reveal the role of Berry curvature in AHE.

non-invasively quantify the relationship in function, structure, and morphology

gender-related connectional differences. However, to the best of our knowledge,
studies on gender differences in brain connectivity were limited to
investigating pairwise (i.e., low-order) relationship ROIs, overlooking the
complex high-order interconnectedness of the brain as a network. To address
this limitation, brain multiplexes have been introduced to model the
relationship between at least two different brain networks. However, this
inhibits their application to datasets with single brain networks such as
functional networks. To fill this gap, we propose the first work on predicting
brain multiplexes from a source network to investigate gender differences.
Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) submerged the field of medical
data synthesis. However, although conventional GANs work well on images, they
cannot handle brain networks due to their non-Euclidean topological structure.
Differently, in this paper, we tap into the nascent field of geometric-GANs
(G-GAN) to design a deep multiplex prediction architecture comprising (i) a
geometric source to target network translator mimicking a U-Net architecture
with skip connections and (ii) a conditional discriminator which classifies
predicted target intra-layers by conditioning on the multiplex source
intra-layers. Such architecture simultaneously learns the latent source network
representation and the deep non-linear mapping from the source to target
multiplex intra-layers. Our experiments on a large dataset demonstrated that
predicted multiplexes significantly boost gender classification accuracy
compared with source networks and identifies both low and high-order
gender-specific multiplex connections.

We report a detection of this EFE using galaxies from the Spitzer Photometry

large-scale external gravitational field from an all-sky galaxy catalog. Our
detection is threefold: (1) the EFE is individually detected at $8\sigma$ to

EFE is statistically detected at more than $4\sigma$ from a blind test of 153

Although recent work try to improve the one-stage detectors by imitating the

In this paper, we propose MimicDet, a novel and efficient framework to train a
one-stage detector by directly mimic the two-stage features, aiming to bridge
the accuracy gap between one-stage and two-stage detectors. Unlike conventional
mimic methods, MimicDet has a shared backbone for one-stage and two-stage
detectors, then it branches into two heads which are well designed to have
compatible features for mimicking. Thus MimicDet can be end-to-end trained
without the pre-train of the teacher network. And the cost does not increase
much, which makes it practical to adopt large networks as backbones. We also
make several specialized designs such as dual-path mimicking and staggered
feature pyramid to facilitate the mimicking process. Experiments on the
challenging COCO detection benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MimicDet.
It achieves 46.1 mAP with ResNeXt-101 backbone on the COCO test-dev set, which
significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.

a deep neural network learns to denoise solely from noisy images. However, when
clean images that do not directly correspond to any of the noisy images are
actually available, there is room for improvement as these clean images contain
useful information that fully unsupervised methods do not exploit. In this
paper, we propose a method for image denoising in this setting. First, we use a
flow-based generative model to learn a prior from clean images. We then use it
to train a denoising network without the need for any clean targets. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments and
comparisons.

  Cross-Diffusion and Heat Tracing for Brain State Profiling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The individual brain can be viewed as a highly-complex multigraph (i.e. a set
of graphs also called connectomes), where each graph represents a unique
connectional view of pairwise brain region (node) relationships such as
function or morphology. Due to its multifold complexity, understanding how
brain disorders alter not only a single view of the brain graph, but its
multigraph representation at the individual and population scales, remains one
of the most challenging obstacles to profiling brain connectivity for
ultimately disentangling a wide spectrum of brain states (e.g., healthy vs.
disordered). In this work, while cross-pollinating the fields of spectral graph
theory and diffusion models, we unprecedentedly propose an eigen-based
cross-diffusion strategy for multigraph brain integration, comparison, and
profiling. Specifically, we first devise a brain multigraph fusion model guided
by eigenvector centrality to rely on most central nodes in the cross-diffusion
process. Next, since the graph spectrum encodes its shape (or geometry) as if
one can hear the shape of the graph, for the first time, we profile the fused
multigraphs at several diffusion timescales by extracting the compact
heat-trace signatures of their corresponding Laplacian matrices. Here, we
reveal for the first time autistic and healthy profiles of morphological brain
multigraphs, derived from T1-w magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
demonstrate their discriminability in boosting the classification of unseen
samples in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. This study presents the
first step towards hearing the shape of the brain multigraph that can be
leveraged for profiling and disentangling comorbid neurological disorders,
thereby advancing precision medicine.

variety of studies based on deep learning have sought to improve ultrafast
ultrasound imaging. Most of these approaches have been performed on radio
frequency (RF) signals. However, inphase/quadrature (I/Q) digital beamformers
are now widely used as low-cost strategies. In this work, we used complex
convolutional neural networks for reconstruction of ultrasound images from I/Q
signals. We recently described a convolutional neural network architecture
called ID-Net, which exploited an inception layer designed for reconstruction
of RF diverging-wave ultrasound images. In the present study, we derive the
complex equivalent of this network; i.e., the Complex-valued Inception for
Diverging-wave Network (CID-Net) that operates on I/Q data. We provide
experimental evidence that CID-Net provides the same image quality as that
obtained from RF-trained convolutional neural networks; i.e., using only three
I/Q images, the CID-Net produces high-quality images that can compete with
those obtained by coherently compounding 31 RF images. Moreover, we show that
CID-Net outperforms the straightforward architecture that consists of
processing the real and imaginary parts of the I/Q signal separately, which
thereby indicates the importance of consistently processing the I/Q signals
using a network that exploits the complex nature of such signals.

dielectric permittivity monitoring, which avoids the direct processing of

to any low-viscosity uncured composites, which may contain multiple fillers.
More importantly, when a voltage is applied to an uncured composite insulating

the development of anonymous system due to the large requirement of additional
additional resources (i.e. bandwidth and storage) and high latency. Moreover,
existing anonymous systems may suffer from different attacks including

10^{14} \rm g$. Since the lifetime of these PBHs is smaller than the present
age of the Universe, they have evaporated by the present day. Due to Hawking
radiation, the heating effects of PBHs on the IGM can suppress the absorption
amplitude of the global 21cm signal. In this work, by requiring that the
differential brightness temperature of the global 21cm signals in the redshift
range of $10\lesssim z \lesssim 30$, e.g., $\delta T_{b} \lesssim -100~\rm mK$,
we obtain upper limits on the initial mass fraction of PBHs. We find that the
strongest upper limit is $\beta_{\rm PBH} \sim 2\times 10^{-30}$. Since the
formation of PBHs is related to primordial curvature perturbations, by using
the constraints on the initial mass fraction of PBHs we obtain the upper limits
on the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations for the scale range

bound using Riemannian distance in the manifold of Hermitian positive definite
matrices. From an analysis of this metric at high signal-to-noise ratio, we
obtain further simplified metrics. For any given set of constellation sizes,
the proposed metrics can be optimized over the set of constellation symbols.
Motivated by the simplified metric, we propose a simple constellation
construction consisting in partitioning a single-user constellation. We also
provide a generalization of our previously proposed construction based on
precoding individual constellations of lower dimensions. For a fixed joint
constellation, the design metrics can be further optimized over the per-user
transmit power, especially when the users transmit at different rates.
Considering unitary space-time modulation, we investigate the option of
building each individual constellation as a set of truncated unitary matrices
scaled by the respective transmit power. Numerical results show that our
proposed metrics are meaningful, and can be used as objectives to generate
constellations through numerical optimization that perform better, for the same
transmission rate and power constraint, than a common pilot-based scheme and
the constellations optimized with existing metrics.

  Super-Resolution","accepted by ECCV2020 AIM workshop",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in single image super-resolution (SISR) explored the power of
convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve a better performance. Despite the
great success of CNN-based methods, it is not easy to apply these methods to
edge devices due to the requirement of heavy computation. To solve this
problem, various fast and lightweight CNN models have been proposed. The
information distillation network is one of the state-of-the-art methods, which
adopts the channel splitting operation to extract distilled features. However,
it is not clear enough how this operation helps in the design of efficient SISR
models. In this paper, we propose the feature distillation connection (FDC)
that is functionally equivalent to the channel splitting operation while being
more lightweight and flexible. Thanks to FDC, we can rethink the information
multi-distillation network (IMDN) and propose a lightweight and accurate SISR
model called residual feature distillation network (RFDN). RFDN uses multiple
feature distillation connections to learn more discriminative feature
representations. We also propose a shallow residual block (SRB) as the main
building block of RFDN so that the network can benefit most from residual
learning while still being lightweight enough. Extensive experimental results
show that the proposed RFDN achieve a better trade-off against the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and model complexity.
Moreover, we propose an enhanced RFDN (E-RFDN) and won the first place in the
AIM 2020 efficient super-resolution challenge. Code will be available at

the AMPC model, as well as the best-known results in the MPC model, which is

empirically evaluate our algorithms on a set of large real-world graphs and
show that our AMPC algorithms can achieve improvements in both running time and

(e.g., brain connectomes) in a low dimensional space for brain connectivity
mapping, prediction and classification. However, existing embedding algorithms
have two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on preserving
one-to-one topological relationships between nodes (i.e., regions of interest
(ROIs) in a connectome), but they have mostly ignored many-to-many
relationships (i.e., set to set), which can be captured using a hyperconnectome
structure. Second, existing graph embedding techniques cannot be easily adapted
to multi-view graph data with heterogeneous distributions. In this paper, while
cross-pollinating adversarial deep learning with hypergraph theory, we aim to
jointly learn deep latent embeddings of subject0specific multi-view brain
graphs to eventually disentangle different brain states. First, we propose a
new simple strategy to build a hyperconnectome for each brain view based on
nearest neighbour algorithm to preserve the connectivities across pairs of
ROIs. Second, we design a hyperconnectome autoencoder (HCAE) framework which
operates directly on the multi-view hyperconnectomes based on hypergraph
convolutional layers to better capture the many-to-many relationships between
brain regions (i.e., nodes). For each subject, we further regularize the
hypergraph autoencoding by adversarial regularization to align the distribution
of the learned hyperconnectome embeddings with that of the input
hyperconnectomes. We formalize our hyperconnectome embedding within a geometric
deep learning framework to optimize for a given subject, thereby designing an
individual-based learning framework. Our experiments showed that the learned
embeddings by HCAE yield to better results for brain state classification
compared with other deep graph embedding methods methods.

produces images containing morphological and dynamical information without

Phase unwrapping is the computational process that recovers a more informative
image. It is particularly challenging with thick and complex samples such as
organoids. Recent works that rely on supervised training show that deep
learning is a powerful method to unwrap the phase; however, supervised
approaches require large and representative datasets which are difficult to
obtain for complex biological samples. Inspired by the concept of deep image
priors, we propose a deep-learning-based method that does not need any training
set. Our framework relies on an untrained convolutional neural network to
accurately unwrap the phase while ensuring the consistency of the measurements.
We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method faithfully recovers the
phase of complex samples on both real and simulated data. Our work paves the
way to reliable phase imaging of thick and complex samples with QPI.

hypersensitive nanoscale IR spectra and imaging in aqueous environment with the

optimization methods using various workload parameters and a thread count of
224. Previous studies focused on thread scalability and did not explore the
space analyzed here. We classified the optimization methods on the basis of
three performance factors: CPU cache, delay on conflict, and version lifetime.
Analyses using CCBench and 224 threads, produced six insights. (I1) The
performance of optimistic concurrency control protocol for a read only workload
rapidly degrades as cardinality increases even without L3 cache misses. (I2)
Silo can outperform TicToc for some write-intensive workloads by using
invisible reads optimization. (I3) The effectiveness of two approaches to
coping with conflict (wait and no-wait) depends on the situation. (I4) OCC
reads the same record two or more times if a concurrent transaction
interruption occurs, which can improve performance. (I5) Mixing different
implementations is inappropriate for deep analysis. (I6) Even a
state-of-the-art garbage collection method cannot improve the performance of
multi-version protocols if there is a single long transaction mixed into the
workload. On the basis of I4, we defined the read phase extension optimization
in which an artificial delay is added to the read phase. On the basis of I6, we
defined the aggressive garbage collection optimization in which even visible
versions are collected. The code for CCBench and all the data in this paper are

sketches. Moreover, most methods are either inapplicable or inefficient for
dynamic datasets, although modern real-world datasets are updated over time. We
propose dynamic filter trie (DyFT), a dynamic similarity search method for both
binary and integer sketches. An extensive experimental analysis using large
real-world datasets shows that DyFT performs superiorly with respect to
scalability, time performance, and memory efficiency. For example, on a huge

and RIS control, whose goal is to minimize the sum transmit power under
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints of the users. To
solve this problem, a dual method is proposed, where the dual problem is

the phase beamforming of the RIS is obtained in the closed form, while the

to be biseparating if $T$ is a bijection so that $f$ and $g$ are disjoint if
and only if $Tf$ and $Tg$ are disjoint. Note that an additive bijection retains
$\mathbb{Q}$-linearity. For a general nonlinear map $T$, the definition of
biseparating given above turns out to be too weak to determine the structure of

general nonlinear operators acting between spaces of vector-valued functions,
which coincides with the previous definition for additive maps. Under some mild
assumptions on the function spaces involved, it turns out that a map is
biseparating if and only if it is locally determined. We then delve deeply into
some specific function spaces -- spaces of continuous functions, uniformly
continuous functions and Lipschitz functions -- and characterize the
biseparating maps acting on them. As a by-product, certain forms of automatic
continuity are obtained. We also prove some finer properties of biseparating

attention. The unusual transport and optical properties of these materials
originate mainly from triangular lattices (TLs). Therefore, the application of
energy harvesting calls for a study of the thermoelectric properties of 2D TLs
coupled to electrodes. The transmission coefficient of 2D TLs is calculated by
using the Green's function technique to treat ballistic transports. Especially
important among our findings is the electron-hole asymmetric behavior of the
power factor ($PF$). Specifically, the maximum $PF$ of electrons is
significantly larger than that of holes. At room temperature, the maximum $PF$
of electrons is dictated by the position of the chemical potential of
electrodes near the band edge of TLs. The enhancement of $PF$ with increasing
electronic states results from the enhancement of electrical conductance and
constant Seebeck coefficient. When the band gap is ten times larger than the
thermal energy, it is appropriate to make one-band model predictions for
thermoelectric optimization.

Given an isogeny class of Drinfeld modules over a finite field, what are the
orders of the corresponding endomorphism algebra (which is an isogeny
invariant) that occur as endomorphism ring of a Drinfeld module in that isogeny
class? It is worth mentioning that this question is different from the ones
investigated by the authors Kuhn, Pink in [6] and Garai, Papikian in [3]. The
former authors rather provided an answer to the question, given a Drinfeld
module {\phi}, how does one efficiently compute the endomorphism ring of
{\phi}? The importance of our question resides in the fact that it might be
very helpful to better understand isogeny graphs of Drinfeld modules of higher
rank (r > 2) and may be reopen the debate concerning the application to
isogeny-based cryptography. We answer that question for the case whereby the
endomorphism algebra is a field by providing a necessary and sufficient
condition for a given order to be the endomorphism ring of a Drinfeld module.

comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions. To that end, we
developed the dynamical energy loss formalism which, in distinction to most
other methods, takes into account a realistic medium composed of dynamical
scattering centers. The formalism also allows making numerical predictions for
a wide number of observables with the same parameter set fixed to standard
literature values. In this proceedings, we overview our recently developed
DREENA-C and DREENA-B frameworks, where DREENA is a computational
implementation of the dynamical energy loss formalism, and where C stands for
constant temperature QCD medium, while B stands for the medium modeled by 1+1D
Bjorken expansion. At constant temperature our predictions overestimate $v_2$,
in contrast to other models, but consistent with simple analytical estimates.
With Bjorken expansion, we have a good agreement of the predictions with both
$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ measurements. We find that introducing medium evolution has
a larger effect on $v_2$ predictions, but for precision predictions it has to
be taken into account in $R_{AA}$ predictions as well. Based on numerical
calculations and simple analytical derivations, we also propose a new
observable, which we call path length sensitive suppression ratio, for which we
argue that the path length dependence can be assessed in a straightforward
manner. We also argue that $Pb+Pb$ vs. $Xe+Xe$ measurements make a good system
to assess the path length dependence. As an outlook, we expect that
introduction of more complex medium evolution (beyond Bjorken expansion) in the
dynamical energy loss formalism can provide a basis for a state of the art QGP
tomography tool - e.g. to jointly constrain the medium properties from the
point of both high pt and low pt data.

results, presented in detail in this paper, show that hyperon-antihyperon pairs
from these reactions can be exclusively reconstructed with high efficiency and

have been applied and evaluated: one standard multidimensional efficiency
correction approach, and one efficiency independent approach. The applicability

electron-electron correlations and deviates from the H$^2$ or saturating
behaviors expected for uncorrelated metals. Contrary to similar Fe-based
pnictide systems, the superconductor LaRu$_2$P$_2$ (T$_c$ = 4 K) shows no
enhancement of electron-electron correlations. Here we report a non-saturating
magnetoresistance deviating from the H$^2$ or saturating behaviors in
LaRu$_2$P$_2$. We have grown and characterized high quality single crystals of
LaRu$_2$P$_2$ and measured a magnetoresistance following H$^{1.3}$ up to 22 T.
We discuss our result by comparing the bandstructure of LaRu$_2$P$_2$ with Fe
based pnictide superconductors. The different orbital structures of Fe and Ru
leads to a 3D Fermi surface with negligible bandwidth renormalization in
LaRu$_2$P$_2$, that contains a large open sheet over the whole Brillouin zone.
We show that the large magnetoresistance in LaRu$_2$P$_2$ is unrelated to the
one obtained in materials with strong electron-electron correlations and that
it is compatible instead with conduction due to open orbits on the rather
complex Fermi surface structure of LaRu$_2$P$_2$.

the usefulness of these states for loss measurement by considering three
different estimators, comparing with the correlated thermal twin beam states
generated from spontaneous parametric down conversion or four-wave mixing. We
then incorporated the photon subtraction operation into the model and
demonstrate their advantage in loss estimations with respect to un-subtracted
states at both fixed squeezing and per photon exposure of the absorbing sample.
For instance, at fixed squeezing, for two photon subtraction, up to three times
advantage is found. In the latter case, albeit the advantage due to photon
subtraction mostly subsides in standard regime, an unexpected result is that in
some operating regimes the photon subtraction scheme can also give up to 20%
advantage over the correlated Poisson beam result. We have also made a
comparative study of these estimators for finding the best measurement for loss
estimations. We present results for all the values of the model parameters

$p_{2t,t}(n)$ for all $t\geq 1$. Using these identities, we prove that the
Ramanujan's famous congruences for $p(n)$ are also satisfied by $p_{t,t}(n)$

background metric and a nontrivial scalar field profile. Recently, in the
context of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories it was shown
that stealth de Sitter solutions suffer from either infinite strong coupling or
gradient instability for scalar field perturbations. The sound speed squared is
either vanishing or negative. In the first case, the strong coupling scale is
zero and thus lower than the energy scale of any physical phenomena. From the
viewpoint of effective field theory, this issue is naturally resolved by
introducing a controlled detuning of the degeneracy condition dubbed
scordatura, recovering a version of ghost condensation. In this paper we
construct a viable dark energy model in the scordatura DHOST theory based on a
stealth cosmological solution, in which the metric is the same as in the
standard $\Lambda$CDM model and the scalar field profile is linearly
time-dependent. We show that the scordatura mechanism resolves the strong
coupling and gradient instability. Further, we find that the scordatura is also
necessary to make the quasi-static limit well-defined, which implies that the
subhorizon observables are inevitably affected by the scordatura. We derive the
effective gravitational coupling and the correction to the friction term for
the subhorizon evolution of the linear dark matter energy density contrast as
well as the Weyl potential and the gravitational slip parameter. In the absence
of the scordatura, the quasi-static approximation would break down at all
scales around stealth cosmological solutions even if the issue of the infinite
strong coupling is unjustly disregarded. Therefore previous estimations of the
subhorizon evolution of matter density contrast in modified gravity in the
literature need to be revisited by taking into account the scordatura effect.

structures of data samples: firstly forming local clusters based on a density
growing process with a strategy for properly noise handling as well as cluster
boundary detection; and then estimating a GDT from relationship between local
clusters in terms of a connectivity measure, givingglobal topological graph.
The connectivity, measuring similarity between neighboring local clusters, is
based on local clusters rather than individual points, ensuring its robustness
to even very large noise. Evaluation results on both toy and real-world

needs an effective, efficient, reliable and robust non-destructive assay (NDA)
system to ensure the integrity of the fuel prior to disposal. In the context of
the Finnish geological repository, Passive Gamma Emission Tomography (PGET)
will be a part of such an NDA system. We report here on the results of PGET
measurements at the Finnish nuclear power plants during the years 2017-2020.
Gamma activity profiles are recorded from all angles by rotating the detector
arrays around the fuel assembly that has been inserted into the center of the
torus. Image reconstruction from the resulting tomographic data is defined as a
constrained minimization problem with a data fidelity term and regularization
terms. The activity and attenuation maps, as well as detector sensitivity
corrections, are the variables in the minimization process. The regularization
terms ensure that prior information on the (possible) locations of fuel rods
and their diameter are taken into account. Fuel rod classification, the main
purpose of the PGET method, is based on the difference of the activity of a
fuel rod from its immediate neighbors, taking into account its distance from
the assembly center. The classification is carried out by a support vector
machine. We report on the results for ten different fuel types with burnups
between 5.72 and 55.0 GWd/tU, cooling times between 1.87 and 34.6 years and
initial enrichments between 1.9 and 4.4%. For all fuel assemblies measured,
missing fuel rods, partial fuel rods and water channels were correctly
classified. Burnable absorber fuel rods were classified as fuel rods. On rare
occasions, a fuel rod that is present was falsely classified as missing. We
conclude that the combination of the PGET device and our image reconstruction
method provides a reliable base for fuel rod classification.

collisionless relaxation dynamics, quasi-stationary states (QSS). These may
arise from a bottom-up aggregation of structures or in a top-down frame; their
quasi-equilibrium properties are well described by the Jeans equation and are
not universal, i.e. they depend on initial conditions. To understand the origin
of such dependence, we present results of numerical experiments of initially
cold and spherical systems characterized by various choices of the spectrum of
initial density fluctuations. The amplitude of such fluctuations determines
whether the system relaxes in a top-down or a bottom-up manner. We find that
statistical properties of the resulting QSS mainly depend upon the amount of
energy exchanged during the formation process. In particular, in the violent
top-down collapses the energy exchange is large and the QSS show an inner core
with an almost flat density profile and a quasi Maxwell-Boltzmann (isotropic)
velocity distribution, while their outer regions display a density profile
$\rho(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha >0$) with radially elongated orbits. We
analytically show that $\alpha=4$ in agreement with numerical experiments. In
the less violent bottom-up dynamics, the energy exchange is much smaller, the
orbits are less elongated and $0< \alpha(r) \le 4$, with a a density profile
well fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White behavior. Such a dynamical evolution is
shown by both non-uniform spherical isolated systems and by halos extracted
from cosmological simulations. We consider the relation of these results with
the core-cusp problem concluding that this is naturally solved if galaxies form
through a monolithic collapse.

invariant once the amplitude is multiplied by an overall energy- and
angle-dependent phase. This invariance is known as the continuum ambiguity.
Also, mostly in truncated partial wave analyses (TPWAs), discrete ambiguities
originating from complex conjugation of roots are known to occur. In this note,
it is shown that the general continuum ambiguity mixes partial waves and that
for scalar particles, discrete ambiguities are just a subset of continuum
ambiguities with a specific phase. A numerical method is outlined briefly,
which can determine the relevant connecting phases.

fractional) one-phase free boundary problem.
  The problem of classifying stable (or minimal) homogeneous solutions in
dimensions $n\geq3$ is completely open. In this context, axially symmetric
solutions are expected to play the same role as Simons' cone in the classical
theory of minimal surfaces, but even in this simpler case the problem is open.
  The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, our first main
contribution is to find, for the first time, the stability condition for the
thin one-phase problem. Quite surprisingly, this requires the use of ""large
solutions"" for the fractional Laplacian, which blow up on the free boundary.
  On the other hand, using our new stability condition, we show that any
axially symmetric homogeneous stable solution in dimensions $n\le 5$ is
one-dimensional, independently of the parameter $s\in (0,1)$.

the study of probabilistic graphical models.
  Marginal estimation algorithms are introduced as diffusion equations of the
form $\dot u = \delta \varphi$. They generalise the traditional belief
propagation (BP) algorithm, and provide an alternative for contrastive
divergence (CD) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, typically
involved in estimating a free energy functional and its gradient w.r.t. model
parameters.
  We propose a new homological picture where parameters are a collections of
local interaction potentials $(u_\alpha) \in A_0$, for $\alpha$ running over
the factor nodes of a given region graph. The boundary operator $\delta$
mapping heat fluxes $(\varphi_{\alpha\beta}) \in A_1$ to a subspace $\delta A_1
\subseteq A_0$ is the discrete analog of a divergence. The total energy $H =
\sum_\alpha u_\alpha$ defining the global probability $p = e^{-H} / Z$ is in
one-to-one correspondence with a homology class $[u] = u + \delta A_1$ of
interaction potentials, so that total energy remains constant when $u$ evolves
up to a boundary term $\delta \varphi$.
  Stationary states of diffusion are shown to lie at the intersection of a
homology class of potentials with a non-linear constraint surface enforcing
consistency of the local marginals estimates. This picture allows us to precise
and complete a proof on the correspondence between stationary states of BP and
critical points of a local free energy functional (obtained by Bethe-Kikuchi
approximations) and to extend the uniqueness result for acyclic graphs (i.e.
trees) to a wider class of hypergraphs. In general, bifurcations of equilibria
are related to the spectral singularities of a local diffusion operator,
yielding new explicit examples of the degeneracy phenomenon.

Hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent dense $1 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ cores, to
study the influence of episodic outflow feedback on the stellar multiplicity
and the star formation efficiency (SFE). Protostars are represented by sink
particles, which use a sub-grid model to capture stellar evolution, inner-disc
evolution, episodic accretion and the launching of outflows. By comparing
simulations with and without episodic outflow feedback, we show that
simulations with outflow feedback reproduce the binary statistics of young
stellar populations, including the relative proportions of singles, binaries,
triples, etc. and the high incidence of twin binaries with $q\geq 0.95$;
simulations without outflow feedback do not. Entrainment factors (the ratio
between total outflowing mass and initially ejected mass) are typically $\sim
7\pm 2$, but can be much higher if the total mass of stars formed in a core is
low and/or outflow episodes are infrequent. By decreasing both the mean mass of

first small mission in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched in
December 2019. CHEOPS is a partnership between ESA and Switzerland with
important contributions by ten additional ESA Member States. CHEOPS is the
first mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets using ultrahigh
precision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a
follow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly dedicated to improving, whenever possible,
existing radii measurements or provide first accurate measurements for a subset
of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from
ground-based spectroscopic surveys and to following phase curves. CHEOPS will
provide prime targets for future spectroscopic atmospheric characterisation.
  Requirements on the photometric precision and stability have been derived for
stars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular, CHEOPS
shall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars in the
magnitude range between 6 and 9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm
in 6 hours of integration. For K stars in the magnitude range between 9 and 12,
CHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets achieving a
photometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration. This is achieved by
using a single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal
plane assembly of a 33.5 cm diameter telescope. The 280 kg spacecraft has a
pointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms and orbits on a sun-synchronous
dusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude.
  The nominal mission lifetime is 3.5 years. During this period, 20% of the
observing time is available to the community through a yearly call and a
discretionary time programme managed by ESA.

mapping from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by
\textsc{LHom}($H$), we are given a graph $G$ and lists $L: V(G) \to 2^{V(H)}$,
and we ask for a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ which additionally respects the
lists $L$.
  Very recently Okrasa, Piecyk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [ESA 2020] defined an
invariant $i^*(H)$ and proved that under the SETH $\mathcal{O}^*\left
(i^*(H)^{\textrm{tw}(G)}\right)$ is the tight complexity bound for
\textsc{LHom}($H$), parameterized by the treewidth $\textrm{tw}(G)$ of the
instance graph $G$. We study the complexity of the problem under dirretent
parameterizations. As the first result, we show that $i^*(H)$ is also the right
complexity base if the parameter is the size of a minimum feedback vertex set
of $G$.
  Then we turn our attention to a parameterization by the cutwidth
$\textrm{ctw}(G)$ of $G$. Jansen and Nederlof~[ESA 2018] showed that
\textsc{List $k$-Coloring} (i.e., \textsc{LHom}($K_k$)) can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$ where $c$ does not depend on
$k$. Jansen asked if this behavior extends to graph homomorphisms. As the main
result of the paper, we answer the question in the negative. We define a new
graph invariant $mim^*(H)$ and prove that \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem cannot be
solved in time $\mathcal{O}^*\left
((mim^*(H)-\varepsilon)^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon >0$,
unless the SETH fails. This implies that there is no $c$, such that for every
odd cycle the non-list version of the problem can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)} \right)$.
  Finally, we generalize the algorithm of Jansen and Nederlof, so that it can
be used to solve \textsc{LHom}($H$) for every graph $H$; its complexity depends
on $\textrm{ctw}(G)$ and another invariant of $H$, which is constant for
cliques.

fillings of these flat bands, energy gaps due to strong electron-electron

correlation-driven phases in twisted graphitic systems at non-integer fillings
is unclear. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements
that reveal the existence of threefold rotational (C3) symmetry breaking in
twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBG). Using spectroscopic imaging over large
and uniform areas to characterize the direction and degree of C3 symmetry
breaking, we find it to be prominent only at energies corresponding to the flat
bands and nearly absent in the remote bands. We demonstrate that the C3
symmetry breaking cannot be explained by heterostrain or the displacement
field, and is instead a manifestation of an interaction-driven electronic
nematic phase, which emerges even away from integer fillings. Comparing our
experimental data with a combination of microscopic and phenomenological
modeling, we show that the nematic instability is not associated with the local
scale of the graphene lattice, but is an emergent phenomenon at the scale of
the moir\'e lattice, pointing to the universal character of this ordered state
in flat band moir\'e materials.

flow of a droplet (or a bubble) in a low Reynolds number flow regime.
Multiphase flows through a constricted passage find many interesting
applications in chemistry and biology. The main parameters which determine the
flow properties such as flow rate and pressure drop, and govern the complex
multiphase phenomena such as drop coalescence, break-up and snap-off in a
straight channel flow are the viscosity ratio, droplet size and ratio of the
viscous forces to the surface tension forces (denoted by Capillary number). But
in flow through a constricted passage, in addition to the above-mentioned
parameters, various other geometric parameters such as constriction ratio,
length and shape of the constriction, phase angle, and spacing between the
constrictions also start playing an important role. Most of the studies done on
the problem of drop flow through a constricted passage have aimed to understand
the role of physical parameters, with some studies extending their analysis to
understand the variation of one or two geometric parameters. But no study could
be found which explicitly evaluates the role of surface topography. An attempt
has been made to unify the current literature as well as analyze the effect of
the geometric parameters by understanding the physics and mechanisms involved.
The non-dimensional numbers which govern this problem are then identified using
the scaling analysis.

the nodes of a unimodular Galton-Watson (UGW) tree, where the state of each
node evolves like a d-dimensional diffusion whose drift coefficient depends on
(the histories of) its own state and the states of neighboring nodes, and whose
diffusion coefficient depends only on (the history of) its own state. Under
suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients, an autonomous
characterization is obtained for the marginal distribution of the dynamics of
the neighborhood of a typical node in terms of a certain local equation, which
is a new kind of SDE that is nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This equation
describes a finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose evolution
at any time depends not only on the structure and current state of the
neighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given the
past of the states of neighborhing nodes. Such marginal distributions are of
interest because they arise as weak limits of both marginal distributions and
empirical measures of interacting diffusions on many sequences of sparse random
graphs, including the configuration model and Erdos-Renyi graphs whose average
degrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement
classical results in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting
dynamics of homogeneous interacting diffusions on complete graphs, as the
number of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a corresponding nonlinear Markov
process. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of the graph
strongly influences the dynamics, and the analysis requires a completely
different approach. The proofs of existence and uniqueness of the local
equation rely on delicate new conditional independence and symmetry properties
of particle trajectories on UGW trees, as well as judicious use of changes of

Painlev\'e equations involves the reformulation of these scalar equations into
a symmetric system of coupled, Riccati-like equations known as dressing chains.
Periodic dressing chains are known to be equivalent to the $A_N$-Painlev\'e
system, first described by Noumi and Yamada. The Noumi-Yamada system, in turn,
can be linearized as using bilinear equations and $\tau$-functions; the
corresponding rational solutions can then be given as specializations of
rational solutions of the KP hierarchy.
  The classification of rational solutions to Painlev\'e equations and systems
may now be reduced to an analysis of combinatorial objects known as Maya

representation for rational solutions in terms of classical orthogonal
polynomials. In this paper we illustrate this approach by describing
Hermite-type rational solutions of Painlev\'e of the Noumi-Yamada system in

graph. In this work, we study the case where there is a partition on one of the
two bipartite node sets such that at most one node per subset of the partition
can be chosen. This polytope arises, for instance, in pooling problems with
fixed proportions of the inputs at each pool. We show that it inherits many
characteristics from BQP, among them a wide range of facet classes and
operations which are facet preserving. Moreover, we characterize various cases
in which the polytope is completely described via the relaxation-linearization
inequalities. The special structure induced by the additional multiple-choice
constraints also allows for new facet-preserving symmetries as well as lifting
operations. Furthermore, it leads to several novel facet classes as well as
extensions of these via lifting. We additionally give computationally tractable
exact separation algorithms, most of which run in polynomial time. Finally, we
demonstrate the strength of both the inherited and the new facet classes in
computational experiments on random as well as real-world problem instances. It
turns out that in many cases we can close the optimality gap almost completely
via cutting planes alone, and, consequently, solution times can be reduced
significantly.

measures for the unfairness of a machine learning (ML) system. As these
measures all capture intuitively desirable aspects of a fair system, choosing
""the one true"" measure is not possible, and instead a reasonable approach is to
minimize a weighted combination of measures. However, this simply raises the
question of how to choose the weights. Here, we formulate Legally Grounded
Fairness Objectives (LGFO), which uses signals from the legal system to
non-arbitrarily measure the social cost of a specific degree of unfairness. The
LGFO is the expected damages under a putative lawsuit that might be awarded to
those who were wrongly classified, in the sense that the ML system made a
decision different to that which would have be made under the court's preferred
measure. Notably, the two quantities necessary to compute the LGFO, the court's
preferences about fairness measures, and the expected damages, are unknown but
well-defined, and can be estimated by legal advice. Further, as the damages
awarded by the legal system are designed to measure and compensate for the harm
caused to an individual by an unfair classification, the LGFO aligns closely
with society's estimate of the social cost.

considerations. In the existing literature, three disjoint regions of
potentially viable parameter space have been identified. In one of them, all
heavy neutrinos decay shortly before big bang nucleosynthesis. In the other two
regions, one of the heavy neutrinos either decays between BBN and the CMB
decoupling or is quasi-stable. We show that previously unaccounted constraints
from photodisintegration of nuclei practically rule out all relevant decays
that happen between BBN and the CMB decoupling. Quite remarkably, if all heavy
neutrinos decay before BBN, the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be quite
generically explained by low-scale leptogenesis, i.e. without further tuning in
addition to what is needed to avoid experimental and cosmological constraints.
This motivates searches for heavy neutrinos in pion decay experiments.

study, we carry out three-dimensional numerical simulations to realise the
effects of surface deformations on thermocapillary flow instabilities in laser
melting of a metallic alloy with surfactants. Our computational model is based
on the finite-volume method and utilises the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method for
gas-metal interface tracking. Additionally, we employ a dynamically adjusted
heat source model and discuss its influence on numerical predictions of the
melt pool behaviour. Our results demonstrate that including free surface
deformations in numerical simulations enhances the predicted flow instabilities
and, thus, the predicted solid-liquid interface morphologies.

to the lower NOx during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, instead of these
changes of the O$_3$ formation region, the significant elevated O$_3$ in the

nearly all of these planets orbit their host star on eccentric orbits. For
planets up to a few Jupiter masses, eccentric orbits are thought to be the
outcome of planet-planet scattering events taking place after gas dispersal. We
simulate the growth of planets via pebble and gas accretion as well as the
migration of multiple planetary embryos in their gas disc. We then follow the
long-term dynamical evolution of our formed planetary system up to 100 Myr
after gas disc dispersal. We investigate the importance of the initial number
of protoplanetary embryos and different damping rates of eccentricity and
inclination during the gas phase for the final configuration of our planetary
systems. We constrain our model by comparing the final dynamical structure of
our simulated planetary systems to that of observed exoplanet systems. Our
results show that the initial number of planetary embryos has only a minor
impact on the final orbital eccentricity distribution of the giant planets, as
long as damping of eccentricity and inclination is efficient. If damping is
inefficient (slow), systems with a larger initial number of embryos harbor
larger average eccentricities. In addition, for slow damping rates, we observe
that scattering events already during the gas disc phase are common and that
the giant planets formed in these simulations match the observed giant planet
eccentricity distribution best. These simulations also show that massive giant
planets (above Jupiter mass) on eccentric orbits are less likely to host inner
super-Earths as these get lost during the scattering phase, while systems with
less massive giant planets on nearly circular orbits should harbor systems of
inner super-Earths. Finally, our simulations predict that giant planets are on
average not single, but live in multi-planet systems.

partners' preferences and how strongly they commit to a common goal.
Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and
consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for
securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT),
here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for
enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff
structure, in both pairwise and multiparty interactions. Arguably, coordination
is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several
desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual
cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas).
Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that
whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing
coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the
collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how
asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multiparty
interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group
diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for

technological applications, owing to its relevance and potential for optical
and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, there is an active search for
suitable nonlinear material systems with efficient conversion and small
material footprint. Ideally, the material system should allow for
chip-integration and room-temperature operation. Two-dimensional materials are
highly interesting in this regard. Particularly promising is graphene, which
has demonstrated an exceptionally large nonlinearity in the terahertz regime.
Yet, the light-matter interaction length in two-dimensional materials is
inherently minimal, thus limiting the overall nonlinear-optical conversion
efficiency. Here we overcome this challenge using a metamaterial platform that
combines graphene with a photonic grating structure providing field
enhancement. We measure terahertz third-harmonic generation in this
metamaterial and obtain an effective third-order nonlinear susceptibility with
a magnitude as large as 3$\cdot$10$^{-8}$m$^2$/V$^2$, or 21 esu, for a
fundamental frequency of 0.7 THz. This nonlinearity is 50 times larger than
what we obtain for graphene without grating. Such an enhancement corresponds to
third-harmonic signal with an intensity that is three orders of magnitude
larger due to the grating. Moreover, we demonstrate a field conversion
efficiency for the third harmonic of up to $\sim$1% using a moderate field
strength of $\sim$30 kV/cm. Finally we show that harmonics beyond the third are
enhanced even more strongly, allowing us to observe signatures of up to the
9$^{\rm th}$ harmonic. Grating-graphene metamaterials thus constitute an
outstanding platform for commercially viable, CMOS compatible, room
temperature, chip-integrated, THz nonlinear conversion applications.

the onset of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. This is in good agreement with

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of
$10^{15}$ G with a short decay lifetime of less than $10^4$ years. Due to their
extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies
according to their current star-formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize
that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume
to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host
galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and
compare it to observed properties from a sample of \nsecure\ secure FRB hosts.
We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at
$>95\%$ c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however,
this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing limited estimates
for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent
association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be
the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must
account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed
galactocentric offsets.

  In this paper, we were researching dynamic buffer sizing algorithms for
multiple, distributed and independent sources, which reorder event streams,
thus enabling subsequent time-sensitive applications to work correctly. To be
able to evaluate such algorithms, we had to record datasets first. Five novel
dynamic buffer sizing algorithms were implemented and compared to
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. The evaluation has shown that the
use of a dynamic time-out buffering method is preferable over a static buffer.
The higher the variation of the network or other influences in the environment,
the more necessary it becomes to use an algorithm which dynamically adapts its
buffer size. These algorithms are universally applicable, easy to integrate in
existing architectures, and particularly interesting for time-sensitive
applications. Dynamic time-out buffering is still a trade-off between reaction
time and out-of-order event compensation.

memory bandwidth bound and, therefore, ill-suited for scalable performance on
modern many-core and hybrid computing nodes. This weakness can be particularly
limiting when tackling many-query studies, where one needs to run a large

Galerkin, of the Galerkin ROM for LTI dynamical systems which converts the
nature of the ROM problem from memory bandwidth to compute bound. We present
the details of the formulation and its implementation, and demonstrate its
utility through numerical experiments using, as a test case, the simulation of
elastic seismic shear waves in an axisymmetric domain. We quantify and analyze
performance and scaling results for varying numbers of threads and problem
sizes. Finally, we present an end-to-end demonstration of using the rank-2

ROM is one order of magnitude more efficient than the rank-1 Galerkin ROM (the

capture the long-range dependencies among the data on the graph and thus bring
performance improvements. To train a GNN with multiple layers effectively, some
normalization techniques (e.g., node-wise normalization, batch-wise
normalization) are necessary. However, the normalization techniques for GNNs
are highly task-relevant and different application tasks prefer to different
normalization techniques, which is hard to know in advance. To tackle this
deficiency, in this paper, we propose to learn graph normalization by
optimizing a weighted combination of normalization techniques at four different
levels, including node-wise normalization, adjacency-wise normalization,
graph-wise normalization, and batch-wise normalization, in which the
adjacency-wise normalization and the graph-wise normalization are newly
proposed in this paper to take into account the local structure and the global
structure on the graph, respectively. By learning the optimal weights, we are
able to automatically select a single best or a best combination of multiple
normalizations for a specific task. We conduct extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets for different tasks, including node classification, link
prediction, graph classification and graph regression, and confirm that the
learned graph normalization leads to competitive results and that the learned
weights suggest the appropriate normalization techniques for the specific task.

  Stochastic Block Model",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With rapid developments of information and technology, large scale network
data are ubiquitous. In this work we develop a distributed spectral clustering
algorithm for community detection in large scale networks. To handle the
problem, we distribute l pilot network nodes on the master server and the
others on worker servers. A spectral clustering algorithm is first conducted on
the master to select pseudo centers. The indexes of the pseudo centers are then
broadcasted to workers to complete distributed community detection task using a
SVD type algorithm. The proposed distributed algorithm has three merits. First,
the communication cost is low since only the indexes of pseudo centers are
communicated. Second, no further iteration algorithm is needed on workers and
hence it does not suffer from problems as initialization and non-robustness.
Third, both the computational complexity and the storage requirements are much
lower compared to using the whole adjacency matrix. A Python package DCD
(www.github.com/Ikerlz/dcd) is developed to implement the distributed algorithm
for a Spark system. Theoretical properties are provided with respect to the
estimation accuracy and mis-clustering rates. Lastly, the advantages of the
proposed methodology are illustrated by experiments on a variety of synthetic
and empirical datasets.

Such collective dynamics arise from the competition of (i) the self-propulsion
velocity of the particles, (ii) the attractive/repulsive chemically-mediated
interactions between particles and (iii) the flow disturbance they introduce in
the surrounding medium. These three ingredients are directly determined by the
shape and physico-chemical properties of the colloids' surface. Owing to such
link, we adapt a recent and popular kinetic model for dilute suspensions of
chemically-active JPs where the particles' far-field hydrodynamic and chemical
signatures are intrinsically linked and explicitly determined by the design
properties. Using linear stability analysis, we show that self-propulsion can
induce a wave-selective mechanism for certain particles' configurations
consistent with experimental observations. Numerical simulations of the
complete kinetic model are further performed to analyze the relative importance
of chemical and hydrodynamic interactions in the nonlinear dynamics. Our
results show that regular patterns in the particle density are promoted by
chemical signaling but prevented by the strong fluid flows generated
collectively by the polarized particles, regardless of their chemotactic or
antichemotactic nature (i.e. for both puller and pusher swimmers).

colony building animals that feed by catching food particles brought by
currents. Because of their flexible skeleton, they bend and sway back and forth
with the wave swell. In addition to this low-frequency sway of the whole
colony, branches of A. bipinnata vibrate at high frequency with small amplitude
and transverse to the flow as the wave flow speed peaks. In this paper, we
investigate the origin of these yet unexplained vibrations and consider their
effect on soft corals. Estimation of dynamical variables along with finite
element implementation of the wake-oscillator model favour vortex-induced
vibrations (VIVs) as the most probable origin of the observed rapid dynamics.
To assess the impact of the dynamics on filter feeding, we simulated particles
advected by the flow around a circular cylinder and calculated the capture rate
with an in-house monolithic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) finite element
solver and Python code. We observe that vibrating cylinders can capture up to
40% more particles than fixed ones at frequency lock-in. Therefore, VIVs
plausibly offer soft corals a better food capture.

large amount of existing content (e.g. over 5M articles in English Wikipedia),
deciding what to edit next can be difficult, both for experienced users that
usually have a huge backlog of articles to prioritize, as well as for newcomers
who that might need guidance in selecting the next article to contribute.
Therefore, helping editors to find relevant articles should improve their
performance and help in the retention of new editors. In this paper, we address
the problem of recommending relevant articles to editors. To do this, we
develop a scalable system on top of Graph Convolutional Networks and Doc2Vec,
learning how to represent Wikipedia articles and deliver personalized
recommendations for editors. We test our model on editors' histories,
predicting their most recent edits based on their prior edits. We outperform
competitive implicit-feedback collaborative-filtering methods such as WMRF
based on ALS, as well as a traditional IR-method such as content-based
filtering based on BM25. All of the data used on this paper is publicly
available, including graph embeddings for Wikipedia articles, and we release
our code to support replication of our experiments. Moreover, we contribute
with a scalable implementation of a state-of-art graph embedding algorithm as
current ones cannot efficiently handle the sheer size of the Wikipedia graph.

an observational study through matching or weighting is an accepted method to
control for confounding due to these variables when estimating the association
between an exposure and outcome and to reduce the degree of dependence on
certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity in practice,
these procedures cannot be immediately applied to datasets with missing values.
Multiple imputation of the missing data is a popular approach to account for
missing values while preserving the number of units in the dataset and
accounting for the uncertainty in the missing values. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching and weighting software that
can be easily implemented with multiply imputed datasets. In this paper, we
review this problem and suggest a framework to map out the matching and
weighting multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as well as the best practices
to assess balance in these datasets after matching and weighting. We also
illustrate these approaches using a companion package for R, MatchThem.

relationships. A management consulting firm wishes to both accept the best new
workers but also place its current affiliated workers at strong firms.
Similarly, a research university wishes to hire strong job market candidates
while also placing its own candidates at strong peer universities. We model
this affiliate matching problem in a generalization of the classic stable
marriage setting by permitting firms to state preferences over not just which
workers to whom they are matched, but also to which firms their affiliated
workers are matched. Based on results from a human survey, we find that
participants (acting as firms) give preference to their own affiliate workers
in surprising ways that violate some assumptions of the classical stable
marriage problem. This motivates a nuanced discussion of how stability could be
defined in affiliate matching problems; we give an example of a marketplace
which admits a stable match under one natural definition of stability, and does
not for that same marketplace under a different, but still natural, definition.
We conclude by setting a research agenda toward the creation of a centralized
clearing mechanism in this general setting.

matter, deflecting their trajectories, delaying their arrival and occasionally
producing multiple images. In theories beyond general relativity (GR), new
gravitational degrees of freedom add an extra layer of complexity and richness
to GW lensing. We develop a formalism to compute GW propagation beyond GR over
general space-times, including kinetic interactions with new fields. Our
framework relies on identifying the dynamical propagation eigenstates (linear
combinations of the metric and additional fields) at leading order in a
short-wave expansion. We determine these eigenstates and the conditions under
which they acquire a different propagation speed around a lens. Differences in
speed between eigenstates cause birefringence phenomena, including time delays
between the metric polarizations (orthogonal superpositions of $h_+,h_\times$)
observable without an electromagnetic counterpart. In particular, GW echoes are
produced when the accumulated delay is larger than the signal's duration, while
shorter time delays produce a scrambling of the wave-form. We also describe the
formation of GW shadows as non-propagating metric components are sourced by the
background of the additional fields around the lens. As an example, we apply
our methodology to quartic Horndeski theories with Vainshtein screening and
show that birefringence effects probe a region of the parameter space
complementary to the constraints from the multi-messenger event GW170817. In
the future, identified strongly lensed GWs and binary black holes merging near

Our contribution is three-fold. First, inspired by the spirit of universal

generate stylized images that appearance similarity to the style images.
Second, we build up a robust cardiac segmentation model based on the U-Net

network for removing appearance shift and the segmentation network. Third, we
investigate test-time augmentation to explore transformed versions of the
stylized image for prediction and the results are merged. Notably, our proposed

our methods are promising and generic for generalizing deep segmentation

dimensionality; and it is {\em data independent}. This paper shows that
Isolation Distributional Kernel (IDK), which is based on a {\em data dependent}
point kernel, addresses both key issues. We demonstrate IDK's efficacy and
efficiency as a new tool for kernel based anomaly detection for both point and
group anomalies. Without explicit learning, using IDK alone outperforms
existing kernel based point anomaly detector OCSVM and other kernel mean
embedding methods that rely on Gaussian kernel. For group anomaly detection,we
introduce an IDK based detector called IDK$^2$. It reformulates the problem of
group anomaly detection in input space into the problem of point anomaly
detection in Hilbert space, without the need for learning. IDK$^2$ runs orders
of magnitude faster than group anomaly detector OCSMM.We reveal for the first

derived and the associated multiple matrix-variate optimization problems can be
substantially simplified. In this paper, several specific examples are given,
which are essentially open problems. Firstly, we investigate multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU- MIMO) uplink communications under various
power constraints. Using the proposed framework, the optimal structures of the
precoding matrices at each user under various power constraints can be derived.
Secondly, we considered the optimization of the signal compression matrices at
each sensor under various power constraints in distributed sensor networks.
Finally, we investigate the transceiver optimization for multi-hop
amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relaying networks with imperfect channel state
information (CSI) under various power constraints. At the end of this paper,
several simulation results are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the
proposed theoretical results.

challenge for creative evolutionary and generative systems research. Prior work
has tended to focus on feature measures of the artefact, such as symmetry,
complexity and coherence. However, research models from Psychology suggest that
human aesthetic experiences encapsulate factors beyond the artefact, making
accurate computational models very difficult to design. The interactive genetic
algorithm (IGA) circumvents the problem through human-in-the-loop, subjective
evaluation of aesthetics, but is limited due to user fatigue and small
population sizes. In this paper we look at how recent advances in deep learning
can assist in automating personal aesthetic judgement. Using a leading artist's
computer art dataset, we investigate the relationship between image measures,
such as complexity, and human aesthetic evaluation. We use dimension reduction
methods to visualise both genotype and phenotype space in order to support the
exploration of new territory in a generative system. Convolutional Neural
Networks trained on the artist's prior aesthetic evaluations are used to
suggest new possibilities similar or between known high quality
genotype-phenotype mappings. We integrate this classification and discovery
system into a software tool for evolving complex generative art and design.

heteroclinic orbits, closed orbits, can be considered as skeletons or scaffolds
upon which the full dynamics of the system is built. In particular, as
demonstrated in previous publications [Phys. Rev. E 95, 062224 (2017), Phys.
Rev. E 97, 022216 (2018)], the determination of homoclinic orbits is sufficient
for the exact calculation of classical action functions of unstable periodic
orbits, which have potential applications in semiclassical trace formulas. Here
this previous work is generalized to the calculation of classical action
functions of arbitrary trajectory segments in multidimensional chaotic
Hamiltonian systems. The unstable trajectory segments' actions are expanded
into linear combinations of homoclinic orbit actions that shadow them in a
piece-wise fashion. The results lend themselves to an approximation with
controllable exponentially small errors, and which demonstrates an
exponentially rapid loss of memory of a segment's classical action to its past
and future. Furthermore, it does not require an actual construction of the
trajectory segment, only its Markov partition sequence. An alternative point of
view is also proposed which partitions the trajectories into short segments of
transient visits to the neighborhoods of successive periodic orbits, giving
rise to a periodic orbit expansion scheme which is equivalent to the homoclinic
orbit expansion. This clearly demonstrates that homoclinic and periodic orbits
are equally valid skeletal structures for the tessellation of phase-space
dynamics.

discriminative features for multi-class classification. A vast majority of
existing LDA algorithms are prone to be dominated by the class with very large
deviation from the others, i.e., edge class, which occurs frequently in
multi-class classification. First, the existence of edge classes often makes
the total mean biased in the calculation of between-class scatter matrix.
Second, the exploitation of l2-norm based between-class distance criterion
magnifies the extremely large distance corresponding to edge class. In this
regard, a novel self-weighted robust LDA with l21-norm based pairwise
between-class distance criterion, called SWRLDA, is proposed for multi-class
classification especially with edge classes. SWRLDA can automatically avoid the
optimal mean calculation and simultaneously learn adaptive weights for each
class pair without setting any additional parameter. An efficient re-weighted
algorithm is exploited to derive the global optimum of the challenging l21-norm
maximization problem. The proposed SWRLDA is easy to implement, and converges
fast in practice. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWRLDA performs
favorably against other compared methods on both synthetic and real-world

irrelevant and redundant features in the dataset. The objective of this study
is to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of some feature selection
approaches namely, wrapper-based and filter-based modeling approaches. To
achieve that, a hybrid of feature selection algorithm in combination with

hybrid intrusion detection modeling with a decision tree algorithm to guide the

medical codes in a particular visit; and medical code - a specific record in
the form of medical codes. As EHRs begin to amass in millions, the potential
benefits, which these data might hold for medical research and medical outcome
prediction, are staggering - including, for example, predicting future
admissions to hospitals, diagnosing illnesses or determining the efficacy of
medical treatments. Each of these analytics tasks requires a domain knowledge

  in Mass Spectrometry Images",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV q-bio.QM stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The computational analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data aims at
the identification of interesting mass co-localizations and the visualization
of their lateral distribution in the sample, usually a tissue cross section.
But as the morphological structure of tissues and the different kinds of mass
co-localization naturally show a huge diversity, the selection and tuning of
the computational method is a time-consuming effort. In this work we address
the special problem of computationally grouping mass channel images according
to their similarities in their lateral distribution patterns. Such an analysis
is driven by the idea, that groups of molecules that feature a similar
distribution pattern may have a functional relation. But the selection of the
similarity function and other parameters is often done by a time-consuming and
unsatsifactory trial and error. We propose a new flexible workflow scheme
called SoRC (sum of ranked cluster indices) for automating this tuning step and
making it much more efficient. We test SoRC using three different data sets
acquired from the lab for three different kinds of samples (barley seed, mouse
bladder tissue, human PXE skin). We show, that SORC can be applied to score and
visualize the results obtained with the applied methods in short time without
too much effort. In our application example, the SoRC results for the three
data sets reveal that a) some well-known similarity functions are suited to
achieve good results for all three data sets and b) for the MSI data featuring
a higher degree of irregularity improved results can be achieved by applying
non-standard similarity functions. The SoRC scores computed with our approach
indicate that an automated testing and scoring of different methods for mass
channel image grouping can improve the final outcome of a study by finally
selecting the methods of the highest scores.

calculus I will present, called SC2Int, is a sequent calculus for the
bi-intuitionistic logic 2Int. Calculi for this logic represent a kind of
bilateralist reasoning, since they do not only internalize processes of
verification or provability but also the dual processes in terms of
falsification or what is called dual provability. A normal form theorem for a
natural deduction calculus of 2Int has already been stated, in this paper I
want to prove a cut-elimination theorem for SC2Int, i.e. if successful, this
would extend the results existing so far.

has recently been shown that ultrafast ultrasound imaging can be used to record
and analyze the mechanical response of individual MUs using blind source
separation. In this work, we present an alternative method - a deep learning
pipeline - to identify active MUs in ultrasound image sequences, including
segmentation of their territories and signal estimation of their mechanical
responses (twitch train). We train and evaluate the model using simulated data
mimicking the complex activation pattern of tens of activated MUs with
overlapping territories and partially synchronized activation patterns. Using a
slow fusion approach (based on 3D CNNs), we transform the spatiotemporal image
sequence data to 2D representations and apply a deep neural network
architecture for segmentation. Next, we employ a second deep neural network
architecture for signal estimation. The results show that the proposed pipeline
can effectively identify individual MUs, estimate their territories, and
estimate their twitch train signal at low contraction forces. The framework can
retain spatio-temporal consistencies and information of the mechanical response
of MU activity even when the ultrasound image sequences are transformed into a
2D representation for compatibility with more traditional computer vision and
image processing techniques. The proposed pipeline is potentially useful to
identify simultaneously active MUs in whole muscles in ultrasound image
sequences of voluntary skeletal muscle contractions at low force levels.

online marketplaces, news, and social media, output ranked lists of content,
products, and sometimes, people. Credit ratings, standardized tests, risk
assessments output only a score, but are also used implicitly for ranking. Bias
in such ranking systems, especially among the top ranks, can worsen social and
economic inequalities, polarize opinions, and reinforce stereotypes. On the
other hand, a bias correction for minority groups can cause more harm if
perceived as favoring group-fair outcomes over meritocracy. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of underranking in group-fair rankings, which was not
addressed in previous work. Most group-fair ranking algorithms post-process a
given ranking and output a group-fair ranking. We define underranking based on
how close the group-fair rank of each item is to its original rank, and prove a
lower bound on the trade-off achievable for simultaneous underranking and group
fairness in ranking. We give a fair ranking algorithm that takes any given
ranking and outputs another ranking with simultaneous underranking and group
fairness guarantees comparable to the lower bound we prove. Our algorithm works
with group fairness constraints for any number of groups. Our experimental
results confirm the theoretical trade-off between underranking and group
fairness, and also show that our algorithm achieves the best of both when
compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

Moreover, images from different locations are utilized via imaging fusion for

realizing different images at diverse location for further image fusion. For
realizing the light spot which is more matched with the Ultrasonic transducer
detection area, we specially design a light adjust unit. Moreover, due to no
displacement among the images, there is no need to execute image register
process. The program execution time be reduced, greatly. Approach: mechanical
design; Montel carol simulation; no-registration image fusion; Spot
compression. Results: Multiple PA images with different optical illumination
areas were acquired. After image fusion, we obtained fused PA images with
higher signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and image fidelity than each single PA
image. A quantitative comparison shows that the SNR of fused image is improved
by 36.06% in agar-milk phantom, and 44.69% in chicken breast phantom,
respectively. Conclusions: In this paper, the light scanning adjustable
hand-held PA imaging probe is proposed, which can realize PA imaging with
different illumination positions via adjusting the optical unit.

order to correctly approximate the flow, chemical reactions, and behavior of
solid particles. These models, in turn, rely on multiple model parameters,
which are determined through experiments or small-scale simulations and contain
a certain level of uncertainty. The competing effects of transport, particle
physics, and chemistry give rise to various scales and disparate dynamics,
making it a very challenging problem to analyse. Therefore, the steady
combustion process of a single solid particle is considered as a starting point
for this study. As an added complication, the large number of parameters
present in such simulations makes a purely forward approach to sensitivity
analysis very expensive and almost infeasible. Therefore, the use of
adjoint-based algorithms, to identify and quantify the underlying sensitivities
and uncertainties, is proposed. This adjoint framework bears a great advantage
in this case, where a large input space is analysed, since a single forward and
backward sweep provides sensitivity information with respect to all parameters
of interest. In order to investigate the applicability of such methods, both
discrete and continuous adjoints are considered, and compared to the
conventional approaches, such as finite differences, and forward sensitivity
analysis. Various quantities of interest are considered, and sensitivities with
respect to the relevant combustion parameters are reported for two different
freestream compositions, describing air and oxy-atmospheres. This study serves
as a benchmark for future research, where unsteady and finally turbulent cases
will be considered.
