novel classes with few examples. Pre-training based meta-learning methods
effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then
fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,
results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In
this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature
space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes
spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the
feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature
extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during
meta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based
meta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge
(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative
attribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to
learn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype
completion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we
further develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the
mean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.
Extensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate
prototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of
classification accuracy. Our code is available online.

the prethermal state can be characterized by a single slow variable which is
related to the conduction band population. The dynamics of this variable does
not follow the paradigmatic steady relaxation of pre-thermal states: It is
highly nonlinear, with a pronounced speedup once the gap falls below a certain
value. This behavior indicates that non-thermal order can be self-stabilized on
some timescale. It is not reproduced using simple Fermi's golden rule estimate

RVL-BERT achieves competitive results on two challenging visual relationship

generalization of quantum mechanics, based on symplectic structures for normal
states and offering a general setting which is convenient to study the
emergence of macroscopic classical dynamics from microscopic quantum processes.
We propose here a new mathematical approach to Bona's one, with much brother
domain of applicability. It highlights the central role of self-consistency.
This leads to a mathematical framework in which the classical and quantum
worlds are naturally entangled. We build a Poisson bracket for the polynomial
functions on the hermitian weak$^{\ast }$ continuous functionals on any
$C^{\ast }$-algebra. This is reminiscent of a well-known construction for
finite-dimensional Lie algebras. We then restrict this Poisson bracket to
states of this $C^{\ast }$-algebra, by taking quotients with respect to Poisson
ideals. This leads to densely defined symmetric derivations on the commutative
$C^{\ast }$-algebras of real-valued functions on the set of states. Up to a
closure, these are proven to generate $C_{0}$-groups of contractions. As a
matter of fact, in general commutative $C^{\ast }$-algebras, even the
closableness of unbounded symmetric derivations is a non-trivial issue. Some
new mathematical concepts are introduced, which are possibly interesting by
themselves: the convex weak $^{\ast }$ G\^{a}teaux derivative, state-dependent
$C^{\ast }$-dynamical systems and the weak$^{\ast }$-Hausdorff hypertopology, a
new hypertopology used to prove, among other things, that convex weak$^{\ast
}$-compact sets generically have weak$^{\ast }$-dense extreme boundary in
infinite dimension. Our recent results on macroscopic dynamical properties of
lattice-fermion and quantum-spin systems with long-range, or mean-field,

warning to likely exposed individuals, (b) identifying individuals who are
asymptomatic, and (c) prescription of optimal testing when testing capacity is
limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph based SEIR epidemiological model in
order to describe the dynamics of the disease propagation. Our model considers
a dynamic network that accounts for the interactions between individuals over
time, such as the ones obtained by manual or automated contact tracing, and
uses a diffusion-reaction mechanism to describe the state dynamics. This
dynamic graph model helps identify likely exposed/infected individuals to whom
we can provide early warnings, even before they display any symptoms and/or are
asymptomatic. Moreover, when the testing capacity is limited compared to the
population size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and disease
transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging. Thus,
estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk assessment,
as well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing
prescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos
Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to
represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This
design enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and
consequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a
constrained testing budget. These tools can also be used to optimize vaccine
distribution to curb the disease spread when limited vaccines are available. We
present a few simulation results that illustrate the performance of the
proposed framework, and estimate the impact of incomplete contact tracing data.

the study of graph algorithms. The problem of sparsifying a graph while
approximately preserving its cut structure has been extensively studied and has
many applications. In a seminal work, Bencz\'ur and Karger (1996) showed that
given any $n$-vertex undirected weighted graph $G$ and a parameter $\varepsilon
\in (0,1)$, there is a near-linear time algorithm that outputs a weighted
subgraph $G'$ of $G$ of size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ such that the weight
of every cut in $G$ is preserved to within a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-factor in
$G'$. The graph $G'$ is referred to as a {\em $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximate
cut sparsifier} of $G$.
  A natural question is if such cut-preserving sparsifiers also exist for
hypergraphs. Kogan and Krauthgamer (2015) initiated a study of this question
and showed that given any weighted hypergraph $H$ where the cardinality of each
hyperedge is bounded by $r$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find a $(1
\pm \varepsilon)$-approximate cut sparsifier of $H$ of size
$\tilde{O}(\frac{nr}{\varepsilon^2})$. Since $r$ can be as large as $n$, in
general, this gives a hypergraph cut sparsifier of size
$\tilde{O}(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$, which is a factor $n$ larger than the
Bencz\'ur-Karger bound for graphs. It has been an open question whether or not
Bencz\'ur-Karger bound is achievable on hypergraphs. In this work, we resolve
this question in the affirmative by giving a new polynomial-time algorithm for
creating hypergraph sparsifiers of size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$.

loop to VQE that permutes qubits in order to solve for the qubit Hamiltonian
that minimizes long-range correlations in the ground state. The choice of
permutations is based on mutual information, which is a measure of interaction
between electrons in spin-orbitals. Encoding strongly interacting spin-orbitals
into proximal qubits on a quantum chip naturally reduces the circuit depth
needed to prepare the ground state. For representative molecular systems, LiH,
H$_2$, (H$_2$)$_2$, H$_4$, and H$_3^+$, we demonstrate for linear qubit
connectivity that placing entangled qubits in close proximity leads to
shallower depth circuits required to reach a given eigenvalue-eigenvector
accuracy. This approach can be extended to any qubit connectivity and can
significantly reduce the depth required to reach a desired accuracy in VQE.
Moreover, our approach can be applied to other variational quantum algorithms

is a parameter-free method that is strongly robust to noise and prioritizes
predictions with the highest consensus across overlapping masks. All masks are

Callisto migrated outwards according to the ""resonance-locking"" model and
passed through a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Ganymede. Ganymede's orbital

contribution, we study how such features can help in improving the quality of
the solutions returned by the annealer. Specifically, we focus on two of these
features: reverse annealing and h-gain. Reverse annealing (RA) was designed to
allow refining a known solution by backward annealing from a classical state
representing the solution to a mid-anneal point where a transverse field is
present, followed by an ordinary forward anneal, which is hoped to improve on
the previous solution. The h-gain (HG) feature stands for time-dependent gain
in Hamiltonian linear ($h$) biases and was originally developed to help study
freezeout times and phase transitions in spin glasses. Here we apply HG to bias
the quantum state in the beginning of the annealing process towards the known
solution as in the RA case, but using a different apparatus. We also
investigate a hybrid reverse annealing/h-gain schedule, which has a backward
phase resembling an RA step and whose forward phase uses the HG idea. To
optimize the parameters of the schedules, we employ a Bayesian optimization
framework. We test all techniques on a variety of input problems including the
weighted Maximum Cut problem and the weighted Maximum Clique problem. Our
results show that each technique may dominate the others depending on the input
instance, and that the HG technique is a viable alternative to RA for some
problems.

this discovery, we perform a high-resolution gyrokinetic numerical simulation

Landau damping in the dissipation of turbulent energy. We employ the

investigated in recent years. To determine the impact of pruning a group of
filters on a network's accuracy, state-of-the-art pruning methods consistently
assume filters of a CNN are independent. This allows the importance of a group
of filters to be estimated as the sum of importances of individual filters.
However, overparameterization in modern networks results in highly correlated
filters that invalidate this assumption, thereby resulting in incorrect
importance estimates. To address this issue, we propose OrthoReg, a principled
regularization strategy that enforces orthonormality on a network's filters to

determination of group importance estimates, improved trainability of pruned

used for iterative pruning on VGG-13, MobileNet-V1, and ResNet-34, OrthoReg
consistently outperforms five baseline techniques, including the
state-of-the-art, on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. For the recently proposed

early-on in training and can be pruned after a few epochs to minimize training

casting a multiagent decision problem as a cooperation-style game in which
individual agents make local choices to optimize their own local utility

system-level objective is submodular maximization, it is known that if every
agent can observe the action choice of all other agents, then all Nash
equilibria of a large class of resulting games are within a factor of $2$ of
optimal; that is, the price of anarchy is $1/2$. However, little is known if

this, we extend the standard game-theoretic model to one in which a subset of

\emph{isolated} (blind, and also invisible to other agents), and we prove exact
expressions for the price of anarchy as a function of the number of compromised

height. It has become a new norm to utilize CLM provided word embeddings in
downstream tasks such as text classification. However, unless addressed, CLMs
are prone to learn intrinsic gender-bias in the dataset. As a result,
predictions of downstream NLP models can vary noticeably by varying gender
words, such as replacing ""he"" to ""she"", or even gender-neutral words. In this
paper, we focus our analysis on a popular CLM, i.e., BERT. We analyse the
gender-bias it induces in five downstream tasks related to emotion and
sentiment intensity prediction. For each task, we train a simple regressor
utilizing BERT's word embeddings. We then evaluate the gender-bias in
regressors using an equity evaluation corpus. Ideally and from the specific
design, the models should discard gender informative features from the input.
However, the results show a significant dependence of the system's predictions
on gender-particular words and phrases. We claim that such biases can be
reduced by removing genderspecific features from word embedding. Hence, for
each layer in BERT, we identify directions that primarily encode gender
information. The space formed by such directions is referred to as the gender
subspace in the semantic space of word embeddings. We propose an algorithm that
finds fine-grained gender directions, i.e., one primary direction for each BERT
layer. This obviates the need of realizing gender subspace in multiple
dimensions and prevents other crucial information from being omitted.
Experiments show that removing embedding components in such directions achieves
great success in reducing BERT-induced bias in the downstream tasks.

and time-resolved reflectivity (TRR). Perturbation by a femtosecond laser pulse
triggers a modulation of the valence band binding energy at the $\Gamma$-point,
related to the Mott gap, that is consistent with the in-plane CDW amplitude
mode frequency. By contrast, TRR measurements show a modulation of the
differential reflectivity comprised of multiple frequencies belonging to the
distorted CDW lattice modes. Comparison of the temperature dependence of
coherent and spontaneous phonons across the CDW transition shows that the
amplitude mode intensity is more easily suppressed during perturbation of the

pyrochlore Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$, an exemplary realization of a material whose
properties are dominated by competition between magnetic dipolar and electric
quadrupolar correlations. The dipolar and quadrupolar correlations evolve over
three distinct regimes that we characterize via heat capacity, elastic and
inelastic neutron scattering. In the first regime, above $T^*=1.1$ K,
significant quadrupolar correlations lead to an intense inelastic mode that
cannot be accounted for within a scenario with solely magnetic dipole-dipole
correlations. The onset of extended dipole correlations occurs in the
intermediate regime, between $T^*=1.1$ K and $T_c = 0.25$ K, with the formation
of a collective paramagnetic state characterized by extended ferromagnetic
canted spin ice domains. Here, long-range order is impeded not only by the
usual frustration operating in classical spin ice systems, but also by a
competition between dipolar and quadrupolar correlations. Finally, in the
lowest temperature regime, below $T_c=0.25$ K, there is an abrupt and
significant increase in the dipole ordered moment. The majority of the ordered
moment remains tied up in the ferromagnetic spin ice-like state, but an
additional $\mathbf{k}=(0,0,1)$ antiferromagnetic order parameter also
develops. Simultaneously, the spectral weight of the inelastic mode, which is a
proxy for the quadrupolar correlations, is observed to drop, indicating that
dipole order ultimately wins out. Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ is therefore a remarkable
platform to study intertwined dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in a
magnetically frustrated system and provides important insights into the physics
of the whole family of terbium pyrochlores.

a unifying theoretical analysis of a fairly general class of SCP procedures for

metrics obtained over a weighted graph excluding a fixed minor, has been an
important research direction since the fundamental work of Robertson and
Seymour. A fundamental idea that helps both to understand the structural
properties of these metrics and lead to strong algorithmic results is to
construct a ""small-complexity"" graph that approximately preserves distances
between pairs of points of the metric. We show the two following structural
results for minor-free metrics:
  1. Construction of a light subset spanner. Given a subset of vertices called
terminals, and $\epsilon$, in polynomial time we construct a subgraph that
preserves all pairwise distances between terminals up to a multiplicative
$1+\epsilon$ factor, of total weight at most $O_{\epsilon}(1)$ times the weight
of the minimal Steiner tree spanning the terminals.
  2. Construction of a stochastic metric embedding into low treewidth graphs
with expected additive distortion $\epsilon D$. Namely, given a minor free
graph $G=(V,E,w)$ of diameter $D$, and parameter $\epsilon$, we construct a
distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over dominating metric embeddings into
treewidth-$O_{\epsilon}(\log n)$ graphs such that the additive distortion is at
most $\epsilon D$.
  One of our important technical contributions is a novel framework that allows
us to reduce \emph{both problems} to problems on simpler graphs of bounded
diameter. Our results have the following algorithmic consequences: (1) the
first efficient approximation scheme for subset TSP in minor-free metrics; (2)
the first approximation scheme for vehicle routing with bounded capacity in
minor-free metrics; (3) the first efficient approximation scheme for vehicle
routing with bounded capacity on bounded genus metrics.

candidates for detecting Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and the related
non-linear effects in electronics and optics due to the large Berry curvature
concentrated around the Weyl nodes. And yet, linearized models of isolated
tilted Weyl cones only realize a diagonal non-zero BCD tensor which sum to zero
in the model of WSM with multiple Weyl nodes in the presence of mirror
symmetry. On the other hand, recent \textit{ab initio} work has found that
realistic WSMs like TaAs-type or MoTe$_2$-type compounds, which have mirror
symmetry, indeed show an off-diagonal BCD tensor with an enhanced magnitude for
its non-zero components. So far, there is a lack of theoretical work addressing
this contradiction for 3D WSMs. In this paper, we systematically study the BCD
in 3D WSMs using lattice Weyl Hamiltonians, which go beyond the linearized
models. We find that the non-zero BCD and its related important features for
these WSMs do not rely on the contribution from the Weyl nodes. Instead, they
are dependent on the part of the Fermi surface that lies \textit{between} the
Weyl nodes, in the region of the reciprocal space where neighboring Weyl cones
overlap. For large enough chemical potential such Fermi surfaces are present in
the lattice Weyl Hamiltonians as well as in the realistic WSMs. We also show
that, a lattice Weyl Hamitonian with a non-zero chiral chemical potential for
the Weyl cones can also support dips or peaks in the off-diagonal components of
the BCD tensor near the Weyl nodes themselves, consistent with recent
\textit{ab initio} work.

a high ratio of alpha elements to iron, [alpha/Fe]. Blue-sequence stars are

average velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{\rm{CII}}$~23-38 km/s with the highest
value belonging to the highly-structured Disturbed Disk stage. Low resolution
observations tend to overestimate $\sigma_{\rm CII}$ values due to beam
smearing effects that depend on the specific galaxy structure. For an angular

source for the velocity dispersion is due to gravitational processes, such as

observed in these stars may be the result of accretion of water-rich rocky
bodies. We obtained far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of WD
J204713.76-125908.9 using the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph on-board the Hubble

Ni. The abundance ratios are consistent with the steady state accretion of
exo-planetesimal debris rich in the volatile elements carbon and oxygen, and
the transitional element sulphur, by factors of seventeen, two, and four
respectively compared to bulk Earth. The parent body has a composition akin to
Solar System carbonaceous chondrites, and the inferred minimum mass, $1.6
\times 10^{20}$ g, is comparable to an asteroid 23 km in radius. We model the

study the impact of disc-induced migrations on the TTV signal of pairs of
planets that enter a resonant configuration. We show that disc-induced
migration creates a correlation between the amplitude and the period of the
TTVs. We study the case of K2-24, a system of two planets whose period ratio
indicates that they are in or near the 2:1 MMR, with non-zero eccentricities
and large-amplitude TTVs. We show that a simple disc-induced migration cannot
reproduce the observed TTVs, and we propose a formation scenario in which the
capture in resonance occurring during migration in a disc with strong
eccentricity damping is followed by eccentricity excitation during the
dispersal of the disc, assisted by a third planet whose presence has been
suggested by radial velocity observations. This scenario accounts for the
eccentricities of the two planets and their period ratio, and accurately
reproduces the amplitude and period of the TTVs. It allows for a unified view
of the formation and evolution history of K2-24, from disc-induced migration to

significant variability in our analysis. The observed variability likely
originates from scintillation on short ($\sim$week) timescales, and

approach to infer electron-boson coupling is through the relaxation dynamics of
optically-excited electrons, and the characteristic timescales of energy

the effective electronic temperature. Such a description requires that
thermodynamic quantities are well-defined, an assumption that is generally
violated at early delays. Additionally, precise estimation of the non-thermal

challenging. We perform TR-ARPES on graphite and show that Boltzmann rate
equations can be used to calculate the time-dependent electronic occupation
function, and reproduce experimental features given by non-thermal electron
occupation. Using this model, we define a quantitative measure of non-thermal
electron occupation and use it to define distinct phases of electron relaxation
in the fluence-delay phase space. More generally, this approach can be used to
inform the non-thermal-to-thermal crossover in pump-probe experiments.

Our model produces a reasonable match to the observed ultraviolet luminosity

assuming that the UV luminosity function is dominated by recent star formation.
We find that cosmic variance in the UVLF is dominated by the variance in the
underlying dark matter halo population, and not by differences in halo
accretion or the specifics of our stellar feedback model. We also find that
cosmic variance dominates over Poisson noise for future high-$z$ surveys except
for the brightest sources or at very high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 12$). We
provide a linear approximation of cosmic variance for a variety of redshifts,

However, the wide band nature of the beam available at long baseline neutrino

well-suited at higher energies as well. In this work, we utilize a beam that
provides high statistics at higher energies which is referred to as the

not only the usual oscillation channels but also the $\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$

stellar models limit the mass of any black hole (BH) remnant to about $40 - 50$
M$_\odot$, more massive BHs can be produced dynamically through repeated
mergers in the core of a dense star cluster. The process is limited by the
recoil kick (due to anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation) imparted
to merger remnants, which can escape the parent cluster, thereby terminating
growth. We study the role of the host cluster metallicity and escape speed in
the buildup of massive BHs through repeated mergers. Almost independent of host
metallicity, we find that a BBH of about $150$ M$_\odot$ could be formed
dynamically in any star cluster with escape speed $\gtrsim 200$ km s$^{-1}$, as
found in galactic nuclear star clusters as well as the most massive globular
clusters and super star clusters. Using an inspiral-only waveform, we compute
the detection probability for different primary masses ($\ge 60$ M$_\odot$) as
a function of secondary mass and find that the detection probability increases
with secondary mass and decreases for larger primary mass and redshift. Future
additional detections of massive BBH mergers will be of fundamental importance

theories. We show that theories with a joint state space given by the minimal
or the maximal tensor product are inferior to quantum theory, before
considering other tensor products in theories whose elementary systems have
various two-dimensional state spaces. For these, we find no theories that
outperform quantum theory in the adaptive CHSH game and prove that it is
impossible to recover the quantum performance in various cases. This is the
first step towards a general solution that, if successful, will have
wide-ranging consequences, in particular, enabling an experiment that could
rule out all theories in which the set of realisable correlations does not
coincide with the quantum set.

well-studied deep fields. These fields have deep images in multiple UV/optical
bands, including a narrow NB816 band that has allowed an efficient selection of
LAE candidates at $z\approx5.7$. Our sample consists of 260 LAEs and covers a
total effective area of more than two square degrees on the sky. This is so far
the largest (spectroscopically confirmed) sample of LAEs at this redshift. We
use the secure redshifts and narrowband photometry to measure Ly$\alpha$
luminosities. We find that these LAEs span a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity range of
$\sim 2\times10^{42} - 5\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and include some of the
most luminous galaxies known at $z \ge 5.7$ in terms of Ly$\alpha$ luminosity.
Most of them have rest-frame equivalent widths between 20 and 300 \r{A}, and
more luminous Ly$\alpha$ emission lines tend to have broader line widths. We
detect a clear offset of $\sim20$ \r{A} between the observed Ly$\alpha$
wavelength distribution and the NB816 filter transmission curve, which can be
explained by the intergalactic medium absorption of continua blueward of
Ly$\alpha$ in the high-redshift spectra. This sample is being used to study the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function and galaxy properties at $z\approx5.7$.

external in-band interference in terms of packet collisions which may
substantially degrade the system performance. In order to enhance the
performance in such cases, the telegram splitting (TS) method has been proposed
recently. This approach exploits the typical burstiness of the interference via
forward error correction (FEC) and offers a substantial performance improvement
compared to other methods for packet transmissions in LPWA networks. While it
has been already demonstrated that the TS method benefits from knowledge on the
current interference state at the receiver side, corresponding practical
receiver algorithms of high performance are still missing. The modeling of the
bursty interference via Markov chains leads to the optimal detector in terms of
a-posteriori symbol error probability. However, this solution requires a high
computational complexity, assumes an a-priori knowledge on the interference
characteristics and lacks flexibility. We propose a further developed scheme
with increased flexibility and introduce an approach to reduce its complexity
while maintaining a close-to-optimum performance. In particular, the proposed
low complexity solution substantially outperforms existing practical methods in
terms of packet error rate and therefore is highly beneficial for practical
LPWA network scenarios.

manipulation of devices such as medical implants and microrobots. It is
comprised of three orthogonal nested solenoids with a ferromagnetic core at the
center. Electrical current within the solenoids leads to Joule heating,
resulting in undesired temperature increase within the Omnimagnet. If the
temperature exceeds the melting point of the wire insulation, device failure
will occur. Thus, a study of heat transfer within an Omnimagnet is a necessity,
particularly to maximize the performance of the device. For the first time, a
transient heat transfer model, that incorporates all three heat transfer modes,
is proposed and validated with experimental data for an Omnimagnet with maximum
root mean square error equal to 8${\%}$ (4$^{\circ}$C). This transient model is
not computationally expensive. It is relatively easy to apply to Omnimagnets
with different structures. The accuracy of this model depends on the accuracy
of the input data. The code is applied to calculate the maximum safe
operational time at a fixed input current or the maximum safe input current for
a fixed time interval. The maximum safe operational time and maximum safe input
current depend on size and structure of the Omnimagnet and the lowest melting
point of all the Omnimagnet materials. A parametric study shows that increasing
convective heat transfer during cooling, and during heating with low input
currents, is an effective method to increase the maximum operational time of
the Omnimagnet.The thermal model is also presented in a state-space equation
format that can be used in a real-time Kalman filter current controller to
avoid device failure due to excessive heating.

explore additional constraints on the initial conditions of the pre-impact

lightcurve using a layer of dirty ice with an ice concentration that increases
with depth, a layer of pure regolith, and a layer of material at about 6 meters
below the lunar surface that would otherwise have been visible in the plume but
has a high enough tensile strength to resist excavation. Among a few possible
materials, a mixture of regolith and ice with a sufficiently high ice
concentration could plausibly produce such a behavior. The vertical albedo
profiles used in the best fit model allows us to calculate a pre-impact mass of
water ice within Cabeus crater of $5 \pm 3.0 \times 10^{11}$ kg and a mass
concentration of water in the lunar sediment of $8.2 \pm 0.001$ %wt, assuming a

(UV) broad emission lines (BELs). An excess of redshifted emission has been
previously shown to occur in the BELs of radio loud quasars and is most extreme
in certain blazars. Paradoxically, blazars are objects that are characterized
by a highly relativistic blue-shifted outflow towards Earth. We show that the
red emitting gas resides in a very broad component (VBC) that is typical of
Population B quasars that are defined by a wide H$\beta$ BEL profile.
Empirically, we find that RA BEL blazars have both low Eddington rates
($\lesssim1\%$) and an inordinately large (order unity) ratio of long term time
averaged jet power to accretion luminosity. The latter circumstance has been
previously shown to be associated with a depressed extreme UV ionizing
continuum. Both properties conspire to produce a low flux of ionizing photons,
two orders of magnitude less than typical Population B quasars. We use CLOUDY
models to demonstrate that a weak ionizing flux is required for gas near the
central black hole to be optimally ionized to radiate BELs with high efficiency
(most quasars over-ionize nearby gas, resulting in low radiative efficiency).
The large gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler shift results in a VBC
that is redshifted by $\sim 2000 -5000$~km~s$^{-1}$ with a correspondingly
large line width. The RA BELs result from an enhanced efficiency (relative to
typical Population B quasars) to produce a luminous, redshifted VBC near the
central black hole.

Chambers (TPCs), based on the Linearly Graded Silicon Photomultiplier
(LG-SiPM). This is a single photon-sensitive detector with excellent timing and
2D position resolution developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento (FBK). The
LG-SiPM produces time-varying voltage signals that are used to reconstruct the
3D position and energy of ionisation tracks generated inside the TPC. The TPC
used in this work contained room-temperature CF$_4$ gas at a pressure of 100
mbar, with two THGEMs to produce secondary scintillation light. A collimated
$^{241}$Am source (Q$_\alpha$ = 5.486 MeV) was used to produce the ionisation
tracks. The successful reconstruction of these tracks is demonstrated, and the
consistency of the methodology characterised through varying the geometry of
the tracks within the TPC. Energy reconstruction and deposition studies are
also described, demonstrating the feasibility of the LG-SiPM as a potential
option for optical TPC readout.

that the dynamics of such a nonlinear dynamical system is toward minimizing a
global cost function which is equivalent with the spin model Hamiltonian. Here,
we introduce a minimal dynamical model for a network of dissipatively coupled
optical oscillators and prove that the dynamics of such a system is governed by
a Lyapunov function that serves as a cost function for the system. This cost
function is in general a function of both phases and intensities of the
oscillators and depends strongly on the pump parameter. In case of bipartite
network topologies, the amplitudes of the oscillators become identical in the
steady state and the cost function reduces to the XY Hamiltonian. In the
general case for non-trivial network topologies, however, the cost function
approaches the XY Hamiltonian only in the strong pump limit. We show that by
adiabatically tuning the pump parameter, the network can largely avoid trapping
into the local minima of the governing cost function and stabilize into the
ground state of the associated XY Hamiltonian. These results show the great
potential of laser networks for unconventional computing.

to learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to
incorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We
demonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying
cancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of
interest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors
of 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports. For the specific task of
classifying cancer site, we are able to identify metastasis, reports involving
lymph nodes, and discussion of multiple cancer sites as responsible for many of
the classification mistakes, and observe that the extent and types of mistakes
vary systematically with cancer site (e.g., breast, lung, and prostate). When
combining across three of the tasks, our model classifies 50% of the reports
with an accuracy greater than 95% for three of the six tasks\edit, and greater
than 85% for all six tasks on the retained samples. Furthermore, we show that
LIME provides a better determinant of classification than measures of word
occurrence alone. By combining a deep abstaining classifier with feature
identification using LIME, we are able to identify concepts responsible for
both correctness and abstention when classifying cancer sites from pathology

significant, presumably because words are assessed in context and have been

interpretability, not just to understand a particular result (classification,
detection, etc.) but also for humans to take action based on that result.
Black-box machine learning model interpretation has been studied, but recent
work has focused on validation and improving model performance. In this work,
an actionable interpretation of black-box machine learning models is presented.
The proposed technique focuses on the extraction of actionable measures to help
users make a decision or take an action. Actionable interpretation can be
implemented in most traditional black-box machine learning models. It uses the
already trained model, used training data, and data processing techniques to
extract actionable items from the model outcome and its time-series inputs. An
implementation of the actionable interpretation is shown with a use case:
dementia-related agitation prediction and the ambient environment. It is shown
that actionable items can be extracted, such as the decreasing of in-home light
level, which is triggering an agitation episode. This use case of actionable

variables when there is no group structure known \textit{a priori}. It is being
increasingly used in bioinformatics, text analytics, etc. Previously,
biclustering has been introduced in a model-based clustering framework by
utilizing a structure similar to a mixture of factor analyzers. In such models,
observed variables $\mathbf{X}$ are modelled using a latent variable
$\mathbf{U}$ that is assumed to be from $N(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$. Clustering
of variables is introduced by imposing constraints on the entries of the factor
loading matrix to be 0 and 1 that results in a block diagonal covariance
matrices. However, this approach is overly restrictive as off-diagonal elements
in the blocks of the covariance matrices can only be 1 which can lead to
unsatisfactory model fit on complex data. Here, the latent variable
$\mathbf{U}$ is assumed to be from a $N(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{T})$ where
$\mathbf{T}$ is a diagonal matrix. This ensures that the off-diagonal terms in
the block matrices within the covariance matrices are non-zero and not
restricted to be 1. This leads to a superior model fit on complex data. A
family of models are developed by imposing constraints on the components of the
covariance matrix. For parameter estimation, an alternating expectation
conditional maximization (AECM) algorithm is used. Finally, the proposed method
is illustrated using simulated and real datasets.

multifield cosmological models, which decompose naturally into visible and
Hessian (a.k.a. 'hidden') symmetries. While visible symmetries correspond to
those infinitesimal isometries of the Riemannian target space of the scalar
field map which preserve the scalar potential, Hessian symmetries have a much
deeper theory. The latter correspond to Hesse functions, defined as solutions
of the so-called Hesse equation of the target space. By definition, a Hesse
manifold is a Riemannian manifold which admits nontrivial Hesse functions --
not to be confused with a Hessian manifold (the latter being a Riemannian
manifold whose metric is locally the Hessian of a function). All Hesse
$n$-manifolds ${\cal M}$ are non-compact and characterized by their index,
defined as the dimension of the space of Hesse functions, which carries a
natural symmetric bilinear pairing. The Hesse index is bounded from above by
$n+1$ and, when the metric is complete, this bound is attained iff ${\cal M}$
is a Poincar\'e ball, in which case the space of Hesse functions identifies
with $\mathbb{R}^{1,n}$ through an isomorphism constructed from the Weierstrass
map. More generally, any elementary hyperbolic space form is a complete Hesse
manifold and any Hesse manifold whose local Hesse index is maximal is
hyperbolic. In particular, the class of complete Hesse surfaces coincides with
that of elementary hyperbolic surfaces and hence any such surface is isometric
with the Poincar\'e disk, the hyperbolic punctured disk or a hyperbolic
annulus. On a complete Hesse manifold $({\cal M},G)$, the value of any Hesse
function $\Lambda$ can be expressed though the distance from a characteristic
subset of ${\cal M}$ determined by $\Lambda$.

events occur more often. One approach for avoiding curtailment of renewable
energies is to cover excess feed-in by demand response. As curtailment is often
a local phenomenon, in this work we determine the regional demand response
potential for the 401 German administrative districts. The load regionalisation
is based on weighting factors derived from population and employment
statistics, locations of industrial facilities, etc. Using periodic and
temperature-dependent load profiles and technology specific parameters, load
shifting potentials were determined with a temporal resolution of 15 minutes.
Our analysis yields that power-to-heat technologies provide the highest
potentials, followed by residential appliances, commercial and industrial
loads. For the considered 2030 scenario, power-to-gas and e-mobility also
contribute a significant potential. The cumulated load increase potential of
all technologies ranges from $5 - 470~MW$ per administrative district. The
median value is $25~MW$, which would suffice to avoid the curtailment of 8
classical wind turbines. Further, we calculated load shifting cost-potential
curves for each district. Industrial processes and power-to-heat in district
heating have the lowest load shifting investment cost, due to the largest
installed capacities per facility. We distinguished between different size
classes of the installed capacity of heat pumps, yielding $23\%$ lower average
investment cost for heat pump flexibilisation in the city of Berlin compared to
a rural district. The variable costs of most considered load shifting
technologies remain under the average compensation costs for curtailment of
renewable energies of $110~\text{\euro{}}/MWh$. As all results and the

between the extension of this ""polylogarithmic calculus"" and the world of
harmonic sums, a local theory of domains has to be done, preserving

generating series, one can consider the eulerian gamma function,
\begin{eqnarray*} \Gamma(1+z)=\exp\biggl(-\gamma z+\sum_{n\ge2}
\zeta(n)\dfrac{(-z)^n}{n}\biggr) {eqnarray*} and this may suggest to regularize
the divergent zeta value $\zeta(1)$, for the quasi-shuffle structure, as to be
Euler's $\gamma$ constant. In the same vein, in \cite{BHN}, we introduce a

appropriately aligned to support phase-coherent beamsteering. Based on a
spectrally-sparse waveform, a self-mixing circuit, and an adaptive control
loop, we present a system capable of synchronizing the RF oscillators in
separate transceivers over distances of nearly 100 m. The approach is based on
a spectrally-sparse waveform for joint inter-node ranging and frequency
transfer. A frequency reference is modulated onto one signal of a two-tone
waveform transmitted by the primary node which is demodulated and used to lock
the oscillator of the secondary node. The secondary node retransmits the
two-tone signal which the primary node uses for a high-accuracy range
measurement. From this range, the phase of the two transceivers can be aligned
to support beamforming. We furthermore implemented an adaptive phase control
approach to support high-accuracy phase coordination in changing environmental
conditions. We demonstrate continuous high accuracy links over a 90 m distance

sufficient phase coordination in changing weather conditions to support

40\,$M_{\odot}$, and includes 7 very massive stars with masses over
100\,$M_{\odot}$. We performed a spectroscopic analysis to derive their
physical properties. Using evolutionary models we find that the initial mass
function (IMF) of massive stars in R136 is suggestive of being top-heavy with a
power-law exponent $\gamma \approx 2 \pm 0.3$, but steeper exponents cannot be
excluded. The age of R136 lies between 1 and 2\,Myr with a median age of around
1.6\,Myr. Stars more luminous than $\log L/L_{\odot} = 6.3$ are helium enriched
and their evolution is dominated by mass loss, but rotational mixing or some
other form of mixing could be still required to explain the helium composition
at the surface. Stars more massive than 40\,$M_{\odot}$ have larger
spectroscopic than evolutionary masses. The slope of the wind-luminosity
relation assuming unclumped stellar winds is $2.41\pm0.13$ which is steeper
than usually obtained ($\sim 1.8$). The ionising ($\log Q_0\,[{\rm ph/s}] =
51.4$) and mechanical ($\log L_{\rm SW}\,[{\rm erg/s}] = 39.1$) output of R136
is dominated by the most massive stars ($>100\,M_{\odot}$). R136 contributes
around a quarter of the ionising flux and around a fifth of the mechanical
feedback to the overall budget of the Tarantula Nebula. For a census of massive
stars of the Tarantula Nebula region we combined our results with the
VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey plus other spectroscopic studies. We observe a lack
of evolved Wolf-Rayet stars and luminous blue and red supergiants.

by product rankings as most customers only examine a few top-ranked products.
Concurrently, such platforms also use the same data corresponding to customers'
actions to learn how these products must be ranked or ordered. These
interactions in the underlying learning process, however, may incentivize
sellers to artificially inflate their position by employing fake users, as
exemplified by the emergence of click farms. Motivated by such fraudulent
behavior, we study the ranking problem of a platform that faces a mixture of
real and fake users who are indistinguishable from one another. We first show
that existing learning algorithms---that are optimal in the absence of fake
users---may converge to highly sub-optimal rankings under manipulation by fake
users. To overcome this deficiency, we develop efficient learning algorithms
under two informational environments: in the first setting, the platform is
aware of the number of fake users, and in the second setting, it is agnostic to
the number of fake users. For both these environments, we prove that our
algorithms converge to the optimal ranking, while being robust to the
aforementioned fraudulent behavior; we also present worst-case performance
guarantees for our methods, and show that they significantly outperform
existing algorithms. At a high level, our work employs several novel approaches
to guarantee robustness such as: (i) constructing product-ordering graphs that
encode the pairwise relationships between products inferred from the customers'
actions; and (ii) implementing multiple levels of learning with a judicious
amount of bi-directional cross-learning between levels.

vision-based approaches for plant identification tasks. These approaches have
their own challenges. Leaf classification is a computer-vision task performed
for the automated identification of plant species, a serious challenge due to
variations in leaf morphology, including its size, texture, shape, and
venation. Researchers have recently become more inclined toward deep
learning-based methods rather than conventional feature-based methods due to
the popularity and successful implementation of deep learning methods in image
analysis, object recognition, and speech recognition.
  In this paper, to have an interpretable and reliable system, a botanist's
behavior is modeled in leaf identification by proposing a highly-efficient
method of maximum behavioral resemblance developed through three deep
learning-based models. Different layers of the three models are visualized to
ensure that the botanist's behavior is modeled accurately. The first and second
models are designed from scratch. Regarding the third model, the pre-trained
architecture MobileNetV2 is employed along with the transfer-learning
technique. The proposed method is evaluated on two well-known datasets: Flavia
and MalayaKew. According to a comparative analysis, the suggested approach is
more accurate than hand-crafted feature extraction methods and other deep
learning techniques in terms of 99.67% and 99.81% accuracy. Unlike conventional
techniques that have their own specific complexities and depend on datasets,
the proposed method requires no hand-crafted feature extraction. Also, it
increases accuracy as compared with other deep learning techniques. Moreover,
SWP-LeafNET is distributable and considerably faster than other methods because
of using shallower models with fewer parameters asynchronously.

the presence of raised seams on the surface of the ball to create asymmetric
flow, a knuckleball's trajectory has proven very challenging to predict
compared to other baseball pitches, such as fastballs or curveballs. Previous
experimental tracking of large numbers of knuckleballs has shown that they can
move in essentially any direction relative to what would be expected from a
drag-only trajectory. This has led to speculation that knuckleballs exhibit
chaotic motion. Here we develop a relatively simple model of a knuckleball that
includes quadratic drag and lift from asymmetric flow which is taken from
experimental measurements of slowly rotating baseballs. Our models can indeed
exhibit dynamical chaos as long In contrast, models that omit torques on the
ball in flight do not show chaotic behavior. Uncertainties in the phase space
position of the knuckleball are shown to grow by factors as large as $10^6$
over the flight of the ball from the pitcher to home plate. We quantify the
impact of our model parameters on the chaos realized in our models,
specifically showing that maximum Lyapunov exponent is roughly proportional to
the square root of the effective lever arm of the torque, and also roughly
proportional to the initial velocity of the pitch. We demonstrate the existence
of bifurcations that can produce changes in the location of the ball when it
reaches the plate of as much as 1.2 m for specific initial conditions similar
to those used by professional knuckleball pitchers. As we introduce additional
complexity in the form of more faithful representations of the empirical
asymmetry force measurements, we find that a larger fraction of the possible
initial conditions result in dynamical chaos.

separation and purification of pharmaceutical active ingredients by using an
antisolvent. In this work, we report the crystallization processes of
oiling-out droplets on surfaces during solvent exchange. Our model ternary
solution is beta-alanine dissolved in isopropanol and water mixture. As the
antisolvent isopropanol displaced the alanine solution pre-filled in a
microchamber, liquid-liquid phase separation occurred at the mixing front. The
alanine-rich subphase formed surface microdroplets that subsequently
crystallized with progression of solvent exchange. We find that the flow rates
have significant influence on the droplet size, crystallization process, and
growth rate, and final morphology of the crystals. At fast flow rates the
droplets solidified rapidly and formed spherical-cap structures resembling the
shape of droplets, in contrast to crystal microdomains or thin films formed at
slow flow rates. On a highly hydrophilic surface, the crystals formed thin film
without droplets formed on the surface. We further demonstrated that by the
solvent exchange crystals can be formed by using a stock solution with a very
low concentration of the precursor, and the as-prepared crystals can be used as
seeds to trigger crystallization in bulk solution. Our results suggest that the
solvent exchange has the potential to be an effective approach for controlling
oiling-out crystallization, which can be applied in wide areas, such as
separation and purification of many food, medical, and therapeutic ingredients.

aggregating network outputting ranking scores used to determine an ordering to

experiments on publicly-available datasets and investigate the applications of
ranking in problems often solved using classification. In an experiment on a
heavily-skewed sentiment analysis dataset, converting ranking results to
classification labels yields an approximately 22% improvement over
state-of-the-art text classification, demonstrating the efficacy of text
ranking over text classification in certain scenarios.

that guides their lane changing behavior during a freeway incident with the
goal of reducing traffic congestion, capacity drop, and delay. When an incident
blocking the lanes ahead is detected, Sentinel calculates the probability of
leaving the blocked lane(s) before reaching the incident point at each time
step. It advises the vehicle to leave the blocked lane(s) when that probability
drops below a certain threshold, as the vehicle nears the congestion boundary.
By doing this, Sentinel reduces the number of late-stage lane changes of
vehicles in the blocked lane(s) trying to move to other lanes, and distributes
those maneuvers upstream of the incident point. A simulation case study is
conducted in which one lane of a four-lane section of the I-66 interstate
highway in the U.S. is temporarily blocked due to an incident, to understand
how Sentinel impacts traffic flow and how different parameters - traffic flow,
system penetration rate, and incident duration - affect Sentinel's performance.
The results show that Sentinel has a positive impact on traffic flow, reducing
average delay by up to 37%, particularly when it has a considerable penetration
rate. Working alongside Traffic Incident Management Systems (TIMS), Sentinel
can be a valuable asset for reducing traffic delay and potentially saving
billions of dollars annually in costs associated with congestion caused by
freeway incidents.

However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing
methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging
the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that proves
essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced
fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning.
Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its
translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then
performs cross-language fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the
intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding.
During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the
target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks
such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same
label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate
or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and
POS tagging. To tackle this issue, we further propose an additional
KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated
soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FILTER achieves new state of the art on two

abstraction at the task planning level enables belief estimation of dynamic
obstacle locations and guarantees navigation safety with collision avoidance.
The high-level task planner, i.e., a two-level navigation planner, employs
linear temporal logic for a reactive game synthesis between the robot and its
environment while incorporating low-level safe keyframe policies into formal
task specification design. The synthesized task planner commands a series of
locomotion actions including walking step length, step height, and heading
angle changes, to the underlying keyframe decision-maker, which further
determines the robot center-of-mass apex velocity keyframe. The low-level
phase-space planner uses a reduced-order locomotion model to generate
non-periodic trajectories meeting balancing safety criteria for straight and
steering walking. These criteria are characterized by constraints on locomotion
keyframe states, and are used to define keyframe transition policies via
viability kernels. Simulation results of a Cassie bipedal robot designed by
Agility Robotics demonstrate locomotion maneuvering in a three-dimensional,

identified to be robust against shifting and scaling of the data but
considering the different distributions of data is much more difficult to
address (imbalance problem) even though it largely impacts the comparability
between evaluations on different datasets. In classification, it has been
stated repeatedly that performance metrics like the F-Measure and Accuracy are
highly dependent on the class distribution and that comparisons between
different datasets with different distributions are impossible. We show that
the same problem exists in regression. The distribution of odometry parameters
in robotic applications can for example largely vary between different
recording sessions. Here, we need regression algorithms that either perform
equally well for all function values, or that focus on certain boundary regions
like high speed. This has to be reflected in the evaluation metric. We propose
the modification of established regression metrics by weighting with the
inverse distribution of function values $Y$ or the samples $X$ using an
automatically tuned Gaussian kernel density estimator. We show on synthetic and
robotic data in reproducible experiments that classical metrics behave wrongly,
whereas our new metrics are less sensitive to changing distributions,
especially when correcting by the marginal distribution in $X$. Our new
evaluation concept enables the comparison of results between different datasets
with different distributions. Furthermore, it can reveal overfitting of a
regression algorithm to overrepresented target values. As an outcome,
non-overfitting regression algorithms will be more likely chosen due to our
corrected metrics.

electrostatic interactions. Since we consider charges of both signs, collisions
might occur in finite time. Upon collision, some of the colliding particles are
effectively removed from the system (annihilation). The two applications we
have in mind are vortices and dislocations in metals.
  In this paper we reach two goals. First, we develop a rigorous solution
concept for the interacting particle system with annihilation. The main
innovation here is to provide a careful management of the annihilation of
groups of more than two particles, and we show that the definition is
consistent by proving existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on
initial data. The proof relies on a detailed analysis of ODE trajectories close
to collision, and a reparametrization of vectors in terms of the moments of
their elements.
  Secondly, we pass to the many-particle limit (discrete-to-continuum), and
recover the expected limiting equation for the particle density. Due to the
singular interactions and the annihilation rule, standard proof techniques of
discrete-to-continuum limits do not apply. In particular, the framework of
measures seems unfit. Instead, we use the one-dimensional feature that both the
particle system and the limiting PDE can be characterized in terms of
Hamilton--Jacobi equations. While our proof follows a standard limit procedure
for such equations, the novelty with respect to existing results lies in
allowing for stronger singularities in the particle system by exploiting the
freedom of choice in the definition of viscosity solutions.

Power systems, among the most important components of urban infrastructure,

systems using false data injection attacks (FDIA), resulting in a breach of
availability, integrity, or confidential principles of the system. Our model
simulates possible attacks on power systems using multiple generators in a

consequence, our system is robust to unseen attacks. Moreover, the proposed
model considerably reduces the well-known mode collapse problem of GAN-based

applying argumentation semantics. We use a modified version of the ""cleaner

The stabilities and characteristics of the vortex QDs must be re-identified. In
the current system, we find that stable 2D vortex QDs can be supported with
topological charge number up to at least 4. We reformulated their density
profile, chemical potential and threshold norm for supporting the stable vortex
QDs according to the new condition. Unlike the QDs under thin confinement, the
QDs in the current system strongly repel each other because the LHY term
features a higher-order repulsion than that of the thin confinement system.

studied throughout the paper. Two kinds of collisions can be characterized by
exerting different values of related speed. The dynamics of the stable nested

framework over graphs. We overcome two key limitations of message passing in
popular graph neural networks (GNNs): localization (a k-layer GNN cannot
utilize features outside the k-hop neighborhood of the labeled training nodes)
and over-smoothed (structurally indistinguishable) representations. We propose
the concept of attributed structural roles of nodes based on their occurrence
in different network motifs, independent of network proximity. Two nodes share
attributed structural roles if they participate in topologically similar motif
instances over co-varying sets of attributes. Further, InfoMotif achieves
architecture independence by regularizing the node representations of arbitrary
GNNs via mutual information maximization. Our training curriculum dynamically
prioritizes multiple motifs in the learning process without relying on
distributional assumptions in the underlying graph or the learning task. We
integrate three state-of-the-art GNNs in our framework, to show significant
gains (3-10% accuracy) across six diverse, real-world datasets. We see stronger
gains for nodes with sparse training labels and diverse attributes in local
neighborhood structures.

growing demands for model interpretability and for the ability to provide
meaningful recourse to users. For example, patients hoping to improve their
diagnoses or loan applicants seeking to increase their chances of approval.
Counterfactuals can help in this regard by identifying input perturbations that
would result in more desirable prediction outcomes. Meaningful counterfactuals
should be able to achieve the desired outcome, but also be realistic,
actionable, and efficient to compute. Current approaches achieve desired
outcomes with moderate actionability but are severely limited in terms of
realism and latency. To tackle these limitations, we apply Generative
Adversarial Nets (GANs) toward counterfactual search. We also introduce a novel
Residual GAN (RGAN) that helps to improve counterfactual realism and
actionability compared to regular GANs. The proposed CounteRGAN method utilizes
an RGAN and a target classifier to produce counterfactuals capable of providing
meaningful recourse. Evaluations on two popular datasets highlight how the
CounteRGAN is able to overcome the limitations of existing methods, including
latency improvements of >50x to >90,000x, making meaningful recourse available
in real-time and applicable to a wide range of domains.

reached, i.e., $\delta_\nu \lesssim 1.3\times 10^{-18}$, corresponding to the
quantum gravity (QG) scale $M_{\rm QG,1} \gtrsim 5.7 \times 10^{3} M_{\rm Pl}$

9$ orders tighter for quadratic LIV compared to the time-of-flight constraint

weaker constraint on the superluminal neutrino velocity is obtained, i.e.,
$\delta_\nu \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-17}$, which is consistent with the
conclusions of previous works. We also study the neutrino detection probability
due to the distortion of neutrino spectral shape during propagation, which

of the Normal, Truncated Normal, and Beta likelihoods to deliver robust LSP
parameter estimates. Two case studies are presented and used to explore aspects
of the proposed model. The first, conducted over forested pixels within a HLS
tile, explores choice of likelihood and space-time varying HLS data
availability for long-term average LSP parameter point and uncertainty
estimation. The second, conducted on a small area of interest within the HLS
tile on an annual time-step, further examines the impact of sample size and
choice of likelihood on LSP parameter estimates. Results indicate that while
the Truncated Normal and Beta likelihoods are theoretically preferable when the
vegetation index is bounded, all three likelihoods performed similarly when the
number of index observations is sufficiently large and values are not near the
index bounds. Both case studies demonstrate how pixel-level LSP parameter
posterior distributions can be used to propagate uncertainty through subsequent
analysis. As a companion to this article, we provide an open-source \R package

taken as a bonus for model pre-training. In this paper, we try to exploit their
potentials with a confidence-based reweighting strategy. To expand, loss-based
reweighting strategies usually take the high loss value to identify two
completely different types of pixels, namely, valuable pixels in noise-free

impossible to perform two tasks of mining valuable pixels and suppressing

confidence, we successfully solve this dilemma and simultaneously perform two
subtasks with a single reweighting strategy. Furthermore, we generalize this
strategy into an Adversarial Reweighting Module (ARM) and prove its convergence
strictly. Experiments on standard datasets shows our ARM can bring consistent
improvements for both coarse annotations and fine annotations. Specifically,
built on top of DeepLabv3+, ARM improves the mIoU on the coarsely-labeled

behavior of the frequencies with the approximation is qualitatively the same
way as that without the approximation, where the frequencies with the

particular, the fundamental mode with the Cowling approximation is
overestimated. In addition, we also discuss the damping time of various
eigenmodes in gravitational waves from the PNSs, where the damping time for the
PNSs before the avoided crossing between the $f$- and $g_1$-modes, is quite
different from that for cold neutron stars, but it is more or less similar to

sheath region, and ejecta region. The ejecta regions are divided into two broad
classes: magnetic clouds (MC) that exhibit the characteristics of magnetic flux
ropes and non-magnetic clouds (NMC) that do not. As CMEs result from eruption
of magnetic flux ropes, it is important to answer why NMCs do not have the flux
rope features. One claims that NMCs lose their original flux rope features due
to the interactions between ICMEs or ICMEs and other large scale structures
during their transit in the heliosphere. The other attributes this phenomenon
to the geometric selection effect, i.e., when an ICME has its nose (flank,
including leg and non-leg flanks) pass through the observing spacecraft, the MC
(NMC) features will be detected along the spacecraft trajectory within the
ejecta. In this Letter, we examine which explanation is more reasonable through
the geometric properties of ICMEs. If the selection effect leads to different
ejecta types, MCs should have narrower sheath region compared to NMCs from the
statistical point of view, which is confirmed by our statistics. Besides, we
find that NMCs have the similar size in solar cycles 23 and 24, and NMCs are
smaller than MCs in cycle 23 but larger than MCs in cycle 24. This suggests
that most NMCs have their leg flank pass through the spacecraft. Our geometric
analyses support that all ICMEs should have a magnetic flux rope structure near
1 AU.

adversarial networks (CoGAN) in this task. Then, we train a CoGAN for the ToI
and restrict it to carry the same domain shift as the CoGAN for IrT does. In
addition, we introduce a pair of co-training classifiers to regularize the
training procedure of CoGAN in the ToI. The proposed method not only derives
machine learning models for the non-available target-domain data, but also
synthesizes the data themselves. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark
datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

provide the deep insight into the black hole microscopic properties and
structures. We in this paper study the dynamic properties of the stable
small-large black hole phase transition for the five-dimensional neutral
Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole. Firstly, by using the first law of black holes, we
prove that the extremal points of the free energy on the landscape denote the
real black hole solutions satisfying the field equations. The local maximal and
minimal points correspond to local unstable and stable black hole states,
respectively. Especially, on the free energy landscape, the wells of the
coexistence small and large black holes have the same depth. Then we
investigate the probability evolution governed by the Fokker-Planck equation.
Due to the thermal fluctuation, we find that the small (large) black hole state
can transit to the large (small) black hole state. Furthermore, the first
passage time is calculated. For each temperature, a single peak is presented,
which suggests that there is a considerable fraction of the first passage
events taking place at short time. And the higher the temperature is, the
faster decrease of the probability is. These results will uncover some
intriguing dynamic properties of the stable small-large black hole phase
transition in modified gravity.

work has shown that by harnessing structural parametric optimization of DOEs,
one can design MDLs to enable multiple functionalities like achromaticity,
depth of focus, wide-angle imaging, etc. with great ease in fabrication.
Therefore, it becomes critical to understand how fabrication errors still do
affect the performance of MDLs and numerically evaluate the trade-off between
efficiency and initial parameter selection, right at the onset of designing an
MDL, i.e., even before putting it into fabrication. Here, we perform a
statistical simulation-based study on MDLs (primarily operating in the THz
regime) to analyze the impact of various fabrication imperfections (single and
multiple) on the final structure as a function of the number of ring height
levels. Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of these same MDLs with
the change in the refractive index of the constitutive material. We use
focusing efficiency as the evaluation criterion in our numerical analysis;
since it is the most fundamental property that can be used to compare and
assess the performance of lenses (and MDLs) in general designed for any

between the current model's output distributions and its copies' on the

a more robust minimum. Our experiments show that LsrKD can improve LSR

the range of $10^9-10^{10}$yr, but show a wide diversity of SFHs with the

relation to normal star-forming galaxies, indicating that AGNs have little

no correlation. Comparing the SFHs with the luminosity of the [OIII]

solve this problem by training transferable models from the label-rich source

computer vision problems. In this paper, we tackle the challenging zero-shot

dual-domain samples in two different tasks, i.e. the relevant task (RT) and an
irrelevant task (IRT). We train CoCoGAN with both source-domain samples in RT
and dual-domain samples in IRT to complete the domain adaptation. While the
former provide high-level concepts of the non-available target-domain data, the
latter carry the sharing correlation between the two domains in RT and IRT. To
train CoCoGAN in the absence of target-domain data for RT, we propose a new
supervisory signal, i.e. the alignment between representations across tasks.
Extensive experiments carried out demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGAN

from a high bit error rate (BER). To eliminate the requirement of channel
estimation and to improve the system performance, in this paper, we adopt a
deep transfer learning (DTL) approach to implicitly extract the features of

data in the matrix formation, the proposed method is able to further improve
the system performance. In addition, an asymptotic explicit expression is also
derived to characterize the properties of the proposed CNN-based method when
the number of samples is sufficiently large. Finally, extensive simulation

an integrated objective function is proposed to facilitate the principle. In
comparison with the existing work in similar areas, our objective function has
two learning targets, which are created to be jointly optimized to achieve the
best possible unsupervised learning and knowledge discovery from unlabeled data
sets. While maximizing the first target enables the GMM to achieve the best
possible modeling of the data representations and each Gaussian component
corresponds to a compact cluster, maximizing the second term will enhance the
separability of the Gaussian components and hence the inter-cluster distances.
As a result, the compactness of clusters is significantly enhanced by reducing
the intra-cluster distances, and the separability is improved by increasing the
inter-cluster distances. Extensive experimental results show that the propose

  Clustering",,"ICME2019",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep representation learning is a crucial procedure in multimedia analysis
and attracts increasing attention. Most of the popular techniques rely on
convolutional neural network and require a large amount of labeled data in the
training procedure. However, it is time consuming or even impossible to obtain
the label information in some tasks due to cost limitation. Thus, it is
necessary to develop unsupervised deep representation learning techniques. This
paper proposes a new network structure for unsupervised deep representation
learning based on spectral analysis, which is a popular technique with solid
theory foundations. Compared with the existing spectral analysis methods, the
proposed network structure has at least three advantages. Firstly, it can
identify the local similarities among images in patch level and thus more
robust against occlusion. Secondly, through multiple consecutive spectral
analysis procedures, the proposed network can learn more clustering-friendly
representations and is capable to reveal the deep correlations among data
samples. Thirdly, it can elegantly integrate different spectral analysis
procedures, so that each spectral analysis procedure can have their individual
strengths in dealing with different data sample distributions. Extensive
experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various
image clustering tasks.

their high accuracy over the traditional statistical methods. To exploit the
potential of CNN models, a huge amount of research and industry efforts have
been devoted to optimizing CNNs. Among these endeavors, CNN architecture design
has attracted tremendous attention because of its great potential of improving
model accuracy or reducing model complexity. However, existing work either
introduces repeated training overhead in the search process or lacks an
interpretable metric to guide the design. To clear these hurdles, we propose
3D-Receptive Field (3DRF), an explainable and easy-to-compute metric, to
estimate the quality of a CNN architecture and guide the search process of
designs. To validate the effectiveness of 3DRF, we build a static optimizer to
improve the CNN architectures at both the stage level and the kernel level. Our
optimizer not only provides a clear and reproducible procedure but also
mitigates unnecessary training efforts in the architecture search process.
Extensive experiments and studies show that the models generated by our
optimizer can achieve up to 5.47% accuracy improvement and up to 65.38%

a type of privacy attacks aimed at inferring information about the training

Despite several decades of observational and theoretical effort, the location
of the optical iron emitting region and the mechanism responsible for the
positive correlation between the \feii\ strength and the black hole accretion
rate remain open questions as yet. In this letter, we report the optical \feii\
response to the central outburst in PS1-10adi, a candidate tidal disruption
event (TDE) taking place in an AGN at $z = 0.203$ that has aroused extensive
attention. For the first time, we observe that the \feii\ response in the
rising phase of its central luminosity is significantly more prominent than
that in the decline phase, showing a hysteresis effect. We interpret this
hysteresis effect as a consequence of the gradual sublimation of the dust
grains situating at the inner surface of the torus into gas when the luminosity
of the central engine increases. It is the iron element released from the
sublimated dust that contributes evidently to the observed \feii\ emission.
This interpretation, together with the weak response of the \hb\ emission as we
observe, naturally explains the applicability of relative \feii\ strength as a
tracer of the Eddington ratio. In addition, optical iron emission of this
origin renders the \feii\ time lag a potential ""standard candle"" with
cosmological implications.

investigated. However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a
specific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to
offer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack
multi-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition
problems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively
unexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial
videos, only a handful of approaches about defense strategies have been
published in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense
strategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.
The proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on
multiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization
(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN
structure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a
single perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution
estimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.
The BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it
to the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allowing
end-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the
proposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against
different and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded
attacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different
datasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study
the properties of the multiple BN structure.

constructively interact with the acoustic modes of that cavity and lead to
aeroacoustic instabilities. The resulting limit cycles can cause undesired
structural vibrations or noise pollution in many industrial applications. To
further the predictive understanding of this phenomenon, we propose two
physics-based models which describe the nonlinear aeroacoustic response of a
side branch aperture under harmonic forcing with variable acoustic pressure
forcing amplitude pa. One model is based on Howe's classic vortex sheet
formulation, and the other on an assumed vertical velocity profile in the side
branch aperture. These models are validated against experimental data. Particle
image velocimetry (PIV) was performed to quantify the turbulent and coherent
fluctuations of the shear layer under increasing pa. The specific acoustic
impedance Z of the aperture was acquired over a range of frequencies f for
different bulk flow velocities U and acoustic pressure forcing amplitudes pa.
We show that, once the handful of parameters in the two models for Z have been
calibrated using experimental data at a given condition, it is possible to make
robust analytical predictions of this impedance over a broad range of f, U and
pa. In particular, the models allow prediction of a necessary condition for
instability, implied by negative values of the acoustic resistance Re(Z).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the models are able to describe the nonlinear
saturation of the aeroacoustic response caused by alteration of the mean flow
at large forcing amplitudes, which was recently reported in literature. This
effect stabilizes the coupling between the side branch opening and the acoustic
field in the cavity, and its quantitative description may be of value for
control of aeroacoustic instabilities.

significant shaping gains over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
However, its benefits have not yet been quantified over realistic wireless
channel models. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the gains of
end-to-end learning over a frequency- and time-selective fading channel using
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). With imperfect channel
knowledge at the receiver, the shaping gains observed on AWGN channels vanish.
Nonetheless, we identify two other sources of performance improvements. The
first comes from a neural network (NN)-based receiver operating over a large
number of subcarriers and OFDM symbols which allows to significantly reduce the
number of orthogonal pilots without loss of bit error rate (BER). The second
comes from entirely eliminating orthognal pilots by jointly learning a neural
receiver together with either superimposed pilots (SIPs), linearly combined
with conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), or an optimized
constellation geometry. The learned geometry works for a wide range of
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), Doppler and delay spreads, has zero mean and
does hence not contain any form of superimposed pilots. Both schemes achieve
the same BER as the pilot-based baseline with around 7% higher throughput.
Thus, we believe that a jointly learned transmitter and receiver are a very
interesting component for beyond-5G communication systems which could remove
the need and associated control overhead for demodulation reference signals
(DMRSs).

frequently embed trusted execution environments into their systems. Here,
applications are protected from adversaries, including a malicious operating
system. TEEs are usually built by integrating protection mechanisms directly
into the processor or by using dedicated external secure elements. However,
both of these approaches only cover a narrow threat model resulting in limited
security guarantees. Enclaves in the application processor typically provide
weak isolation between the secure and non-secure domain, especially when
considering side-channel attacks. Although secure elements do provide strong
isolation, the slow communication interface to the application processor is
exposed to adversaries and restricts the use cases. Independently of the used
implementation approach, TEEs often lack the possibility to establish secure
communication to external peripherals, and most operating systems executed
inside TEEs do not provide state-of-the-art defense strategies, making them
vulnerable against various attacks. We argue that TEEs implemented on the main
application processor are insecure, especially when considering side-channel
attacks. We demonstrate how a heterogeneous architecture can be utilized to
realize a secure TEE design. We directly embed a processor into our
architecture to provide strong isolation between the secure and non-secure

mechanisms for establishing secure communication channels. We further introduce
RISC-V Secure Co-Processor, a security-hardened processor tailored for TEEs. To
secure applications executed inside the TEE, RVSCP provides control-flow

Different from previous works, GTEA models the temporal dynamics of interaction
sequences in the continuous-time space and simultaneously takes advantage of
both rich node and edge/ interaction attributes in the graph. Concretely, we
integrate a sequence model with a time encoder to learn pairwise interactional
dynamics between two adjacent nodes.This helps capture complex temporal
interactional patterns of a node pair along the history, which generates edge
embeddings that can be fed into a GNN backbone. By aggregating features of
neighboring nodes and the corresponding edge embeddings, GTEA jointly learns
both topological and temporal dependencies of a TIG. In addition, a
sparsity-inducing self-attention scheme is incorporated for neighbor
aggregation, which highlights more important neighbors and suppresses trivial
noises for GTEA. By jointly optimizing the sequence model and the GNN backbone,
GTEA learns more comprehensive node representations capturing both temporal and
graph structural characteristics. Extensive experiments on five large-scale
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GTEA over other inductive
models.

brightens over $0.12$ yr by $0.3$ mag at 850 $\mu$m, $2$ mag at 3.35 $\mu$m,
and $1.5$ mag at near-IR wavelengths, to a maximum luminosity consistent with
an accretion rate of $\sim8\times10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The emission
then decays with an e-folding timescale of $\approx0.74$ yr until the accretion
rate is $\sim1\times10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The next eruption then
occurs, likely triggered by the buildup of $\sim5\times10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ of

star. Just before outburst, when the disk is almost replenished, the near-IR
colors become redder, indicating an increase in the geometrical height of the

burst, as much of the mass is drained from the disk. We quantify physical
parameters related to the accretion process in EC 53 by assuming an
$\alpha$-disk formulation, constrained by the observed disk properties and
accretion rate. While we can only speculate about the possible trigger for
these faithful eruptions, we hope that our quantified schematic will motivate
theorists to test the hypothesized mechanisms that could cause the cyclical

of HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied

modern communication systems. It consists of an encoder, a channel, and a
decoder block which modify their internal neural structure in an end-to-end
learning fashion. However, the current approach to train an autoencoder relies
on the use of the cross-entropy loss function. This approach can be prone to
overfitting issues and often fails to learn an optimal system and signal
representation (code). In addition, less is known about the autoencoder ability
to design channel capacity-approaching codes, i.e., codes that maximize the
input-output information under a certain power constraint. The task being even
more formidable for an unknown channel for which the capacity is unknown and
therefore it has to be learnt.
  In this paper, we address the challenge of designing capacity-approaching
codes by incorporating the presence of the communication channel into a novel
loss function for the autoencoder training. In particular, we exploit the
mutual information between the transmitted and received signals as a
regularization term in the cross-entropy loss function, with the aim of
controlling the amount of information stored. By jointly maximizing the mutual
information and minimizing the cross-entropy, we propose a methodology that a)
computes an estimate of the channel capacity and b) constructs an optimal coded
signal approaching it. Several simulation results offer evidence of the
potentiality of the proposed method.

this, we developed Skill Lab, a novel game-based tool that simultaneously
assesses a broad suite of cognitive abilities while providing an engaging

cognitive ability tasks. Using a popular citizen science platform (N = 10725),
we conducted a comprehensive validation in the wild of a game-based cognitive
assessment suite. Based on the game and validation task data, we constructed
reliable models to simultaneously predict eight cognitive abilities based on
the users' in-game behavior. Follow-'-up validation tests revealed that the
models can discriminate nuances contained within each separate cognitive
ability as well as capture a shared main factor of generalized cognitive
ability. Our game-based measures are five times faster to complete than the
equivalent task-based measures and replicate previous findings on the decline
of certain cognitive abilities with age in our large cross-sectional population

rapid in-the-wild systematic assessment of cognitive abilities as a promising
first step towards population-scale benchmarking and individualized mental

recent proposed learning-based methods have achieved impressive registration
performance on the full shape observations, these methods mostly suffer from
performance degradation when dealing with partial shapes. To bridge the
performance gaps between partial point set registration with full point set
registration, we proposed to incorporate a shape completion network to benefit
the registration process. To achieve this, we design a latent code for each
pair of shapes, which can be regarded as a geometric encoding of the target
shape. By doing so, our model does need an explicit feature embedding network
to learn the feature encodings. More importantly, both our shape completion
network and the point set registration network take the shared latent codes as
input, which are optimized along with the parameters of two decoder networks in
the training process. Therefore, the point set registration process can thus
benefit from the joint optimization process of latent codes, which are enforced
to represent the information of full shape instead of partial ones. In the
inference stage, we fix the network parameter and optimize the latent codes to
get the optimal shape completion and registration results. Our proposed method
is pure unsupervised and does not need any ground truth supervision.
Experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model for partial point set registration.

node representations (i.e., the node representations before the first-time
graph convolution) largely affect the final model performance. However, when
learning the initial representation for a node, most existing work linearly
combines the embeddings of node features, without considering the interactions
among the features (or feature embeddings). We argue that when the node
features are categorical, e.g., in many real-world applications like user
profiling and recommender system, feature interactions usually carry important
signals for predictive analytics. Ignoring them will result in suboptimal
initial node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up
graph convolution. In this paper, we propose a new GCN model named CatGCN,
which is tailored for graph learning when the node features are categorical.
Specifically, we integrate two ways of explicit interaction modeling into the
learning of initial node representation, i.e., local interaction modeling on
each pair of node features and global interaction modeling on an artificial
feature graph. We then refine the enhanced initial node representations with
the neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolution. We train CatGCN in an
end-to-end fashion and demonstrate it on semi-supervised node classification.
Extensive experiments on three tasks of user profiling (the prediction of user
age, city, and purchase level) from Tencent and Alibaba datasets validate the
effectiveness of CatGCN, especially the positive effect of performing feature
interaction modeling before graph convolution.

methods for problems modeled by variable coefficient equations. Despite the
fact that GPWs do not satisfy the Trefftz property, i.e. they are not exact
solutions to the governing equation, they instead satisfy a quasi-Trefftz
property: they are only approximate solutions. They lead to high order
numerical methods, and this quasi-Trefftz property is critical for their
numerical analysis.
  The present work introduces a new family of GPWs, amplitude-based. The
motivation lies in the poor behavior of the phase-based GPW approximations in
the pre-asymptotic regime, which will be tamed by avoiding high degree
polynomials within an exponential. The new ansatz is introduces higher order
terms in the amplitude rather than the phase of a plane wave as was initially
proposed. The new functions' construction and the study of their interpolation
properties are guided by the roadmap proposed in [16]. For the sake of clarity,
the first focus is on the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with
spatially-varying wavenumber. The extension to a range of operators allowing
for anisotropy in the first and second order terms follows. Numerical
simulations illustrate the theoretical study of the new quasi-Trefftz

introducing a logarithmic number of unfolded rules to the program. Efficiency
crucially depends on the amount of simplification inside the unfolded rules. We
prove a super-linear speedup theorem in the best case, i.e. speedup by more
than a constant factor. Our optimization can lower the time complexity class of
a program. In this paper, the super-linear speedup is within bounds: it holds
up to an arbitrary but chosen upper bound on the number of recursive steps. We

efficiency of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile and embedded systems.
However, the accuracy degradation of BCNNs is still considerable compared with
their full precision counterpart, impeding their practical deployment. Because
of the inevitable binarization error in the forward propagation and gradient
mismatch problem in the backward propagation, it is nontrivial to train BCNNs
to achieve satisfactory accuracy. To ease the difficulty of training, the
shortcut-based BCNNs, such as residual connection-based Bi-real ResNet and
dense connection-based BinaryDenseNet, introduce additional shortcuts in
addition to the shortcuts already present in their full precision counterparts.
Furthermore, fractal architectures have been also been used to improve the
training process of full-precision DCNNs since the fractal structure triggers
effects akin to deep supervision and lateral student-teacher information flow.
Inspired by the shortcuts and fractal architectures, we propose two
Shortcut-based Fractal Architectures (SoFAr) specifically designed for BCNNs:
1. residual connection-based fractal architectures for binary ResNet, and 2.
dense connection-based fractal architectures for binary DenseNet. Our proposed
SoFAr combines the adoption of shortcuts and the fractal architectures in one
unified model, which is helpful in the training of BCNNs. Results show that our
proposed SoFAr achieves better accuracy compared with shortcut-based BCNNs.
Specifically, the Top-1 accuracy of our proposed RF-c4d8 ResNet37(41) and
DRF-c2d2 DenseNet51(53) on ImageNet outperforms Bi-real ResNet18(64) and
BinaryDenseNet51(32) by 3.29% and 1.41%, respectively, with the same

strong and positive correlation between successive likelihood estimates.
However, unless the measurement error or the dimension of the SDE is small,
correlation can be eroded by the resampling steps in the particle filter. We
therefore propose a novel augmentation scheme, that allows for conditioning on
values of the latent process at the observation times, completely avoiding the
need for resampling steps. We integrate over the uncertainty at the observation
times with an additional Gibbs step. Connections between the resulting
pseudo-marginal scheme and existing inference schemes for diffusion processes
are made, giving a unified inference framework that encompasses Gibbs sampling

whether the epidemic information is delayed or not has no effect on the spread
of the epidemic. People's high sensitivity to the epidemic information leads to
their risk aversion behavior and the spread of the epidemic is suppressed. In
the population with only global person-to-person movement, timely and accurate
epidemic information helps an individual cut off the connections with the
infected in time and the epidemic is brought under control in no time. A delay
in the epidemic information leads to an individual's misjudgment of who has
been infected and who has not, which in turn leads to rapid progress and a
higher peak of the epidemic. In the population with coexistence of local and

grading if those systems can outperform human skills by analyzing hidden cues
that seem unnoticed, improving the detection time, and even anticipating
maneuvers in some cases.

that it calculates the stream function everywhere in the thin-film structure to
determine during the time-evolution the fluxoids for each SQUID array hole. Our
numerical model calculations are compared with our experimental data and
predict the bias-current versus voltage and the voltage versus magnetic field

they harden and their average c/a lattice parameter ratio decreases with

dislocation loops that contribute to a non-uniform growth phenomenon called
irradiation-induced growth (IIG). To gain insights into these dislocation loops
in Zr we studied them using atomistic simulation. We constructed and relaxed
dislocation loops of various types. We find that the energies of <a>-loops on
different habit planes are similar, but our results indicate that they are most
likely to form on the 1st prismatic plane and then reduce their energy by
rotating onto the 2nd prismatic plane. By simulating loops of different aspect
ratios, we find that, based on energetics alone, the shape of <a>-loops does
not depend on character, and that these loops become increasingly elliptical as
their size increases. Additionally, we find that interstitial <c/2+p>-loops and
vacancy <c>-loops are both energetically feasible and so the possibility of
these should be considered in future work. Our findings offer important
insights into loop formation and evolution, which are difficult to probe

galaxy radial profiles in $\Delta \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and luminosity weighted
stellar age (${\rm Age_L}$), split by a variety of intrinsic and environmental
parameters. Via several statistical analyses, we establish that the quenching
of central galaxies is governed by intrinsic parameters, with central velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_c$) being the most important single parameter. High mass
satellites quench in a very similar manner to centrals. Conversely, low mass
satellite quenching is governed primarily by environmental parameters, with
local galaxy over-density ($\delta_5$) being the most important single
parameter. Utilising the empirical $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_c$ relation, we estimate
that quenching via AGN feedback must occur at $M_{BH} \geq 10^{6.5-7.5}
M_{\odot}$, and is marked by steeply rising $\Delta \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ radial
profiles in the green valley, indicating `inside-out' quenching. On the other
hand, environmental quenching occurs at over-densities of 10 - 30 times the
average galaxy density at z$\sim$0.1, and is marked by steeply declining
$\Delta \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles, indicating `outside-in' quenching. Finally,
through an analysis of stellar metallicities, we conclude that both intrinsic

networks can greatly improve the classification performance of general neural
models. In most practical cases, however, choosing the optimal architecture for
a given task remains a challenging problem. Recent architecture-search methods
are able to automatically build neural models with strong performance but fail
to fully appreciate the interaction between neural architecture and weights.
This work investigates the problem of disentangling the role of the neural
structure and its edge weights, by showing that well-trained architectures may
not need any link-specific fine-tuning of the weights. We compare the
performance of such weight-free networks (in our case these are binary networks
with {0, 1}-valued weights) with random, weight-agnostic, pruned and standard
fully connected networks. To find the optimal weight-agnostic network, we use a
novel and computationally efficient method that translates the hard
architecture-search problem into a feasible optimization problem.More
specifically, we look at the optimal task-specific architectures as the optimal
configuration of binary networks with {0, 1}-valued weights, which can be found
through an approximate gradient descent strategy. Theoretical convergence
guarantees of the proposed algorithm are obtained by bounding the error in the
gradient approximation and its practical performance is evaluated on two
real-world data sets. For measuring the structural similarities between
different architectures, we use a novel spectral approach that allows us to
underline the intrinsic differences between real-valued networks and
weight-free architectures.

investigating the single electron spectra and the angular correlation between
the emitted electrons. We derive and calculate the LIV contributions to these
spectra associated with the anisotropic part of the countershaded operator and
controlled through the coefficient $\mathring{a}_{\text{of}}^{(3)}$ and discuss
possible signatures that may be probed in experiments. First, we show that some
distortion occurs in the single electron spectrum, maximal at small electron
energies. Then, we show that other LIV effects may be highlighted by analysing
the angular correlation spectra and the ratio between the Standard Model
Extension (SME) electron spectra and their Standard Model (SM) forms. We found
that these LIV signatures depend on the magnitude of
$\mathring{a}_{\text{of}}^{(3)}$, manifest differently for positive and
negative values of this coefficient, and become more pronounced as the electron
energy approaches the $Q$-value. Finally, we propose an alternative, new method
to constrain $\mathring{a}_{\text{of}}^{(3)}$ through the measurement of the
angular correlation coefficient. Using this method, and considering only
statistical uncertainties, we obtain bounds of $\mathring{a}_{\text{of}}^{(3)}$
at the level of present ones, obtained from summed energy spectra. We show that
future experiments can improve these limits significantly. Our study is
performed for $^{100}$Mo, but the results hold qualitatively for other nuclei

the recent success of deep learning. However, a key question remains as to
whether backprop can be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in
neural circuitry. The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate
formulation uses only local information, rather than relying on global signals
as in standard backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop
using only local signals have been proposed. However, these algorithms
typically impose other requirements which challenge biological plausibility:
for example, requiring complex and precise connectivity schemes, or multiple
sequential backwards phases with information being stored across phases. Here,
we propose a novel algorithm, Activation Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by
constructing the backpropagation gradient as the equilibrium point of a
dynamical system. Our algorithm converges rapidly and robustly to the correct
backpropagation gradients, requires only a single type of computational unit,
utilises only a single parallel backwards relaxation phase, and can operate on
arbitrary computation graphs. We illustrate these properties by training deep
neural networks on visual classification tasks, and describe simplifications to
the algorithm which remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation
(for example, the weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear
derivatives), while preserving performance.

journals and publishers, also known as ""predatory"", to minimise the spread of
unreliable research and the growing of fake publishing outlets. However,
blacklisting remains a very controversial activity for several reasons: there
is no consensus regarding the criteria used to determine fraudulent journals,
the criteria used may not always be transparent or relevant, and blacklists are
rarely updated regularly. Cabell's paywalled blacklist service attempts to
overcome some of these issues in reviewing fraudulent journals on the basis of
transparent criteria and in providing allegedly up-to-date information at the
journal entry level. We tested Cabell's blacklist to analyse whether or not it
could be adopted as a reliable tool by stakeholders in scholarly communication,
including our own academic library. To do so, we used a copy of Walt Crawford's
Gray Open Access dataset (2012-2016) to assess the coverage of Cabell's
blacklist and get insights on their methodology. Out of the 10,123 journals
that we tested, 4,681 are included in Cabell's blacklist. Out of this number of
journals included in the blacklist, 3,229 are empty journals, i.e. journals in
which no single article has ever been published. Other collected data points to
questionable weighing and reviewing methods and shows a lack of rigour in how
Cabell applies its own procedures: some journals are blacklisted on the basis
of 1 to 3 criteria, identical criteria are recorded multiple times in
individual journal entries, discrepancies exist between reviewing dates and the
criteria version used and recorded by Cabell, reviewing dates are missing, and
we observed two journals blacklisted twice with a different number of
violations. Based on these observations, we conclude with recommendations and
suggestions that could help improve Cabell's blacklist service.

trusted ""aggregator"" holds the sensitive data of all the individuals and is
responsible for protecting their privacy. A popular alternative is the local

responsible for their own privacy. The decentralized privacy guarantee of the
local model comes at a high price in statistical utility or computational
complexity. Thus intermediate models such as the shuffled model and pan privacy
have been studied in an attempt to attain the best of both worlds.
  In this note, we propose an intermediate trust model for differential

aggregators and we only assume that they do not collude nefariously. This model
relaxes the trust requirements of the central model while avoiding the price of

delete transactions through a chain reorganization (a malicious reorg) can
perform a profitable double-spend attack. We study the rate at which an
attacker can execute reorgs in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake protocol. As an
example, an attacker with 40% of the staking power is able to execute a
20-block malicious reorg at an average rate of once per day, and the attack
probability increases super-linearly as the staking power grows beyond 40%.
Moreover, an attacker of the Tezos protocol knows in advance when an attack
opportunity will arise, and can use this knowledge to arrange transactions to
double-spend. We show that in particular cases, the Tezos protocol can be
adjusted to protect against deep reorgs. For instance, we demonstrate protocol
parameters that reduce the rate of length-20 reorg opportunities for a 40%
attacker by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a trade-off between
optimizing for robustness to deep reorgs (costly deviations that may be net
profitable because they enable double-spends) and robustness to selfish mining
(mining deviations that result in typically short reorgs that are profitable
even without double-spends). That is, the parameters that optimally protect
against one make the other attack easy. Finally, we develop a method that
monitors the Tezos blockchain health with respect to malicious reorgs using
only publicly available information.

250 K, it is the coldest known brown dwarf (BD), located at only ca.2.2 pc form
the Sun. It is extremely faint, which makes any astronomical observations
difficult. However, at least one remotely similar ultra-low-mass object, the M9
dwarf TVLM 513-46546, has been shown to be a steady radio emitter at
frequencies up to 95 GHz with superimposed active states where strong, pulsed
emission is observed. Aims: Our goal is to determine the millimeter radio
properties of W0855 with deep observations around 93 GHz (3.2 mm) in order to
investigate whether radio astrometry of this object is feasible and to measure
or set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Methods: We observed W0855 for 94
min at 85.1-100.9 GHz on 24 December 2019 using 44 of the Atacama Large
millimeter Array (ALMA) 12 m antennas. We used the standard ALMA calibration
procedure and created the final image for our analysis by accommodating the
Quasar 3C 209, the brightest nearby object by far. Furthermore, we created a
light curve with a 30 s time resolution to search for pulsed emission. Results:
Our observations achieve a noise RMS of 7.3 {\mu}Jy/beam for steady emission
and of 88 {\mu}Jy for 30 s pulses in the aggregated bandwidth (Stokes I). There
is no evidence for steady or pulsed emission from the object at the time of the
observation. We derive 3 {\sigma} upper limits of 21.9 {\mu}Jy on the steady
emission and of 264 {\mu}Jy on the pulsed emission of W0855 between 85 GHz and
101 GHz. Conclusions: Together with the recent non-detection of W0855 at 4-8
GHz, our constraints on the steady and pulsed emission from W0855 confirm that
the object is neither radio-loud nor magnetospherically particularly active.

of the results by Ruscher et al., we observe, by both molecular dynamics and
Monte Carlo simulations, that upon slow quasi-static equilibrium cooling, the
Voronoi liquid crystallises from a disordered configuration into the
body-centered cubic configuration. By contrast, upon sufficiently fast
non-equilibrium cooling (and not just in the limit of a maximally fast quench)
the Voronoi liquid adopts similar states as the effectively hyperuniform
inherent structures identified by Klatt et al. and prevents the ordering
transition into a BCC ordered structure. This result is in line with the

maximum entropy principle, is shown to be parameterizable in terms of root
turbulence variables including the Reynolds number. The spectral function is
first compared with a number of experimental data sets, showing a very close
agreement across the entire energy and length (wavenumber) scales. The peak
wavenumber (m) and the width parameter (C2) prescribe the spectral location and
broadening, respectively, when the Reynolds number increases, where C2 has ~
1/Rem dependence. The energy scale is adjusted with a multiplicative factor. In
this perspective, the inertial scaling from k-3 to k-5/3 when the flow
transitions from two- to three-dimensions is explained as the increase in
spectral width since the range of scales increases as Re1/6 and Re3/4 for two
and three-dimensional turbulence, respectively. Energy spectra at various
locations in channel flows are also reproduced using the same function,
indicating applicability wherever local equilibrium is achieved. Therefore,
based on a small number of scaling parameters the full energy spectra can be
prescribed using the maximum-entropy formalism.

properties including the maximum likelihood estimators, the hypothesis test for
uniformity and give a test of serial independence. Using our discrete circular
distributions, we demonstrate how to determine changepoint when the data arise

test for uniformity (unbiasedness) , test for serial correlation, detect
changepoint in streaming roulette-spins data, and fit mixtures. We analyse a

all functions are smooth, strongly convex, and their minimizers all lie in a

the accuracy of the final solution in the absence of arrival and departure,
exposing thus a potential trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity. Our

we use a small dataset for intent classification collected for building
chatbots and compare the performance of a simple bidirectional LSTM model with
a pre-trained BERT model. Our experimental results show that bidirectional LSTM
models can achieve significantly higher results than a BERT model for a small
dataset and these simple models get trained in much less time than tuning the

these factors should be taken into consideration instead of directly choosing

ultraprecise broadband optical diagnostics of atoms and molecules. This
powerful tool typically requires two phase-locked femtosecond lasers, yet it
has been shown that it can be realized without any stabilization if the combs
are generated from a single laser cavity. Still, unavoidable intrinsic relative
phase-fluctuations always set a limit on the precision of any spectroscopic
measurements, hitherto limiting the applicability of bulk dual-comb lasers for
mode-resolved studies. Here, we demonstrate a versatile concept for low-noise
dual-comb generation from a single-cavity femtosecond solid-state laser based
on intrinsic polarization-multiplexing inside an optically anisotropic gain
crystal. Due to intracavity spatial separation of the orthogonally-polarized
beams, two sub-100 fs pulse trains are simultaneously generated from a 1.05
$\mu$m Yb:CNGS oscillator with a repetition rate difference of 4.7 kHz. The
laser exhibits the lowest relative noise ever demonstrated for a bulk dual-comb
source, supporting free-running mode-resolved spectroscopic measurements over a
second. Moreover, the developed dual-comb generation technique can be applied
to any solid-state laser exploiting a birefringent active crystal, paving the
way towards a new class of highly-coherent, single-cavity, dual-comb laser
sources operating in various spectral regions.

to humankind due to the potential damage they can cause to Earth's environment
and infrastructure. It has been shown in Kusano et al. (2012) that a
small-scale bipolar region (BR), with its flux reversed relative to the
potential component of the overlying field, appearing near the polarity
inversion line (PIL) is sufficient to effectively trigger a solar flare. In
this study we perform further 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the
effect that the motion of these small-scale BRs has on the effectiveness of
flare triggering. The effect of two small-scale BRs colliding is also
simulated. The results indicate that the strength of the triggered flare is
dependent on how much of the overlying field is disrupted by the BR.
Simulations of linear oscillations of the BR showed that oscillations along the
PIL increase the flare strength whilst oscillations across the PIL detract from
the flare strength. The flare strength is affected more by larger amplitude
oscillations but is relatively insensitive to the frequency of oscillations. In
the most extreme case the peak kinetic energy of the flare increased more than
threefold compared to a non-oscillating BR. Simulations of torsional
oscillations of the BR showed a very small effect on the flare strength.
Finally, simulations of colliding BRs showed the generation of much stronger
flares as the flares triggered by each individual BR coalesce. These results
show that significantly stronger flares can result from motion of the BR along
the PIL of a sheared field or from the presence of multiple BRs in the same
region.

order to the gravitational field equations in \(D = 4\) dimensions from a

It triggered a discussion whether the employed renormalization procedure yields
a well-defined theory. One of the main criticisms is based on the fact that the
resulting field equations cannot be obtained as the Euler-Lagrange equations
from a diffeomorphism invariant action. In this work, we use techniques from
the inverse calculus of variations to point out that the renormalized truncated
Gauss-Bonnet equations cannot be obtained from any action at all (either
diffeomorphism invariant or not), in any dimension. Then, we employ canonical
variational completion, based on the notion of Vainberg-Tonti Lagrangian -
which consists in adding a canonically defined correction term to a given
system of equations, so as to make them derivable from an action. To apply this
technique to the suggested $4$D renormalized Gauss-Bonnet equations, we extend
the variational completion algorithm to some classes of PDE systems for which
the usual integral providing the Vainberg-Tonti Lagrangian diverges. We
discover that in $D>4$ the suggested field equations can be variationally
completed, choosing either the metric or its inverse as field variables; both
approaches yield consistently the same Lagrangian, whose variation leads to
fourth order field equations. In $D=4$, the Lagrangian of the variationally
completed theory diverges in both cases.

following a close encounter. An observational signature of close encounters is
eccentric binary orbit; however, this feature is currently difficult to
identify due to the lack of suitable gravitational waveforms. No eccentric

random growth process with competition on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ called \emph{first
passage percolation in a hostile environment} that consists of two first
passage percolation processes $FPP_1$ and $FPP_{\lambda}$ that compete for the
occupancy of sites. Initially, $FPP_1$ occupies the origin and spreads through
the edges of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at rate 1, while $FPP_{\lambda}$ is initialised at
sites called \emph{seeds} that are distributed according to a product of
Bernoulli measures of parameter $p\in(0,1)$, where a seed remains dormant until
$FPP_1$ or $FPP_{\lambda}$ attempts to occupy it before then spreading through
the edges of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at rate $\lambda>0$. Particularly challenging
aspects of FPPHE are its non-equilibrium dynamics and its lack of monotonicity
(for instance, adding seeds could be benefitial to $FPP_1$ instead of
$FPP_\lambda$); such characteristics, for example, prevent the application of a
more standard multi-scale analysis. As a consequence of our main result for
FPPHE, we establish a coexistence phase for the model for $d\geq3$, answering
an open question in \cite{sidoravicius2019multi}. This exhibits a rare
situation where a natural random competition model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ observes
coexistence for processes with \emph{different} speeds. Moreover, we are able
to establish the stronger result that $FPP_1$ and $FPP_{\lambda}$ can both
occupy a \emph{positive density} of sites with positive probability, which is
in stark contrast with other competition processes.

compared with the observations using a modified and robust version of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results of one simulation, convolved with the
distribution of distances of the observational sample, are able to explain most
of the statistical properties of the HI-to-H$_2$ transition observed in the
local ISM. The tightest agreement is obtained for a neutral diffuse gas modeled
over ~200 pc, with a mean density of $1-2$ cm$^{-3}$, illuminated by the
standard interstellar UV radiation field, and stirred up by a large-scale
compressive turbulent forcing. Within this configuration, the 2D probability
histogram of the column densities of H and H$_2$ is remarkably stable and is
almost unaltered by gravity, the strength of the turbulent forcing, the
resolution of the simulation, or the strength of the magnetic field $B_x$. The
weak effect of the resolution and our analytical prescription suggest that the

Measurement of the variety of disk-integrated brightnesses of bodies in the
Solar System and the variation with illumination and wavelength is essential
for both planning imaging observations of directly imaged exoplanets and
interpreting the eventual datasets. Here we measure the change in brightness of
the Galilean satellites as a function of planetocentric longitude, illumination
phase angle, and wavelength. The data span a range of wavelengths from
400-950nm and predominantly phase angles from 0-25 degrees, with some
constraining observations near 60-140 degrees. Despite the similarity in size
and density between the moons, surface inhomogeneities result in significant
changes in the disk-integrated reflectivity with planetocentric longitude and
phase angle. We find that these changes are sufficient to determine the
rotational periods of the moon. We also find that at low phase angles the
surface can produce reflectivity variations of 8-36% and the limited high phase
angle observations suggest variations will have proportionally larger
amplitudes at higher phase angles. Additionally, all the Galilean satellites
are darker than predicted by an idealized Lambertian model at the phases most
likely to be observed by direct-imaging missions. If Earth-size exoplanets have
surfaces similar to that of the Galilean moons, we find that future direct
imaging missions will need to achieve precisions of less than 0.1\,ppb. Should
the necessary precision be achieved, future exoplanet observations could
exploit similar observation schemes to deduce surface variations, determine
rotation periods, and potentially infer surface composition.

the existence of a pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap in the range
$\sim50$ to $\sim120$ solar masses. This theoretical prediction is supported by
the binary black holes (BBHs) of LIGO/Virgo's first two observing runs, whose
component masses are well-fit by a power law with a maximum mass cutoff at
$m_\mathrm{max}=40.8^{+11.8}_{-4.4}\,M_\odot$. Meanwhile, the BBH event
GW190521 has a reported primary mass of $m_1=85^{+21}_{-14}\,M_\odot$, firmly
above the inferred $m_\mathrm{max}$, and secondary mass
$m_2=66^{+17}_{-18}\,M_\odot$. Rather than concluding that both components of
GW190521 belong to a new population of mass-gap BHs, we explore the
conservative scenario in which GW190521's secondary mass belongs to the
previously-observed population of BHs. We replace the default priors on $m_1$
and $m_2$, which assume that BH detector-frame masses are uniformly
distributed, with this population-informed prior on $m_2$, finding
$m_2<48\,M_\odot$ at 90\% credibility. Moreover, because the total mass of the
system is better constrained than the individual masses, the population prior
on $m_2$ automatically increases the inferred $m_1$ to sit \emph{above} the gap
(39\% for $m_1 > 120\,M_\odot$, or 25\% probability for $m_1>130\,M_\odot$). As
long as the prior odds for a double-mass-gap BBH are smaller than $\sim 1:15$,
it is more likely that GW190521 straddles the pair-instability gap. We argue
that GW190521 may be the first example of a straddling binary black hole,
composed of a conventional stellar mass BH and a BH from the ``far side' of the
PISN mass gap.

Chow-Luo's combinatorial Ricci flow on surfaces and Luo's combinatorial Ricci

maximizing the volume of angle structures, combinatorial Ricci flow finds the
complete hyperbolic metric on a cusped $3$-manifold by minimizing the co-volume
of decorated hyperbolic polyhedral metrics. The combinatorial Ricci flow may
develop singularities. We overcome this difficulty by extending the flow
through the potential singularities using Luo-Yang's extension. It is shown
that the existence of a complete hyperbolic metric on a cusped $3$-manifold is
equivalent to the convergence of the extended combinatorial Ricci flow, which
gives a new characterization of existence of a complete hyperbolic metric on a

wind-blown bubble NGC6888 around WR136. We use Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE), Spitzer IRAC and MIPS and Herschel PACS IR images to produce a
sharp view of the distribution of dust around WR136. We complement these IR
photometric observations with Spitzer IRS spectra in the 5-38 $\mu$m wavelength
range. The unprecedented high-resolution IR images allowed us to produce a
clean spectral energy distribution, free of contamination from material along
the line of sight, to model the properties of the dust in NGC6888. We use the
spectral synthesis code Cloudy to produce a model for NGC6888 that consistently
reproduces its optical and IR properties. Our best model requires a double
distribution with the inner shell composed only of gas, whilst the outer shell
requires a mix of gas and dust. The dust consists of two populations of grain
sizes, one with small sized grains $a_\mathrm{small}$=[0.002-0.008] $\mu$m and
another one with large sized grains $a_\mathrm{big}$=[0.05-0.5] $\mu$m. The
population of big grains is similar to that reported for other red supergiants
stars and dominates the total dust mass, which leads us to suggest that the
current mass of NGC6888 is purely due to material ejected from WR136, with a
negligible contribution of swept up interstellar medium. The total mass of this
model is 25.5$^{+4.7}_{-2.8}$ M$_{\odot}$, a dust mass of
$M_\mathrm{dust}=$0.14$^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$, for a dust-to-gas ratio
of $5.6\times10^{-3}$. Accordingly, we suggest that the initial stellar mass of
WR136 was $\lesssim$50 M$_{\odot}$, consistent with current single stellar
evolution models.

self-attention weighted embedding and a mutual-attention weighted embedding.
The similarity between the embeddings is measured by a cosine distance score

particles scale with their volume-square. This unfavorable scaling makes it
extremely difficult to quantitatively characterize intrinsically heterogeneous
clinical samples, such as extracellular vesicles, as their signal variation
easily exceeds the dynamic range of currently available cameras. Here, we
introduce off-axis k-space holography that circumvents this limitation. By
imaging the back-focal-plane of our microscope we project the scattering signal
of all particles onto all camera pixels thus dramatically boosting the
achievable dynamic range to up-to 110 dB. We validate our platform by
detecting, and quantitatively sizing, metallic and dielectric particles over a
200x200 $\mu$m field-of-view and demonstrate that independently performed
signal calibrations allow correctly sizing particles made from different
materials. Finally, we present quantitative size-distributions of extracellular
vesicle samples.

This study utilizes a 1 comoving Mpc$^3$ high-resolution simulation to study
the enrichment process of metal-enriched halos down to $z=9.3$. Our simulation
uniquely tracks the metals ejected from Population III stars, and we use this
information to identify the origin of metals within metal-enriched halos. These
halos show a wide range of metallicities, but we find that the source of metals
for $\gtrsim$ 50\% of metal-enriched halos is supernova explosions of
Population III stars occuring outside their virial radii. The results presented
here indicate that external enrichment by metal-free stars dominates the
enrichment process of halos with virial mass below $10^{6}\,M_\odot$ down to
$z=9.3$. Despite the prevalence of external enrichment in low mass halos, Pop
II stars forming due to external enrichment are rare because of the small
contribution of low-mass halos to the global star formation rate combined with
low metallicities towards the center of these halos resulting from metal ejecta
from external sources mixing from the outside-in. The enriched stars that do
form through this process have absolute metallicities below $10^{-3}\,Z_\odot$.
We also find that the fraction of externally enriched halos increases with
time, $\sim 90\%$ of halos that are externally enriched have $M_\mathrm{vir} <
10^6\,M_\odot$, and that pair-instability supernovae contribute the most to the
enrichment of the IGM as a whole and are thus are the predominant supernova

is important to verify and understand the reasons why a particular output is
produced. Although feature importance calculation approaches assist in
interpretation, there is a lack of consensus regarding how features' importance
is quantified, which makes the explanations offered for the outcomes mostly
unreliable. A possible solution to address the lack of agreement is to combine
the results from multiple feature importance quantifiers to reduce the variance
of estimates. Our hypothesis is that this will lead to more robust and
trustworthy interpretations of the contribution of each feature to machine
learning predictions. To assist test this hypothesis, we propose an extensible
Framework divided in four main parts: (i) traditional data pre-processing and
preparation for predictive machine learning models; (ii) predictive machine
learning; (iii) feature importance quantification and (iv) feature importance
decision fusion using an ensemble strategy. We also introduce a novel fusion
metric and compare it to the state-of-the-art. Our approach is tested on
synthetic data, where the ground truth is known. We compare different fusion
approaches and their results for both training and test sets. We also
investigate how different characteristics within the datasets affect the
feature importance ensembles studied. Results show that our feature importance
ensemble Framework overall produces 15% less feature importance error compared
to existing methods. Additionally, results reveal that different levels of
noise in the datasets do not affect the feature importance ensembles' ability
to accurately quantify feature importance, whereas the feature importance
quantification error increases with the number of features and number of
orthogonal informative features.

  We consider the symmetric group, $S_n$, one of the most basic non-product

this inequality to bound the size of global, product-free sets in the

and the planet's evolution is simulated up to the present epoch. The growth
from a small embryo until gas accretion overtakes solids' accretion was
presented by D'Angelo et al. (Icarus 2014, 241, 298). Those calculations
followed the formation for $4\times 10^{5}$ years, until the heavy-element and
H/He masses were $M_{Z}\approx 7.3$ and $M_{XY}\approx 0.15$ Earth's masses
($M_{\oplus}$), respectively, and $dM_{XY}/dt\approx dM_{Z}/dt$. The
calculation is continued through the phase when $M_{XY}=M_{Z}$, at which age,
about $2.4\times 10^{6}$ years, the planet mass is $M_{p}\approx
20\,M_{\oplus}$. About $9\times 10^{5}$ years later, $M_{p}$ is approximately
$60\,M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{Z}\approx 16\,M_{\oplus}$. Around this epoch, the
contraction of the envelope dictates gas accretion rates a few times
$10^{-3}\,M_{\oplus}$ per year, initiating the regime of disk-limited
accretion, when the planet's evolution is tied to disk's evolution. Growth is
continued by constructing simplified models of accretion disks that evolve
through viscous diffusion, winds, and accretion on the planet. Jupiter's
formation ends after $\approx 3.4$-$4.2$ Myr, when nebula gas disperses. The
young Jupiter is $4.5$-$5.5$ times as voluminous as it is presently and
thousands of times as luminous, $\sim 10^{-5}\,L_{\odot}$. The heavy-element
mass is $\approx 20\,M_{\oplus}$. The evolution proceeds through the cooling
and contraction phase, in isolation except for solar irradiation. After $4570$
Myr, radius and luminosity of the planet are within $10$% of current values.
During formation, and soon thereafter, the planet exhibits features, e.g.,
luminosity and effective temperature, that may probe aspects of the latter
stages of formation, if observable. These possibly distinctive features,
however, seem to disappear within a few tens of Myr.

Europe (CESEE) -- a region that experienced a substantial boom-bust cycle in
capital flows amid the global financial crisis and where policymakers had been
quite active in adopting MPPs already before that crisis. To study the dynamic
responses of capital flows to MPP shocks, we propose a novel regime-switching

potential structural breaks in the policy regime and to control -- besides
domestic macroeconomic quantities -- for the impact of global factors such as
the global financial cycle. Feeding into this model a novel intensity-adjusted

delay minimization in multi-user NOMA-MEC networks, where multiple users can

the partial offloading policy, in which each user can partition its computation
task into offloading and locally computing parts. We aim to minimize the task
delay among users by optimizing their tasks partition ratios and offloading
transmit power. The delay minimization problem is first formulated, and it is
shown that it is a nonconvex one. By carefully investigating its structure, we
transform the original problem into an equivalent quasi-convex. In this way, a
bisection search iterative algorithm is proposed in order to achieve the

generalize quantum mechanics by relaxing the axioms. Here, we discuss possible
extensions of quantum mechanics within a general epistemic framework based on
an operational scheme of estimation of momentum given positions under epistemic
restriction. The epistemic restriction is parameterized by a
global-nonseparable random variable on the order of Planck constant, an ontic
extension to the separable classical phase space variables. Within the
estimation scheme, the canonical quantum laws is reconstructed for a specific
estimator and estimation error. In the present work, keeping the Born's
quadratic law intact, we construct a class of nonlinear variants of
Schr\""odinger equation and generalized Heisenberg uncertainty principle within
the estimation scheme by assuming a more general class of estimation errors.
The nonlinearity of the Schr\""odinger equation and the deviation from the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle thus have a common transparent operational
origin in terms of generalizations of estimation errors. We then argue that a
broad class of nonlinearities and deviations from Heisenberg uncertainty
principle arise from estimation errors violating a plausible
inferential-causality principle of estimation independence which is respected
by the standard quantum mechanics. This result therefore constrains possible
extensions of quantum mechanics, and suggests directions to generalize quantum
mechanics which comply with the principle of estimation independence.

considerable attention from researchers. Numerical algorithms such as Genetic
Algorithms (GAs) are powerful tools that allow to perform global optimization.
These algorithms are particularly of great interest in complex optimization
problems where cost functionals may lack smoothness and regularity. In
turbulent flow optimization, the hybridization of GA with high fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely demanding in terms of
computational time and memory storage. Thus, alternative approaches aiming to
alleviate these requirements are of great interest. Nowadays, data driven
approaches gained attention due to their potential in predicting flow solutions
based only on preexisting data. In the present paper, we propose a near-real
time data-driven genetic algorithm (DDGA) for inverse parameter identification
problems involving turbulent flows. In this optimization framework, the
parametrized flow data are used in their reduced form obtained by the POD
(Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) and solutions prediction is made by
interpolating the temporal and the spatial POD subspaces through a recently
developed Riemannian barycentric interpolation. The validation of the proposed
optimization approach is carried out in the parameter identification problem of
the turbulent mixed-convection flow in a cavity. The objective is to determine
the inflow temperature and inflow velocity corresponding to a given temperature
distribution in a restricted area of the spatial domain. The results show that
the proposed genetic programming optimization framework is able to deliver good
approximations of the optimal solutions within less than two minutes.

that it is difficult to construct a proper affinity matrix and determine the

SA-Net to overcome these weaknesses and achieve improved image clustering by
extending the spectral analysis procedure into a deep learning framework with
multiple layers. The SA-Net has the capability to learn deep representations
and reveal deep correlations among data samples. Compared with the existing
spectral analysis, the SA-Net achieves two advantages: (i) Given the fact that
one spectral analysis procedure can only deal with one subset of the given
dataset, our proposed SA-Net elegantly integrates multiple parallel and
consecutive spectral analysis procedures together to enable interactive
learning across different units towards a coordinated clustering model; (ii)
Our SA-Net can identify the local similarities among different images at patch

proposed recommendation strategy. BM25 and Word2vec with VSM are implemented as
the baseline models for the recommendation. Then the term function information
is applied to enhance the performance. Findings: The experiments show that the
term function-based methods outperform the baseline methods regarding the
recall, precision, and F1-score measurement, demonstrating that term functions
are useful in identifying valuable citations. Research limitations: The dataset
is insufficient due to the complexity of annotating citation functions for
paragraphs in the related studies section. More recent deep learning models
should be performed to future validate the proposed approach. Practical
implications: The citation recommendation strategy can be helpful for valuable
citation discovery, semantic scientific retrieval, and automatic literature
review generation. Originality/value: The proposed citation function-based
citation recommendation can generate intuitive explanations of the results for
users, improving the transparency, persuasiveness, and effectiveness of
recommender systems.

  propagators","Master's thesis (Advisor: Orlando Oliveira), 90 pages, 47 figures.
  Main source of arXiv:2008.02614",,,,"hep-lat hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a Quantum Field Theory, the analytic structure of the 2-points correlation
functions, ie the propagators, encloses information about the properties of the
corresponding quanta, particularly if they are or not confined. However, in
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), we can only have an analytic solution in a
perturbative picture of the theory. For the non-perturbative propagators, one
resorts on numerical solutions of QCD that accesses specific regions of the
Euclidean momentum space, as, for example, those computed via Monte Carlo
simulations on the lattice. In the present work, we rely on Pad\'e Approximants
(PA) to approximate the numerical data for the gluon and ghost propagators, and
investigate their analytic structures. In a first stage, the advantages of
using PAs are explored when reproducing the properties of a function, focusing
on its analytic structure. The use of PA sequences is tested for the
perturbative solutions of the propagators, and a residue analysis is performed
to help in the identification of the analytic structure. A technique used to
approximate a PA to a discrete set of points is proposed and tested for some
test data sets. Finally, the methodology is applied to the Landau gauge gluon
and ghost propagators, obtained via lattice simulations. The results identify a
conjugate pair of complex poles for the gluon propagator, that is associated
with the infrared structure of the theory. This is in line with the presence of
singularities for complex momenta in theories where confinement is observed.
Regarding the ghost propagator, a pole at $p^2=0$ is identified. For both
propagators, a branch cut is found on the real negative $p^2$-axis, which
recovers the perturbative analysis at high momenta.

tasks are simultaneously learned by a shared model. Such approaches offer
advantages like improved data efficiency, reduced overfitting through shared

However, the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks presents new design and
optimization challenges, and choosing which tasks should be learned jointly is
in itself a non-trivial problem. In this survey, we give an overview of
multi-task learning methods for deep neural networks, with the aim of
summarizing both the well-established and most recent directions within the
field. Our discussion is structured according to a partition of the existing
deep MTL techniques into three groups: architectures, optimization methods, and
task relationship learning. We also provide a summary of common multi-task
benchmarks.

  Segmentation","6 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted by ICPR",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of methods based on deep learning have been applied to medical image
segmentation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Due to the
importance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for
state-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting soft tissue on the
chest x-rays. The dataset for exploring best segmentation model is from
Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous
technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the
Chest X-rays. However, most variant U-Nets mainly focus on extraction of
contextual information and skip connections. There is still a large space for
improving extraction of spatial features. In this paper, we propose a dual
encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception
Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected
recurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating contextual feature
extraction. In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation
of features, the inception blocks with dilation are adopted. The inception
blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information from various
receptive fields. At the same time, the two paths are fused by summing
features, thus preserving the contextual and spatial information for decoding
part. This multi-learning-scale model is benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from
two different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net
achieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net,
R2U-Net and attention R2U-Net. This model has proved the feasibility for mixed
dataset and approaches state-of-the-art. The source code for this proposed
framework is public https://github.com/uceclz0/DEFU-Net.

optimal for discriminating its different states. Quantifying observability
requires knowledge of the equations governing the dynamics. These equations are
often unknown when experimental data are considered. Consequently, we propose
an approach for numerically assessing observability using Delay Differential
Analysis (DDA). Given a time series, DDA uses a delay differential equation for
approximating the measured data. The lower the least squares error between the
predicted and recorded data, the higher the observability. We thus rank the
variables of several chaotic systems according to their corresponding least
square error to assess observability. The performance of our approach is
evaluated by comparison with the ranking provided by the symbolic observability
coefficients as well as with two other data-based approaches using reservoir
computing and singular value decomposition of the reconstructed space. We
investigate the robustness of our approach against noise contamination.

  recognition system",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of this project is to create an inexpensive, lightweight, wearable
assistive device that can measure hand or finger movements accurately enough to
identify a range of hand gestures. One eventual application is to provide
assistive technology and sign language detection for the hearing impaired. My
system, called LiTe (Light-based Technology), uses optical fibers embedded into
a wristband. The wrist is an optimal place for the band since the light
propagation in the optical fibers is impacted even by the slight movements of
the tendons in the wrist when gestures are performed. The prototype
incorporates light dependent resistors to measure these light propagation
changes. When creating LiTe, I considered a variety of fiber materials, light
frequencies, and physical shapes to optimize the tendon movement detection so
that it can be accurately correlated with different gestures. I implemented and
evaluated two approaches for gesture recognition. The first uses an algorithm
that combines moving averages of sensor readings with gesture sensor reading
signatures to determine the current gesture. The second uses a neural network
trained on a labelled set of gesture readings to recognize gestures. Using the
signature-based approach, I was able to achieve a 99.8% accuracy at recognizing
distinct gestures. Using the neural network the recognition accuracy was 98.8%.
This shows that high accuracy is feasible using both approaches. The results
indicate that this novel method of using fiber optics-based sensors is a
promising first step to creating a gesture recognition system.

conditions (CC) of the Killing operator for the Minkowski (M) , Schwarzschild
(S) and Kerr (K) metrics. They discovered second order CC, well known for M,
but also third order CC for S and K. In a recent paper, we have studied the
cases of M and S, without using specific technical tools such as Teukolski
scalars or Killing-Yano tensors. However, even if S($m$) and K($m,a$) are
depending on constant parameters in such a way that S $\rightarrow $ M when $m
\rightarrow 0$ and K $\rightarrow$ S when $ a \rightarrow 0$, the CC of S do
not provide the CC of M when $m \rightarrow 0$ while the CC of K do not provide
the CC of S when $a\rightarrow 0$. In this paper, using tricky motivating
examples of operators with constant or variable parameters, we explain why the
CC are depending on the choice of the parameters. In particular, the only
purely intrinsic objects that can be defined, namely the extension modules, may
change drastically. As the algebroid bracket is compatible with the {\it
prolongation/projection} (PP) procedure, we provide for the first time all the
CC for K in an intrinsic way, showing that they only depend on the underlying
Killing algebras and that the role played by the Spencer operator is crucial.
We get K$<$S$<$M with $2 < 4 < 10$ for the Killing algebras and explain why the
formal search of the CC for M, S or K are strikingly different, even though
each Spencer sequence is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Poincar\'{e}
sequence for the exterior derivative by the corresponding Lie algebra.

witnessed immense research interest both fundamentally and technologically in a
wide range of subject areas in physics and engineering. One significant example
of the principal emerging fields in this context is the PT symmetric wireless
applications using multiple coils that are spatially separated but mutually
coupled with position-dependent coupling strength. Such a spatial PT
configuration limits the flexibility and miniaturization of the PT symmetric
designs. As far as this is concerned, inspired by scattering induced two
opposite whispering-gallery (WG) modes in an optical resonator, analogously
here we experimentally demonstrate a specially constructed second-order (2-nd
order) PT symmetry in a single coil resonator, whose currents with two
different directions are excited by internal bypass capacitor. Our proposed
structure has the following peculiar feature: First, the bypass capacitor
induces coupling in spectral resonances allow us to observe a 2-nd order phase
transition between symmetry regimes, without the need of a second coil in the
spatial PT case. Under this circumstance, this specially constructed PT
symmetry can be regarded as synthetic PT symmetry, which is enabled by coupling
modes with different directions. Second, by introducing two or more internal
bypass capacitors, the synthetic high-order PT symmetric system bearing such as
third-order exceptional point in a single coil resonator can be realized. These
results will provide a new paradigm to realize higher-order PT symmetry towards
the investigation of non-Hermitian physics in a synthetic perspective, which
can be extended to other physical platforms such as optics and acoustics.

specific direction and have a wide range of applications in filters, sensors,
and energy-transfer devices. However, given the increasing demand for planar
integrated photonics, new waveguides are required with excellent
characteristics such as more functionality, greater efficiency, and smaller
size. In this work, we report the experimental results for a subwavelength
planar microwave-regime waveguide fabricated from circuit-based magnetic
hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) and develop the associated theory. HMM is a
special type of anisotropic metamaterial whose isofrequency contour (IFC) takes
the form of an open hyperboloid. Because of the open-dispersion IFCs, HMMs
support propagating high-k modes with large effective refractive indices, which
allows planar hyperbolic waveguides to be miniaturized. In particular, as
opposed to the traditional dielectric slab waveguide, the group velocity of the
hyperbolic guided modes is negative-a characteristic that can be exploited to
realize the backward propagation of electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we
study the abnormal photonic spin Hall effect and experimentally demonstrate an
ultracompact backward coupler based on hyperbolic waveguides. The experimental
results are consistent with numerical simulations. This work not only reveals
the significant potential of circuit-based platforms for the experimental study
of the propagation and coupling of guided modes but also promotes the use of
HMMs in the microwave regime for numerous integrated functional devices.
