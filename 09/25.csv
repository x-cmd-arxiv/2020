  Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Bluetooth standard specifies two transports: Bluetooth Classic (BT) for
high-throughput wireless services and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for very
low-power scenarios. BT and BLE have dedicated pairing protocols and devices
have to pair over BT and BLE to use both securely. In 2014, the Bluetooth
standard (v4.2) addressed this usability issue by introducing Cross-Transport
Key Derivation (CTKD). CTKD allows establishing BT and BLE pairing keys just by
pairing over one of the two transports. While CTKD crosses the security
boundary between BT and BLE, little is known about the internals of CTKD and
its security implications.
  In this work, we present the first complete description of CTKD obtained by
merging the scattered information from the Bluetooth standard with the results
from our reverse-engineering experiments. Then, we perform a security
evaluation of CTKD and uncover four cross-transport issues in its
specification. We leverage these issues to design four standard-compliant
attacks on CTKD enabling new ways to exploit Bluetooth (e.g., exploiting BT and
BLE by targeting only one of the two). Our attacks work even if the strongest
security mechanism for BT and BLE are in place, including Numeric Comparison
and Secure Connections. They allow to impersonate, man-in-the-middle, and
establish unintended sessions with arbitrary devices. We refer to our attacks
as BLUR attacks, as they blur the security boundary between BT and BLE. We
provide a low-cost implementation of the BLUR attacks and we successfully
evaluate them on 14 devices with 16 unique Bluetooth chips from popular
vendors. We discuss the attacks' root causes and present effective
countermeasures to fix them. We disclosed our findings and countermeasures to
the Bluetooth SIG in May 2020 (CVE-2020-15802), and we reported additional
unmitigated issues in May 2021.

signals for both standard single diffusion encoding (SDE) and more advanced
double diffusion encoding (DDE) measurements using numerical simulations. The
aim is to study the ability of dMRI/dMRS to characterize the complex morphology
of brain grey matter, focusing on these two distinctive features. To this end,
we employ a recently developed framework to create realistic meshes for Monte
Carlo simulations, covering a wide range of soma sizes and branching orders of
cellular projections, for diffusivities reflecting both water and metabolites.
For SDE sequences, we assess the impact of soma size and branching order on the
signal b-value dependence as well as the time dependence of the apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC). For DDE sequences, we assess their impact on the
mixing time dependence of the signal angular modulation and of the estimated
microscopic anisotropy, a promising contrast derived from DDE measurements. The
SDE results show that soma size has a measurable impact on both the b-value and
diffusion time dependence, for both water and metabolites. On the other hand,
branching order has little impact on either, especially for water. In contrast,
the DDE results show that soma size has a measurable impact on the signal
angular modulation at short mixing times and the branching order significantly
impacts the mixing time dependence of the signal angular modulation as well as
of the derived microscopic anisotropy, for both water and metabolites. Our
results confirm that soma size can be estimated from SDE based techniques, and
most importantly, show for the first time that DDE measurements show
sensitivity to the branching of cellular projections, paving the way for
non-invasive characterization of grey matter morphology.

that neural systems reach such a state by self-organizing towards the critical
point of a dynamical phase transition. Here, we study a minimal neural network
model that exhibits self-organized criticality in the presence of stochastic
noise using a rewiring rule which only utilizes local information. For network
evolution, incoming links are added to a node or deleted, depending on the
node's average activity. Based on this rewiring-rule only, the network evolves
towards a critcal state, showing typical power-law distributed avalanche
statistics. The observed exponents are in accord with criticality as predicted
by dynamical scaling theory, as well as with the observed exponents of neural
avalanches. The critical state of the model is reached autonomously without
need for parameter tuning, is independent of initial conditions, is robust
under stochastic noise, and independent of details of the implementation as
different variants of the model indicate. We argue that this supports the
hypothesis that real neural systems may utilize similar mechanisms to
self-organize towards criticality especially during early developmental stages.

(CMPD) of the Kepler field was recently revealed, thanks to data from Gaia and
Kepler spacecraft. It was found that redder and brighter stars are spinning
slower than the rest of the main sequence. On the theoretical side, it was
demonstrated that metallicity should affect the rotational evolution of stars
as well as their evolution in the Hertzprung-R\""ussel or Color-Magnitude
diagram. In this work we combine this dataset with medium and high resolution
spectroscopic metallicities and carefully select main sequence single stars in
a given mass range. We show that the structure seen in the CMPD also
corresponds to a broad correlation between metallicity and rotation, such that
stars with higher metallicity rotate on average more slowly than those with low
metallicity. We compare this sample to theoretical rotational evolution models
that include a range of different metallicities. They predict a correlation
between rotation rate and metallicity that is in the same direction and of
about the same magnitude as that observed. Therefore metallicity appears to be
a key parameter to explain the observed rotation period distributions. We also
discuss a few different ways in which metallicity can affect the observed
distribution of rotation period, due to observational biases and age
distributions, as well as the effect on stellar wind torques.

$m/k$ sized parts, one per hash function. Contrary to hardware designs, where
they prevail, software implementations mostly adopt standard Bloom filters,
considering partitioned filters slightly worse, due to the slightly larger
false positive rate (FPR). In this paper, by performing an in-depth analysis,
first we show that the FPR advantage of standard Bloom filters is smaller than
thought; more importantly, by studying the per-element FPR, we show that
standard Bloom filters have weak spots in the domain: elements which will be
tested as false positives much more frequently than expected. This is relevant
in scenarios where an element is tested against many filters, e.g., in packet
forwarding. Moreover, standard Bloom filters are prone to exhibit extremely
weak spots if naive double hashing is used, something occurring in several,
even mainstream, libraries. Partitioned Bloom filters exhibit a uniform
distribution of the FPR over the domain and are robust to the naive use of
double hashing, having no weak spots. Finally, by surveying several usages
other than testing set membership, we point out the many advantages of having
disjoint parts: they can be individually sampled, extracted, added or retired,
leading to superior designs for, e.g., SIMD usage, size reduction, test of set
disjointness, or duplicate detection in streams. Partitioned Bloom filters are
better, and should replace the standard form, both in general purpose libraries
and as the base for novel designs.

of Parameterized Complexity and proved, among other things, that it admits an
\FPT\ algorithm running in time $(d + k)^{2k} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)} =
2^{\mathcal{O}(k \log (k+d) )} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and remains \NP-hard
for every constant $d \ge 2$ (Acta Informatica $(2014)$). We present a
different \FPT\ algorithm that runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(dk)} \cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. In particular, our algorithm runs in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k)} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for every fixed $d$. In the same
article, the authors asked whether the problem admits a polynomial kernel, when
parameterized by $k + d$. We answer this question in the negative and prove
that it does not admit a polynomial compression unless $\NP \subseteq
\coNP/poly$.

propagation model for an indoor environment, operating at a transmission

previous works on well-known indoor path loss models are discussed. Then, the
path loss produced by the intervening walls in the propagation path is
measured, and the terms representing the loss factors in the theoretical

therefore, remains an important task to identify the most accurate, while
computationally economic, Hamiltonian formulation(s) in such theories,
considering the necessary truncation imposed on the Hilbert space of gauge
bosons with any finite computing resources. This paper is a first step toward
addressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs, which further require
the imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing
additional computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1+1 D
coupled to matter, a number of different formulations of the original
Kogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the dependence of the
dimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system's size,
and the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons. The impact of such
dependencies on the accuracy of the spectrum and dynamics is examined, and the
(classical) computational-resource requirements given these considerations are
studied. Besides the well-known angular-momentum formulation of the theory, the
cases of purely fermionic and purely bosonic formulations (with open boundary
conditions), and the Loop-String-Hadron formulation are analyzed, along with a
brief discussion of a Quantum Link Model of the same theory. Clear advantages
are found in working with the Loop-String-Hadron framework which implements
non-Abelian Gauss's laws a priori using a complete set of gauge-invariant

substantially altered. This transition takes place at a non-zero value of the

Multivariate models exist that account for within-study correlations and
between-study heterogeneity. The number of parameters that must be estimated in
existing models is quadratic in the number of variates (e.g., risk factors).
This means they may not be usable if data are sparse with many variates and few

The number of parameters that must be estimated in this model scales linearly
in the number of variates and quadratically in the dimension of the
approximating space, making estimation more tractable. We performed a

the presence of superconducting proximity, spin-orbit coupling, and Zeeman

decisively distinguish between trivial and topological Majorana scenarios in
the presence of chemical potential inhomogeneity and random impurity disorder.
We calculate the local electrical as well as nonlocal electrical and thermal
conductance of the pristine nanowire (good zero-bias conductance peaks), the
nanowire in the presence of quantum dots and inhomogeneous potential (bad
zero-bias conductance peaks), and the nanowire in the presence of large
disorder (ugly zero-bias conductance peaks). The local conductance by itself is
incapable of distinguishing the trivial states from the topological states
since zero-bias conductance peaks are generic in the presence of disorder and
inhomogeneous potential. The nonlocal conductance, which in principle is
capable of providing the bulk gap closing and reopening information at the
topological quantum phase transition, is found to be far too weak in magnitude
to be particularly useful in the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous
potential. Therefore, we focus on the question of whether the combination of
the local, nonlocal electrical, and thermal conductance can separate the good,
bad, and ugly zero-bias conductance peaks in finite-length wires. Our paper
aims to provide a guide to future experiments, and we conclude that a
combination of all three measurements would be necessary for a decisive
demonstration of topological Majorana zero modes in nanowires -- positive
signals corresponding to just one kind of measurements are likely to be false
positives arising from disorder and inhomogeneous potential.

labeling process is infallible, and the accuracy of many SSL classifiers
decreases significantly in the presence of label noise. In this work, we
introduce the LGC_LVOF, a leave-one-out filtering approach based on the Local

wrong labels, and thus can be used as a preprocessing step to any SSL
classifier. Given the propagation matrix, detecting noisy labels takes O(cl)
per step, with c the number of classes and l the number of labels. Moreover,
one does not need to compute the whole propagation matrix, but only an $l$ by
$l$ submatrix corresponding to interactions between labeled instances. As a
result, our approach is best suited to datasets with a large amount of
unlabeled data but not many labels. Results are provided for a number of
datasets, including MNIST and ISOLET. LGCLVOF appears to be equally or more
precise than the adapted gradient-based filter. We show that the best-case

of classes that were not seen during training. To address this challenging
task, most ZSL methods relate unseen test classes to seen(training) classes via
a pre-defined set of attributes that can describe all classes in the same
semantic space, so the knowledge learned on the training classes can be adapted
to unseen classes. In this paper, we aim to optimize the attribute space for
ZSL by training a propagation mechanism to refine the semantic attributes of
each class based on its neighbors and related classes on a graph of classes. We
show that the propagated attributes can produce classifiers for zero-shot
classes with significantly improved performance in different ZSL settings. The
graph of classes is usually free or very cheap to acquire such as WordNet or
ImageNet classes. When the graph is not provided, given pre-defined semantic
embeddings of the classes, we can learn a mechanism to generate the graph in an
end-to-end manner along with the propagation mechanism. However, this
graph-aided technique has not been well-explored in the literature. In this
paper, we introduce the attribute propagation network (APNet), which is
composed of 1) a graph propagation model generating attribute vector for each
class and 2) a parameterized nearest neighbor (NN) classifier categorizing an
image to the class with the nearest attribute vector to the image's embedding.
For better generalization over unseen classes, different from previous methods,
we adopt a meta-learning strategy to train the propagation mechanism and the
similarity metric for the NN classifier on multiple sub-graphs, each associated
with a classification task over a subset of training classes. In experiments
with two zero-shot learning settings and five benchmark datasets, APNet
achieves either compelling performance or new state-of-the-art results.

distribution (QKD) with orbiting satellites. Established techniques use
attenuated lasers as weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources, with so-called
decoy-state protocols, to generate the required single-photon-level pulses.
While such approaches are elegant, they come at the expense of attainable final
key due to inherent multi-photon emission, thereby constraining secure key
generation over the high-loss, noisy channels expected for satellite
transmissions. In this work we improve on this limitation by using true
single-photon pulses generated from a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) embedded
in a nanowire, possessing low multi-photon emission ($<10^{-6}$) and an
extraction system efficiency of -15 dB (or 3.1%). Despite the limited
efficiency, the key generated by the QD source is greater than that generated
by a WCP source under identical repetition rate and link conditions
representative of a satellite pass. We predict that with realistic improvements
of the QD extraction efficiency to -4.0 dB (or 40%), the quantum-dot QKD
protocol outperforms WCP-decoy-state QKD by almost an order of magnitude.
Consequently, a QD source could allow generation of a secure key in conditions
where a WCP source would simply fail, such as in the case of high channel
losses. Our demonstration is the first specific use case that shows a clear
benefit for QD-based single-photon sources in secure quantum communication, and
has the potential to enhance the viability and efficiency of satellite-based
QKD networks.

successful in describing the non-linear dynamics not only of black branes, but
also of compact black objects which are encoded as solitary Gaussian-shaped
lumps, {\it blobs}. For a rigidly rotating ansatz, in addition to axisymmetric
deformed branches, various non-axisymmetric solutions have been found, such as
black bars, which only stay stationary in the large $D$ limit.
  In this article, we demonstrate the blob approximation has a wider range of
applicability by formulating the interaction between blobs and subsequent
dynamics. We identify that this interaction occurs via thin necks connecting
blobs. Especially, black strings are well captured in this approximation
sufficiently away from the perturbative regime. Highly deformed black dumbbells
and ripples are also found to be tractable in the approximation. By defining
the local quantities, the effective force acting on distant blobs are evaluated
as well. These results reveal that the large $D$ effective theory is capable of
describing not only individual black holes but also the gravitational
interactions between them, as a full dynamical theory of interactive blobs,

the construction of interpolating operators which can be used to construct a

other applications of lattice QCD to two nucleons in the literature. It also
allows for a variational analysis in which optimal linear combinations of the

design and analysis stages are highly encouraged by regulatory agencies. A
recent trend is to use a model-assisted approach for covariate adjustment to
gain credibility and efficiency while producing asymptotically valid inference
even when the model is incorrect. In this article we present three
considerations for better practice when model-assisted inference is applied to
adjust for covariates under simple or covariate-adaptive randomized trials: (1)
guaranteed efficiency gain: a model-assisted method should often gain but never
hurt efficiency; (2) wide applicability: a valid procedure should be
applicable, and preferably universally applicable, to all commonly used
randomization schemes; (3) robust standard error: variance estimation should be
robust to model misspecification and heteroscedasticity. To achieve these, we
recommend a model-assisted estimator under an analysis of heterogeneous
covariance working model including all covariates utilized in randomization.
Our conclusions are based on an asymptotic theory that provides a clear picture
of how covariate-adaptive randomization and regression adjustment alter
statistical efficiency. Our theory is more general than the existing ones in
terms of studying arbitrary functions of response means (including linear
contrasts, ratios, and odds ratios), multiple arms, guaranteed efficiency gain,
optimality, and universal applicability.

present a review of the state-of-the-art of measuring the coefficient of the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the DMI constant $D$, focusing on systems
where the interaction arises from the interface between two materials (i.e.
interfacial DMI). We give an overview of the experimental techniques as well as
their theoretical background and models for the quantification of the DMI
constant. The measurement techniques are divided into three categories: a)
domain wall-based measurements, b) spin wave-based measurements and c)
spin-orbit torque-based measurements. We analyze the advantages and
disadvantages of each method and compare $D$ values at different interfaces.
The review aims to obtain a better understanding of the applicability of the
different techniques to various stacks and of the origin of apparent
disagreements among literature values.

wide parameter ranges in masses and orbital elements can be dynamically
unstable and ruled out. We present a case study of Kepler-23, a compact
three-planet system where constraints from stability, transit timing variations
(TTVs), and transit durations can be directly compared. We find that in this
tightly packed system, stability can place upper limits on the masses and
orbital eccentricities of the bodies that are comparable to or tighter than
current state of the art methods. Specifically, stability places 68% upper
limits on the orbital eccentricities of 0.09, 0.04, and 0.05 for planets $b$,
$c$ and $d$, respectively. These constraints correspond to radial velocity
signals $\lesssim 20$ cm/s, are significantly tighter to those from transit
durations, and comparable to those from TTVs. Stability also yields 68% upper
limits on the masses of planets $b$, $c$ and $d$ of 2.2, 16.1, and 5.8
$M_\oplus$, respectively, which were competitive with TTV constraints for the
inner and outer planets. Performing this stability constrained characterization
is computationally expensive with N-body integrations. We show that SPOCK, the
Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier, is able to faithfully
approximate the N-body results over 4000 times faster. We argue that such
stability constrained characterization of compact systems is a challenging
""needle-in-a-haystack"" problem (requiring removal of 2500 unstable
configurations for every stable one for our adopted priors) and we offer
several practical recommendations for such stability analyses.

electron-correlated antiferromagnetic Mott insulators (AFMI) where localized
spins form a ground state quite different from the unentangled N\'{e}el state
$|\!\! \uparrow \downarrow \ldots \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$. The true ground
state is entangled by quantum spin fluctuations, leading to expectation value
of all localized spins being zero, so that LLG dynamics of classical vectors of
fixed length rotating due to STT cannot even be initiated. Instead, a fully
quantum treatment of both conduction electrons and localized spins is necessary
to capture exchange of spin angular momentum between them, denoted as quantum
STT. We use a recently developed time-dependent density matrix renormalization

interaction and possibly small interlayer hopping -- which mimics, e.g.,
topological-insulator/NiO bilayer employed experimentally -- will induce
nonzero expectation value of AFMI localized spins. This new nonequilibrium

To estimate the impact of removing a parameter, these methods use importance
measures that were originally designed to prune trained models. Despite lacking
justification for their use early-on in training, such measures result in
surprisingly low accuracy loss. To better explain this behavior, we develop a
general framework that uses gradient flow to unify state-of-the-art importance
measures through the norm of model parameters. We use this framework to
determine the relationship between pruning measures and evolution of model
parameters, establishing several results related to pruning models early-on in
training: (i) magnitude-based pruning removes parameters that contribute least
to reduction in loss, resulting in models that converge faster than
magnitude-agnostic methods; (ii) loss-preservation based pruning preserves
first-order model evolution dynamics and is therefore appropriate for pruning
minimally trained models; and (iii) gradient-norm based pruning affects
second-order model evolution dynamics, such that increasing gradient norm via
pruning can produce poorly performing models. We validate our claims on several

the sum of weighted completion times, or a norm of the load vector, are among
the oldest and most fundamental tasks in combinatorial optimization. Since all
of these problems are in general NP-hard, much attention has been given to the
regime where there is only a small number $k$ of job types, but possibly the
number of jobs $n$ is large; this is the few job types, high-multiplicity
regime. Despite many positive results, the hardness boundary of this regime was
not understood until now.
  We show that makespan minimization on uniformly related machines
($Q|HM|C_{\max}$) is NP-hard already with $6$ job types, and that the related
Cutting Stock problem is NP-hard already with $8$ item types. For the more
general unrelated machines model ($R|HM|C_{\max}$), we show that if either the
largest job size $p_{\max}$, or the number of jobs $n$ are polynomially bounded
in the instance size $|I|$, there are algorithms with complexity
$|I|^{\textrm{poly}(k)}$. Our main result is that this is unlikely to be
improved, because $Q||C_{\max}$ is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ already when
$n$, $p_{\max}$, and the numbers describing the speeds are polynomial in $|I|$;
the same holds for $R|HM|C_{\max}$ (without speeds) when the job sizes matrix
has rank $2$. Our positive and negative results also extend to the objectives
$\ell_2$-norm minimization of the load vector and, partially, sum of weighted
completion times $\sum w_j C_j$.
  Along the way, we answer affirmatively the question whether makespan
minimization on identical machines ($P||C_{\max}$) is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by $k$, extending our understanding of this fundamental problem.
Together with our hardness results for $Q||C_{\max}$ this implies that the
complexity of $P|HM|C_{\max}$ is the only remaining open case.

auction, where a revenue-maximizing seller sells one item to $n$ buyers with
independent private values. In addition, we have an intermediary who knows the
buyers' private values, and can map these to a public signal so as to increase
consumer surplus. This model generalizes the single-buyer setting proposed by
Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris, who present a signaling scheme that raises the
optimal consumer surplus, by guaranteeing that the item is always sold and the
seller gets the same revenue as without signaling. Our work aims to understand
how this result ports to the setting with multiple buyers.
  We likewise define the benchmark for the optimal consumer surplus: one where
the auction is efficient (i.e., the item is always sold to the highest-valued
buyer) and the revenue of the seller is unchanged. We show that no signaling
scheme can guarantee this benchmark even for $n=2$ buyers with $2$-point
valuation distributions. Indeed, no signaling scheme can be efficient while
preserving any non-trivial fraction of the original consumer surplus, and no
signaling scheme can guarantee consumer surplus better than a factor of
$\frac{1}{2}$ compared to the benchmark. These impossibility results are
existential (beyond computational), and provide a sharp separation between the
single and multi-buyer settings.
  In light of this impossibility, we develop signaling schemes with good
approximation guarantees to the benchmark. Our main technical result is an
$O(1)$-approximation for i.i.d. regular buyers, via signaling schemes that are
conceptually simple and computable in polynomial time. We also present an
extension to the case of general independent distributions.

quantify the image variability on event horizon scales. To address this need,
we analyze M87* data collected with prototype EHT arrays in 2009, 2011, 2012,

analysis and validate our procedures using synthetic data. Applying the same
approach to the observational data sets, we find the M87* morphology in
2009-2017 to be consistent with a persistent asymmetric ring of ~40 uas
diameter. The position angle of the peak intensity varies in time. In
particular, we find a significant difference between the position angle
measured in 2013 and 2017. These variations are in broad agreement with
predictions of a subset of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic

simultaneous discovery by Aubrun, Lami, Palazuelos and Pl\'avala, who
independently proved Barker's conjecture in full generality. We recover their
result for a large class of cones, using completely different techniques.

theory in a parameter that somehow encodes its ""distance"" from the
corresponding non-interacting one was introduced more than thirty years ago,
and has been recently reconsidered in connection with its possible application
to the renormalization of non-hermitian theories. Besides this new and
interesting application, this expansion has special properties already when
applied to ordinary (i.e. hermitian) theories, and in order to disentangle the
peculiarities of the expansion itself from those of non-hermitian theories, it
is worth to push further the investigation limiting first the analysis to
ordinary theories. In the present work we study some aspects related to the
renormalization of a scalar theory within the framework of such an expansion.
Due to its peculiar properties, it turns out that at any finite order in the
expansion parameter the theory looks as non-interacting. We show that when
diagrams of appropriate classes are resummed, this apparent drawback disappears
and the theory recovers its interacting character. In particular we have seen
that with a certain class of diagrams, the weak-coupling expansion results are
recovered, thus establishing a bridge between the two expansions.

what they learn outside the support of the training distribution. Previous
works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks:
while feedforward neural networks, a.k.a. multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), do not
extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) --
structured networks with MLP modules -- have shown some success in more complex
tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under
which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that
ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the
origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most nonlinear
functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the
training distribution is sufficiently ""diverse"". Second, in connection to
analyzing the successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a
hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success
of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or
edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the
architecture or features. Our theoretical analysis builds on a connection of
over-parameterized networks to the neural tangent kernel. Empirically, our
theory holds across different training settings.

results for a sample of nine luminous quasars that were observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the outflows in more than half of the
objects are powerful enough to be the main agents for AGN feedback, and that
most outflows are found at R>100 pc. The sample is representative of the quasar
absorption outflow population as a whole and is unbiased towards specific
ranges of R and kinetic luminosity. Therefore, the analysis results can be
extended to the majority of such objects, including broad absorption line
quasars. We find that these results are consistent with those of another sample
(seven quasars) that is also unbiased towards specific ranges of R and kinetic
luminosity. Assuming that all quasars have absorption outflows, we conclude
that most luminous quasars produce outflows that can contribute significantly
to AGN feedback. We also discuss the criterion for whether an outflow is
energetic enough to cause AGN feedback effects.

can receive contributions from the boundary of the compactified, genus $g$

capture the long distance or infrared behaviour of the amplitude. The boundary
parametrises degenerations of genus $g$ super Riemann surfaces. A holomorphic
projection of the supermoduli space onto its reduced space would then provide a
way to integrate the holomorphic, superstring measure and thereby give the
superstring vacuum amplitude at $g$-loop order. However, such a projection does
not generally exist over the bulk of the supermoduli spaces in higher genera.
Nevertheless, certain boundary divisors in $\partial\overline{\mathfrak M}_g$
may holomorphically map onto a bosonic space upon composition with universal
morphisms, thereby enabling an integration of the holomorphic, superstring

circuit, and, at late times, is related to the partition function of a
frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) type Hamiltonian. Through this mapping,
we show that the inverse of the spectral gap of the RK-Hamiltonian lower bounds
the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ of the underlying circuit. For systems with

we obtain the dispersion of the low-lying excitations of the RK-Hamiltonian in
the continuum limit, which allows us to extract $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$. In
particular, we analytically argue that in a system of length $L$ that conserves
the $m^{th}$ multipole moment, $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ scales subdiffusively as
$L^{2(m+1)}$. We also show that our formalism directly generalizes to higher

high-mass high-redshift galaxies which, according to our models, should not be
able to host SMBHBs. Importantly the GW detection of even one of these
candidates would be an essentially eternal multimessenger system, and
identifying common false positive signals from non-detections will be useful to
filter the data from future large-scale surveys such as LSST.

effective field theory, we discuss renormalization at length from a variety of

approaches, while providing a plethora of examples for clarity. With that
background we can then clearly understand the hierarchy problem, which is
reviewed primarily by introducing and refuting common misconceptions thereof.
We next discuss some of the beautiful classic frameworks to approach the issue.
However, we argue that the LHC data have qualitatively modified the issue into
`The Loerarchy Problem'---how to generate an IR scale without accompanying
visible structure---and we discuss recent work on this approach. In the second
half, we present some of our own work in these directions, beginning with
explorations of how the Neutral Naturalness approach motivates novel signatures
of electroweak naturalness at a variety of physics frontiers. Finally, we
propose a New Trail for Naturalness and suggest that the physical breakdown of
EFT, which gravity demands, may be responsible for the violation of our EFT
expectations at the LHC.

protected by the $C_{2z}T$ symmetry. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 036401] also
pointed out an approximate particle-hole symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$) in the
continuous model of TBG. In this work, we numerically confirm that
$\mathcal{P}$ is indeed a good approximation for TBG and show that the fragile
topology of the two flat bands is enhanced to a $\mathcal{P}$-protected stable

between the middle two bands. The $\mathcal{P}$-protected stable topology is
robust against arbitrary gap closings between the middle two bands the other

realized in lattice models that preserve both $C_{2z}T$ and $\mathcal{P}$

well-sampled abundance patterns for all stars obtained using local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer codes and 1D hydrostatic

LTE may hide several issues, thereby introducing biases in our interpretation
as to the nature of the first stars and the GCE. Hence, we use non-LTE (NLTE)
and correct the abundances using 3D model atmospheres to present a physically
more reliable pattern. In order to infer the nature of the first stars, we
compare unevolved, cool stars, enriched by a single event (`mono-enriched'),
with a set of yield predictions to pin down the mass and energy of the Pop III
progenitor. To date, only few bona fide second generation mono-enriched stars
are known. A simple x^2-fit may bias our inferred mass and energy just as much

an improved fitting technique considering dilution and mixing. Our sample
presents Carbon Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, some of which are promising
true second generation (mono-enriched) stars. The unevolved, dwarf BD+09_2190
shows a mono-enriched signature which, combined with kinematical data,

three shape types: straight (41\,per\,cent), curved (47\,per\,cent) and plume
(12\,per\,cent). Their host galaxies are mostly at late stages of merging,

projection of curved tidal tails accounts for only a small fraction of the
straight tails. We identify 165 tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), yielding a TDG
production rate of 0.36 per merger. Combined with a galaxy merger fraction and
a TDG survival rate from the literature, we estimate that $\sim$\,5\,per\,cent

not an important formation channel for the dwarf galaxies. More than half of
TDGs are located at the tip of their host tails. These TDGs have stellar masses

states to develop an efficient local optimization algorithm to extremize
arbitrary functions on these families of states. The method is based on notions
of gradient descent attuned to the local geometry which also allows for the
implementation of local constraints. The natural group action of the symplectic
and orthogonal group enables us to compute the geometric gradient efficiently.
While our parametrization of states is based on covariance matrices and linear
complex structures, we provide compact formulas to easily convert from and to
other parametrization of Gaussian states, such as wave functions for pure
Gaussian states, quasiprobability distributions and Bogoliubov transformations.
We review applications ranging from approximating ground states to computing
circuit complexity and the entanglement of purification that have both been
employed in the context of holography. Finally, we use the presented methods to
collect numerical and analytical evidence for the conjecture that Gaussian
purifications are sufficient to compute the entanglement of purification of
arbitrary mixed Gaussian states.

of the condensate manifests itself in a sudden increase of luminescence
intensity in a threshold-like manner, and a significant spin-polarizability in
an externally applied magnetic field. Spatial coherence is mapped out via
highly resolved real-space interferometry, revealing a spatially extended

coherent light-sources based on atomically thin crystals, as well as

programming robots for interaction tasks with their environments. Those robots
usually implement high-gain disturbance rejection on joint-level and hide
direct access to the actuators behind velocity or position controlled
interfaces. Using wrist force-torque sensors to add compliance to these
systems, force-resolved control laws must map the control signals from
Cartesian space to joint motion. Although forward dynamics algorithms would
perfectly fit to that task description, their application to Cartesian robot
control is not well researched. This paper proposes a general concept of
virtual forward dynamics models for Cartesian robot control and investigates
how the forward mapping behaves in comparison to well-established alternatives.
Through decreasing the virtual system's link masses in comparison to the end
effector, the virtual system becomes linear in the operational space dynamics.
Experiments focus on stability and manipulability, particularly in singular
configurations. Our results show that through this trick, forward dynamics can
combine both benefits of the Jacobian inverse and the Jacobian transpose and,
in this regard, outperforms the Damped Least Squares method.

short of theoretical expectations by orders of magnitude. This apparent
discrepancy can be resolved if the accumulation of mass by the white dwarf (WD)
is highly sporadic, and most observations are performed during low states. Here
we use a reanalysis of archival data from the Digital Access to a Sky Century
@Harvard (DASCH) survey to argue that the most recent nova eruption in
symbiotic RN T CrB, in 1946, occurred during -- and was therefore triggered by
-- a transient accretion high state. Based on similarities in the optical light
curve around 1946 and the time of the prior eruption, in 1866, we suggest that
the WD in T CrB accumulates most of the fuel needed to ignite the thermonuclear
runaways (TNRs) during accretion high states. A natural origin for such states
is dwarf-nova like accretion-disk instabilities, which are expected in the
presumably large disks in symbiotic binaries. The timing of the TNRs in
symbiotic RNe could thus be set by the stability properties of their accretion
disks. T CrB is in the midst of an accretion high state like the ones we posit
led to the past two nova eruptions. Combined with the approach of the time at
which a TNR would be expected based on the 80-year interval between the prior
two novae ($2026 \pm$3), the current accretion high state increases the
likelihood of a TNR occurring in T CrB in the next few years.

models to adversarial time series examples, which is an important step,
specifically when the forecasting from such models is used in safety-critical

  the Mode-Collapse Issue",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IT eess.SP math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building on the success of deep learning, Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) provide a modern approach to learn a probability distribution from
observed samples. GANs are often formulated as a zero-sum game between two sets
of functions; the generator and the discriminator. Although GANs have shown
great potentials in learning complex distributions such as images, they often
suffer from the mode collapse issue where the generator fails to capture all
existing modes of the input distribution. As a consequence, the diversity of
generated samples is lower than that of the observed ones. To tackle this
issue, we take an information-theoretic approach and maximize a variational
lower bound on the entropy of the generated samples to increase their
diversity. We call this approach GANs with Variational Entropy Regularizers
(GAN+VER). Existing remedies for the mode collapse issue in GANs can be easily
coupled with our proposed variational entropy regularization. Through extensive
experimentation on standard benchmark datasets, we show all the existing
evaluation metrics highlighting difference of real and generated samples are
significantly improved with GAN+VER.

Zeeman-split Balmer emission lines. The star shows coherent variability at
optical wavelengths with an amplitude of ~0.03mag and a period of 15.26h, which
we interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf. Modelling the spectral
energy distribution and Gaia parallax, we derive a white dwarf temperature of
7500+/-148K, a mass of 0.649+/-0.022Msun, and a cooling age of 1.5+/-0.1Gyr, as
well as an upper limit on the temperature of a sub-stellar or giant planet

closely those of the other two magnetic white dwarfs showing Balmer emission
lines: GD356 and SDSS J125230.93$-$023417.7. We argue that, considering the
growing evidence for planets and planetesimals on close orbits around white
dwarfs, the unipolar inductor model provides a plausible scenario to explain
the characteristics of this small class of stars. The tight clustering of the
three stars in cooling age suggests a common mechanism switching the unipolar
inductor on and off. Whereas Lorentz drift naturally limits the lifetime of the
inductor phase, the relatively late onset of the line emission along the white
dwarf cooling sequence remains unexplained.

maps from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) along with (E)UV and magnetic
data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We report the following three
findings as important features of the microwave CRF. (1) The first preflare
activation comes in the form of a gradual increase of the 17 GHz flux without a
counterpart at 34 GHz, which indicates thermal preheating. The first sign of
nonthermal activity occurs in the form of stepwise flux increases at both 17
and 34 GHz about 4 min before the impulsive phase. (2) Until the impulsive
phase, the microwave emission over the entire active region is in a single
polarization state matching the magnetic polarity of the surrounding fields.
During and after the impulsive phase, the sign of the 17 GHz polarization state
reverses in the core region, which implies a magnetic breakout--type eruption
in a fan-spine magnetic structure. (3) The 17 GHz flux around the time of the
eruption shows quasi-periodic variations with periods of 1--2 min. The
pre-eruption oscillation is more obvious in total intensity at one end of the
flare loop, and the post-eruption oscillation, more obvious in the polarized
intensity at a region near the inner spine. We interpret this transition as the
transfer of oscillatory power from kink mode oscillation to torsional Alfv\'en
waves propagating along the spine field after the eruption. We argue that these
three processes are inter-related and indicate a breakout process in a
fan-spine structure.

revisiting our previous results for the three-parton cross-section presented in

physically more transparent. We also correct several errors in this process.
The real NLO corrections to inclusive dijet production are then obtained by
integrating out the kinematics of any of the three final partons. We explicitly
work out the interesting limits where the unmeasured parton is either a soft
gluon, or the product of a collinear splitting. We find the expected results in
both limits: the B-JIMWLK evolution of the leading-order dijet cross-section in
the first case (soft gluon) and, respectively, the DGLAP evolution of the

Gini coefficient). These resulting clusters also correlate well with physical
properties such as the colour-magnitude diagram, and span the range of
scaling-relations such as mass vs. size amongst the different machine-defined

the given clusters with classic Hubble types (ellipticals, lenticulars, early

model, with a diameter scaling logarithmically with the graph size, the zero
forcing number approaches the graph size when $\gamma\rightarrow2$. In
contrast, for graphs generated by the deactivation model, with a diameter
scaling linearly with the graph size, the zero forcing number is smaller than
the graph size independently of $\gamma$. Therefore the scaling of the graph
diameter with the graph size is another factor determining the controllability

from edges that lie at approximately constant depth regions (called pattern
edges, for which the blur estimate is well-defined). Then, we estimate the
defocus blur amount at pattern edges only, and explore an interpolation scheme
based on guided filters that prevents data propagation across the detected

Both tasks (edge classification and blur estimation) are performed by deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that share weights to learn meaningful
local features from multi-scale patches centered at edge locations. Experiments
on naturally defocused images show that the proposed method presents
qualitative and quantitative results that outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA)

a distributed consensus-based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to

also partitions the area to subregions, each of which is represented by one of
the GMM's Gaussian bases. We use the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to
evaluate the similarity between the QoS distribution of each agent and each
Gaussian basis/subregion. Then, a distributed assignment problem is formulated

agent to a subregion by taking the KLD as the assignment cost. We demonstrate
our results by a sensor deployment for event detection where the sensor's QoS

We aim to help newcomers to the field understand the main characteristics of

within a subset of problems where collocation is traditionally known to perform
sub-par, namely when the solution sought is non-smooth, i.e. contains
discontinuities, singularities or sharp gradients. For such problems and other
simpler ones with smooth solutions, we study in depth the influence of the
weight function, correction function, and the number of nodes in a given
support. We also propose new stabilization approaches to improve the accuracy
of the numerical methods. In particular, we experiment with the use of a
Voronoi diagram for weight computation, collocation method stabilization
approaches, and support node selection for problems with singular solutions.
With an appropriate selection of the above-mentioned parameters, the resulting
collocation methods are compared to the moving least-squares method (and
variations thereof), the radial basis function finite difference method and the
finite element method. Extensive tests involving two and three dimensional

We consider the most general case with an off-shell gluon with transfer
momentum $q^2$ and obtain analytical results in terms of Feynman parameter
integrals and Passarino-Veltman scalar functions, which are then expressed in
terms of closed form functions when possible. The calculation is done via a
renormalizable linear $R_\xi$ gauge and the background field method, which
allows one to corroborate that the resulting $\hat \mu_q(q^2)$ is gauge
independent and thus a valid observable quantity. It is found that the QCD
contribution from a three-gluon Feynman diagram has an infrared divergence,
which agrees with a previous evaluation and stems from the fact that the static
CMDM [$\hat\mu(0)$] has no sense in perturbative QCD. For the numerical
analysis we consider the region 30 GeV$<\|q\|<$ 1000 GeV and analyze the
behavior of $\hat \mu_q(q^2)$ for all the standard model quarks. It is found
that the CMDM of light quarks is considerably smaller than that of the top
quark as it is directly proportional to the quark mass. In the considered
energy interval, both the real and imaginary parts of $\hat\mu_t(q^2)$ are of
the order of $10^{-2}-10^{-3}$, with the largest contribution arising from the
QCD induced diagrams, though around the threshold $q^2=4m_t^2$ there are also
important contributions from diagrams with $Z$ gauge boson and Higgs boson

forecasting problem. Proposed neural network has high expressive power to solve
non-linear stochastic forecasting problems with time series including trends,
seasonality and significant random fluctuations. At the same time, it is simple
to implement and train, it does not require signal preprocessing, and it is
equipped with a forecast bias reduction mechanism. We compare our approach
against ten baseline methods, including classical statistical methods, machine
learning and hybrid approaches, on 35 monthly electricity demand time series

of linearized Boltzmann transport equations are employed to systematically
analyze the low-temperature thermal transport in crystalline GeTe. The
extensive thermal transport simulations, ranging from room temperature to
cryogenic temperatures, reveal the emergence of a phonon hydrodynamic regime in
GeTe at low temperature. The reduction of grain boundary scattering is found to
play a crucial role along with the divergent trend of umklapp and normal
scattering at low temperatures in accommodating the hydrodynamic regime.
Average scattering rates for normal, umklapp, and other resistive processes are
distinguished for a wide range (4-300 K) of temperatures and used for
identifying various phonon transport regimes. Therefore, the variations of
lattice thermal conductivity, phonon propagation length, and thermal
diffusivity with temperature, related to these transport regimes (ballistic,
hydrodynamic, and kinetic), have been thoroughly investigated. The modewise
decomposition of lattice thermal conductivity and the distinction of thermal
diffusivity according to different scattering processes reveal rich information
on the dominant phonon modes and phonon scattering processes in GeTe at low
temperature. Further, the kinetic-collective model is used to elucidate the
hydrodynamic behavior of phonon scattering through the relative study of
collective and kinetic contributions to the thermal transport properties. In
this context, the Knudsen number is estimated through the characteristic
nonlocal length and the grain size, which further quantifies the consistent
hydrodynamic behavior of phonon thermal transport for GeTe. Finally,
phonon-vacancy scattering for GeTe is realized, and vacancies are found
strongly to influence the hydrodynamic window while incorporating the other
resistive scattering mechanisms.

derived from this framework offers an improvement over existing pair-based

description concise and relatively simple. For the contagion process, we
consider the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which is realized on a
network with time-varying edges. We show that the shift in perspective from
individual-based to pair-based quantities enables exact modelling of Markovian
epidemic processes on temporal tree networks. On arbitrary networks, the
proposed pair-based model provides a substantial increase in accuracy at a low
computational and conceptual cost compared to the individual-based model. From
the pair-based model, we analytically find the condition necessary for an
epidemic to occur, otherwise known as the epidemic threshold. Due to the fact
that the SIR model has only one stable fixed point, which is the global
non-infected state, we identify an epidemic by looking at the initial stability
of the model.

practically benefit from quantum architecture, one has to identify problems and

that solves integer linear programming problems, a classically NP-hard problem,
on a quantum annealer, and investigated problem and hardware-specific

annealing architectures, how to systematically improve computations utilizing
optimized anneal schedules, and models the anneal process through a simulation.
It illustrates the effects of decoherence and many body localization for the
minimum dominating set problem, and compares annealing results against
numerical simulations of the quantum architecture. We find that the algorithm
outperforms random guessing but is limited to small problems and that annealing
schedules can be adjusted to reduce the effects of decoherence. Simulations
qualitatively reproduce algorithmic improvements of the modified annealing
schedule, suggesting the improvements have origins from quantum effects.

describing the most probable reaction outcomes in low-energy heavy-ion

dispersions of observables around the average values that has limited their
applicability. Recently it has been shown that a quantal transport approach
based on the stochastic mean-field (SMF) theory significantly improves the
description, while its application has been limited so far to fragment mass and
charge dispersions.
  Purpose: In this work, we extend the quantal transport approach based on the
SMF theory for relative kinetic energy dissipation and angular momentum
transfer in low-energy heavy-ion reactions.
  Results: As the first application of the proposed formalism, we consider the
radial linear momentum dispersion, neglecting the coupling between radial and
angular momenta. We analyze the total kinetic energy (TKE) distribution of
binary reaction products in the $^{136}$Xe+$^{208}$Pb reaction at
$E_\mathrm{c.m.}=526$ MeV and compare with experimental data. From time
evolution of single-particle orbitals in TDHF, the radial diffusion coefficient
is computed on a microscopic basis, while a phenomenological treatment is
introduced for the radial friction coefficient. By solving the quantal
diffusion equation for the radial linear momentum, the dispersion of the radial
linear momentum is obtained, from which one can construct the TKE distribution.
We find that the calculations provide a good description of the TKE
distribution for large values of energy losses, TKEL $\gtrsim$ 150 MeV.
However, the calculations underestimate the TKE distribution for smaller energy
losses. Further studies are needed to improve the technical details of
calculations.

there are five possible configurations for the six-quark state. The fully

waves, which limits the absorption performance of a conventional metasurface
absorber operating in only a single, finite frequency band. The first type of
the proposed absorbers is designed using two kinds of unit cells, each of which
absorbs either a fundamental frequency or third harmonic of an incident digital
waveform. This dual-band metasurface absorber exhibits absorption performance
exceeding that of the conventional metasurface absorber and more strongly
dissipates the energy of a digital waveform. In addition, the second type of
absorber exploits the concept of nonlinear analogous circuits to convert an
incoming wave to a different waveform, specifically, a triangular waveform that
has a larger magnitude at a fundamental frequency. Therefore, the incoming
waveform is more effectively absorbed by this waveform-conversion metasurface
absorber as well. Although still there remain some issues to put these digital
signal absorbers into practice, including experimental validation, our results
contribute to mitigating electromagnetic interference issues caused by digital
noise and realising physically smaller, lighter digital signal processing

advection-dominated flow phenomena, such as in traffic flow, atmospheric flows,

artificially veiled, and a best-fit combination of spectral type and veiling

photometry to derive $V$-band extinction and stellar luminosity. From the H-R
diagram, the median age of the young stars is about 1 Myr, with a luminosity
dispersion of $\sim$0.3--0.4 dex. We investigate the photometric variability of
the spectroscopic member sample using ZTF data, and conclude that photometric
variability, while present, does not significantly contribute to the luminosity
dispersion. While larger than the formal errors, the luminosity dispersion is
smaller than if veiling were not taken into account in our spectral typing

dynamics in a sequence of tasks using task-conditional hypernetworks. Our
method has three main attributes: first, it includes dynamics learning sessions
that do not revisit training data from previous tasks, so it only needs to

second, it uses fixed-capacity hypernetworks to represent non-stationary and
task-aware dynamics; third, it outperforms existing continual learning
alternatives that rely on fixed-capacity networks, and does competitively with
baselines that remember an ever increasing coreset of past experience. We show

there has been a lot of research going on in the field of unsupervised visual
representation learning especially in a self-supervised setting. Amongst the
recent advancements in self-supervised methods for visual recognition, in
SimCLR Chen et al. shows that good quality representations can indeed be
learned without explicit supervision. In SimCLR, the authors maximize the
similarity of augmentations of the same image and minimize the similarity of
augmentations of different images. A linear classifier trained with the
representations learned using this approach yields 76.5% top-1 accuracy on the

normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy (NT-Xent) loss function (as used in
SimCLR), it is beneficial to not have images of the same category in the same
batch. In an unsupervised setting, the information of images pertaining to the
same category is missing. We use the latent space representation of a denoising
autoencoder trained on the unlabeled dataset and cluster them with k-means to
obtain pseudo labels. With this apriori information we batch images, where no
two images from the same category are to be found. We report comparable
performance enhancements on the CIFAR10 dataset and a subset of the ImageNet

We construct an estimator $\delta \kappa$ to describe the difference between

parametric segmentation of different tissues to exploit the segmentation of

are compared to assess the effect of model segmentation variations.
Computational results indicate that the influence of segmentation error is
tissue-dependent. In brain, sensitivity to segmentation accuracy is relatively
high in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moderate in gray matter (GM) and low in
white matter for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial

reduction of 5.6% DC leads to increase of normalized induced electric field up

much larger than joint resistance. Nevertheless, there has not been a numerical
model capable of systematically studying this behaviour, which is the main
topic of this work. The field decay curves of a closed-loop
high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) coil in various AC fields are simulated

coils is considered. Reasonable consistence is found between experimental and

the same thinner filters over equal blocks of channels and produces multiple
responses with a single filter. The concept of TBC can also be extended to
group convolution and fully connected layers, and can be applied to various

TBC's significant across-the-board gain over standard convolution and group
convolution. The proposed TiedSE attention module can even use 64 times fewer
parameters than the SE module to achieve comparable performance. In particular,
standard CNNs often fail to accurately aggregate information in the presence of
occlusion and result in multiple redundant partial object proposals. By sharing

distribution of rates. The balanced state model explains these observations
with a cancellation of mean excitatory and inhibitory currents, which makes
fluctuations drive firing. In networks of neurons with current-based synapses,
the balanced state emerges dynamically if coupling is strong, i.e. if the mean
number of synapses per neuron $K$ is large and synaptic efficacy is of order
$1/\sqrt{K}$. When synapses are conductance-based, current fluctuations are
suppressed when coupling is strong, questioning the applicability of the
balanced state idea to biological neural networks. We analyze networks of
strongly coupled conductance-based neurons and show that asynchronous irregular
activity and broad distributions of rates emerge if synapses are of order
$1/\log(K)$. In such networks, unlike in the standard balanced state model,
current fluctuations are small and firing is maintained by a drift-diffusion
balance. This balance emerges dynamically, without fine tuning, if inputs are
smaller than a critical value, which depends on synaptic time constants and
coupling strength, and is significantly more robust to connection
heterogeneities than the classical balanced state model. Our analysis makes

The seed magnetic field can be of primordial or astrophysical origin. The
strength and structure of the seed field, on the galaxy or galaxy cluster
scale, can be very different, depending on the seed-field generation mechanism.
The seed field first encounters the small-scale dynamo, thus we investigate the
effects of the strength and structure of the seed field on the small-scale
dynamo action. Using numerical simulations of driven turbulence and considering
three different seed-field configurations: 1) uniform field, 2) random field
with a power-law spectrum, and 3) random field with a parabolic spectrum, we
show that the strength and statistical properties of the dynamo-generated
magnetic fields are independent of the details of the seed field. We
demonstrate that, even when the small-scale dynamo is not active, small-scale
magnetic fields can be generated and amplified linearly due to the tangling of
the large-scale field. In the presence of the small-scale dynamo action, we
find that any memory of the seed field for the non-linear small-scale dynamo
generated magnetic fields is lost and thus, it is not possible to trace back
seed-field information from the evolved magnetic fields in a turbulent medium.

the optimum classical systems in various examples, including `wine-tasting' and
`drug-testing' where real molecules are considered. In detecting the presence

the source and target domains into intermediate, transitional spaces through
the employment of adjustable, cross-grafted generative network stacks and
effective adversarial learning between transitions. Specifically, we construct
variational auto-encoders (VAE) for the two domains, and form bidirectional
transitions by cross-grafting the VAEs' decoder stacks. Furthermore, generative
adversarial networks (GAN) are employed for domain adaptation, mapping the
target domain data to the known label space of the source domain. The overall
adaptation process hence consists of three phases: feature representation
learning by VAEs, transitions generation, and transitions alignment by GANs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the

and control, where all the agents constantly communicate with each other and
update their states in order to reach an agreement. Under a general average
consensus algorithm, information exchanged through wireless or wired
communication networks could lead to the disclosure of sensitive and private
information. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving push-sum approach
for directed networks that can protect the privacy of all agents while
achieving average consensus simultaneously. Each node decomposes its initial
state arbitrarily into two substates, and their average equals to the initial
state, guaranteeing that the agent's state will converge to the accurate
average consensus. Only one substate is exchanged by the node with its
neighbours over time, and the other one is reserved. That is to say, only the
exchanged substate would be visible to an adversary, preventing the initial
state information from leakage. Different from the existing state-decomposition
approach which only applies to undirected graphs, our proposed approach is
applicable to strongly connected digraphs. In addition, in direct contrast to
offset-adding based privacy-preserving push-sum algorithm, which is vulnerable
to an external eavesdropper, our proposed approach can ensure privacy against
both an honest-but-curious node and an external eavesdropper. A numerical
simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed

each relation as a translation operation between the types of two entities with

obtained from a sequence of finite-size results, a strict, quantitative bound
on the magnitude of FSE is still missing. Here we derive rigorous upper bounds
on the FSE of local observables in real time quantum dynamics simulations
initialized from a product state. In $d$-dimensional locally interacting

compute explicitly. For periodic boundary conditions (PBC), the constant $c$ is
twice as large as that for open boundary conditions (OBC), suggesting that PBC
have smaller FSE than OBC at early times. The bound can be generalized to a
large class of correlated initial states as well. As a byproduct, we prove that
the FSE of local observables in ground state simulations decays exponentially
with $L$, under a suitable spectral gap condition. Our bounds are practically
useful in determining the validity of finite-size results, as we demonstrate in

four bands that were thought to be sufficient to describe a Dirac point. The
eight-band manifold can be realized in materials with screw symmetry. Near the
zone boundary along the screw axis, the folded bands are coupled to their
""parent"" bands, resulting in doubling dimension of the Hilbert space. Indeed,
in ""$\epsilon$-TaN (space group 194 with screw symmetry) we find a quadruple WP
when applying a Zeeman field along the screw axis. This quadruple WP away from
high symmetry points is distinct from highly degenerate nodes at the
high-symmetry points already reported. We further find that such a high chiral
charge might be related to the parity mixing of bands with high degeneracy,
which in turn alters the screw eigenvalues and the resulted chiral charge.

formalize a machine-learning concept of fairness and to design frameworks for
building fair models with sacrifice in accuracy, most are geared toward either
supervised or unsupervised learning. Yet two observations inspired us to wonder
whether semi-supervised learning might be useful to solve discrimination
problems. First, previous study showed that increasing the size of the training
set may lead to a better trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Second, the
most powerful models today require an enormous of data to train which, in
practical terms, is likely possible from a combination of labeled and unlabeled

learning in the pre-processing phase, including pseudo labeling to predict
labels for unlabeled data, a re-sampling method to obtain multiple fair
datasets and lastly, ensemble learning to improve accuracy and decrease
discrimination. A theoretical decomposition analysis of bias, variance and
noise highlights the different sources of discrimination and the impact they
have on fairness in semi-supervised learning. A set of experiments on

nanoparticles with a Curie temperature close to room temperature (TC = 308 K)
in a silicone matrix has been prepared and comprehensively studied. It has been
found that at room temperature and above, MAE particles are magnetized
superparamagnetically with a low coercivity below 10 Oe, and the influence of
magnetic anisotropy on the appearance of a torque is justified. A coupling
between magnetization and magnetoelasticity has been also established. The
mechanisms of the appearance of magnetoelasticity, including the effect of MAE
rearrangement and MAE compression by magnetized particles, have been revealed.
It has been found that the magnetoelastic properties of MAE have critical
features near TC. The magnetoelastic properties of MAE disappear at T > TC and
are restored at T < TC. This makes it possible to use MAE at room temperature
as a smart material for devices with self-regulating magnetoelastic properties.

range from 8.9 to 35.0K with an average of 15.3$\pm$6.1K. Low gas temperatures
associate with Serpens South ranging from 8.9 to 16.8K with an average
12.3$\pm$1.7K, while dense gas in the W40 region shows higher temperatures
ranging from 17.7 to 35.0K with an average of 25.1$\pm$4.9 K. A comparison of
kinetic temperatures against HiGal dust temperatures indicates that the gas and
dust temperatures are in agreement in the low mass star formation region of
Serpens South. In the high mass star formation region W40, the measured gas
kinetic temperatures are higher than those of the dust. The turbulent component
of the velocity dispersion of NH$_3$(1,1) is found to be positively correlated
with the gas kinetic temperature, which indicates that the dense gas may be
heated by dissipation of turbulent energy. For the fractional total-NH3
abundance obtained by a comparison with Herschel infrared continuum data
representing dust emission we find values from 0.1 to 21$\times 10^{-8}$ with
an average of 6.9$(\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-8}$. Serpens South also shows a
fractional total-NH3 abundance ranging from 0.2 to 21$\times 10^{-8}$ with an
average of 8.6($\pm 3.8)\times 10^{-8}$. In W40, values are lower, between 0.1
and 4.3$\times 10^{-8}$ with an average of 1.6($\pm 1.4)\times 10^{-8}$. Weak
velocity gradients demonstrate that the rotational energy is a negligible
fraction of the gravitational energy. In W40, gas and dust temperatures are not
strongly dependent on the projected distance to the recently formed massive
stars. Overall, the morphology of the mapped region is ring-like, with strong
emission at lower and weak emission at higher Galactic longitudes.

a viscous liquid. However, the elementary mechanisms of momentum transport in
such athermal particulate fluids are elusive. As a result, existing models for
cohesive granular viscosity remain phenomenological and debated. Here we use
discrete element simulations of plane shear flows to measure the viscosity of
cohesive granular materials, while tuning the intensity of inter-particle
adhesion. We establish that two adhesion-related, dimensionless numbers control
their viscosity. These numbers compare the force and energy required to break a
bond to the characteristic stress and kinetic energy in the flow. This
progresses the commonly accepted view that only one dimensionless number could
control the effect of adhesion. The resulting scaling law captures strong,
non-Newtonian variations in viscosity, unifying several existing viscosity
models. We then directly link these variations in viscosity to adhesion-induced
modifications in the flow micro-structure and contact network. This analysis
reveals the existence of two modes of momentum transport, involving either
grain micro-acceleration or balanced contact forces, and shows that adhesion
only affects the later. This advances our understanding of rheological models
for granular materials and other soft materials such as emulsions and
suspensions, which may also involve inter-particle adhesive forces.

by intercurrent events. For instance, rescue medication is sometimes given to
patients in response to worsening of their disease, either in addition to the
randomised treatment or in its place. The use of such medication complicates
the interpretation of the intention-to-treat analysis. In view of this, we
propose a novel estimand defined as the intention-to-treat effect that would
have been observed, had patients on the active arm been switched to rescue
medication if and only if they would have been switched when randomised to
control. This enables us to disentangle the treatment effect from the effect of
rescue medication on a patient's outcome, while avoiding the strong
extrapolations that are typically needed when inferring what the
intention-to-treat effect would have been in the absence of rescue medication.
We develop an inverse probability weighting method to estimate this estimand
under specific untestable assumptions, in view of which we propose a
sensitivity analysis. We use the method for the analysis of a clinical trial
conducted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in which chronically ill patients can
switch to rescue medication for ethical reasons. Monte Carlo simulations
confirm that the proposed estimator is unbiased in moderate sample sizes.

automatic models for computer-aided diagnosis. Existing methods, such as U-Net
follow the encoder-decoder pipeline, where detailed information is lost in the
encoder in order to achieve a large field of view. Although spatial detailed
information could be recovered partly in the decoder, while there is noise in
the high-resolution feature maps of the encoder. And, we argue this
encoder-decoder architecture is inefficient for vessel segmentation. In this
paper, we present the detail-preserving network (DPN), which avoids the
encoder-decoder pipeline. To preserve detailed information and learn structural
information simultaneously, we designed the detail-preserving block (DP-Block).
Further, we stacked eight DP-Blocks together to form the DPN. More importantly,
there are no down-sampling operations among these blocks. Therefore, the DPN
could maintain a high/full resolution during processing, avoiding the loss of
detailed information. To illustrate the effectiveness of DPN, we conducted
experiments over three public datasets. Experimental results show, compared to
state-of-the-art methods, DPN shows competitive/better performance in terms of
segmentation accuracy, segmentation speed, and model size. Specifically, 1) Our
method achieves comparable segmentation performance on the DRIVE, CHASE_DB1,

dipole density are essential to assure a circulating spin current with
vanishing net flow at equilibrium. The band geometric origin of bulk spin
transport is ascertained to be the momentum space spin texture and Berry
curvature instead of the spin Berry curvature, paving the way for material
related studies. In superconductors the attained conserved charge current
corresponds to the quasiparticle charge current renormalized by the condensate

the backgrounds which leads to over-estimated localization. In this paper, we
consider the background as an important cue that guides the feature activation
to cover the sophisticated object region and propose contrastive attention
loss. The loss promotes similarity between foreground and its dropped version,
and, dissimilarity between the dropped version and background. Furthermore, we
propose foreground consistency loss that penalizes earlier layers producing
noisy attention regarding the later layer as a reference to provide them with a
sense of backgroundness. It guides the early layers to activate on objects
rather than locally distinctive backgrounds so that their attentions to be
similar to the later layer. For better optimizing the above losses, we use the
non-local attention blocks to replace channel-pooled attention leading to
enhanced attention maps considering the spatial similarity. Last but not least,
we propose to drop background regions in addition to the most discriminative

is numerically estimated based on the Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method. The
transfer mutual information has the peak near the confinement-deconfinement
transition, and it may be used to detect the precursors of the transition.
Since the transfer mutual information still have the peak even if the
Polyakov-loop changes continuously and smoothly, we may pick up some aspects of
the confinement-deconfinement nature from the information flow properties.
Particularly, the transfer mutual information shows the significantly different
behavior below and above the Roberge-Weiss endpoint existed in the pure
imaginary chemical potential region, which may indicate the system change by
the confinement-deconfinement transition.

  To improve the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods
for robot manipulator trajectory planning in random working environments, we
present three dense reward functions. These rewards differ from the traditional
sparse reward. First, a posture reward function is proposed to speed up the
learning process with a more reasonable trajectory by modeling the distance and
direction constraints, which can reduce the blindness of exploration. Second, a
stride reward function is proposed to improve the stability of the learning
process by modeling the distance and movement distance of joint constraints.
Finally, in order to further improve learning efficiency, we are inspired by
the cognitive process of human behavior and propose a stage incentive
mechanism, including a hard stage incentive reward function and a soft stage
incentive reward function. Extensive experiments show that the soft stage
incentive reward function is able to improve the convergence rate by up to
46.9% with the state-of-the-art DRL methods. The percentage increase in the
convergence mean reward was 4.4-15.5% and the percentage decreases with respect
to standard deviation were 21.9-63.2%. In the evaluation experiments, the
success rate of trajectory planning for a robot manipulator reached 99.6%.

the effective mass of the quasiparticle in the Fermi-liquid theory; the
dispersion relation around the Fermi level is considered to become flat towards
the Mott transition. Here, to clarify the characterization of the Mott
transition under the assumption of a Fermi-liquid-like ground state, the
electron-addition excitation from the Gutzwiller wavefunction in the $t$-$J$
model is investigated on a chain, ladder, square lattice, and bilayer square
lattice in the single-mode approximation using a Monte Carlo method. The
numerical results demonstrate that an electronic mode that is continuously
deformed from a non-interacting band at zero electron density loses its
spectral weight and gradually disappears towards the Mott transition. It
exhibits essentially the magnetic dispersion relation shifted by the Fermi
momentum in the small-doping limit as indicated by recent studies for the
Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models, even if the ground state is assumed to be a
Fermi-liquid-like state exhibiting gradual disappearance of the quasiparticle
weight. This implies that, rather than as the divergence of the effective mass
or disappearance of the carrier density that is expected in conventional
single-particle pictures, the Mott transition can be better understood as
freezing of the charge degrees of freedom while the spin degrees of freedom
remain active, even if the ground state is like a Fermi liquid.

epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact
processes or need real-time or archived population mobility data to simulate
the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and
regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is
often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease
propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited
by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution
description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the
impact of the creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city.
Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to
understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales
demonstrated in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a
SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in addition to the contact network and
population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of transit are strongly
correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited
access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road
connectivity networks using open-source imageries and travel patterns from
open-source surveys and government reports. Within the proposed framework, we
then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns, and
enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread.

based on (i) consensus on \textit{a-priori} estimates and (ii) measurement
innovation. The necessary connectivity condition on the sensor network and
stabilizing block-diagonal gain matrix is derived based on our previous works.
Considering additive faults in the presence of system and measurement noise,
the estimation error at sensors is derived and proper residuals are defined for
fault detection. Unlike many works in the literature, no simplifying
upper-bound condition on the noise is considered and we assume Gaussian
system/measurement noise. A probabilistic threshold is then defined for fault
detection based on the estimation error covariance norm. Finally, a
graph-theoretic sensor replacement scenario is proposed to recover possible
loss of networked observability due to removing the faulty sensor. We examine
the proposed fault detection and isolation scheme on an illustrative academic

harvesting (EH) model and a partial offloading scheme at each EU, we propose a
scheme to maximize the weighted sum computation bits of all the EUs by jointly
optimizing the backscatter reflection coefficient and time, active transmission
power and time, local computing frequency and execution time of each EU. By
introducing a series of auxiliary variables and using the properties of the
non-linear EH model, we transform the original non-convex problem into a convex

computer vision image classification tasks that required visual inspection in
the past (e.g., object recognition, face detection, etc.). Motivated by these
astonishing results, researchers have also started using CNNs to cope with
image forensic problems (e.g., camera model identification, tampering
detection, etc.). However, in computer vision, image classification methods
typically rely on visual cues easily detectable by human eyes. Conversely,
forensic solutions rely on almost invisible traces that are often very subtle
and lie in the fine details of the image under analysis. For this reason,
training a CNN to solve a forensic task requires some special care, as common
processing operations (e.g., resampling, compression, etc.) can strongly hinder
forensic traces. In this work, we focus on the effect that JPEG has on CNN
training considering different computer vision and forensic image
classification problems. Specifically, we consider the issues that rise from
JPEG compression and misalignment of the JPEG grid. We show that it is
necessary to consider these effects when generating a training dataset in order
to properly train a forensic detector not losing generalization capability,
whereas it is almost possible to ignore these effects for computer vision
tasks.

oxidized GaN$(0001)$ and GaN$(1\bar{1}00)$ layers as well as on GaN nanowires.
The resulting hybrid inorganic/organic heterostructures are investigated by
X-ray photoemission and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The GaN work function
is changed significantly by the grafting of phosphonic acids, evidencing the
formation of dense self-assembled monolayers. Regardless of the GaN surface
orientation, both types of phosphonic acids significantly impact the GaN
surface band bending. A dependence on the acids' electronegativity is, however,
only observed for the oxidized GaN$(1\bar{1}00)$ surface, indicating a
relatively low density of surface states and a favorable band alignment between
the surface oxide and acids' electronic states. Regarding the optical
properties, the covalent bonding of PFOPA and OPA on oxidized GaN layers and
nanowires significantly affect their external quantum efficiency, especially in
the nanowire case due to the large surface-to-volume ratio. The variation in
the external quantum efficiency is related to the modication of both the
internal electric fields and surface states. These results demonstrate the
potential of phosphonate chemistry for the surface functionalization of GaN,
which could be exploited for selective sensing applications.

systems (especially gas and electricity), to increase operational flexibility

challenging due to the existence of physical and economic dependencies between
the different energy carriers. We propose in this paper an integrated day-ahead
multi-carrier gas, electricity and heat market clearing which includes new
types of orders and constraints on these orders to represent techno-economic
constraints of conversion and storage technologies. We prove that the proposed
market clearing gives rise to competitive equilibria. In addition, we propose
two decentralised clearing algorithms which differ in how the decomposition of
the underlying centralised clearing optimisation problem is performed. This has
implications in terms of the involved agents and their mutual information

for a growing portion of the world's power consumption. Thus reducing
communication is vital, both, from an economical and an ecological perspective.
For machine learning, on-device learning avoids sending raw data, which can
reduce communication substantially. Furthermore, not centralizing the data
protects privacy-sensitive data. However, most learning algorithms require
hardware with high computation power and thus high energy consumption. In
contrast, ultra-low-power processors, like FPGAs or micro-controllers, allow
for energy-efficient learning of local models. Combined with
communication-efficient distributed learning strategies, this reduces the
overall energy consumption and enables applications that were yet impossible
due to limited energy on local devices. The major challenge is then, that the
low-power processors typically only have integer processing capabilities. This
paper investigates an approach to communication-efficient on-device learning of
integer exponential families that can be executed on low-power processors, is
privacy-preserving, and effectively minimizes communication. The empirical
evaluation shows that the approach can reach a model quality comparable to a
centrally learned regular model with an order of magnitude less communication.
Comparing the overall energy consumption, this reduces the required energy for

distort the original data vector, which is formally expressed as the error
vector magnitude (EVM) between the precoded and original data vectors. Notably,
EVM has a deleterious impact on the performance of multiple-input

the EVM-unconstrained mask-compliant spectral precoding problem, which serves
as a springboard to the design of two EVM-constrained spectral precoding
schemes. The first scheme takes into account a wideband EVM-constraint which
limits the average in-band distortion. The second scheme takes into account
frequency-selective EVM-constraints, and consequently, limits the signal
distortion at the subcarrier level. Numerical examples illustrate that both
proposed schemes outperform previously developed schemes in terms of important
performance indicators such as block error rate and system-wide throughput

to avoid, reduce, and/or hide the message-passing costs (in distributed

  This paper introduces a new communication-reduction strategy for the (Krylov)
GMRES solver that advocates for decoupling the storage format (i.e., the data
representation in memory) of the orthogonal basis from the arithmetic precision
that is employed during the operations with that basis. Given that the
execution time of the GMRES solver is largely determined by the memory access,
the datatype transforms can be mostly hidden, resulting in the acceleration of
the iterative step via a lower volume of bits being retrieved from memory.
Together with the special properties of the orthonormal basis (whose elements
are all bounded by 1), this paves the road toward the aggressive customization
of the storage format, which includes some floating point as well as fixed
point formats with little impact on the convergence of the iterative process.
  We develop a high performance implementation of the ""compressed basis GMRES""

problem by devising path-selection policies that lead to stability. However,
little is known about the viability of these policies in the Internet context,
where selfish end-hosts can deviate from a prescribed policy if such a
deviation is beneficial fromtheir individual perspective. In order to achieve
network stability in future Internet architectures, it is essential that
end-hosts have an incentive to adopt a stability-oriented path-selection
policy. In this work, we perform the first incentive analysis of the
stability-inducing path-selection policies proposed in the literature. Building
on a game-theoretic model of end-host path selection, we show that these
policies are in fact incompatible with the self-interest of end-hosts, as these
strategies make it worthwhile to pursue an oscillatory path-selection strategy.
Therefore, stability in networks with selfish end-hosts must be enforced by

high-mass star-forming regions and discuss possible empirical correlations with
relevant physical quantities to assess its role as a chronometer of
star-forming regions through different evolutionary stages. APEX observations
of the ground-state transition of o-H$_2$D$^+$ were analysed in a sample of
massive clumps selected from ATLASGAL at different evolutionary stages. Column
densities and beam-averaged abundances of o-H$_2$D$^+$ with respect to H$_2$,
$X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$), were obtained by modelling the spectra under the assumption
of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We detect 16 sources in o-H$_2$D$^+$ and
find clear correlations between $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) and the clump bolometric
luminosity and the dust temperature, while only a mild correlation is found
with the CO-depletion factor. In addition, we see a clear correlation with the
luminosity-to-mass ratio, which is known to trace the evolution of the star
formation process. This would indicate that the deuterated forms of H$_3^+$ are
more abundant in the early stages of the star formation process and that
deuteration is influenced by the time evolution of the clumps. In this respect,
our findings would suggest that the $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) abundance is mainly
affected by the thermal changes rather than density changes in the gas. We have
employed these findings together with observations of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, DCO$^+$,
and C$^{17}$O to provide an estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in a
sub-sample of eight clumps based on recent analytical work. Our study presents
the largest sample of o-H$_2$D$^+$ in star-forming regions to date. The results
confirm that the deuteration process is strongly affected by temperature and
suggests that o-H$_2$D$^+$ can be considered a reliable chemical clock during
the star formation processes, as proved by its strong temporal dependence.

accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) measurements for the success of their
main science objectives. However, to date, no method has been able to produce
photo-$z$s at the required accuracy using only the broad-band photometry that
those surveys will provide. An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
current methods is a crucial step in the eventual development of an approach to
meet this challenge. We report on the performance of 13 photometric redshift
code single value redshift estimates and redshift probability distributions
(PDZs) on a common set of data, focusing particularly on the 0.2--2.6 redshift
range that the Euclid mission will probe. We design a challenge using emulated
Euclid data drawn from three photometric surveys of the COSMOS field. The data
are divided into two samples: one calibration sample for which photometry and
redshifts are provided to the participants; and the validation sample,
containing only the photometry, to ensure a blinded test of the methods.
Participants were invited to provide a redshift single value estimate and a PDZ
for each source in the validation sample, along with a rejection flag that
indicates sources they consider unfit for use in cosmological analyses. The
performance of each method is assessed through a set of informative metrics,
using cross-matched spectroscopic and highly-accurate photometric redshifts as
the ground truth. We show that the rejection criteria set by participants are
efficient in removing strong outliers, sources for which the photo-z deviates
by more than 0.15(1+z) from the spectroscopic-redshift (spec-z). We also show
that, while all methods are able to provide reliable single value estimates,
several machine-learning methods do not manage to produce useful PDZs.

$\ell_1$ regularized linear models in the context of (possibly non-stationary)
streaming data Recently, it has been noted that the choice of the
regularization parameter is fundamental in such models and several methods have
been proposed which iteratively tune such a parameter in a~time-varying manner;
thereby allowing the underlying sparsity of estimated models to vary. Moreover,
in many applications, inference on the regularization parameter may itself be
of interest, as such a parameter is related to the underlying \textit{sparsity}
of the model. However, in this work, we highlight and provide extensive
empirical evidence regarding how various (often unrelated) statistical
properties in the data can lead to changes in the regularization parameter. In
particular, through various synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that changes
in the regularization parameter may be driven by changes in the true underlying
sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio or even model misspecification. The purpose of
this letter is, therefore, to highlight and catalog various statistical
properties which induce changes in the associated regularization parameter. We
conclude by presenting two applications: one relating to financial data and
another to neuroimaging data, where the aforementioned discussion is relevant.

volume limit of the extra dimensions, i.e., $\mbox{Im}\tau \to \infty$ for a
modulus $\tau$. The right-handed neutrinos are introduced to realize the seesaw
mechanism for tiny neutrino masses observed in oscillation experiments. The
vacuum expectation value of the singlet Higgs gives the Majorana masses for
right-handed neutrinos and the $\mu$-term for Higgs fields. The model can
explain the observed masses and mixing angles of neutrinos successfully. We
find that one of the mixing angles should be in the range $\sin^2 \theta_{23}

the two restricted regions. One is that the Dirac phase is $\delta_{\rm CP}

conditions for optimal control of a non-smooth semilinear elliptic partial
differential equation, where the nonlinearity is the non-smooth max-function

G\^{a}teaux-differentiable. In addition to standing assumptions, two main
hypotheses are imposed. The first one is the G\^{a}teaux-differentiability at
the considered control of the objective functional and it is precisely
characterized by the vanishing of an adjoint state on the active set. The
second one is a structural assumption on the 'almost' active sets, i.e., the
sets of all points at which the values of the interested state are 'close' to
the non-differentiability point of the max-function. We then derive a 'no-gap'
theory of second-order optimality conditions in terms of an abstract curvature
functional, i.e., for which the only change between necessary or sufficient
second-order optimality conditions is between a strict and non strict
inequality.

production time, output of higher quality and reduced waste. Given the
complexity of today's industrial processes, it becomes infeasible to monitor

recent years, machine learning methods have been used to automate processes and
provide decision support. All of this, based on analyzing large amounts of data

applying machine learning methods during a chemical sulphonation process with
the objective of automating the product quality analysis which currently is
performed manually. We used data from process parameters to train different
models including Random Forest, Neural Network and linear regression in order
to predict product quality values. Our experiments showed that it is possible
to predict those product quality values with good accuracy, thus, having the
potential to reduce time. Specifically, the best results were obtained with
Random Forest with a mean absolute error of 0.089 and a correlation of 0.978.

when $p = (1 + \mu n^{-1/3})/n$, the asymptotic probability that the strongly
connected components of a random directed graph are only cycles and single
vertices decreases from 1 to 0 as $\mu$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
  By using techniques from analytic combinatorics, we establish the exact
limiting value of this probability as a function of $\mu$ and provide more
properties of the structure of a random digraph around, below and above its
transition point. We obtain the limiting probability that a random digraph is
acyclic and the probability that it has one strongly connected complex
component with a given difference between the number of edges and vertices
(called excess). Our result can be extended to the case of several complex
components with given excesses as well in the whole range of sparse digraphs.
  Our study is based on a general symbolic method which can deal with a great
variety of possible digraph families, and a version of the saddle point method
which can be systematically applied to the complex contour integrals appearing
from the symbolic method. While the technically easiest model is the model of
random multidigraphs, in which multiple edges are allowed, and where edge
multiplicities are sampled independently according to a Poisson distribution
with a fixed parameter $p$, we also show how to systematically approach the
family of simple digraphs, where multiple edges are forbidden, and where
2-cycles are either allowed or not.
  Our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations, and we

In the redshifted ($z=0.193$) source reference frame, the RM decreased from
$1.46\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ to $1.33\times10^5$~rad~m$^{-2}$ between January
and August 2017, showing day-timescale variations of $\sim200$~rad~m$^{-2}$.
Here we present sixteen FRB 121102 RMs from burst detections with the Arecibo

Array, providing a record of FRB 121102's RM over a 2.5-year timespan. Our

dropping by an average of 15\% year$^{-1}$ and is
$\sim9.7\times10^4$~rad~m$^{-2}$ at the most recent epoch of August 2019.
Erratic, short-term RM variations of $\sim10^3$~rad~m$^{-2}$ week$^{-1}$ were
also observed between MJDs 58215--58247. A decades-old neutron star embedded
within a still-compact supernova remnant or a neutron star near a massive black

compare the observed RMs to theoretical models describing the RM evolution for
FRBs originating within a supernova remnant. FRB 121102's age is unknown, and
we find that the models agree for source ages of $\sim6-17$~years at the time

axial scan range of an optical microscope. To maximise the diffraction limited
depth range in an RF system, the magnification of the relay lenses should be
such that the pupil planes of the objectives are accurately mapped on to each
other. In this paper we study the tolerance of the RF system to magnification
mismatch and quantify the amount of residual spherical aberration present at
different focusing depths. We observe that small deviations from ideal
magnification results in increased amounts of residual spherical aberration
terms leading to a reduction in the dynamic range. For high numerical aperture
objectives, the simulation predicts a 50% decrease in the dynamic range for 1%
magnification mismatch. The simulation has been verified against an
experimental RF system with ideal and non-ideal magnifications. Experimentally
confirmed predictions also provide a valuable empirical method of determining
when a system is close to the ideal phase matching condition, based on the sign
of the spherical aberration on either side of focus.

and technological processes, the mechanisms underlying dissipation at a sliding
contact are still a matter of debate. Attempts to explain the dependence of
measured frictional losses at nanoscale contacts on the electronic degrees of
freedom of the surrounding materials have so far been controversial. Here, it
is proposed that friction can be explained by considering damping of stick-slip
pulses in a sliding contact. Based on friction force microscopy studies of
La$_{(1-x)}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ films at the ferromagnetic-metallic to
paramagnetic-polaronic conductor phase transition, it is confirmed that the
sliding contact generates thermally-activated slip pulses in the nanoscale
contact, and argued that these are damped by direct coupling into phonon bath.
Electron-phonon coupling leads to the formation of Jahn-Teller polarons and a
clear increase in friction in the high temperature phase. There is no evidence
for direct electronic drag on the atomic force microscope tip nor any
indication of contributions from electrostatic forces. This intuitive scenario,
that friction is governed by the damping of surface vibrational excitations,
provides a basis for reconciling controversies in literature studies as well as
suggesting possible tactics for controlling friction.

linear program (LP). At each step one solves a semidefinite relaxation of the
LP which involves pseudo-moments up to a certain degree. Its dual computes a
polynomial of same degree which approximates from above the discontinuous
indicator function of the set, hence with a typical Gibbs phenomenon which
results in a slow convergence of the associated numerical scheme. Drastic
improvements have been observed by introducing in the initial LP additional
linear moment constraints obtained from a certain application of Stokes'
theorem for integration on the set. However and so far there was no rationale
to explain this behavior. We provide a refined version of this extended LP
formulation. When the set is the smooth super-level set of a single polynomial,
we show that the dual of this refined LP has an optimal solution which is a
continuous function.Therefore in this dual one now approximates a continuous
function by a polynomial, hence with no Gibbs phenomenon, which explains and
improves the already observed drastic acceleration of the convergence of the
hierarchy. Interestingly, the technique of proof involves recent results on

that is widely used in applications that feature scattering of waves from
circular cylinders. Moreover, it also serves as a key component in several
other numerical methods in which scattering computations involving arbitrarily
shaped objects are accelerated by enclosing the objects in artificial
cylinders. A fundamental question is that of how fast the approximation error
of the MEM converges to zero as the truncation number goes to infinity. Despite
the fact that the MEM was introduced in 1913, and has been in widespread usage
as a numerical technique since as far back as 1955, to the best of the authors'
knowledge, a precise characterization of the asymptotic rate of convergence of
the MEM has not been obtained. In this work, we provide a resolution to this
issue. While our focus in this paper is on the Dirichlet scattering problem,
this is merely for convenience and our results actually establish convergence
rates that hold for all MEM formulations irrespective of the specific boundary
conditions or boundary integral equation solution representation chosen.

nonlinear structure discretised with the finite element (FE) method, is
detailed. The procedure allows to define a nonlinear mapping in order to derive
accurate reduced-order models (ROM) relying on invariant manifold theory. The
proposed reduction strategy is direct and simulation free, in the sense that it
allows to pass from physical coordinates (FE nodes) to normal coordinates,
describing the dynamics in an invariant-based span of the phase space. The
number of master modes for the ROM is not a priori limited since a complete
change of coordinate is proposed. The underlying theory ensures the quality of
the predictions thanks to the invariance property of the reduced subspace,
together with their curvatures in phase space that accounts for the nonresonant
nonlinear couplings. The method is applied to a beam discretised with 3D
elements and shows its ability in recovering internal resonance at high energy.
Then a fan blade model is investigated and the correct prediction given by the
ROMs are assessed and discussed. A method is proposed to approximate an
aggregate value for the damping, that takes into account the damping
coefficients of all the slave modes, and also using the Rayleigh damping model
as input. Frequency-response curves for the beam and the blades are then
exhibited, showing the accuracy of the proposed method.

rapid drug repurposing. Deep learning has been successfully applied in
drug-target affinity (DTA) problem. However, previous deep learning-based

may change due to the drug binding effects. In addition, previous DTA methods
learn protein representation solely based on a small number of protein

is modeled as a graph of atoms, which then serves as a node in a larger graph
of residues-drug complex. The resulting model is an expressive deep nested

the recent effort of learning contextualized protein representation. The
experiments are conducted under different settings to evaluate scenarios such

that the emerging correlation dynamics crucially depends on the impurity-medium

is bound to the bosonic bath, while for intermediate attractions it undergoes
an effective tunneling. In the case of weak attractive or repulsive couplings
the impurity penetrates the bosonic bath and performs a dissipative oscillatory
motion. Further increasing the impurity-bath repulsion results in the pinning
of the impurity between the density peaks of the bosonic medium, a phenomenon
that is associated with a strong impurity-medium entanglement. For strong
repulsions the impurity is totally reflected by the bosonic medium. To unravel
the underlying microscopic excitation processes accompanying the dynamics we
employ an effective potential picture. We extend our results to the case of two
bosonic impurities and demonstrate the existence of a qualitatively similar

it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to set proper parameter values. The

this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method that is inspired by the
Hadamard matrix. The proposed method captures the multi-modal feature

consider the existence of hidden (brane)worlds parallel to our own visible
world - our usual universe - in a multidimensional bulk. Hidden braneworlds
allow for hidden copies of the Standard Model. For instance, atoms hidden in a
hidden brane could exist as dark matter candidates. As a way to constrain such
hypotheses, the possibility for neutron-hidden neutron swapping can be tested
thanks to disappearance-reappearance experiments also known as
passing-through-walls neutron experiments. The neutron-hidden neutron coupling
$g$ can be constrained from those experiments. While $g$ could be arbitrarily
small, previous works involving a $M_4 \times R_1$ bulk, with DGP branes, show
that $g$ then possesses a value which is reachable experimentally. It is of
crucial interest to know if a reachable value for $g$ is universal or not and
to estimate its magnitude. Indeed, it would allow, in a near future, to reject
definitively - or not - the existence of hidden braneworlds from experiments.
In the present paper, we explore this issue by calculating $g$ for DGP branes,
for $M_4 \times S_1/Z_2$, $M_4 \times R_2$ and $M_4 \times T^2$ bulks. As a
major result, no disappearance-reappearance experiment would definitively
universally rules out the existence of hidden worlds endowed with their own

password unconsciously. Aim. We investigate the effect of incidental fear and
stress on the measured strength of a chosen password. Method. We conducted two
experiments with within-subject designs measuring the Zxcvbn \textsf{log10}
number of guesses as strength of chosen passwords as dependent variable. In
both experiments, participants were signed up to a site holding their personal
data and, for the second run a day later, asked under a security incident
pretext to change their password. (a) Fear. $N_\mathsf{F} = 34$ participants
were exposed to standardized fear and happiness stimulus videos in random
order. (b) \textbf{Stress.} $N_\mathsf{S} = 50$ participants were either
exposed to a battery of standard stress tasks or left in a control condition in
random order. The Zxcvbn password strength was compared across conditions.
Results. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in mean
Zxcvbn password strengths on fear (Hedges' $g_{\mathsf{av}} = -0.11$, 95\% CI
$[-0.45, 0.23]$) or stress (and control group, Hedges' $g_{\mathsf{av}} =

cross-over interaction of stress and TLX mental demand. Conclusions. While
having observed negligible main effect size estimates for incidental fear and
stress, we offer evidence towards the interaction between stress and cognitive
effort that vouches for further investigation.

and the subsequent discovery of a neutrino excess from the same direction have
strengthened the hypothesis that blazars are cosmic neutrino sources. The lack,
however, of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity during the latter period challenges
the standard scenario of correlated $\gamma$-ray and high-energy neutrino
emission in blazars. We propose instead that TeV-PeV neutrinos are produced in
coincidence with X-ray flares that are powered by proton synchrotron radiation.
In this case, neutrinos are produced by photomeson interactions of protons with
their own synchrotron radiation, while MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays are the result
of synchrotron-dominated electromagnetic cascades developed in the source.
Using a time-dependent approach, we find that this ""pure hadronic flaring""
hypothesis has several interesting consequences. The X-ray flux is a good proxy
for the all-flavor neutrino flux, while certain neutrino-rich X-ray flares may
be dark in GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays. Lastly, hadronic X-ray flares are accompanied
by an equally bright MeV component that is detectable by proposed missions like
e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO. We then applied this scenario to the extreme blazar 3HSP
J095507.9+355101 that has been associated with IceCube-200107A while undergoing
an X-ray flare. We showed that the number of muon and antimuon neutrinos above
100 TeV during hadronic flares can be up to $\sim3-10$ times higher than the
expected number in standard leptohadronic models. Still, frequent hadronic
flaring activity is necessary for explaining the detected neutrino event

theory (LR-TDDFT) as a first-principles framework for consistently modeling
plasmon properties. We provide a comprehensive analysis of plasmons in aluminum
from ambient to warm dense matter conditions and assess typical properties such
as the dynamical structure factor, the plasmon dispersion, and the plasmon
lifetime. We compare our results with scattering measurements and with other
TDDFT results as well as models such as the random phase approximation, the
Mermin approach, and the dielectric function obtained using static local field
corrections of the uniform electron gas parametrized from path integral Monte
Carlo simulations. We conclude that results for the plasmon dispersion and
lifetime are inconsistent between experiment and theories and that the common
practice of extracting and studying plasmon dispersion relations is an
insufficient procedure to capture the complicated physics contained in the
dynamic structure factor in its full breadth.

negligible the effect of outliers in seeking out projections. Here we apply two
multiplier approaches, total distance and cosine similarity metrics. These two

points and the principal projections in the feature space. As a result of this,
improved low-rank projections are gotten through multiplying the data
iteratively to make negligible the effect of corrupt data in the training set.

research presents a piezoelectric metamaterial with the capability to
concurrently tailor the frequency, path, and mode shape of topological waves
using resonant circuitry. In the research presented in this manuscript, the
plane wave expansion method is used to detect a frequency tunable subwavelength
Dirac point in the band structure of the periodic unit cell and discover an
operating region over which topological wave propagation can exist. Dispersion
analyses for a finite strip illuminate how circuit parameters can be utilized
to adjust mode shapes corresponding to topological edge states. A further
evaluation provides insight into how increased electromechanical coupling and
lattice reconfiguration can be exploited to enhance the frequency range for
topological wave propagation, increase achievable mode localization, and attain
additional edge states. Topological guided wave propagation that is
subwavelength in nature and adaptive in path, localization, and frequency is
illustrated in numerical simulations of thin plate structures. Outcomes from

techniques in addition to the classic signature analysis. This sophistication
leads antiviruses to leave more traces of their presence on the machine they
protect. To remain undetected as long as possible, malware can avoid executing
within such environments by hunting down the modifications left by the
antiviruses. This paper aims at determining the possibilities for malware to
detect the antiviruses and then evaluating the efficiency of these techniques
on a panel of antiviruses that are the most used nowadays. We then collect
samples showing this kind of behavior and propose to evaluate a countermeasure
that creates false artifacts, thus forcing malware to evade.

$y,z$ and in addition to multilinearity and irreducibility the equation pair is
required to have the following specific properties: (1) The two equations
forming the pair are related by $y\leftrightarrow z$ exchange. (2) When $z=y$
both equations reduce to one of the equations in the ABS list. (3) Evolution in
any corner direction is by a multilinear equation pair. One straightforward way
to construct such two-component pairs is by taking some particular equation in
the ABS list (in terms of $y$), using replacement $y \leftrightarrow z$ for
some particular shifts, after which the other equation of the pair is obtained
by property (1). This way we can get 8 pairs for each starting equation. One of
our main results is that due to condition (3) this is in fact complete for H1,
H3, Q1, Q3. (For H2 we have a further case, Q2, Q4 we did not check.) As for
the CAC integrability test, for each choice of the bottom equations we could in

equations constructed with an even number of $y \leftrightarrow z$ replacements
are possible, and for each such equation there are two sets of ""side"" equation
pairs that produce (the same) genuine B\""acklund transformation and Lax pair.

heavily leveraged. Our aim is to make the framework conceptually sound and
computationally practical for a range of realistic applications, including
micro path planning for autonomous vehicles. To this end, we first convert the
would-be stochastic game problem into a closely related deterministic one by
introducing risk premium in the utility function for each individual agent. We
show how the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the simplified deterministic
game can be solved by an algorithm based on best response dynamics. In order to
better model human driving behaviors with bounded rationality, we seek to
further simplify the solution concept by replacing the Nash equilibrium
condition with a heuristic and adaptive optimization with finite look-ahead
anticipation. In addition, the algorithm corresponding to the new solution
concept drastically improves the computational efficiency. To demonstrate how
our approach can be applied to realistic traffic settings, we conduct a
simulation experiment: to derive merging and yielding behaviors on a
double-lane highway with an unexpected barrier. Despite assumption differences
involved in the two solution concepts, the derived numerical solutions show
that the endogenized driving behaviors are very similar. We also briefly
comment on how the proposed framework can be further extended in a number of
directions in our forthcoming work, such as behavioral calibration using real
traffic video data, computational mechanism design for traffic policy
optimization, and so on.

mostly (i) statistics-driven: inspired by human driver crash data, (ii)
deterministic: POV trajectories are pre-determined and are independent of SV
responses, and (iii) overly simplified: defined over a finite set of actions
performed at the abstracted motion planning level. Such scenario-based testing
(i) lacks severity guarantees, (ii) has predefined maneuvers making it easy for
an SV with intelligent driving policies to game the test, and (iii) is
inefficient in producing safety-critical instances with limited and expensive
testing effort. We propose a model-driven online feedback control policy for
multiple POVs which propagates efficient adversarial trajectories while
respecting traffic rules and other concerns formulated as an admissible
state-action space. The approach is formulated in an anchor-template hierarchy
structure, with the template model planning inducing a theoretical SV capturing
guarantee under standard assumptions. The planned adversarial trajectory is
then tracked by a lower-level controller applied to the full-system or the

various simulated examples with the SV controlled by either parameterized

catastrophic instabilities if not carefully handled. A key development to
overcome this issue is the log-conformation formulation, which has been applied

robust, and able to handle both internal and free-surface flows, and a range of
linear and non-linear constitutive models. Several test cases are considerd

presents a significant step change in capabilties compared to previous SPH
algorithms for viscoelastic flows, and has the potential to simulate a wide

Specification-driven trace-checking tools for CPS usually provide users with a

they are often not sufficiently expressive to allow the specification of
complex CPS properties related to the software and the physical components and
their interactions.
  In this paper, we propose (i) the Hybrid Logic of Signals (HLS), a
logic-based language that allows the specification of complex CPS requirements,
and (ii) ThEodorE, an efficient SMT-based trace-checking procedure. This
procedure reduces the problem of checking a CPS requirement over an execution

  We evaluated our contributions by using a representative industrial case
study in the satellite domain. We assessed the expressiveness of HLS by
considering 212 requirements of our case study. HLS could express all the 212
requirements. We also assessed the applicability of ThEodorE by running the
trace-checking procedure for 747 trace-requirement combinations. ThEodorE was
able to produce a verdict in 74.5% of the cases. Finally, we compared HLS and
ThEodorE with other specification languages and trace-checking tools from the

performance computing and machine learning. Recent NVIDIA GPUs include GEMM
accelerators, such as NVIDIA's Tensor Cores. Their exploitation is hampered by
the two-language problem: it requires either low-level programming which
implies low programmer productivity or using libraries that only offer a
limited set of components. Because rephrasing algorithms in terms of
established components often introduces overhead, the libraries' lack of
flexibility limits the freedom to explore new algorithms. Researchers using
GEMMs can hence not enjoy programming productivity, high performance, and
research flexibility at once.
  In this paper we solve this problem. We present three sets of abstractions
and interfaces to program GEMMs within the scientific Julia programming
language. The interfaces and abstractions are co-designed for researchers'
needs and Julia's features to achieve sufficient separation of concerns and
flexibility to easily extend basic GEMMs in many different ways without paying
a performance price. Comparing our GEMMs to state-of-the-art libraries cuBLAS
and CUTLASS, we demonstrate that our performance is in the same ballpark of the
libraries, and in some cases even exceeds it, without having to write a single
line of code in CUDA C++ or assembly, and without facing flexibility
limitations.

$\sim$10-30 kpc scales, while the rest are largely a combination of a radio
core unresolved at the uGMRT resolution of $\sim$3-5 arcsec, surrounded by
diffuse emission on few kpc to $\sim$10 kpc scales. A few sources reveal
signatures of barely resolved jets and lobes in their spectral index images
that are created using the uGMRT 685 MHz data and similar resolution
GHz-frequency data from the Very Large Array. On the basis of their position on
the radio-IR correlation as well as the spectral index images, we find that the
radio emission in the two radio-loud (RL) quasars and nearly one-third of the
radio-quiet (RQ) quasars is active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated whereas the
remaining sources appear to have significant contributions from stellar-related

spectral index in their cores, the RQ sources exhibit a range of spectral
indices varying from flat to steep ($-0.1\gtrsim\alpha_{R}\gtrsim-1.1$)
indicating the presence of unresolved jets/lobes or winds. Except for a
significant correlation between the 685~MHz radio luminosity and the Eddington
ratio, we do not find strong correlations between other 685 MHz radio
properties and black hole (BH) properties in the RQ PG sources. This lack of
correlations could be explained by the contribution of stellar-related
emission, or radio emission from previous AGN activity episodes which may not
be related to the current BH activity state.

semi-empirical potentials of the interatomic interaction. While there are many
reliable semi-empirical potentials for the bcc Fe, the number of the available
potentials for the fcc is very limited. In the present study we tested three
EAM potentials for the fcc Fe (ABCH97 [Phil. Mag. A, 75, 713-732 (1997)], BCT13
[MSMSE 21, 085004 (2013)] and ZFS18 [J. Comp. Chem. 39, 2420-2431 (2018)]) from
literature. It was found that the ABCH97 potential does not provide that the
fcc phase is the most stable at any temperature. On the other hand, the fcc
phase is always more stable than the bcc phase for the BCT13, ZFS18 potentials.
The hcp phase is the most stable phase for the BCT13 potential at any
temperature. In order to fix these problems we developed two new EAM potentials
(MB1 and MB2). The fcc phase is still more stable than the bcc phase for the
MB1 potential but the MB2 potential provides that the bcc phase is the most
stable phase from the upper fcc-bcc transformation temperature, T_gamma-delta,
to the melting temperature, Tm, and the fcc phase is the most stable phase
below T_gamma-delta. This potential also leads to an excellent agreement with
the experimental data on the fcc elastic constants and reasonable stacking
fault energy which makes it the best potential for the simulation of the
dislocation migration in the fcc Fe among all semi-empirical potentials
considered in the present study. The MD simulation demonstrated that only the
ZFS18, MB1 and MB2 potentials are actually suitable for the simulation of the
dislocation migration in the fcc Fe. They lead to the same orders of magnitude
for the dislocation velocities and all of them show that the edge dislocation
is faster than the screw dislocation. However, the actual values of the
dislocation velocities do depend on the employed semi-empirical potential.

nodes with similar patterns of edge formation. When such relational data are
complemented by additional information on exogenous node partitions, these

Although these solutions are routinely implemented, there is a lack of formal
approaches to test if a given external node partition is in line with the
endogenous clustering structure encoding stochastic equivalence patterns among
the nodes in the network. To fill this gap, we develop a formal Bayesian
testing procedure which relies on the calculation of the Bayes factor between a
stochastic block model with known grouping structure defined by the exogenous
node partition and an infinite relational model that allows the endogenous
clustering configurations to be unknown, random and fully revealed by the
block-connectivity patterns in the network. A simple Markov chain Monte Carlo
method for computing the Bayes factor and quantifying uncertainty in the
endogenous groups is proposed. This routine is evaluated in simulations and in
an application to study exogenous equivalence structures in brain networks of

We formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem, where the F-RAN

pedestrians are relatively small, frequently occluded and easily confused with

Unexpectedly, LiDAR-only detection methods tend to outperform multisensor
fusion methods in public benchmarks. Recently, PointPainting has been presented
to eliminate this performance drop by effectively fusing the output of a
semantic segmentation network instead of the raw image information. In this
paper, we propose a generalization of PointPainting to be able to apply fusion
at different levels. After the semantic augmentation of the point cloud, we
encode raw point data in pillars to get geometric features and semantic point
data in voxels to get semantic features and fuse them in an effective way.
Experimental results on the KITTI test set show that SemanticVoxels achieves

investigate accretion variability in IRS54, a Class I very low-mass protostar
with a mass of M$_{\star}$ ~ 0.1 - 0.2 M$_{\odot}$. We obtained spectroscopic
and photometric data with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI in the near-infrared ($J$,
$H$, and $K$ bands) across four epochs (2005, 2010, 2013, and 2014). We used
accretion-tracing lines (Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$) and outflow-tracing lines
(H$_2$ and [FeII] to examine physical properties and kinematics of the object.
A large increase in luminosity was found between the 2005 and 2013 epochs of
more than 1 magnitude in the $K$ band, followed in 2014 by a steep decrease.
Consistently, the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{acc}$) rose by an order of
magnitude from ~ 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to ~ $10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ between the two early epochs. The visual extinction ($A_V$) has also
increased from ~ 15 mag in 2005 to ~ 24 mag in 2013. This rise in $A_V$ in
tandem with the increase in $\dot{M}_{acc}$ is explained by the lifting up of a
large amount of dust from the disc of IRS54, following the augmented accretion
and ejection activity in the YSO, which intersects our line of sight due to the
almost edge-on geometry of the disc. Because of the strength and timescales
involved in this dramatic increase, this event is believed to have been an
accretion burst possibly similar to bursts of EXor-type objects. IRS54 is the
lowest mass Class I source observed to have an accretion burst of this type,
and therefore potentially one of the lowest mass EXor-type objects known so
far.

measure highly significant values for the proper motion and the related rate of

values of the rate of advance of periastron time ($\dot{\omega}$), and two of
the Shapiro delay parameters ($h_{3}$ and $\varsigma$). This has allowed us to
improve the measurements of the pulsar and companion masses by an order of
magnitude, yielding (with $1\sigma$ uncertainties)
$1.251^{+0.021}_{-0.021}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ for PSR J2045+3633, and
$0.873^{+0.016}_{-0.014}\,\text{M}_{\odot}$ for its white dwarf companion, and

the orbital size, we consider possible evolutionary scenarios for the system.

energy to be dissipated predominantly through rearrangement of the stars
internally, rather than chain sliding. During film deformation, stars with
large f show higher energy absorption rates soon after contact with the
projectile, whereas stars with larger M have a delayed response where
dissipation arises primarily from chain sliding, which results in significant
back face deformation. Our results suggest that stars may be advantageous for
tuning energy dissipation mechanisms of ultra-thin films. These findings set
the stage for a topology-based strategy for the design of impact-resistant

network design where we have to determine the capacity to reserve on each link
so that each demand vector belonging to a polyhedral set can be routed. The
objective is either to minimize congestion or a linear cost. Routing is assumed
to be fractional and dynamic (i.e., dependent on the current traffic vector).
We first prove that the robust network design problem with minimum congestion
cannot be approximated within any constant factor. Then, using the ETH
conjecture, we get a $\Omega(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ lower bound for the
approximability of this problem. This implies that the well-known $O(\log n)$
approximation ratio established by R\""{a}cke in 2008 is tight. Using Lagrange
relaxation, we obtain a new proof of the $O(\log n)$ approximation. An
important consequence of the Lagrange-based reduction and our inapproximability
results is that the robust network design problem with linear reservation cost
cannot be approximated within any constant ratio. This answers a long-standing
open question of Chekuri (2007). We also give another proof of the result of
Goyal\&al (2009) stating that the optimal linear cost under static routing can
be $\Omega(\log n)$ more expensive than the cost obtained under dynamic
routing. Finally, we show that even if only two given paths are allowed for
each commodity, the robust network design problem with minimum congestion or
linear cost is hard to approximate within some constant.

results in a linear system setting also provide insights and guidelines that

practice, every quantum system interacts with the environment leading to an

understanding of the fundamental process of decoherence of a two-state quantum
system interacting with a bosonic heat bath but the nature of transient
dynamics in the presence of hybrid diagonal and off-diagonal system-bath
interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate how the hybrid
system-bath interactions of an Ohmic environment induce localization in the
bias-free SBM. For strong coupling to the environment, localization is strongly
affected by a dynamically generated bias via the renormalization of the
tunneling amplitude. We find that counteractive effects of Hamiltonian
parameters on non-exponential short-time dynamics and long-time population
equilibration can lead to a separation of timescales and non-equilibrium
quantum coherent dynamics that can persist even for ultra-strong system-bath
interaction. The findings offer novel opportunities to exploit coherence as a
resource in quantum devices operating in the ultra-strong coupling regime.

decomposition in the presence of correlated additive noise; although it
nominally involves unobservables, we show how to apply it even where the noise
covariance structure is not a-priori known or is not independently estimable.
  The proposed method, which we call ScreeNOT, is a mathematically solid
alternative to Cattell's ever-popular but vague Scree Plot heuristic from 1966.
  ScreeNOT has a surprising oracle property: it typically achieves exactly, in
large finite samples, the lowest possible MSE for matrix recovery, on each
given problem instance - i.e. the specific threshold it selects gives exactly
the smallest achievable MSE loss among all possible threshold choices for that
noisy dataset and that unknown underlying true low rank model. The method is
computationally efficient and robust against perturbations of the underlying
covariance structure.
  Our results depend on the assumption that the singular values of the noise
have a limiting empirical distribution of compact support; this model, which is
standard in random matrix theory, is satisfied by many models exhibiting either
cross-row correlation structure or cross-column correlation structure, and also
by many situations where there is inter-element correlation structure.
Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method even at moderate matrix
sizes. The paper is supplemented by ready-to-use software packages implementing
the proposed algorithm: package ScreeNOT in Python (via PyPI) and R (via CRAN).

service rates. This paper further broadens this family by introducing
pass-and-swap (P&S) queues, an extension of OI queues where, upon a service
completion, the customer that completes service is not necessarily the one that
leaves the system. More precisely, we supplement the OI queue model with an
undirected graph on the customer classes, which we call a swapping graph, such
that there is an edge between two classes if customers of these classes can be
swapped with one another. When a customer completes service, it passes over
customers in the remainder of the queue until it finds a customer it can swap
positions with, that is, a customer whose class is a neighbor in the graph. In
its turn, the customer that is ejected from its position takes the position of
the next customer it can be swapped with, and so on. This is repeated until a
customer can no longer find another customer to be swapped with; this customer
is the one that leaves the queue. After proving that P&S queues have a
product-form stationary distribution, we derive a necessary and sufficient
stability condition for (open networks of) P&S queues that also applies to OI
queues. We then study irreducibility properties of closed networks of P&S
queues and derive the corresponding product-form stationary distribution.
Lastly, we demonstrate that closed networks of P&S queues can be applied to
describe the dynamics of new and existing load-distribution and scheduling
protocols in clusters of machines in which jobs have assignment constraints.

photoexcitation process remains localized within that skin depth in the
amorphous state. We then demonstrate that this is due to supersonic diffusion
of photoexcited electron-hole plasma in the crystalline state. Consequently
these findings prove the existence of a non-thermal transport of energy which
is much faster than lattice heat diffusion.

without properly learning the intended task. Recently proposed debiasing
methods are shown to be effective in mitigating this tendency. However, these
methods rely on a major assumption that the types of bias should be known
a-priori, which limits their application to many NLU tasks and datasets. In
this work, we present the first step to bridge this gap by introducing a
self-debiasing framework that prevents models from mainly utilizing biases
without knowing them in advance. The proposed framework is general and
complementary to the existing debiasing methods. We show that it allows these
existing methods to retain the improvement on the challenge datasets (i.e.,
sets of examples designed to expose models' reliance on biases) without
specifically targeting certain biases. Furthermore, the evaluation suggests
that applying the framework results in improved overall robustness.

  Topological data analysis traditionally considers a point cloud in a

discusses the approach Virtual Citation Proximity (VCP) which uses Siamese
Neural Network along with the notion of citation proximity analysis and
content-based filtering. To train this model, the actual distance between the
two citations in a document is used as ground truth, this distance is the word
count between the two citations. VCP is trained on Wikipedia articles for which
the actual word count is available which is used to calculate the similarity

documents in a way they would have been cited in the proximity even if the
documents are uncited. This approach has shown a great improvement in
predicting proximity with basic neural networks over the approach which uses
the Average Citation Proximity index value as the ground truth. This can be
improved by using a complex neural network and proper hyper tuning of

Supervised learning is powerful when the labeled data is sufficient. However,
on online recruitment platforms, job-resume interaction data is sparse and
noisy, which affects the performance of job-resume match algorithms. To
alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view
co-teaching network from sparse interaction data for job-resume matching. Our
network consists of two major components, namely text-based matching model and
relation-based matching model. The two parts capture semantic compatibility in
two different views, and complement each other. In order to address the
challenges from sparse and noisy data, we design two specific strategies to
combine the two components. First, two components share the learned parameters
or representations, so that the original representations of each component can
be enhanced. More importantly, we adopt a co-teaching mechanism to reduce the
influence of noise in training data. The core idea is to let the two components
help each other by selecting more reliable training instances. The two
strategies focus on representation enhancement and data enhancement,
respectively. Compared with pure text-based matching models, the proposed
approach is able to learn better data representations from limited or even
sparse interaction data, which is more resistible to noise in training data.
Experiment results have demonstrated that our model is able to outperform
state-of-the-art methods for job-resume matching.

COVID-19pandemic has shown multiple benefits, including helping to slow the
spread of infectious disease and to improve the dissemination of accurate

adoption, privacy must be at the forefront. With the loss of privacy being a
critical threat, thorough threat modeling will help us to strategize and
protect privacy as digital contact tracing technologies advance. Various threat
modeling frameworks exist today, such as LINDDUN, STRIDE, PASTA, and NIST,
which focus on software system privacy, system security, application security,
and data-centric risk, respectively. When applied to the exposure notification
system (ENS) context, these models provide a thorough view of the software side
but fall short in addressing the integrated nature of hardware, humans,
regulations, and software involved in such systems. Our approach addresses
ENSsas a whole and provides a model that addresses the privacy complexities of
a multi-faceted solution. We define privacy principles, privacy threats,
attacker capabilities, and a comprehensive threat model. Finally, we outline
threat mitigation strategies that address the various threats defined in our
model

reported incidence of Zika virus occurred in Brazil in May 2015. The disease
then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East Asia, affecting
more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites
of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes
albopictus). The abundance of mosquitoes and, as a result, the prevalence of
Zika virus infections are common in areas which have high precipitation, high
temperature, and high population density.Nonlinear spatio-temporal dependency
of such data and lack of historical public health records make prediction of
the virus spread particularly challenging. In this article, we enhance Zika
forecasting by introducing the concepts of topological data analysis and,
specifically, persistent homology of atmospheric variables, into the virus
spread modeling. The topological summaries allow for capturing higher order
dependencies among atmospheric variables that otherwise might be unassessable
via conventional spatio-temporal modeling approaches based on geographical
proximity assessed via Euclidean distance. We introduce a new concept of
cumulative Betti numbers and then integrate the cumulative Betti numbers as
topological descriptors into three predictive machine learning models: random
forest, generalized boosted regression, and deep neural network. Furthermore,
to better quantify for various sources of uncertainties, we combine the
resulting individual model forecasts into an ensemble of the Zika spread
predictions using Bayesian model averaging. The proposed methodology is
illustrated in application to forecasting of the Zika space-time spread in
Brazil in the year 2018.

$t_{0}$, by available measurements of the isolated and recovered individuals at
two succeeding times, $ t_{0}$ and $ T>t_{0}.$ Simultaneously, we identify the
rate standing for the average number of individuals infected in unit time by an
infective symptomatic individual. Then, we propose a control problem aiming at
controlling the infected classes by improving the actions in view of isolating
as much as possible the populations $ A$ and $ I$ in the class $ L$. These
objectives are formulated as minimization problems, the second one including a
state constraint, which are treated by an optimal control technique. The
existence of optimal controllers is proved and the first order necessary

deduced by passing to the limit in the conditions of optimality calculated for
an appropriately defined approximating problem. In this case, the dual system
is singular and has a component in the space of measures. The discussion of the
asymptotic stability of the system done for the case when life immunity is

Wainwright, described in the 1959 Scientific American[1], brought Bill to
interview at Livermore in 1962. Hired by Berni, Bill enjoyed over 40 years'
research at the Laboratory. Berni, along with Edward Teller, founded UC's
Department of Applied Science in 1963. Their motivation was to attract bright
students to use the laboratory's unparalleled research facilities. In 1972
Carol was offered a joint LLNL employee-DAS student appointment at Livermore.
Bill, thanks to Berni's efforts, was already a Professor at DAS. Carol became
one of Bill's best students. Berni's influence was directly responsible for our
physics collaboration and our marriage in 1989. The present work is devoted to
two early interests of Berni's, irreversibility and shockwaves. Berni and Tom
studied the irreversibility of Boltzmann's ""H function"" in the early 1950s[2].
Berni called shockwaves the ""most irreversible"" of hydrodynamic processes[3].
Just this past summer, in simulating shockwaves with time-reversible classical
mechanics, we found that reversed Runge-Kutta shockwave simulations yielded
nonsteady rarefaction waves, not shocks. Intrigued by this unexpected result we
studied the exponential Lyapunov instabilities in both wave types. Besides the
Runge-Kutta and Leapfrog algorithms, we developed a precisely-reversible
manybody algorithm based on trajectory storing, just changing the velocities'
signs to generate the reversed trajectories. Both shocks and rarefactions were
precisely reversed. Separate simulations, forward and reversed, provide
interesting examples of the Lyapunov-unstable symmetry-breaking models
supporting the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We describe promising research
directions suggested by this work.

multi-party security scenarios, a separable RDH-ED scheme for secret image
sharing based on Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is presented. In the
application of (t, n) secret image sharing, the image is first shared into n
different shares of ciphertext. Only when not less than t shares obtained, can
the original image be reconstructed. In our scheme, additional data could be
embedded into the image shares. To realize data extraction from the image
shares and the reconstructed image separably, two data hiding methods are
proposed: one is homomorphic difference expansion in encrypted domain (HDE-ED)
that supports data extraction from the reconstructed image by utilizing the
addition homomorphism of CRT secret sharing; the other is difference expansion
in image shares (DE-IS) that supports the data extraction from the marked
shares before image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme could not only maintain the security and the threshold function
of secret sharing system, but also obtain a better reversibility and efficiency
compared with most existing RDH-ED algorithms. The maximum embedding rate of
HDE-ED could reach 0.5000 bits per pixel and the average embedding rate of
DE-IS is 0.0545 bits per bit of ciphertext.
