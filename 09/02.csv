$-$1.08 $\pm$ 0.04 and $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$ = 0.40 $\pm$ 0.03.
Between 8--34 kpc, the inner halo has a steep [Fe/H] gradient ($-$0.025 $\pm$
0.002 dex kpc$^{-1}$) and negligible [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient, where substructure
in the inner halo is systematically more metal-rich than the smooth component
of the halo at a given projected distance. Although the chemical abundances of
the inner stellar halo are largely inconsistent with that of present-day dwarf

kinematically associated with the smooth component of the stellar halo that
have chemical abundance patterns similar to M31 dSphs. We discuss formation
scenarios for M31's halo, concluding that these dSph-like stars may have been
accreted from galaxies of similar stellar mass and star formation history, or
of higher stellar mass and similar star formation efficiency.

appropriate way will introduce improvements in the individual predictions made

diversity of the base models. Of the most common solutions for introducing
diversity into the decision trees are bagging and random forest. Bagging
enhances the diversity by sampling with replacement and generating many
training data sets, while random forest adds selecting a random number of
features as well. This has made the random forest a winning candidate for many
machine learning applications. However, assuming equal weights for all base
decision trees does not seem reasonable as the randomization of sampling and
input feature selection may lead to different levels of decision-making
abilities across base decision trees. Therefore, we propose several algorithms
that intend to modify the weighting strategy of regular random forest and
consequently make better predictions. The designed weighting frameworks include
optimal weighted random forest based on ac-curacy, optimal weighted random
forest based on the area under the curve (AUC), performance-based weighted
random forest, and several stacking-based weighted random forest models. The
numerical results show that the proposed models are able to introduce

that a delayed coincidence signature from long-lived states predicted in

provide a duality, which keeps entanglement spectrum invariant, in order to
diagnose quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian non-interacting fermionic
systems. We limit our attention to non-Hermitian systems with a complete set of
biorthonormal eigenvectors and an entirely real energy spectrum. The original
system has a reduced density matrix $\rho_\mathrm{o}$ and the real space is
partitioned via a projecting operator $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm o}$. After
dualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix $\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$ and a
new real space projector $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm d}$. Remarkably, entanglement
spectrum and entanglement entropy keep invariant. Inspired by the duality, we
defined two types of non-Hermitian models, upon $\mathcal R_{\mathrm{o}}$ is
given. In type-I exemplified by the ``non-reciprocal model'', there exists at
least one duality such that $\rho_{\mathrm{d}}$ is Hermitian. In other words,
entanglement information of type-I non-Hermitian models with a given
$\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{o}}$ is entirely controlled by Hermitian models with
$\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{d}}$. As a result, we are allowed to apply known results
of Hermitian systems to efficiently obtain entanglement properties of type-I
models. On the other hand, the duals of type-II models, exemplified by
``non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'', are always non-Hermitian. For the
practical purpose, the duality provides a potentially \textit{efficient}
computation route to entanglement of non-Hermitian systems. Via connecting
different models, the duality also sheds lights on either trivial or nontrivial
role of non-Hermiticity played in quantum entanglement, paving the way to
potentially systematic classification and characterization of non-Hermitian

seen from a large number of astrophysical objects. For a number of reasons, in
particular their proximity and the abundant range of diagnostics to determine
their characteristics, jets from young stars and their associated outflows may
offer us the best opportunity to discover how jets are generated in general and
the nature of the link between outflows and their accretion disks. Recently it
has become clear that jets may be fundamental to the star formation process in
removing angular momentum from the surrounding protoplanetary disk thereby
allowing accretion to proceed. Moreover, with the realisation that planetary
formation begins much earlier than previously thought, jets may also help forge
planets by determining initial environmental characteristics. This seems to be
particularly true within the so-called terrestrial planet forming zone. Here we
review observations of jets from young stars which have greatly benefitted from
new facilities such as ALMA, space observatories like Spitzer, Herschel and
HST, and radio facilities like LOFAR and the VLA. Interferometers such as CHARA
and GRAVITY are starting to make inroads into resolving how they are launched,
and we can look forward to a bright future in our understanding of this
phenomenon when JWST and the SKA come on stream. In addition, we examine the
various magnetohydrodynamic models for how jets from young stars are thought to
be generated and how observations may help us select between these various
options.

an essential step that requires complex techniques with careful

To close this gap, we present our MultiSegVA platform for interactively
defining segmentation techniques and parameters on multiple temporal scales.
MultiSegVA primarily contributes tailored, visual-interactive means and visual
analytics paradigms for segmenting unlabeled time series on multiple scales.
Further, to flexibly compose the multi-scale segmentation, the platform
contributes a new visual query language that links a variety of segmentation
techniques. To illustrate our approach, we present a domain-oriented set of
segmentation techniques derived in collaboration with movement ecologists. We
demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of MultiSegVA in two real-world
use cases from movement ecology, related to behavior analysis after
environment-aware segmentation, and after progressive clustering. Expert
feedback from movement ecologists shows the effectiveness of tailored
visual-interactive means and visual analytics paradigms at segmenting
multi-scale data, enabling them to perform semantically meaningful analyses. A
third use case demonstrates that MultiSegVA is generalizable to other domains.

assumes treatment uptake to be monotonic in all instruments, capturing the

$d$-dimensional hypercube $Q_d$ induces a subgraph of maximum degree at least
$\sqrt{d}$, which is tight by a result of Chung, F\""uredi, Graham, and Seymour.
Huang asked whether similar results can be obtained for other highly symmetric
graphs.
  First, we present three infinite families of Cayley graphs of unbounded
degree that contain induced subgraphs of maximum degree $1$ on more than half
the vertices. In particular, this refutes a conjecture of Potechin and Tsang,
for which first counterexamples were shown recently by Lehner and Verret. The
first family consists of dihedrants and contains a sporadic counterexample
encountered earlier by Lehner and Verret. The second family are star graphs,
these are edge-transitive Cayley graphs of the symmetric group. All members of
the third family are $d$-regular containing an induced matching on a
$\frac{d}{2d-1}$-fraction of the vertices. This is largest possible and answers
a question of Lehner and Verret.
  Second, we consider Huang's lower bound for graphs with subcubes and show
that the corresponding lower bound is tight for products of Coxeter groups of
type $\mathbf{A_n}$, $\mathbf{I_2}(2k+1)$, and most exceptional cases. We
believe that Coxeter groups are a suitable generalization of the hypercube with
respect to Huang's question.
  Finally, we show that induced subgraphs on more than half the vertices of
Levi graphs of projective planes and of the Ramanujan graphs of Lubotzky,
Phillips, and Sarnak have unbounded degree. This gives classes of Cayley graphs
with properties similar to the ones provided by Huang's results. However, in
contrast to Coxeter groups these graphs have no subcubes.

provide several results which were missing in the early derivation: i) a
rigorous proof of the convergence of the SINC formula to the correct option

ii) ready to implement formulas for put, Cash-or-Nothing, and Asset-or-Nothing

pricing exercise under the rough Heston model of Jaisson and Rosenbaum (2015);

advantages of the SINC approach are numerous. When compared to benchmark
methodologies, SINC provides the most accurate and fast pricing computation.
The method naturally lends itself to price all options in a smile concurrently

that different patterns of time-dependent Peierls phases that all give rise to

the cm dust emission substructure in discs for integration times totalling

applications of Bayesian or Dempster-Shafer methods, and the default approach
here would be methods based on the principle of indifference, such as the sum
or product rule, which essentially weight all classifiers equally. In contrast,
our approach considers the diversity between the outputs of the various
classifiers, iteratively updating predictions based on their correspondence
with other predictions until the predictions converge to a consensus decision.
The intuition behind this approach is that classifiers trained for the same
task should typically exhibit regularities in their outputs on a new task; the
predictions of classifiers which differ significantly from those of others are
thus given less credence using our approach. The approach implicitly assumes a
symmetric loss function, in that the relative cost of various prediction errors
are not taken into account. Performance of the model is demonstrated on
different benchmark datasets. Our proposed method works well in situations
where accuracy is the performance metric; however, it does not output

perform unambiguous statistical studies of fundamental plasma processes such as
shocks, magnetic reconnection, waves and turbulence, jets and their
combinations. The majority of available studies have been performed by using
human-driven methods, such as visual data selection or the application of
predefined thresholds to different observable plasma quantities. While
human-driven methods have allowed performing many statistical studies, these
methods are often time-consuming and can introduce important biases. On the
other hand, the recent availability of large, high-quality spacecraft
databases, together with major advances in machine-learning algorithms, can now
allow meaningful applications of machine learning to in-situ plasma data. In
this study, we apply the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) deep
machine-leaning algorithm to the recent Magnetospheric Multi Scale (MMS)
mission data in order to classify ten key plasma regions in near-Earth space
for the period 2016-2019. For this purpose, we use available intervals of time
series for each such plasma region, which were labeled by using human-driven
selective downlink applied to MMS burst data. We discuss several quantitative
parameters to assess the accuracy of both methods. Our results indicate that
the FCN method is reliable to accurately classify labeled time series data
since it takes into account the dynamical features of the plasma data in each
region. We also present good accuracy of the FCN method when applied to
unlabeled MMS data. Finally, we show how this method used on MMS data can be
extended to data from the Cluster mission, indicating that such method can be
successfully applied to any in situ spacecraft plasma database.

limitation, data augmentation and semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have
been developed. However, these methods have limited effectiveness as they
either exploit the existing data set only (data augmentation) or risk negative
impact by adding poor training examples (SSL). Segmentations are rarely the
final product of medical image analysis - they are typically used in downstream
tasks to infer higher-order patterns to evaluate diseases. Clinicians take into
account a wealth of prior knowledge on biophysics and physiology when
evaluating image analysis results. We have used these clinical assessments in
previous works to create robust quality-control (QC) classifiers for automated
cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
scheme that uses QC of the downstream task to identify high quality outputs of
CMR segmentation networks, that are subsequently utilised for further network
training. In essence, this provides quality-aware augmentation of training data
in a variant of SSL for segmentation networks (semiQCSeg). We evaluate our
approach in two CMR segmentation tasks (aortic and short axis cardiac volume
segmentation) using UK Biobank data and two commonly used network architectures
(U-net and a Fully Convolutional Network) and compare against supervised and
SSL strategies. We show that semiQCSeg improves training of the segmentation
networks. It decreases the need for labelled data, while outperforming the
other methods in terms of Dice and clinical metrics. SemiQCSeg can be an
efficient approach for training segmentation networks for medical image data

networks \autocite{GAN}, variational autoencoders \autocite{vaepaper}, and
their variants, have seen wide adoption for the task of modelling complex data
distributions. In spite of the outstanding sample quality achieved by those
early methods, they model the target distributions \emph{implicitly}, in the
sense that the probability density functions induced by them are not explicitly
accessible. This fact renders those methods unfit for tasks that require, for
example, scoring new instances of data with the learned distributions.
Normalizing flows have overcome this limitation by leveraging the
change-of-variables formula for probability density functions, and by using
transformations designed to have tractable and cheaply computable Jacobians.
Although flexible, this framework lacked (until recently
\autocites{semisuplearning_nflows, RAD}) a way to introduce discrete structure
(such as the one found in mixtures) in the models it allows to construct, in an
unsupervised scenario. The present work overcomes this by using normalizing
flows as components in a mixture model and devising an end-to-end training
procedure for such a model. This procedure is based on variational inference,
and uses a variational posterior parameterized by a neural network. As will
become clear, this model naturally lends itself to (multimodal) density
estimation, semi-supervised learning, and clustering. The proposed model is
illustrated on two synthetic datasets, as well as on a real-world dataset.

mode -- scalar or vectorial, and LSE/LSM or TE/TM in the latter case. The
unification is based on the integral superposition of constituent waves along
the angular-spectrum cone of the beam, and allows to describe, compute, relate,
and implement all the Bessel beams, and even other types of beams, in a
universal fashion. The paper first establishes the integral superposition
theory. Then, it demonstrates the previously unreported existence of
noninteger-OAM TE/TM Bessel beams, compares the LSE/LSM and TE/TM modes, and
establishes useful mathematical relations between them. It also provides an
original description of the position of the noninteger-OAM singularity in terms
of the initial phase of the constituent waves. Finally, it introduces a general
technique to generate Bessel beams by an adequate superposition of properly
tuned sources. This global perspective and theoretical extension may open up
new avenues in applications such as spectroscopy, microscopy, and
optical/quantum force manipulations.

field theory leading to a Hamiltonian formulation in which states or operators
evolve with respect to the clock given by a free massless scalar field, similar
to what happens in deparametrised models in quantum cosmology. Here we extend
the construction of Hamiltonian group field theory to models with multiple
scalar matter fields, encountering new features and technical subtleties
compared with the previously studied case. We show that the effective
cosmological dynamics for these more general models reduce to the Friedmann
dynamics of general relativity with multiple scalar fields in the limit of
large volume, if suitable (non-generic) initial conditions are chosen. At high
energy, we find corrections to the classical Friedmann equations whose form is
similar to what is found in loop quantum cosmology. These corrections lead to
generic singularity resolution by a bounce. For generic initial conditions, the
effective cosmological dynamics treat the 'clock' field and other matter fields
differently, in disagreement with the Friedmann dynamics of general relativity.
We speculate on a possible interpretation in terms of inhomogeneities.

bottom-heavy in the centres of the most massive, metal-rich early-type
galaxies. It is still unclear what physical processes might cause this IMF
variation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the abundance of deuterium in the
birth clouds of forming stars may be important in setting the IMF. We use
models of disc accretion onto low-mass protostars to show that those forming
from deuterium-poor gas are expected to have zero-age main sequence masses
significantly lower than those forming from primordial (high deuterium
fraction) material. This deuterium abundance effect depends on stellar mass in
our simple models, such that the resulting IMF would become bottom-heavy - as
seen in observations. Stellar mass loss is entirely deuterium-free and is
important in fuelling star formation across cosmic time. Using the EAGLE
simulation we show that stellar mass loss-induced deuterium variations are
strongest in the same regions where IMF variations are observed: at the centres
of the most massive, metal-rich, passive galaxies. While our analysis cannot
prove that the deuterium abundance is the root cause of the observed IMF
variation, it sets the stage for future theoretical and observational attempts
to study this possibility.

consistent with an average ratio of the continuum attenuation to the nebular

nebular dust attenuation as measured by (space-based) $\Pab$ to (ground-based)

differences between attenuation measured from grism-based / wide-aperture

Unfortunately, a large number of topological materials suffer from non-ideal

non-symmorphic symmetry to design an idealized Dirac semimetal. We then show
experimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb$_{0.46}$Te$_{1.48}$ is
a nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that
most interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual

validating the analytic approach and providing substantial reduction in

analytic covariances. First, the analysis does not suffer from sampling noise,
which biases the constraints and typically requires inflating parameter error
bars. Second, it allows us to study convergence of the cosmological constraints
when recomputing the analytic covariances to match the best-fit power spectrum,
which can be done at a negligible computational cost, unlike when using mock

constraints, which suggests that the analytic approach may be an important tool
for upcoming high-precision galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.
Finally, we study the impact of various ingredients in the power spectrum
covariance matrix and show that the non-Gaussian part, which includes the
regular trispectrum and super-sample covariance, has a marginal effect

Several physical properties of solar polar plumes have been

sometimes in disagreement. Aims. The purpose of the present work is to analyze
a set of SOHO/UVCS data dedicated to the observation of plumes and to obtain a
picture of the physical properties of plumes in the intermediate solar corona
through a self-consistent analysis. Methods. We applied the Doppler Dimming
technique to data acquired by SOHO/UVCS in April 1996, which was during the
very early phases of the mission. From this we derived outflow speeds and
electron densities. We used SOHO/LASCO images as context data in order to
better identify plume and interplume regions in the UVCS field of view.
Results. The results we obtain demonstrate that in three cases out of four
plumes expand with outflow speeds comparable to those of interplumes, and in a
single case with lower speeds. We estimate that the contribution of plumes to
the wind coming from the solar poles is about 20%, and that different plumes
provide a different contribution, possibly according to different stages of
their evolution. Conclusions. We conclude that plumes are not static
structures, and that they contribute significantly to the wind coming from the

is disordered at finite temperature, the curvature of the spherical surface
provides non-zero critical temperature for Schwinger boson condensation, which

physical FPGA fabrics. An overlay that is specialized for an application, or a
class of applications, offers both fast reconfiguration and minimized
performance penalty. Such an overlay is usually implemented by hardware
designers in hardware ""assembly"" languages at register-transfer level (RTL).
  This short article proposes an idea for a software programmer, instead of
hardware designers, to quickly implement an application-specific overlay using
high-level customizable IPs. These IPs are expressed succinctly by a
specification language, whose abstraction level is much higher than RTL but can
nonetheless expresses many performance-critical loop and data optimizations on
FPGAs, and thus would offer competitively high performance at a much lower cost
of maintenance and much easier customizations.
  We propose new language features to easily put the IPs together into an
overlay. A compiler automatically implements the specified optimizations to
generate an efficient overlay, exposes a multi-tasking programming interface
for the overlay, and inserts a runtime scheduler for scheduling tasks to run on
the IPs of the overlay, respecting the dependences between the tasks. While an
application written in any language can take advantage of the overlay through
the programming interface, we show a particular usage scenario, where the
application itself is also succinctly specified in the same language.
  We describe the new language features for expressing overlays, and illustrate
the features with an LU decomposer and a convolutional neural network. A system
is under construction to implement the language features and workloads.

high inclination angles, relatively even mass ratios, and modest jet speeds,
the eclipses may be deeper. We discuss how eclipses can be used to measure

evolution of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo, extracted from a cosmological
zoom-in simulation. For each snapshot, the density of the halo is reduced to a
basis function expansion, with interpolation used to recreate the evolution
between snapshots. The angular variation of the halo density is described by
spherical harmonics, and the radial variation either by biorthonormal basis
functions adapted to handle truncated haloes or by splines. High fidelity orbit
reconstructions are attainable using either method with similar computational
expense. We quantify how the error in the reconstructed orbits varies with
expansion order and snapshot spacing. Despite the many possible biorthonormal
expansions, it is hard to beat a conventional Hernquist-Ostriker expansion with
a moderate number of terms ($\gtrsim15$ radial and $\gtrsim6$ angular). As two
applications of the developed machinery, we assess the impact of the
time-dependence of the potential on (i) the orbits of Milky Way satellites, and
(ii) planes of satellites as observed in the Milky Way and other nearby
galaxies. Time evolution over the last 5 Gyr introduces an uncertainty in the
Milky Way satellites' orbital parameters of $\sim 15$ per cent, comparable to
that induced by the observational errors or the uncertainty in the present-day
Milky Way potential. On average, planes of satellites grow at similar rates in
evolving and time-independent potentials. There can be more, or less, growth in
the plane's thickness, if the plane becomes less, or more, aligned with the
major or minor axis of the evolving halo.

from regression depth (RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999) (RH99) is one of the
most prevailing estimators in regression. It possesses outstanding robustness
similar to the univariate location counterpart. Indeed, $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$
can, asymptotically, resist up to $33\%$ contamination without breakdown, in
contrast to the $0\%$ for the traditional (least squares and least absolute
deviations) estimators (see Van Aelst and Rousseeuw, 2000) (VAR00)). The
results from VAR00 are pioneering, yet they are limited to regression-symmetric
populations (with a strictly positive density) and the $\epsilon$-contamination
and maximum-bias model. With a fixed finite-sample size practice, the most
prevailing measure of robustness for estimators is the finite-sample breakdown
point (FSBP) (Donoho and Huber (1983)). Despite many attempts made in the
literature, only sporadic partial results on FSBP for $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ were
obtained whereas an exact FSBP for $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ remained open in the
last twenty-plus years. Furthermore, is the asymptotic breakdown value $1/3$
(the limit of an increasing sequence of finite-sample breakdown values)
relevant in the finite-sample practice? (Or what is the difference between the
finite-sample and the limit breakdown values?). Such discussions are yet to be
given in the literature. This article addresses the above issues, revealing an
intrinsic connection between the regression depth of $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ and
the newly obtained exact FSBP. It justifies the employment of
$\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ as a robust alternative to the traditional estimators and
demonstrates the necessity and the merit of using the FSBP in finite-sample
real practice.

converting a continual graph learning problem to a regular graph learning

convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose a new topology, the feature
graph, which takes features as new nodes and turns nodes into independent
graphs. This successfully converts the original problem of node classification
to graph classification. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of feature graph networks (FGN) by continuously learning a
sequence of classical graph datasets. We also show that FGN achieves superior
performance in two applications, i.e., lifelong human action recognition with
wearable devices and feature matching. To the best of our knowledge, FGN is the

that is not traced by CO(1-0), but residing in the C+ - emitting regions. We
explore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what
parameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir. We present Cloudy grids of
density, radiation field and metallicity in terms of observed quantities, such
as [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity and the total MH2 and
provide recipes based on these models to derive total MH2 mass estimates from
observations. The models are applied to the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey,
extracting the total MH2 for each galaxy which is compared to the H2 determined
from the observed CO(1-0) line. While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be
negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of
the total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is
well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line. The CO-dark gas mass fraction correlates
with the observed L[CII]/LCO(1-0) ratio. A conversion factor for [CII]
luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a
function of metallicity, is presented. A recipe is provided to quantify the
total mass of H2 in galaxies, taking into account the CO and [CII]
observations. Accounting for this CO-dark H2 gas, we find that the star forming
dwarf galaxies now fall on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. Their star-forming
efficiency is rather normal, since the reservoir from which they form stars is
now more massive when introducing the [CII] measures of the total H2, compared
to the little amount of H2 in the CO-emitting region.

a chiral spectrum of tensor fluctuations that is considerably enhanced relative
to the vacuum fluctuations. If the field content of CNI acts purely as a
spectator (SCNI), the inflationary sector can be consistent with current data
making SCNI very appealing in view of future observations. We investigate the
prospects of embedding SCNI in string theory, in the framework of K\""ahler
inflation in type IIB large volume string compactifications, with a spectator
sector associated with gaugino condensation on multiply magnetised D7-branes.
We first introduce a generalised field theory framework that describes
non-trivial multifield inflation coupled to gauge fields of the form
generically arising in supergravity and string theory. We then use these
results to study numerically and analytically both the background evolution and
the dynamics of cosmological perturbations. We show that a successful
inflationary background evolution with a large enhancement of the gravitational
wave spectrum and a controllable backreaction from the amplified tensor
fluctuations can be achieved by considering suitable values of three parameters
present in our scenario: the magnetic flux, the degree of the condensing gauge
group and the wrapping number of the D7-brane. On the other hand, the required
values for these quantities may present a challenge for its successful
realisation within string theory. We also discuss these challenges and the
model from the viewpoint of the weak gravity conjecture.

structural biology and network analysis. State of the art methods solve special
cases of the motif problem by constraining the structural variability in
occurrences of a motif, and narrowing the substructure search space. Here, we
relax these constraints by posing the motif finding problem as a graph
representation learning and clustering task. This framing takes advantage of
the continuous nature of graph representations to model the flexibility and
variability of RNA motifs in an efficient manner. We propose a set of node
similarity functions, clustering methods, and motif construction algorithms to

sequential decision-making problems that involve uncertainty. One typically
overlooked aspect of this methodology is how uncertainty is incorporated into
modeling. Traditionally, statistical forecasting techniques with simple forms,
e.g., (first-order) autoregressive time-series models, are used to extract
scenarios to be added to optimization models to represent the uncertain future.
However, often times, the performance of these forecasting models are not
thoroughly assessed. Motivated by the advances in probabilistic forecasting, we
incorporate a deep learning-based time-series forecasting method into
multistage stochastic programming framework, and compare it with the cases
where a traditional forecasting method is employed to model the uncertainty. We
assess the impact of more accurate forecasts on the quality of two commonly
used look-ahead policies, a deterministic one and a two-stage one, in a
rolling\red{-}horizon framework on a practical problem. Our results illustrate
that more accurate forecasts contribute substantially to the model performance,
and enable obtaining high-quality solutions even from computationally cheap
heuristics. They also show that the probabilistic forecasting capabilities of
deep learning-based methods can be especially beneficial when used as a
(conditional) sampling tool for scenario-based models, and to predict the
worst-case scenario for risk-averse models.

recover the characteristic times when satellite galaxies are stripped and
quenched. Stripping in massive ($M_\mathrm{ vir}\sim
10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) clusters typically occurs at or just before the
first pericentric passage. Lower mass ($\sim10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$)
groups strip their satellites on a significantly longer (by
$\sim3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) timescale. Quenching occurs later: Balmer emission lines
typically fade $\sim3.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ($5.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) after first
pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred $\mathrm{Myr}$ later by
reddenning in $(g-r)$ colour. These `delay timescales' are remarkably constant
across the entire satellite stellar mass range probed
($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), a feature closely tied to our
treatment of `group pre-processing'. The lowest mass groups in our sample
($\sim10^{12.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) strip and quench their satellites extremely
inefficiently: typical timescales may approach the age of the Universe. Our
measurements are qualitatively consistent with the `delayed-then-rapid'

its mass is probed through other emission lines (e.g., CO, [CI], [CII]), or
through a gas-to-dust ratio. Each of these methods depends on several
assumptions, and are best used in parallel. In this work, we extend an
additional molecular gas tracer to high-redshift studies by observing hydrogen
deuteride (HD) emission in the strongly lensed $z=5.656$ galaxy SPT0346-52 with
ALMA. While no HD(1-0) emission is detected, we are able to place an upper
limit on the gas mass of $\rm M_{H_2}<6.4\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. This is used
to find a limit on the $\rm L'_{CO}$ conversion factor of $\rm\alpha_{CO}<5.8$
M$_{\odot}$(K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$. In addition, we construct the most
complete spectral energy distribution (SED) of this source to date, and fit it

sub-solar metallicity. This implies a CO conversion factor of $\rm

metastasis before surgery plays an essential role in determining optimal

neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Although developing radiomics based machine learning
(ML) models has attracted broad research interest for this purpose, it often
faces a challenge of how to build a highly performed and robust ML model using
small and imbalanced image datasets. Methods: In this study, we explore a new
approach to build an optimal ML model. A retrospective dataset involving
abdominal computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 159 patients diagnosed
with gastric cancer is assembled. Among them, 121 cases have peritoneal
metastasis (PM), while 38 cases do not have PM. A computer-aided detection
(CAD) scheme is first applied to segment primary gastric tumor volumes and
initially computes 315 image features. Then, two Gradient Boosting Machine
(GBM) models embedded with two different feature dimensionality reduction
methods, namely, the principal component analysis (PCA) and a random projection
algorithm (RPA) and a synthetic minority oversampling technique, are built to
predict the risk of the patients having PM. All GBM models are trained and
tested using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method. Results: Results
show that the GBM embedded with RPA yielded a significantly higher prediction
accuracy (71.2%) than using PCA (65.2%) (p<0.05). Conclusions: The study
demonstrated that CT images of the primary gastric tumors contain
discriminatory information to predict the risk of PM, and RPA is a promising
method to generate optimal feature vector, improving the performance of ML
models of medical images.

observed flux ratio, R_obs = (f_12.7/f_11.2)_obs strongly correlates with the
silicate strength (S_sil) confirming that differences in R_obs reflect
variation in the optical depth. The relation between R_obs and S_sil reproduces
predictions for the Galactic Centre extinction law but disagrees with other
laws. We calibrate the total extinction affecting the 11.2 micron PAH from
R_obs, which we apply to another sample of 215 galaxies with accurate

extinction-corrected L_11.2 is proportional to L_IR in the range L_IR/L_sun =

understand surgeries. With the understanding of the complete surgical workflow,
the robots are able to assist the surgeons in intra-operative events, such as
by giving a warning when the surgeon is entering specific keys or high-risk
phases. Deep learning techniques have recently been widely applied to
recognizing surgical workflows. Many of the existing temporal neural network
models are limited in their capability to handle long-term dependencies in the
data, instead, relying upon the strong performance of the underlying per-frame
visual models. We propose a new temporal network structure that leverages
task-specific network representation to collect long-term sufficient statistics
that are propagated by a sufficient statistics model (SSM). We implement our
approach within an LSTM backbone for the task of surgical phase recognition and
explore several choices for propagated statistics. We demonstrate superior
results over existing and novel state-of-the-art segmentation techniques on two
laparoscopic cholecystectomy datasets: the publicly available Cholec80 dataset
and MGH100, a novel dataset with more challenging and clinically meaningful
segment labels.

important features at multiple scales of time and/or space; examples include
biological tissues, active matter, oceans, networks, and images. Explicitly
extracting, describing, and defining such features are difficult tasks, at
least in part because each system has a unique set of features. Here, we
introduce an analysis method that, given a set of observations, discovers an
energetic hierarchy of structures localized in scale and space. We call the
resulting basis vectors a ""data-driven wavelet decomposition"". We show that
this decomposition reflects the inherent structure of the dataset it acts on,
whether it has no structure, structure dominated by a single scale, or
structure on a hierarchy of scales. In particular, when applied to
turbulence---a high-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale process---the method
reveals self-similar structure over a wide range of spatial scales, providing
direct, model-free evidence for a century-old phenomenological picture of
turbulence. This approach is a starting point for the characterization of
localized hierarchical structures in multiscale systems, which we may think of
as the building blocks of these systems.

electrical conductivity in nanoscale devices, which underpins the field-effect
transistor, one of the cornerstones of present-day semiconductor technology.
The effect is enabled by the penetration of the electric field far into a
weakly doped semiconductor, whose charge density is not sufficient to screen
the field. On the contrary, the charge density in metals and superconductors is
so large that the field decays exponentially from the surface and can penetrate
only a short distance into the material. Hence, the field-effect should not
exist in such materials. Nonetheless, recent publications have reported
observation of the field-effect in superconductors and proximised normal metal
nanodevices. The effect was discovered in gated nanoscale superconducting
constrictions as a suppression of the critical current under the application of
intense electric field and interpreted in terms of an electric-field induced
perturbation propagating inside the superconducting film. Here we show that
ours, and previously reported observations, governed by the overheating of the

is a leakage current between the gate and the constriction, which perfectly

the sample to produce photoacoustic signal. And signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
a very important indicator for photoacoustic imaging. In order to obtain the
image with high SNR, multiple acquisition or increasing laser pulse energy is
usually adopted. The former will lead to slower imaging speed, and the latter
will lead to photobleaching or phototoxicity. Here, we proposes multi-pulse
photoacoustic microscopy, the photoacoustic signals were stimulated
sequentially using multiple laser pulses in each A line data acquisition. In

curves by injecting ARs consisting of spots and faculae on stellar surfaces at
various rates and nesting patterns, using solar AR properties and differential
rotation. We show that a moderate increase of the emergence frequency from the
solar value combined with the increase of the degree of nesting can explain the
full range of observed amplitudes of variability of Sun-like stars with nearly
the solar rotation period. Furthermore, nesting in the form of active
longitudes, in which ARs tend to emerge in the vicinity of two longitudes
separated by $180^\circ$, leads to highly regular, almost sine-like variability
patterns, rather similar to those observed in a number of solar-like stars.

exists a matching $M$ such that the inequality $\sum_{e\in M} g(e) w(e) \geq
\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ holds with $g(e)=|e|-1+\frac{1}{|e|}$, where
$\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of the canonical LP
relaxation.
  While the conjecture remains open, the strongest result towards it was very
recently obtained by Brubach, Sankararaman, Srinivasan, and Xu
(2020)---building on and strengthening prior work by Bansal, Gupta, Li, Mestre,
Nagarajan, and Rudra (2012)---showing that the aforementioned inequality holds
with $g(e)=|e|+O(|e|\exp(-|e|))$.
  Actually, their method works in a more general sampling setting, where, given
a point $x$ of the canonical LP relaxation, the task is to efficiently sample a
matching $M$ containing each edge $e$ with probability at least
$\frac{x(e)}{g(e)}$.
  We present simpler and easy-to-analyze procedures leading to improved
results. More precisely, for any solution $x$ to the canonical LP, we introduce
a simple algorithm based on exponential clocks for Brubach et al.'s sampling
setting achieving $g(e)=|e|-(|e|-1)x(e)$.
  Apart from the slight improvement in $g$, our technique may open up new ways
to attack the original conjecture.
  Moreover, we provide a short and arguably elegant analysis showing that a
natural greedy approach for the original setting of the conjecture shows the
inequality for the same $g(e)=|e|-(|e|-1)x(e)$ even for the more general
hypergraph $b$-matching problem.

supervised-learning models. However, these models require an extensive number

unsupervised framework for single-image reflection separation. Instead of
learning from a large dataset, we optimize the parameters of two cross-coupled
deep convolutional networks on a target image to generate two exclusive
background and reflection layers. In particular, we design a new architecture
of the network to embed semantic features extracted from a pre-trained deep
classification network, which gives more meaningful separation similar to human
perception. Quantitative and qualitative results on commonly used datasets in
the literature show that our method's performance is at least on par with the
state-of-the-art supervised methods and, occasionally, better without requiring

outperforms the closest unsupervised method in the literature for removing

modern smart devices to provide convenient and diverse voice-controlled
services. Since ASR systems are vulnerable to audio replay attacks that can
spoof and mislead ASR systems, a number of defense systems have been proposed
to identify replayed audio signals based on the speakers' unique acoustic
features in the frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of
replay attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing
frequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to compensate for the
frequency distortion of a given electronic speaker using an inverse filter that
is customized to the speaker's transform characteristics. Our experiments on
real smart devices confirm the modulated replay attacks can successfully escape
the existing detection mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious features
in the frequency domain. To defeat modulated replay attacks, we design and
implement a countermeasure named DualGuard. We discover and formally prove that
no matter how the replay audio signals could be modulated, the replay attacks
will either leave ringing artifacts in the time domain or cause spectrum
distortion in the frequency domain. Therefore, by jointly checking suspicious
features in both frequency and time domains, DualGuard can successfully detect
various replay attacks including the modulated replay attacks. We implement a
prototype of DualGuard on a popular voice interactive platform, ReSpeaker Core
v2. The experimental results show DualGuard can achieve 98% accuracy on
detecting modulated replay attacks.

tied to quadratic Lyapunov functions ever since it was shown that LTI system
stability is equivalent to the existence of such a Lyapunov function. Some
metrics for LTI systems, however, have resisted treatment via means of
quadratic Lyapunov functions. Among these, point-wise-in-time metrics, such as
peak norms, are not captured accurately using these techniques, and this
shortcoming has prevented the development of tools to analyze system behavior

the more general class of homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions can be used
to approximate point-wise-in-time behavior for LTI systems with greater
accuracy, and we extend this to the case of linear time-varying (LTV) systems
as well. Our findings rely on the recent observation that the search for
homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions for LTV systems can be recast as a
search for quadratic Lyapunov functions for a related hierarchy of time-varying
Lyapunov differential equations; thus, performance guarantees for LTV systems
are attainable without heavy computation. Numerous examples are provided to

construct a hypothesis space based on dominant runoff generating mechanisms.
Acceptable model runs, defined as total simulated flow with similar (and
minimal) model error, are mapped to the hypothesis space given their simulated
runoff components. In each modeling case, the hypothesis space is the result of
an interplay of factors: model structure and parameterization, chosen error
metric, and data information content. The aim of this study is to disentangle
the role of each factor in model evaluation. We used two model structures
(SACRAMENTO and SIMHYD), two parameter sampling approaches (Latin Hypercube
Sampling of the parameter space and guided-search of the solution space), three
widely used error metrics (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency - NSE, Kling-Gupta
Efficiency skill score - KGEss, and Willmott refined Index of Agreement - WIA),
and hydrological data from a large sample of Australian catchments. First, we
characterized how the three error metrics behave under different error types
and magnitudes independent of any modeling. We then conducted a series of
controlled experiments to unpack the role of each factor in runoff generation
hypotheses. We show that KGEss is a more reliable metric compared to NSE and
WIA for model evaluation. We further demonstrate that only changing the error
metric -- while other factors remain constant -- can change the model solution
space and hence vary model performance, parameter sampling sufficiency, and or
the flux map. We show how unreliable error metrics and insufficient parameter
sampling impair model-based inferences, particularly runoff generation

suppress low-overtone pressure modes (p modes) but allow high-overtone p modes

analysed a Subaru spectrum, from which we show that KIC 11296437 has abundances
similar to other magnetic Ap stars, and we estimate a mean magnetic field
modulus of $2.8\pm0.5$ kG. The same spectrum rules out a double-lined
spectroscopic binary, and we use other techniques to rule out binarity over a
wide parameter space, so the two pulsation types originate in one $\delta$
Sct--roAp hybrid pulsator. We construct stellar models depleted in helium and
demonstrate that helium settling is second to magnetic damping in suppressing
low-overtone p modes in Ap stars. We compute the magnetic damping effect for
selected p and g modes, and find that modes with frequencies similar to the
fundamental mode are driven for polar field strengths $\lesssim4$ kG, while
other low-overtone p modes are driven for polar field strengths up to $\sim$1.5
kG. We find that the high-order g modes commonly observed in $\gamma$ Dor stars
are heavily damped by polar fields stronger than 1--4 kG, with the damping
being stronger for higher radial orders. We therefore explain the observation
that no magnetic Ap stars have been observed as $\gamma$ Dor stars. We use our
helium-depleted models to calculate the $\delta$ Sct instability strip for
metallic-lined A (Am) stars, and find that driving from a Rosseland mean

distribution systems. In most cases, PVs are installed behind-the-meter (BTM),
and only the net demand is recorded. Therefore, the native demand and PV
generation are unknown to utilities. Separating native demand and solar
generation from net demand is critical for improving grid-edge observability.
In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for disaggregating customer-level
BTM PV generation using low-resolution but widely available hourly smart meter
data. The proposed approach exploits the strong correlation between monthly
nocturnal and diurnal native demands and the high similarity among PV
generation profiles. First, a joint probability density function (PDF) of
monthly nocturnal and diurnal native demands is constructed for customers
without PVs, using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). Deviation from the
constructed PDF is utilized to probabilistically assess the monthly solar
generation of customers with PVs. Then, to identify hourly BTM solar generation
for these customers, their estimated monthly solar generation is decomposed
into an hourly timescale; to do this, we have proposed a maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE)-based technique that utilizes hourly typical solar exemplars.
Leveraging the strong monthly native demand correlation and high PV generation
similarity enhances our approach's robustness against the volatility of
customers' hourly load and enables highly accurate disaggregation. The proposed
approach has been verified using real native demand and PV generation data.

processing steps for virtually any quantitative study of spatial correlations
between the local chemistry and the microstructure of a material. For electron
and X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools which
compare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and
relative orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number
of numerically efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above
characterisation tasks.
  For atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making
comparisons between measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust
because many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given that general
enough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools
for APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore,
their capability to identify and distinguish different crystal structures and
orientation is limited. In addition, the tools are sequential and demand
substantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty
quantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent
crystallographic information a difficult task with APT data.
  To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss how they
link to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the
APT methods to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We
report how this enables the development of an open-source software tool for
strong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure and mapping
crystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.

to perform inch-worm jumps autonomously. Themobiletransformationallows the

suitable for treating patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Drugs rarely
act at a single molecular target, with off target effects often being
responsible for undesirable side effects and sometimes, beneficial synergy
between targets for a specific illness. Off target activities have also led to
blockbuster drugs in some cases, e.g. Viagra for erectile dysfunction and
Minoxidil for male pattern hair loss. Drugs already in use or in clinical
trials plus approved natural products constitute a rich resource for discovery
of therapeutic agents that can be repurposed for existing and new conditions,
based on the rationale that they have already been assessed for safety in man.
A key question then is how to rapidly and efficiently screen such compounds for
activity against new pandemic pathogens such as COVID-19. Here we show how a
fast and robust computational process can be used to screen large libraries of
drugs and natural compounds to identify those that may inhibit the main
protease of SARS-Cov-2 (3CL pro, Mpro). We show how the resulting shortlist of

natural products not previously identified as having potential COVID-19

This in silico screening pipeline may also be useful for repurposing of

building interpretable systems that learn to solve complex tasks by decomposing
them into simpler ones solvable by existing models. To ensure solvability of
simpler tasks, TMNs learn the textual input-output behavior (i.e., language) of
existing models through their datasets. This differs from prior
decomposition-based approaches which, besides being designed specifically for
each complex task, produce decompositions independent of existing sub-models.
Specifically, we focus on Question Answering (QA) and show how to train a
next-question generator to sequentially produce sub-questions targeting
appropriate sub-models, without additional human annotation. These
sub-questions and answers provide a faithful natural language explanation of
the model's reasoning. We use this framework to build ModularQA, a system that
can answer multi-hop reasoning questions by decomposing them into sub-questions
answerable by a neural factoid single-span QA model and a symbolic calculator.
Our experiments show that ModularQA is more versatile than existing explainable
systems for DROP and HotpotQA datasets, is more robust than state-of-the-art
blackbox (uninterpretable) systems, and generates more understandable and
trustworthy explanations compared to prior work.

method to fully characterize a solenoidal ""spin-flip"" Zeeman slower (ZS) using
a Quartz Crystal $\mu$-balance (QCM) as a kinetic energy sensor. In this
experiment, we focus a 447.1 nm laser into a counter-propagating beam of
gadolinium (Gd) atoms in order to drive the dipole transition between ground
$^{9}$D$^{0}_{2}$ state and $^{9}$D$_{3}$ excited state. The changes in the
velocity of the beam were measured using a QCM during this process, as a novel
and alternative method to characterize the efficiency of a 1 m-long spin-flip
Zeeman slower. The QCM, normally used in solid-state physics, is continuously
and carefully monitored to determine the change in its natural frequency of
oscillation. These changes reveal a direct relation with changes in the
deposition rate and the momentum exchanged between the QCM and Gd atoms. Hence,
in terms of ultracold atom physics, it might be used to study the
time-evolution of the velocity distribution of the atoms during the cooling
process. By this method, we obtain a maximum atom average velocity reduction of
(43.5 $\pm$ 6.4)$\%$ produced by our apparatus. Moreover, we estimate an
experimental lifetime of $\tau_{e}$ = 8.2 ns for the used electronic
transition, and then we compared it with the reported lifetime for 443.06 nm

offers an accessible and simple solution to take into account for laser cooling
experiments. Therefore, a novel and innovative technique can be available for

polarizations from an astrophysical object provide a new, interesting way of
testing the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP). In this paper, we constrain
the EEP by considering both Shapiro time delay and Faraday rotation effects. We
continue to search for astronomical sources that are suitable for testing the
EEP accuracy, and obtain 60 extragalactic radio sources with multi-wavelength
polarization angles in three different radio bands (20, 8.6, and 4.8 GHz) and
29 brightest stars within our own Milky Way galaxy with multi-colour linear
polarimetric data in five optical bands ($UBVRI$). We apply the
Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain to simulate the fit parameters. The final
results show that the values of the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter
$\gamma$ discrepancy ($\Delta \gamma_{p}$) are constrained to be in the range
of $10^{-26}-10^{-23}$ for 60 radio sources and in the range of
$10^{-23}-10^{-20}$ for 29 optical polarization stars. Compared to previous EEP
tests that based on the single polarization measurement in the gamma-ray band,
our results have profound superiority that nearly a few tens of astrophysical
sources with multi-wavelength polarization observations commonly in the optical
and radio bands are available. It ensures that these sources can give more
significantly robust bounds on the EEP. Although the presented method is
straightforward, the resulting constraints on the EEP should be taken as upper
limits as other more complex astrophysical effects affecting a polarization
rotation are hardly considered.

consider an abstract molecular robotics model based on simple folding
instructions that execute asynchronously. Turning Machines are a simple 1D to
2D folding model, also easily generalisable to 2D to 3D folding. A Turning
Machine starts out as a line of connected monomers in the discrete plane, each
with an associated turning number. A monomer turns relative to its neighbours,
executing a unit-distance translation that drags other monomers along with it,
and through collective motion the initial set of monomers eventually folds into
a programmed shape. We provide a suite of tools for reasoning about Turning
Machines by fully characterising their ability to execute line rotations:
executing an almost-full line rotation of $5\pi/3$ radians is possible, yet a
full $2\pi$ rotation is impossible. Furthermore, line rotations up to $5\pi/3$
are executed efficiently, in $O(\log n)$ expected time in our continuous time
Markov chain time model. We then show that such line-rotations represent a
fundamental primitive in the model, by using them to efficiently and
asynchronously fold shapes. In particular, arbitrarily large zig-zag-rastered
squares and zig-zag paths are foldable, as are $y$-monotone shapes albeit with
error (bounded by perimeter length). Finally, we give shapes that despite
having paths that traverse all their points, are in fact impossible to fold, as
well as techniques for folding certain classes of (scaled) shapes without
error. Our approach relies on careful geometric-based analyses of the feats
possible and impossible by a very simple robotic system, and pushes
conceptional hardness towards mathematical analysis and away from molecular
implementation.

object in subsequent frames given the object label in the first frame. Existing
algorithms are mostly based on the objectives of matching and propagation
strategies, which often make use of the previous frame with masking or optical
flow. This paper explores a new propagation method, uses short-term matching
modules to extract the information of the previous frame and apply it in
propagation, and proposes the network of Long-Short-Term similarity matching
for video object segmentation (LSMOVS) Method: By conducting pixel-level
matching and correlation between long-term matching module and short-term
matching module with the first frame and previous frame, global similarity map
and local similarity map are obtained, as well as feature pattern of current
frame and masking of previous frame. After two refine networks, final results
are obtained through segmentation network. Results: According to the
experiments on the two data sets DAVIS 2016 and 2017, the method of this paper
achieves favorable average of region similarity and contour accuracy without
online fine tuning, which achieves 86.5% and 77.4% in terms of single target
and multiple targets. Besides, the count of segmented frames per second reached
21. Conclusion: The short-term matching module proposed in this paper is more
conducive to extracting the information of the previous frame than only the
mask. By combining the long-term matching module with the short-term matching
module, the whole network can achieve efficient video object segmentation
without online fine tuning

agents from learning a good policy or teaches the agents to converge to a
target policy, with a limited attacking budget.

follows an exponent decaying rate with the impurity distance $R$, i.e.,
$J\propto 1/R^d$ ($1/R^{2d-1}$) in $d$-dimensional systems at finite (zero)
Fermi energy. This fast decay makes it rather difficult to be detected and
limits its application in spintronics. Here, we theoretically investigate the
influence of anisotropic dispersion on the RKKY interaction, and find that the
introduction of non-relativistic dispersion in semi-Dirac semimetals (S-DSMs)
can significantly prolong the decay of the RKKY interaction and can remarkably
enhance the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction around the relativistic
direction. The underlying physics is attributed to the highly increased density
of states in the linear-momentum direction as a result of the interplay of
relativistic and non-relativistic electrons. Furthermore, we propose a general
formula to determine the decaying rate of the RKKY interaction, extending the
typical formula for isotropic DSMs. Our results suggest that the S-DSM
materials are a powerful platform to detect and control the magnetic exchange

Here we report the first robust VLBI detection and imaging of the lensed images

lensed images (A and B) is consistent with that previously seen at 22 and 15

that the absorption effects due to the intervening lensing galaxy become
negligible at millimeter wavelengths. These results indicate that
high-frequency VLBI observations are a powerful tool to better recover the
intrinsic properties of lensed active galactic nucleus jets, which therefore

chains are usually required to simultaneously transmit multiple data streams.
As a special MIMO technology, spatial modulation (SM) activates one transmit
antenna with one RF chain and exploits the index of the active antenna for
information transfer at each time slot. Recently, reconfigurable metasurfaces
have emerged as a promising technology that is able to reconfigure the wireless
propagation environment by altering the amplitude and/or phase of the incident
signal. In this article, we aim for the implementation of single-RF MIMO by
shifting the focus from SM to metasurface-based modulation. Specifically, the
principles of SM and metasurfaces are first presented. After reviewing the
evolution of SM, we elaborate on the idea of metasurface-aided single-RF MIMO
and discuss some implementations for it in line with notable variants of SM. A
comparison between antenna-based and metasurface-based modulation is made to
highlight the advantages of using metasurfaces. We finally investigate the
research challenges and opportunities in the context of metasurface-based
modulation.

measure, can be used to infer the magnetoionic environment of a radio source.
We investigate the magnetoionic environments of FRBs by deriving their
estimated average magnetic field strengths along the line of sight $\langle
B_{\parallel}\rangle$ in their host galaxies and comparing them with those of
Galactic pulsars and magnetars. We find that for those FRBs with RM
measurements, the mean $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ is
$1.77^{+9.01}_{-1.48}\,\rm\mu G$ and $1.74^{+14.82}_{-1.55}\,\rm\mu G$ using
two different methods, which is slightly larger but not inconsistent with the
distribution of Galactic pulsars, $1.00^{+1.51}_{-0.60}\,\rm\mu G$. Only six
Galactic magnetars have estimated $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$. Excluding PSR
J1745--2900 that has an anomalously high value due to its proximity with the
Galactic Centre, the other three sources have a mean value of $1.70\,\rm\mu G$,
which is statistically consistent with the $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$
distributions of both Galactic pulsars and FRBs. There is no apparent trend of
evolution of magnetar $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ as a function of age or
surface magnetic field strength. Galactic pulsars and magnetars close to the
Galactic Centre have relatively larger $\langle B_{\parallel}\rangle$ values
than other pulsars/magnetars. We discuss the implications of these results for
the magnetoionic environments of FRB 121102 within the context of magnetar
model and the model invoking a supermassive black hole, and for the origin of
FRBs in general.

guide treatment decisions for a specific individual through training on small

several interrelated clinical variables simultaneously. We attempt to simulate
such clinical perspective, and introduce meta learning techniques to develop a
new model, which can extract the common experience or knowledge from
interrelated clinical tasks and transfer it to help address new tasks. Our new
model is built upon a carefully designed meta-learner, called Prototypical
Network, that is a simple yet effective meta learning machine for few-shot
image classification. Observing that gene expression data have specifically
high dimensionality and high noise properties compared with image data, we
proposed a new extension of it by appending two modules to address these
issues. Concretely, we append a feature selection layer to automatically filter
out the disease-irrelated genes and incorporate a sample reweighting strategy
to adaptively remove noisy data, and meanwhile the extended model is capable of
learning from a limited number of training examples and generalize well.
Simulations and real gene expression data experiments substantiate the
superiority of the proposed method for predicting the subtypes of disease and

to whether we adaptively select the next respondents based on the answers of
the previous respondents or not. We first provide the information theoretic
lower bounds for the necessary budgets in both algorithm types. In terms of the
sufficient budgets, we propose two practical estimation algorithms, each of
non-adaptive and adaptive types, and for each algorithm, we quantitatively
analyze the budget which ensures $1-\delta$ detection accuracy. This
theoretical analysis not only quantifies the budgets needed by practical
estimation algorithms achieving a given target detection accuracy in finding
the diffusion source, but also enables us to quantitatively characterize the
amount of extra budget required in non-adaptive type of estimation, refereed to

the condition that the proton radius of the scaled proton density equals the

Generalising an observation made in arXiv:1706.04425, we provide evidence that
the BPS counting functions of special subsectors of the latter exhibit a Hecke
structure in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit, i.e. the different orders in
an instanton expansion of the supersymmetric gauge theory are related through
the action of Hecke operators. We extract $N$ distinct such reduced BPS
counting functions from the full free energy of the LST with the help of
contour integrals with respect to the gauge parameters of the $U(N)$ gauge
group. Physically, the states captured by these functions correspond to
configurations where the same number of M2-branes is stretched between some of
these neighbouring M5-branes, while the remaining M5-branes are collapsed on
top of each other and a particular singular contribution is extracted. The
Hecke structures suggest that these BPS states form the spectra of symmetric
orbifold CFTs. We furthermore show that to leading instanton order (in the
NS-limit) the reduced BPS counting functions factorise into simpler building
blocks. These building blocks are the expansion coefficients of the free energy
for $N=1$ and the expansion of a particular function, which governs the
counting of BPS states of a single M5-brane with single M2-branes ending on it

c_{min})\cdot\sum_{t\leq T}g_t(N))$, where $c_{max},c_{min}$ are the
largest/smallest costs of elements in $N$. This competitive ratio is best
possible even in the offline setting, and the recourse bound is optimal up to
the logarithmic factor. For monotone submodular functions that also have
positive mixed third derivatives, we show an optimal recourse bound of
$O(\sum_{t\leq T}g_t(N))$. This structured class includes set-coverage
functions, so our algorithm matches the known $O(\log n)$-competitiveness and
$O(1)$ recourse guarantees for fully-dynamic SetCover. Our work simultaneously
simplifies and unifies previous results, as well as generalizes to a
significantly larger class of covering problems. Our key technique is a new
potential function inspired by Tsallis entropy. We also extensively use the
idea of Mutual Coverage, which generalizes the classic notion of mutual
information.

Deep Neural Networks. First, highly touted AI successes (eg. image

failure-prone than are typically certified in critical systems even within
design bounds (perfectly in-distribution sampling). Second, performance falls
off only gradually as inputs become further Out-Of-Distribution (OOD). Enhanced

two distinct negative differential resistance (NDR) characteristics depending
on the maximum current employed for electroforming. For low compliance currents
they exhibit a smooth S-type characteristic and have a temperature-dependent
device resistance characterised by an activation energy of 0.25 eV, consistent
with conduction in polycrystalline VO2, while for high-compliance currents they
exhibit an abrupt snap-back characteristic and a resistance characterised by an
activation energy of 0.025 eV, consistent with conduction in oxygen deficient
VOx. In both cases, the temperature dependence of the switching voltage implies
that the conductivity change is due to the insulator-metal transition in VO2.
From this analysis it is concluded that electroforming at low currents creates
a conductive filament comprised largely of polycrystalline VO2, while
electroforming at high currents creates a composite structure comprised of VO2
and a conductive halo of oxygen deficient VOx. The effect of electroforming on
the NDR mode is then explained with reference to a lumped element model of
filamentary conduction that includes the effect of a parallel resistance
created by the halo. These results provide new insight into the NDR response of
vanadium-oxide-based devices and a basis for designing devices with specific

characteristic timescale is consistently observed to increase during certain

through an interstellar scattering screen. The best-fitting annual cycle model
for each year suggests that the scintillation pattern has an anisotropic
structure and that the upper limit of its scattering screen is at a distance of
~0.84 kpc. Higher anisotropy in some of the annual cycle fits suggests that
changes in the intrinsic source structure might be influencing the variability
timescale. We found a prominent annual cycle is only present in the variability
timescale for certain years where other evidence suggests that the core is
compact. From our measurements, we calculated that the core angular size varied
between 5.65-15.90 $\mu$as (0.05-0.13 pc). The core component was found to be
at its most compact during two flares in the total flux density, which were

convergence properties of the strain-smoothed element (SSE) method. The SSE
method has demonstrated improved convergence behaviors compared to other strain
smoothing methods through various numerical examples; however, there has been
no theoretical evidence for the convergence behavior. A unique feature of the
SSE method is the construction of smoothed strain fields within elements by
fully unifying the strains of adjacent elements. Owing to this feature,
convergence analysis is required, which is different from other existing strain
smoothing methods. In this paper, we first propose a novel mixed variational
principle wherein the SSE method can be interpreted as a Galerkin approximation
of that. The proposed variational principle is a generalization of the
well-known Hu--Washizu variational principle; thus, various existing strain
smoothing methods can be expressed in terms of the proposed variational
principle. With a unified view of the SSE method and other existing methods
through the proposed variational principle, we analyze the convergence behavior
of the SSE method and explain the reason for the improved performance compared
to other methods. We also present numerical experiments that support our
theoretical results.

attributed network embedding (ANE) maps each node v in G to a compact vector
Xv, which can be used in downstream machine learning tasks. Ideally, Xv should
capture node v's affinity to each attribute, which considers not only v's own
attribute associations, but also those of its connected nodes along edges in G.
It is challenging to obtain high-utility embeddings that enable accurate
predictions; scaling effective ANE computation to massive graphs pushes the
difficulty of the problem to a whole new level. Existing solutions largely fail
on such graphs, leading to prohibitive costs, low-quality embeddings, or both.
This paper proposes PANE, an effective and scalable approach to ANE computation
for massive graphs that achieves state-of-the-art result quality on multiple
benchmark datasets. PANE obtains high scalability and effectiveness through 3
main algorithmic designs. First, it formulates the learning objective based on
a novel random walk model for attributed networks. Second, PANE includes a
highly efficient solver for the above optimization problem, whose key module is
a carefully designed initialization of the embeddings, which drastically
reduces the number of iterations required to converge. Finally, PANE utilizes
multi-core CPUs through non-trivial parallelization of the above solver, which
achieves scalability while retaining the high quality of the resulting
embeddings. The performance of PANE depends upon the number of attributes in
the input network. To handle large networks with numerous attributes, we
further extend PANE to PANE++. Extensive experiments, comparing 10 existing
approaches on 8 real datasets, demonstrate that PANE and PANE++ consistently
outperform all existing methods in terms of result quality, while being orders
of magnitude faster.

proportion has been well studied in the literature owing to its wide range of
applications. In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also
known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays
an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random
sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers
from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been
developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the
optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance
comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by
developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of
shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas
for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation
studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or
as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to
illustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent
meta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical
distancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies
encounter the zero-event problem.

non withstanding that Lorentz invariance is lost due to the presence of the

tensor valid to all orders in the magnetic field, the existence of a second
solution, corresponding to a finite gluon mass, is shown to be spurious and an
artifact of the lowest order approximation in the field strength. We also study
the strength of the polarization modes for real gluons. We conclude that,
provided the spurious solutions are discarded, the lowest order approximation
to the gluon polarization and dispersion properties is good as long as the

An
exact square coloring of a graph G is a vertex-coloring in which any two

denoted $\chi^{\sharp 2}(G)$. This notion is related to other types of

triangle-free graphs, exact square coloring and injective coloring coincide. We
prove tight bounds on special subclasses of planar graphs: subcubic bipartite
planar graphs and subcubic K 4-minor-free graphs have exact square chromatic
number at most 4. We then turn our attention to the class of fullerene graphs,
which are cubic planar graphs with face sizes 5 and 6. We characterize
fullerene graphs with exact square chromatic number 3. Furthermore, supporting
a conjecture of Chen, Hahn, Raspaud and Wang (that all subcubic planar graphs

proving that a minimum counterexample has to be on at most 80 vertices and then
computationally verifying the claim for all such graphs.

superconductor. In the present study, we perform a detailed first-principles
analysis of bulk and bilayer 2M WS$_2$. We report a comprehensive investigation
of the bulk phase, comparing structural and electronic properties obtained from
different exchange correlation functionals to the experimentally reported
values. By calculation of the $Z_2$ invariant and surface states, we give
support for its non-trivial band nature. Based on the insights gained from the
analysis of the bulk phase, we predict bilayer 2M WS$_2$ as a new
two-dimensional topological material. We demonstrate its dynamical stability
from first-principles phonon computations and present its electronic
properties, highlighting the band inversions between the W $d$ and S $p$
states. By means of $Z_2$ invariant computations and a calculation of the edge
states, we show that bilayer 2M WS$_2$ exhibits protected, robust edge states.
The broken inversion symmetry in this newly proposed bilayer also leads to the
presence of Berry curvature dipole and resulting non-linear responses. We
compute the Berry curvature distribution and the dipole as a function of Fermi
energy. We propose that BCD signals, which are absent in the centrosymmetric
bulk 2M WS$_2$, can be signatures of the bilayer. We hope our predictions lead
to the experimental realization of this as-yet-undiscovered two-dimensional

(SM), are required to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Measurement
of a non-zero permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) for fundamental particles,
such as in an electron or a neutron, or in nuclei or atoms, can help us gain a
handle on the sources of CP violation, both in SM and beyond. Multiple
mechanisms within the SM can generate CP violating EDMs, viz.\ through the CKM
matrix in the weak sector or through the QCD $\bar{\theta}$ parameter in the
strong sector. We will estimate the maximum possible EDMs of leptons, certain
baryons, select atoms and molecules in the (CKM$\bigoplus\bar{\theta}$)
framework, assuming that the EDM wholly originates from either of the two SM
mechanisms, independently. These estimates have been presented in light of the
current experimental upper limits on the EDMs, in the following systems -
leptons: $e^-$, $\mu^-$, $\tau^-$, $\nu_e^0$, $\nu^0_{\mu}$, $\nu^0_{\tau}$,
baryons: $n^0$, $p^+$, $\Lambda^0$, $\Sigma^0$, $\Xi^0$, $\Lambda^+_c$,

constrain CP-violating interactions differently, we show that the same measured
constraint on the EDM in two different systems may not actually be equally
constraining on CP violating parameters, and to emphasize the need to measure a
non-zero EDM in multiple systems before understanding the origins of these

the biggest contribution to MFPADs is removed, so that PA-MFPADs clearly show
the detail of scattering image of the photoelectron. As a result, it is
necessary to employ well precise theory for the continuum state for the
theoretical analysis. In this study, we applied our Full-potential multiple
scattering theory, where the space is partitioned by using Voronoi polyhedra
and truncated spheres to take into account the electron charge density outside
the physical atomic spheres. We did not use spherical harmonic expansion of the
cell shape functions to avoid convergence problems.The potentials in scattering
cells are prepared employing Multiconfigurational Second-Order Perturbation

the influence of core hole in the electron charge density in the final state to
realize realistic relaxation. We showed that the Full-potential treatment plays

photoelectron. Instead, the PA-MFPADs are not sensitive to type of major
excited state in the Auger final state.We also studied the dynamics of

revolutionary cameras, the tracking framework uses a discriminative
representation for the object with online learning, and detects and re-tracks
the object when it comes back into the field-of-view. One of the key novelties
is the use of an event-based local sliding window technique that tracks
reliably in scenes with cluttered and textured background. In addition,
Bayesian bootstrapping is used to assist real-time processing and boost the
discriminative power of the object representation. On the other hand, when the
object re-enters the field-of-view of the camera, a data-driven, global sliding
window detector locates the object for subsequent tracking. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to track and
detect arbitrary objects of various shapes and sizes, including dynamic objects
such as a human. This is a significant improvement compared to earlier works
that simply track objects as long as they are visible under simpler background
settings. Using the ground truth locations for five different objects under
three motion settings, namely translation, rotation and 6-DOF, quantitative
measurement is reported for the event-based tracking framework with critical
insights on various performance issues. Finally, real-time implementation in
C++ highlights tracking ability under scale, rotation, view-point and occlusion

photonics. Efficient tuning of the bandgap and higher subbands in BP by
modulation of the Fermi level or application of vertical electric fields has
been previously demonstrated, allowing electrical control of its above bandgap
optical properties. Here, we report modulation of the optical conductivity
below the band-gap (5-15 um) by tuning the charge density in a two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) induced in BP, thereby modifying its free carrier dominated
intraband response. With a moderate doping density of 7x10^12/cm2 we were able
to observe a polarization dependent epsilon-near-zero behavior in the
dielectric permittivity of BP. The intraband polarization sensitivity is
intimately linked to the difference in effective fermionic masses along the two
crystallographic directions, as confirmed by our measurements. Our results
suggest the potential of multilayer BP to allow new optical functions for
emerging photonics applications.

images is critical to diagnose early breast cancer, which can greatly improve
the patients survival rate. However, it is still a big challenge due to the
heterogeneity of breast masses and the complexity of their surrounding
environment.Methods: To address these problems, we propose a one-stage object
detection architecture, called Breast Mass Detection Network (BMassDNet), based
on anchor-free and feature pyramid which makes the detection of breast masses
of different sizes well adapted. We introduce a truncation normalization method
and combine it with adaptive histogram equalization to enhance the contrast
between the breast mass and the surrounding environment. Meanwhile, to solve
the overfitting problem caused by small data size, we propose a natural
deformation data augmentation method and mend the train data dynamic updating
method based on the data complexity to effectively utilize the limited data.
Finally, we use transfer learning to assist the training process and to improve
the robustness of the model ulteriorly.Results: On the INbreast dataset, each
image has an average of 0.495 false positives whilst the recall rate is 0.930;
On the DDSM dataset, when each image has 0.599 false positives, the recall rate
reaches 0.943.Conclusions: The experimental results on datasets INbreast and
DDSM show that the proposed BMassDNet can obtain competitive detection
performance over the current top ranked methods.

standard AL heuristics, such as selecting those points for annotation for which

important research direction to pursue. This paper describes our

function trains an `explainer' model in addition to the classifier model, and
favours those instances where a different part of the data is used, on an

encouraging trends in showing that such a heuristic can lead to developing more

covers a given domain, reflecting a priority of areas of interest represented
by a density distribution, rather than simply following a preset of uniform
patterns. To achieve an efficient multi-robot exploration, the optimal
transport theory that quantifies a distance between two density distributions
is employed as a tool, which also serves as a means of performance measure. The
energy constraints for the multi-robot system is then incorporated into the
OT-based multi-robot exploration scheme.
  The proposed scheme is decoupled from robot dynamics, broadening the
applicability of the multi-robot exploration plan to heterogeneous robot
platforms. Not only the centralized but also decentralized algorithms are
provided to cope with more realistic scenarios such as communication range
limits between agents. To measure the exploration efficiency, the upper bound
of the performance is developed for both the centralized and decentralized
cases based on the optimal transport theory, which is computationally tractable
as well as efficient. The proposed multi-robot exploration scheme is also
applicable to a time-varying distribution, where the spatio-temporal evolution
of the given reference distribution is desired. To validate the proposed

consumption among clusters is mitigated by the proposed P2P trading method. For
power management of individual clusters, multi-objective optimization
simultaneously minimizing total power consumption, portion of grid power
consumption, and total delay incurred by scheduling is attempted. A renewable
power source photovoltaic(PV) system is adopted for each cluster as a secondary
source. The temporal surplus of self-supply PV power of a cluster can be sold
through P2P trading to another cluster (s) experiencing temporal power
shortage. The cluster in temporal shortage of electric power buys the PV power
to reduce peak load and total delay. In P2P trading, a cooperative game model
is used for buyers and sellers to maximize their welfare. To increase P2P
trading efficiency, future trends of load demand and PV power production are
considered for power management of each cluster to resolve instantaneous
unbalance between load demand and PV power production. To this end, a gated
recurrent unit network is used to forecast future load demand and future PV
power production. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed P2P
trading for nanogrid clusters.

estimating loss-given-default distribution implied in current credit market and
company-specific financial conditions. Since the market standard is the
predetermined constant loss rate (60%) for all firms, it is hard to estimate
loss-given-default distribution by just observing the market information such
as default time distribution, default probability, and CDS spreads. To overcome
this difficulty, we construct a hybrid model with the last passage time of the
leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of a firm's assets over its debt) to a
certain level. The last passage time, which is not a stopping time, allows us
to appropriately model the timing of severe firm-value deterioration which is
not apparent to credit market participants. Under minimal and standard
assumptions, our model captures asset value dynamics when close to default,
while treating default as an unexpected event. We explicitly obtain the
distribution of the leverage ratio at default time. As we base the model solely
on the leverage ratio and do not introduce additional risk factors, both the
model and the procedure for calibrating model parameters to the credit market
are simple. We illustrate this procedure in detail by calculating the
loss-given-default distribution implied in the credit market.

To overcome this problem, we introduce HL-Pow, a power modeling framework for
FPGA HLS based on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. HL-Pow
incorporates an automated feature construction flow to efficiently identify and
extract features that exert a major influence on power consumption, simply
based upon HLS results, and a modeling flow that can build an accurate and
generic power model applicable to a variety of designs with HLS. By using
HL-Pow, the power evaluation process for FPGA designs can be significantly
expedited because the power inference of HL-Pow is established on HLS instead
of the time-consuming register-transfer level (RTL) implementation flow.
Experimental results demonstrate that HL-Pow can achieve accurate power
modeling that is only 4.67% (24.02 mW) away from onboard power measurement. To
further facilitate power-oriented optimizations, we describe a novel design
space exploration (DSE) algorithm built on top of HL-Pow to trade off between
latency and power consumption. This algorithm can reach a close approximation
of the real Pareto frontier while only requiring running HLS flow for 20% of
design points in the entire design space.

different variables or groups of variables for the variability of a quantity of
interest. Among several sensitivity indices, so-called Shapley effects have
recently gained popularity mainly because the Shapley effects for all the
individual variables are summed up to the overall variance, which gives a
better interpretability than the classical sensitivity indices called main
effects and total effects. In this paper, assuming that all the input variables
are independent, we introduce a quite simple Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate
the Shapley effects for all the individual variables simultaneously, which
drastically simplifies the existing algorithms proposed in the literature. We
present a short Matlab implementation of our algorithm and show some numerical
results. A possible extension to the case where the input variables are
dependent is also discussed.

Yang-Mills correlation functions in the Landau gauge, already at one-loop
order. In a recent work, the robustness of these results has been tested by
evaluating the two-loop corrections to the gluon and ghost propagators. We
pursue this systematic investigation by computing the ghost-antighost-gluon
vertex to the same accuracy in a particular kinematic configuration that makes
the calculations simpler. Because both the parameters of the model and the
normalizations of the fields have already been fixed in a previous work, the
present calculation represents both a pure prediction and a stringent test of
the approach. We find that the two-loop results systematically improve the
comparison to Monte-Carlo simulations as compared to earlier one-loop results.
The improvement is particularly significative in the SU($3$) case where the
predicted ghost-antighost-gluon vertex is in very good agreement with the data.
The same comparison in the SU($2$) case is not as good, however. This may be
due to the presence of a larger coupling constant in the infrared in that case
although we note that a similar mismatch has been quoted in non-perturbative
continuum approaches. Despite these features of the SU($2$) case, it is
possible to find sets of parameters fitting both the propagators and the
ghost-antighost-gluon vertex to a reasonable accuracy.

derived, for the first time, in a sample of nearby M dwarfs. We focus on stars
in the metallicity range -0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3, an interval poorly explored for Rb
abundances in previous analyses. To do this we use high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise-ratio, optical and near-infrared spectra of 57 M dwarfs
observed with CARMENES. The resulting [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe] ratios for most M
dwarfs are almost constant at about the solar value, and are identical to those
found in GK dwarfs of the same metallicity. However, for Rb we find systematic
underabundances ([Rb/Fe]<0.0) by a factor two on average. Furthermore, a
tendency is found for Rb-but not for other heavy elements (Sr, Zr) -to increase
with increasing metallicity such that [Rb/Fe]>0.0 is attained at metallicities
higher than solar. These are surprising results, never seen for any other heavy
element, and are difficult to understand within the formulation of the s- and
r-processes, both contributing sources to the Galactic Rb abundance. We discuss
the reliability of these findings for Rb in terms of non-LTE effects, stellar
activity, or an anomalous Rb abundance in the Solar System, but no explanation
is found. We then interpret the full observed [Rb/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend
within the framework of theoretical predictions from state-of-the-art chemical
evolution models for heavy elements, but a simple interpretation is not found
either. In particular, the possible secondary behaviour of the [Rb/Fe] ratio at
super-solar metallicities would require a much larger production of Rb than
currently predicted in AGB stars through the s-process without overproducing Sr
and Zr.

0235+164, and make correlation analysis between them by using the local
cross-correlation function (LCCF). We found that both $\gamma$-ray and the
optical {\it V}-band light curves are correlated with the radio light curve at
beyond 3$\sigma$ significance level. The emitting regions of the $\gamma$-ray
and the optical coincide within errors, and locate at {$6.6_{-1.7}^{+0.6}$} pc
upstream of the core region of 15 GHz, which are beyond the broad line region
(BLR). The color index shows the redder when brighter (RWB) trend at the low
flux state, but turns to the bluer when brighter (BWB) trend at the high flux
state. While, the $\gamma$-ray spectral index always shows the softer when
brighter (SWB) trend. We propose that such complex variation trends can be
explained by the increasing jet component with two constant components. The
{optical} PD flares and {optical} flux flares are not synchronous. It seems
that one flux peak are sandwiched by two PD peaks, which have inverse rotation
trajectories in the $qu$ plane. The helical jet model can schematically show
these characteristics of polarization with fine tuned parameters. The change of
viewing angle is suggested to be the primary variable which lead all these
variations, although other possibilities like the shock in jet model or the

of light neutrinos via Type-I Seesaw mechanism. The particle content
automatically allows us to extend the model by a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry,

Gibbs-Marangoni pressure has been proposed as an explanation of this
phenomenon. This repulsive pressure occurs during thin film drainage whenever
surface enhanced or surface depleted solutes are present. However, bubble
coalescence inhibition is known to depend on which particular combination of
ions are present in a peculiar and unexplained way. This dependence may be
explained by the electrostatic surface potential created by the distribution of
ions at the interface, which will alters the natural surface propensity of the
ions and hence the Gibbs-Marangoni pressure.
  Calculations: A generalised form of the Gibbs-Marangoni pressure is derived
for a mixture of solutes and a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation model is
used to calculate this pressure for five different electrolyte solutions made
up of four different ions.
  Findings: Combining ions with differing surface propensities, i.e., one
enhanced and one depleted, creates a significant electrostatic surface
potential which dampens the natural surface propensity of these ions, resulting
in a reduced Gibbs-Marangoni pressure, which allows bubble coalescence. This
mechanism explains why the ability of electrolytes to inhibit bubble
coalescence is correlated with surface tension for pure electrolytes but not
for mixed electrolytes.

future communication networks need to be carefully designed with respect to the
city infrastructure and utilization of resources. Recently, the idea of 'smart'

advances in design of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are
planar structures with the capability to reflect impinging electromagnetic
waves toward preferred directions. Thus, RISs are expected to provide the
necessary flexibility for the design of the 'smart' communication environment,
which can be optimally shaped to enable cost- and energy-efficient signal
transmissions where needed. Upon deployment of RISs, the ecosystem of the Smart
Cities would become even more controllable and adaptable, which would
subsequently ease the implementation of future communication networks in urban

the degrees, logarithmic heights, and the logarithmic distance to a certain
\emph{locus of unlikely intersections}. Under suitable conditions on the
foliation, we show that this implies a bound, polynomial in the degree and
height, for the number of algebraic points on transcendental sets defined using
such foliations.
  We deduce several results in Diophantine geometry. i) Following
Masser-Zannier, we prove that given a pair of sections $P,Q$ of a
non-isotrivial family of squares of elliptic curves that do not satisfy a
constant relation, whenever $P,Q$ are simultaneously torsion their order of
torsion is bounded effectively by a polynomial in the degrees and log-heights
of the sections $P,Q$. In particular the set of such simultaneous torsion
points is effectively computable in polynomial time. ii) Following Pila, we
prove that given $V\subset\mathbb{C}^n$ there is an (ineffective) upper bound,
polynomial in the degree and log-height of V, for the degrees and discriminants
of maximal special subvarieties. In particular it follows that Andr\'e-Oort for
powers of the modular curve is decidable in polynomial time (by an algorithm
depending on a universal, ineffective Siegel constant). iii) Following Schmidt,
we show that our counting result implies a Galois-orbit lower bound for torsion
points on elliptic curves of the type previously obtained using transcendence
methods by David.

scenarios, mainly due to the extremely long-tailed bias of predicate annotation
distribution. Thus, tackling the class imbalance trouble of SGG is critical and
challenging. In this paper, we first discover that when predicate labels have
strong correlation with each other, prevalent re-balancing strategies(e.g.,
re-sampling and re-weighting) will give rise to either over-fitting the tail
data(e.g., bench sitting on sidewalk rather than on), or still suffering the
adverse effect from the original uneven distribution(e.g., aggregating varied
parked on/standing on/sitting on into on). We argue the principal reason is
that re-balancing strategies are sensitive to the frequencies of predicates yet
blind to their relatedness, which may play a more important role to promote the
learning of predicate features. Therefore, we propose a novel
Predicate-Correlation Perception Learning(PCPL for short) scheme to adaptively
seek out appropriate loss weights by directly perceiving and utilizing the
correlation among predicate classes. Moreover, our PCPL framework is further
equipped with a graph encoder module to better extract context features.
Extensive experiments on the benchmark VG150 dataset show that the proposed
PCPL performs markedly better on tail classes while well-preserving the
performance on head ones, which significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

as a promising candidate to support the ever-increasing capacity demand, which
cannot be satisfied with existing radio-frequency (RF) technology. On the other
hand, it likely will serve as backbone infrastructure and could therefore be an
attractive target for eavesdropping attacks. Compared with regular RF spectrum,
wireless channels in the THz range could be less vulnerable to interceptions
because of their high beam directionality and small signal coverage. However, a
risk for eavesdropping can still exist due to the multipath effects caused by
unintended scattering. In this work, an eavesdropping risk for THz channel
passing atmospheric turbulences and producing compromising emissions is
investigated from a physical layer perspective. A model combining signal
attenuation due to turbulence, gaseous absorption and beam divergence, is
developed for prediction of deterministic and probabilistic signal leakages.
The secrecy capacity and outage probability of the THz channel are derived and
analyzed with respect to variations of the turbulence strength and other
channels characteristics. The dependence of the channel performance on the
eavesdropper's position is investigated with respect to the maximum safe data
transmission rate (MSR) and the signal leakage region. Design results for THz
channels are provided to minimize an eavesdropping risk at physical layer.

importance for geophysical flows and bedload transport in particular. In the
present paper, the mobility of bidisperse segregated particle beds was studied
with a coupled fluid discrete element method. Large particles were initially
placed above small ones and it was observed that, for the same flow conditions,
the bedload transport rate is higher in the bidisperse configuration than in
the monodisperse one. Depending on the Shields number and on the depth of the
interface between small and large particles, different transport
phenomenologies are observed, ranging from no influence of the small particles
to small particles reaching the bed surface due to diffusive remixing. In cases
where the small particles hardly mix with the overlying large particles and for
the range of studied size ratios ($r<4$), it is shown that the increased
mobility is not a bottom roughness effect, that would be due to the reduction
of roughness of the underlying small particles, but a granular flow effect.
This effect is analyzed within the framework of the $\mu(I)$ rheology and it is
demonstrated that the buried small particles are more mobile than larger
particles and play the role of a ""conveyor belt"" for the large particles at the
surface. Based on rheological arguments, a simple predictive model is proposed
for the additional transport in the bidisperse case. It reproduces
quantitatively the DEM results for a large range of Shields numbers and for
size ratios smaller than 4. The results of the model are used to identify four
different transport regimes of bidisperse mixtures, depending on the mechanism
responsible for the mobility of the small particles. A phenomenological map is
proposed for bidisperse bedload transport and, more generally, for any granular
flow on an erodible bed.

(EPEs), sometimes leading to negative impacts on society, economy, and the
environment. Understanding such natural hazards and their drivers is essential
to mitigate related risks. Here, EPEs over the Mediterranean between 1979 and
2019 are analyzed, using ERA5 dataset from ECMWF. EPEs are determined based on
the 99th percentile of the daily distribution (P99). The different EPE
characteristics are assessed, based on seasonality and spatiotemporal
dependencies. To better understand the connection to large-scale atmospheric
flow patterns, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and subsequent
K-means clustering are used to quantify the importance of weather regimes to
EPE frequency. The analysis is performed for three different variables,
depicting atmospheric variability in the lower and middle troposphere: Sea
level pressure (SLP), temperature at 850 hPa (T850), and geopotential height at
500 hPa (Z500). Results show a clear spatial division in EPEs occurrence, with
winter (autumn) being the season of highest EPEs frequency for the eastern
(western) Mediterranean. There is a high degree of temporal dependencies with
20% of the EPEs (median value of all studied grid-cells), occurring up to 1
week after a preceding P99 event at the same location. Local orography is a key
modulator of the spatiotemporal connections and substantially enhances the
probability of co-occurrence of EPEs even for distant locations. The clustering
clearly demonstrates the prevalence of distinct synoptic-scale atmospheric
conditions during the occurrence of EPEs for different locations within the
region. Results indicate that clustering based on a combination of SLP and Z500
can increase the conditional probability of EPEs by more than three (3) times
(median value for all grid cells) from the nominal probability of 1% for the
P99 EPEs.

as the main causes of low frequency noise. While their effect on the
bias-dependence of LFN has been well investigated, the way these noise
mechanisms contribute to the bias-dependence of variability of LFN has been
less well understood. LFN variability has been shown to be maximized in weak

variability. However, no compact model has been proposed to explain this
bias-dependence in detail. In combination with the charge-based formulation of
LFN, the present paper proposes a new model for bias-dependence of LFN

continual learning, data streams are processed in an online fashion, without
additional task-information, and an efficient memory scheme provides robustness
to imbalanced data streams. Besides nearest neighbor based prediction, learning
is facilitated by a novel objective function, encouraging cluster density about
the class prototype and increased inter-class variance. Furthermore, the latent
space quality is elevated by pseudo-prototypes in each batch, constituted by
replay of exemplars from memory. As an additional contribution, we generalize
the existing paradigms in continual learning to incorporate data incremental
learning from data streams by formalizing a two-agent learner-evaluator

statistic $Q$ that measures how close the within-cluster distributions are to
elliptical unimodal distributions that have the only mode in the mean. This
nonparametric measure allows for non-Gaussian clusters as long as they have a
good quality according to $Q$. The simplicity of a model is assessed by a
measure $S$ that prefers a smaller number of clusters unless additional
clusters can reduce the estimated noise proportion substantially. The simplest
model is then chosen that is adequate for the data in the sense that its
observed value of $Q$ is not significantly larger than what is expected for

bootstrap. The approach is compared with model-based clustering using the

beyond the application of free-viewpoint volumetric video, we allow
re-animation and alteration of an actor's performance through (i) the
enrichment of the captured data with semantics and animation properties and
(ii) applying hybrid geometry- and video-based animation methods that allow a
direct animation of the high-quality data itself instead of creating an
animatable model that resembles the captured data. Semantic enrichment and
geometric animation ability are achieved by establishing temporal consistency
in the 3D data, followed by an automatic rigging of each frame using a
parametric shape-adaptive full human body model. Our hybrid geometry- and
video-based animation approaches combine the flexibility of classical CG
animation with the realism of real captured data. For pose editing, we exploit
the captured data as much as possible and kinematically deform the captured
frames to fit a desired pose. Further, we treat the face differently from the
body in a hybrid geometry- and video-based animation approach where coarse
movements and poses are modeled in the geometry only, while very fine and
subtle details in the face, often lacking in purely geometric methods, are
captured in video-based textures. These are processed to be interactively
combined to form new facial expressions. On top of that, we learn the
appearance of regions that are challenging to synthesize, such as the teeth or
the eyes, and fill in missing regions realistically in an autoencoder-based
approach. This paper covers the full pipeline from capturing and producing
high-quality video content, over the enrichment with semantics and deformation
properties for re-animation and processing of the data for the final hybrid
animation.

propagate only in one direction along the chain, independent of the excitation
position, and the propagation in the opposite direction is suppressed. The
system shows fair robustness against the typical disorder present in modern
samples. Finally, using the bistable nature of the polaritons we show that

paves the way for compact and robust feedback-free one-dimensional polariton

Driven nonlinear resonators provide a fertile ground for phenomena related to

unattainable in their linear counterparts. Here, we show that optical
parametric oscillators (OPOs) can undergo second-order phase transitions in the
spectral domain between degenerate and non-degenerate regimes. This abrupt
change in the spectral response follows a square-root dependence around the
critical point, exhibiting high sensitivity to parameter variation akin to
systems around an exceptional point. We experimentally demonstrate such a phase
transition in a quadratic OPO, map its dynamics to the universal
Swift-Hohenberg equation, and extend it to Kerr OPOs. To emphasize the
fundamental importance and consequences of this phase transition, we show that
the divergent susceptibility of the critical point is accompanied by
spontaneous symmetry breaking and distinct phase noise properties in the two
regimes, indicating the importance of a beyond nonlinear bifurcation
interpretation. We also predict the occurrence of first-order spectral phase
transitions in coupled OPOs. Our results on non-equilibrium spectral behaviors

disks, a process that is thought to regulate their rotational evolution. In
this work, we compute torques acting onto the stellar surface of CTTs arising
from different accreting (accretion funnels) and ejecting (stellar winds and
magnetospheric ejections) flow components. Furthermore, we compare the magnetic
braking due to stellar winds in two different systems: isolated and accreting
stars. 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, time-dependent, axisymmetric simulations are
employed. For both systems the stellar wind is thermally driven. In the
star-disk-interaction (SDI) simulations the accretion disk is Keplerian,
viscous, and resistive. Two series of simulations are presented, one for each
system. We find that in classical T Tauri systems the presence of
magnetospheric ejections confines the stellar-wind expansion, resulting in an
hourglass-shaped geometry of the outflow. In addition, the formation of the
accretion columns modifies the amount of open magnetic flux exploited by the
stellar wind. These effects have a strong impact on the stellar wind properties
and we show that the stellar-wind braking is more efficient in the
star-disk-interacting systems than in the isolated ones. We also derive torque
scalings, over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, for each flow
component in a SDI system that directly applies a torque on the stellar
surface. In all the performed SDI simulations the stellar wind extracts less
than 2% of the mass accretion rate and the disk is truncated up to 66% of the
corotation radius. All the simulations show a net spin-up torque. In order to
achieve a stellar-spin equilibrium we need either more massive stellar winds or
disks being truncated closer to the corotation radius, which increases the
torque efficiency by the magnetospheric ejections.

models and let them teach each other during each batch. First, each network
feeds forward all samples and selects samples with high-confidence predictions.
Second, each model is updated by samples selected by its peer network. We view
the high-confidence predictions as useful knowledge, and the useful knowledge
of one network teaches the peer network with model updating in each batch. In
mutual teaching, the pseudo-label set of a network is from its peer network.
Since we use the new strategy of network training, performance improves
significantly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods under very low
label rates.

boulders in LAMO images, which have a scale of 20 m per pixel. We estimate that
our sample is virtually complete down to a boulder size of 4 pixels (80 m). The
largest boulder is a 400 m-sized block on the Marcia crater floor. Relatively
few boulders reside in a large area of relatively low albedo, surmised to be
the carbon-rich ejecta of the Veneneia basin, either because boulders form less
easily here or live shorter. By comparing the density of boulders around
craters with a known age, we find that the maximum boulder lifetime is about
300 Ma. The boulder size-frequency distribution (SFD) is generally assumed to
follow a power law. We fit power laws to the Vesta SFD by means of the maximum
likelihood method, but they do not fit well. Our analysis of power law
exponents for boulders on other small Solar System bodies suggests that the
derived exponent is primarily a function of boulder size range. The Weibull
distribution mimics this behavior and fits the Vesta boulder SFD well. The
Weibull distribution is often encountered in rock grinding experiments, and may
result from the fractal nature of cracks propagating in the rock interior. We
propose that, in general, the SFD of particles (including boulders) on the
surface of small bodies follows a Weibull distribution rather than a power law.

issues of deep neural networks. In the black-box setting, current model
stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of
the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model.
Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be
defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called
""Simulator"", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To
this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by
collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing
networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based
knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference
between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss
are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator
and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is
unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its
functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of
queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity.
Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the
baseline method. The implementation source code is released at

how ferroelectric polarization and its reversibility in direction can be
utilized to modulate the band alignment and optical absorption properties. For
this objective, 2D van der Waals heterostructures (HTSs) are constructed by
interfacing monolayer MoS2 with ferroelectric In2Se3. We find the switch of
polarization direction has dramatically changed the band alignment, thus
facilitating different type of reactions. In In2Se3/MoS2/In2Se3
heterostructures, one polarization direction supports hydrogen evolution
reaction and another polarization direction can favour oxygen evolution
reaction. These can be used to create tuneable photocatalyst materials where
water reduction reactions can be selectively controlled by polarization
switching. The modulation of band alignment is attributed to the shift of
reaction potential caused by spontaneous polarization. Additionally, the formed
type-II van der Waals HTSs also significantly improve charge separation and
enhance the optical absorption in the visible and infrared regions. Our results
pave a way in the design of van der Waals HTSs for water splitting using

MUSE/CALIFA IFU data cubes. We employ two complementary approaches: i) the
analysis of bar/disk stacks built from co-added UV images of hundreds of
galaxies; and ii) the classification of the morphology of ionised regions in
galaxies into three main SF classes: A) only circumnuclear SF, B) SF at the bar
ends, but not along the bar, and C) SF along the bar. Lenticular galaxies
typically belong to SF class A: this is probably related to bar-induced SF
quenching. The distribution of SF class B peaks for early- and
intermediate-type spirals: this most likely results from the interplay of gas
flow, shocks, and enhanced shear in centrally concentrated galaxies with large
bar amplitudes. Late-type galaxies are mainly assigned to SF class C: we argue
that this is a consequence of low shear. In bar stacks of spirals, the UV
emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as
witnessed in simulations. For early-types, the central UV emission is $\sim$0.5
mag brighter in strongly barred galaxies, relative to their weakly barred
counterparts: this is related to the efficiency of strong bars sweeping the
disk gas and triggering central starbursts. We also show that the distributions
of SF in inner ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred
galaxies, including a UV/H$\alpha$ deficit in the middle part of the bar: this
hints at the effect of resonance rings trapping gas. Distinct distributions of
SF within bars are reported in galaxies of different morphological types
(Abridged).

stereoselective interactions between particles is not known. Here we developed
a strategy to tune the nature of chiral activity of 3D-printed granular
ellipsoids without altering their shape or size. In vertically agitated
monolayers of these particles, we observed two types of dimers form depending
on the chirality of the pairing monomers. Heterochiral dimers moved
collectively as a single achiral active unit, while homochiral ones formed a
translationally immobile spinner. In active racemic mixtures, the former was
more abundant than the latter indicating stereoselectivity. Through dimer
lifetime measurements, we provide compelling evidence for chiral
self-recognition in mixtures of particles with different chiral activities. We
finally show that changing only the net chirality of a dense active liquid from
a racemic mixture to an enantiopure liquid fundamentally alters its nature of
collective relaxation.

robotic end-effector. Compared with rigid counterparts, they are safer for
human-robot and environment-robot interactions, easier to control, lower cost
and weight, and more compliant. Current soft robotic hands have mostly focused
on the soft fingers and bending actuators. However, the palm is also essential
part for grasping. In this work, we propose a novel design of soft humanoid
hand with pneumatic soft fingers and soft palm. The hand is inexpensive to
fabricate. The configuration of the soft palm is based on modular design which
can be easily applied into actuating all kinds of soft fingers before. The
splaying of the fingers, bending of the whole palm, abduction and adduction of
the thumb are implemented by the soft palm. Moreover, we present a new design
of soft finger, called hybrid bending soft finger (HBSF). It can both bend in
the grasping axis and deflect in the side-to-side axis as human-like motion.
The functions of the HBSF and soft palm were simulated by SOFA framework. And
their performance was tested in experiments. The 6 fingers with 1 to 11
segments were tested and analyzed. The versatility of the soft hand is
evaluated and testified by the grasping experiments in real scenario according
to Feix taxonomy. And the results present the diversity of grasps and show
promise for grasping a variety of objects with different shapes and weights.

operators can allow artificial immune systems (AIS) to be very efficient at
escaping local optima of multimodal optimisation problems. However, this
efficiency comes at the expense of considerably slower runtimes during the
exploitation phase compared to standard evolutionary algorithms. We propose
modifications to the traditional `hypermutations with mutation potential' (HMP)
that allow them to be efficient at exploitation as well as maintaining their
effective explorative characteristics. Rather than deterministically evaluating
fitness after each bit-flip of a hypermutation, we sample the fitness function
stochastically with a `parabolic' distribution which allows the `stop at first
constructive mutation' (FCM) variant of HMP to reduce the linear amount of
wasted function evaluations when no improvement is found to a constant. The
stochastic distribution also allows the removal of the FCM mechanism altogether
as originally desired in the design of the HMP operators. We rigorously prove
the effectiveness of the proposed operators for all the benchmark functions
where the performance of HMP is rigorously understood in the literature and
validating the gained insights to show linear speed-ups for the identification
of high quality approximate solutions to classical NP-Hard problems from
combinatorial optimisation. We then show the superiority of the HMP operators
to the traditional ones in an analysis of the complete standard Opt-IA AIS,
where the stochastic evaluation scheme allows HMP and ageing operators to work
in harmony. Through a comparative performance study of other `fast mutation'
operators from the literature, we conclude that a power-law distribution for
the parabolic evaluation scheme is the best compromise in black box scenarios
where little problem knowledge is available.

dimensionality. Using a reduced analytical description of the full Hamiltonian,
we show that in the presence of vibrational excitation both on electronically
excited as well as unexcited sites, constructive interference between such
basis states causes vibronic coupling between excitons to become progressively
stronger with increasing quanta of vibrational excitation. This effect leads to
three distinguishing features of excitons coupled through a vibronic resonance
which are not captured in basis sets with reduced vibrational dimensionality -
1. the vibronic resonance criterion itself, 2. vibronically assisted perfect
delocalization between sites even though purely electronic mixing between the
sites is imperfect due to energetic disorder, 3. the nuclear distortion
accompanying vibronic excitons becoming increasingly larger for resonant
vibronic coupling involving higher vibrational quanta. In terms of
spectroscopically observable limitations of reduced basis set descriptions of
vibronic resonance, several differences are seen in absorption and emission
spectra, but may be obscured on account of overwhelming line broadening.
However, we show that several features such as vibronic exciton delocalization
and vibrational distortions associated with electronic excitations, which
ultimately dictate the excited state wavepacket motions and relaxation
processes, are fundamentally not described under reduced basis set descriptions

Comprehensions also support features for writing reusable and composable
queries, such as the handling of nested data and the use of functional
abstractions. In parallel to these developments, optics have emerged in recent
years as the technology of choice to write programs that manipulate complex
data structures with nested components. Optic abstractions are easily
composable and, in principle, permit both data access and updates. This paper
attempts to exploit the notion of optic for LINQ as a higher-level language
that complements comprehension-based approaches. In order to do this, we lift a
restricted subset of optics, namely getters, affine folds and folds, into a
full-blown DSL. The type system of the resulting language of optics, that we
have named Optica, distills their compositional properties, whereas its
denotational semantics is given by standard optics. This formal specification
of the concept of optic enables the definition of non-standard optic
representations beyond van Laarhoven, profunctor optics, etc. In particular,
the paper demonstrates that a restricted subset of XQuery can be understood as
an optic representation; it introduces Triplets, a non-standard semantic domain
to normalize optic expressions and facilitate the generation of SQL queries;
and it describes how to generate comprehension-based queries from optic

applications, such as building reconstruction and biomass estimation.
Retrieving the scattering profile along the mixed dimension (elevation) is
typically solved by inversion of the SAR imaging model, a process known as SAR
tomography. This paper proposes a nonlinear blind scatterer separation method
to retrieve the phase centers of the layovered scatterers, avoiding the
computationally expensive tomographic inversion. We demonstrate that
conventional linear separation methods, e.g., principle component analysis
(PCA), can only partially separate the scatterers under good conditions. These
methods produce systematic phase bias in the retrieved scatterers due to the
nonorthogonality of the scatterers' steering vectors, especially when the
intensities of the sources are similar or the number of images is low. The
proposed method artificially increases the dimensionality of the data using
kernel PCA, hence mitigating the aforementioned limitations. In the processing,
the proposed method sequentially deflates the covariance matrix using the
estimate of the brightest scatterer from kernel PCA. Simulations demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed method over conventional PCA-based
methods in various respects. Experiments using TerraSAR-X data show an
improvement in height reconstruction accuracy by a factor of one to three,

a non-monotonic temperature dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC),
increasing from 9 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature to 29
$\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ at 100 K, followed by a drop and unexpected
sign-reversal at lower temperatures. Similar sign reversal is also observed in
magnetoresistance measurements. We attribute this sign reversal to the
transition from a Berry curvature dominated AHC at high temperature to a weak
canted ferromagnetic AHC response at lower temperature, below 70 K, caused by
the reorientation of Mn moments out of the kagome plane. Our above results in
thin films of Mn$_3$Pt make advances in their integration with room temperature
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

derived from tide gauge records; however most algorithms for this assume that
modes of sea level variability are stationary which is not true over several
decades. Here we suggest a method that is based on optimized data-dependent
triangulations of the network of gauge stations. Data-dependent triangulations
are triangulations of point sets that rely not only on 2D point positions but
also on additional data (e.g. elevation, anomalies). In this article, we show
how data-dependent triangulations with min-error criteria can be used to
reconstruct 2D maps of the sea surface anomaly over a longer time period,
assuming that height anomalies are continuously monitored at a sparse set of
stations and, in addition, observations of a reference surface is provided over
a shorter time period. At the heart of our method is the idea to learn a
min-error triangulation based on the available reference data, and to use the
learned triangulation subsequently to compute piece-wise linear surface models
for epochs in which only observations from monitoring stations are given. We
combine our approach of min-error triangulation with $k$-order Delaunay
triangulation to stabilize the triangles geometrically. We show that this
approach is advantageous for the reconstruction of the sea surface by combining
tide gauge measurements with data of modern satellite altimetry. We show how to
learn a min-error triangulation and a min-error $k$-order Delaunay
triangulation using integer linear programming. We confront our reconstructions
against the Delaunay triangulation. With real data for the North Sea we show
that the min-error triangulation outperforms the Delaunay method significantly
for reconstructions back in time up to 18 years, and the $k$-order Delaunay
min-error triangulation even up to 21 years for $k=2$.

Unlike a static linear regression model, the DLMs assume that their parameters

of classes of pattern avoiding matchings, initiated by Chen, Deng, Du, Stanley

particular, we work out explicit formulas to enumerate the class of matchings

Finally, we introduce the notion of unlabeled pattern, as a combinatorial way

it suffers from long-standing performance instability, which extremely limits

indicators such as Hessian eigenvalues are proposed as a signal to stop
searching before the performance collapses. However, these indicator-based
methods tend to easily reject good architectures if the thresholds are
inappropriately set, let alone the searching is intrinsically noisy. In this

We first demonstrate that skip connections have a clear advantage over other
candidate operations, where it can easily recover from a disadvantageous state
and become dominant. We conjecture that this privilege is causing degenerated
performance. Therefore, we propose to factor out this benefit with an auxiliary
skip connection, ensuring a fairer competition for all operations. We call this

  Reconstruction",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many practical applications, e.g., content based image retrieval and object
recognition, heavily rely on the local features extracted from the query image.
As these local features are usually exposed to untrustworthy parties, the
privacy leakage problem of image local features has received increasing
attention in recent years. In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the privacy
leakage of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), which is one of the most
widely-used image local features. We first consider the case that the adversary
can fully access the SIFT features, i.e., both the SIFT descriptors and the
coordinates are available. We propose a novel end-to-end, coarse-to-fine deep
generative model for reconstructing the latent image from its SIFT features.
The designed deep generative model consists of two networks, where the first
one attempts to learn the structural information of the latent image by
transforming from SIFT features to Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features, while
the second one aims to reconstruct the pixel values guided by the learned LBP.
Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed deep generative
model produces much improved reconstructed results over three public datasets.
Furthermore, we address more challenging cases that only partial SIFT features
(either SIFT descriptors or coordinates) are accessible to the adversary. It is
shown that, if the adversary can only have access to the SIFT descriptors while
not their coordinates, then the modest success of reconstructing the latent
image can be achieved for highly-structured images (e.g., faces) and would fail
in general settings. In addition, the latent image can be reconstructed with
reasonably good quality solely from the SIFT coordinates. Our results would
suggest that the privacy leakage problem can be largely avoided if the SIFT
coordinates can be well protected.

network for better filling the missing pixels. Furthermore, an improved spatial

considering the consistency not only between the known region with the

magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 3.6 MJm-3 is combined with a saturation
magnetization of {\mu}0Ms = 0.52 T at 2 K (2.2 MJm-3 and 0.44 T at

is the highest observed for any rare-earth free hard magnet. The anisotropy is
related to an unquenched orbital moment of 0.42 {\mu}B on Co, which is
hybridized with neighbouring Rh atoms with a large spin-orbit interaction.
Moreover, the pronounced temperature-dependence of the anisotropy that follows

global spatial-temporal context can greatly clarify local distractions to
enhance the target feature representation. To comprehensively leverage the
spatial-temporal context information, in this work, we present a novel block,
Interaction-Aggregation-Update (IAU), for high-performance person reID.
Firstly, Spatial-Temporal IAU (STIAU) module is introduced. STIAU jointly
incorporates two types of contextual interactions into a CNN framework for
target feature learning. Here the spatial interactions learn to compute the
contextual dependencies between different body parts of a single frame. While
the temporal interactions are used to capture the contextual dependencies
between the same body parts across all frames. Furthermore, a Channel IAU
(CIAU) module is designed to model the semantic contextual interactions between
channel features to enhance the feature representation, especially for
small-scale visual cues and body parts. Therefore, the IAU block enables the
feature to incorporate the globally spatial, temporal, and channel context. It
is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be easily plugged into existing
CNNs to form IAUnet. The experiments show that IAUnet performs favorably
against state-of-the-art on both image and video reID tasks and achieves
compelling results on a general object categorization task. The source code is

the robot in the whole workspace. In this work, we measure the forces exerted
by two collaborative manipulators (UR10e and KUKA LBR iiwa) moving downward
against an impact measuring device. First, we empirically show that the impact
forces can vary by more than 100 percent within the robot workspace. The forces
are negatively correlated with the distance from the robot base and the height
in the workspace. Second, we present a data-driven model, 3D
Collision-Force-Map, predicting impact forces from distance, height, and
velocity and demonstrate that it can be trained on a limited number of data
points. Third, we analyze the force evolution upon impact and find that
clamping never occurs for the UR10e. We show that formulas relating robot mass,
velocity, and impact forces from ISO/TS 15066 are insufficient -- leading both
to significant underestimation and overestimation and thus to unnecessarily
long cycle times or even dangerous applications. We propose an empirical method
that can be deployed to quickly determine the optimal speed and position where
a task can be safely performed with maximum efficiency.

formation of such domains occurs owing to the charge ordering of Mn^{3+} and

interaction, we formulate a communication system composed of a nanoantenna
transmitter and a protein receiver. We adopt a Markov chain model to account
for protein stochasticity with transition rates governed by the nanoantenna
force. Both two-state and multi-state protein models are presented to depict
different biological configurations. Closed form expressions for the mutual
information of each scenario is derived and maximized to find the capacity
between the input nanoantenna force and the protein state. The results we
obtain indicate that controlled protein signaling provides a communication
platform for information transmission between the nanoantenna and the protein
with a clear physical significance. The analysis reported in this work should
further research into the EM-based control of protein networks.

which predict and establish the existence of quantum droplets (QDs), i.e.,
robust two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) self-trapped states in
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), which are stabilized by effective
selffirepulsion induced by quantum fluctuations around the mean-field (MF)
states [alias the Lee-Huang--Yang (LHY) effect]. The basic models are
presented, taking special care of the dimension crossover, 2D -> 3D. Recently
reported experimental results, which exhibit stable 3D and quasi-2D QDs in
binary BECs, with the inter-component attraction slightly exceeding the MF
self-repulsion in each component, and in single-component condensates of atoms
carrying permanent magnetic moments, are presented in some detail. The summary
of theoretical results is focused, chiefly, on 3D and quasi-2D QDs with
embedded vorticity, as the possibility to stabilize such states is a remarkable
prediction. Stable vortex states are presented both for QDs in free space, and
for singular but physically relevant 2D modes pulled to the center by the
inverse-square potential, with the quantum collapse suppressed by the LHY
effect.

wireless sensor networks (WSNs) under the fault model without knowing the

localizing intruders, Wifi hotspots and users, and faults in power systems.
Previous studies assume the true knowledge (or good estimates) of sensor
parameters (e.g., fault model probability or Region of Influence (ROI) of the
source) for source localization. However, we propose two methods to estimate
the source location in this paper under the fault model: hitting set approach
and feature selection method, which only utilize the noisy data set at the
fusion center for estimation of the source location without knowing the sensor
parameters. The proposed methods have been shown to localize the source
effectively. We also study the lower bound on the sample complexity requirement
for hitting set method. These methods have also been extended for multiple
sources localizations. In addition, we modify the proposed feature selection
approach to use maximum likelihood. Finally, extensive simulations are carried
out for different settings (i.e., the number of sensor nodes and sample
complexity) to validate our proposed methods in comparison to centroid, maximum
likelihood, FTML, SNAP estimators.

Advanced LIGO observations, head-on mergers with respective total masses of

reason of the performance improvements made by existing methods lie in massive
paired video-sentence data, but collecting such strong annotation, i.e.,
high-quality sentences, is time-consuming and laborious. It is the fact that
there now exist an amazing number of videos with weak annotation that only
contains semantic concepts such as actions and objects. In this paper, we
investigate using weak annotation instead of strong annotation to train a video
captioning model. To this end, we propose a progressive visual reasoning method
that progressively generates fine sentences from weak annotations by inferring
more semantic concepts and their dependency relationships for video captioning.
To model concept relationships, we use dependency trees that are spanned by
exploiting external knowledge from large sentence corpora. Through traversing
the dependency trees, the sentences are generated to train the captioning
model. Accordingly, we develop an iterative refinement algorithm that refines
sentences via spanning dependency trees and fine-tunes the captioning model
using the refined sentences in an alternative training manner. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method using weak annotation is very competitive
to the state-of-the-art methods using strong annotation.

the merger of two black holes with masses of $85^{+21}_{-14} M_{\odot}$ and
$66^{+17}_{-18} M_{\odot}$ (90 % credible intervals). We infer that the primary
black hole mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational) pair-instability
supernova processes, and has only a 0.32 % probability of being below $65
M_{\odot}$. We calculate the mass of the remnant to be $142^{+28}_{-16}
M_{\odot}$, which can be considered an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The
luminosity distance of the source is $5.3^{+2.4}_{-2.6}$ Gpc, corresponding to

Stellar migration of the galactic disc stars has been invoked to
explain the dispersion of stellar metallicity observed in the solar
neighborhood. Aims. We seek to identify the dynamical mechanisms underlying
stellar migration in an isolated galaxy disc under the influence of a bar. Our
approach is to analyze the diffusion of dynamical quantities. Methods. We
extend our previous work by exploring Chirikov's diffusion rate (and derived
timescale) of the radial action $J_\mathrm{R}$ in an idealised N$-$body
simulation of an isolated disc galaxy. We limit our study to the evolution of
the disc region well after the formation of the bar, in a regime of adiabatic
evolution. Results. The $J_\mathrm{R}$ diffusion timescales
$T_\mathrm{D}(J_\mathrm{R})$ is less than 3 Gyr for roughly half the galaxy
mass. It is always much shorter than the angular momentum diffusion timescale
$T_\mathrm{D}(L_\mathrm{z})$ outside the stellar bar. In the disc, $\langle
T_\mathrm{D}(J_\mathrm{R}) \rangle \sim 1$ Gyr. All non-axisymmetric
morphological structures characteristic of resonances and waves in the disc are
associated to particles with $T_\mathrm{D}(J_\mathrm{R}) < 3$ Gyr and
$T_\mathrm{D}(L_\mathrm{z}) > 10$ Gyr. Short $T_\mathrm{D}(J_\mathrm{R})$ can
be explained by the gradual decircularisation of initially circular orbits
($J_\mathrm{R}=0$) under the effect of intermittent ILR scattering by wave
trains propagating in the disc, well beyond the bar OLR. This leads to a
moderate secular heating of the disc beyond the bar OLR for 7 Gyr, comparable
to solar neighbourhood observations. The complex multi-wave structure, mixing
permanent and intermittent modes, allows for multiple resonance overlaps.

branch (HB) should mainly depend on GC metallicity, the ""first parameter"", but
it is actually the result of complex interactions between the red giant branch
(RGB) mass loss, the coexistence of multiple stellar populations with different
helium content, and the presence of a ""second parameter"" which produces
dramatic differences in HB morphology of GCs of similar metallicity and ages
(like the pair M3--M13). In this work, we combine the entire dataset from the
Hubble Space Telescope Treasury survey and stellar evolutionary models, to
analyse the HBs of 46 GCs. For the first time in a large sample of GCs, we
generate population synthesis models, where the helium abundances for the first
and the ""extreme"" second generations are constrained using independent
measurements based on RGB stars. The main results are: 1) the mass loss of
first generation stars is tightly correlated to cluster metallicity. 2) the
location of helium enriched stars on the HB is reproduced only by adopting a
higher RGB mass loss than for the first generation. The difference in mass loss
correlates with helium enhancement and cluster mass. 3) A model of ""pre-main
sequence disc early loss"", previously developed by the authors, explains such a
mass loss increase and is consistent with the findings of multiple-population
formation models predicting that populations more enhanced in helium tend to
form with higher stellar densities and concentrations. 4) Helium-enhancement
and mass-loss both contribute to the second parameter.

  (CVPPP) in conjunction with ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised learning is often used to count objects in images, but for
counting small, densely located objects, the required image annotations are
burdensome to collect. Counting plant organs for image-based plant phenotyping
falls within this category. Object counting in plant images is further
challenged by having plant image datasets with significant domain shift due to
different experimental conditions, e.g. applying an annotated dataset of indoor
plant images for use on outdoor images, or on a different plant species. In
this paper, we propose a domain-adversarial learning approach for domain
adaptation of density map estimation for the purposes of object counting. The
approach does not assume perfectly aligned distributions between the source and
target datasets, which makes it more broadly applicable within general object
counting and plant organ counting tasks. Evaluation on two diverse object
counting tasks (wheat spikelets, leaves) demonstrates consistent performance on
the target datasets across different classes of domain shift: from
indoor-to-outdoor images and from species-to-species adaptation.

discovery and characterization of exoplanets. Modern spectrographs promise
measurement precision of ~0.2-0.5 m/s for an ideal target star. However, the
intrinsic variability of stellar spectra can mimic and obscure true planet
signals at these levels. Rajpaul et al. (2015) and Jones et al. (2017) proposed
applying a physically motivated, multivariate Gaussian process (GP) to jointly
model the apparent Doppler shift and multiple indicators of stellar activity as
a function of time, so as to separate the planetary signal from various forms
of stellar variability. These methods are promising, but performing the
necessary calculations can be computationally intensive and algebraically
tedious. In this work, we present a flexible and computationally efficient
software package, GPLinearOdeMaker.jl, for modeling multivariate time series
using a linear combination of univariate GPs and their derivatives. The package
allows users to easily and efficiently apply various multivariate GP models and
different covariance kernel functions. We demonstrate GPLinearOdeMaker.jl by
applying the Jones et al. (2017) model to fit measurements of the apparent
Doppler shift and activity indicators derived from simulated active solar
spectra time series affected by many evolving star spots. We show how
GPLinearOdeMaker.jl makes it easy to explore the effect of different choices
for the GP kernel. We find that local kernels could significantly increase the

between the snow slab above a weak-layer and, as presented in this work, the

slab which eventually triggers an avalanche. I present the results of 3D finite
element simulations in an elastoplastic domain. The plastic deformation of the
weak-layer follows the Mohr-Coulomb-Cap model which provides a more realistic
model as a pure elastic approach. I investigate how the stress field on top of
the weak-layer changes if one is skiing down-slope or parallel to the slope. A
layered snow slab changes the stress on top of the weak-layer and to
investigate these changes I simulated two different representative layered
slabs. One containing only soft layers to investigate how the weak layer is
affected by the ski induced stress and the other hard-soft-hard layer to
examine bridge effects caused by the hard layers. A hard layer in the snow slab
forms a sort of bridge which spreads the induced stress over a larger lateral
distance, at the same time decreasing the stress to the layers below the
bridge. Furthermore, I show a possible connection between the plastic
deformation and the critical crack length.

difficult to obtain because their HIV surveillance data is very limited. In
this paper, we propose a so-called joint spatial conditional auto-regressive
model for estimating HIV prevalence rates among key populations. Our model
borrows information from both neighboring locations and dependent populations.
As illustrated in the real data analysis, it provides more accurate estimates
than independently fitting the sub-epidemic for each key population. In
addition, we provide a study to reveal the conditions that our proposal gives a
better prediction. The study combines both theoretical investigation and
numerical study, revealing strength and limitations of our proposal.

tool results. We also contacted the maintainers of these projects by creating
an issue on the GitHub repository of each project, and discussed the misuses
with developers. [Results] We learned that 85% of Cryptography APIs are
misused, however, not every misuse has severe consequences. Developer feedback
showed that security caveats in the documentation of crypto APIs are rare,
developers may overlook misuses that originate in third-party code, and the
context where a Crypto API is used should be taken into account. [Conclusion]
We conclude that using Crypto APIs is still problematic for developers but
blindly blaming them for such misuses may lead to erroneous conclusions.

Green Bank Telescope to survey 100 nearby ($z \lesssim 0.055$) dwarf galaxies
($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5}~M_{\odot}$) with optical emission line ratios
indicative of accretion onto a massive black hole. We detected no new masers
down to a limit of $\sim$12 mJy (5$\sigma$). We compared the properties of our
sample with those of $\sim$1,850 known detections and non-detections in massive
galaxies. We find, in agreement with previous studies, that masers are
preferentially hosted by Seyferts and highly-obscured, [O III]-bright AGNs. Our
sample has fewer Seyferts, is less obscured, and is [O III]-faint. Though the
overall maser detection rate is $\sim$3% in massive galaxies, the predicted
rate for our sample, weighted by its optical properties, is $\sim$0.6-1.7%,
corresponding to a probability of making no detections of $\sim$20-50%. We also
found a slight increase in the detection rate with increased stellar mass in

discern whether there is an intrinsic difference between the maser fraction in
active dwarf galaxies and in their massive counterparts for the same AGN
properties.

function can be factorized into local and nonlocal factors in the thermodynamic
limit. The gapless topological extended-kink (TEK) phase is disclosed to
exhibit long-range correlation but without long-range order, because its ground
state is nondegenerate and thus immune to spontaneous symmetry breaking. This
conclusion is also true in the classical impurity limit, which is significantly
different from that for the open boundary chain without ring frustration.
However, spontaneous symmetry breaking does occur in the gapped kink zero mode
(KZM) phase and leads to the antiferromagnetic zero mode (AFZM), in which
antiferromagnetic order develops in the bulk while entangled states persists
locally around the impurity. And as a new feature of quantum phase transition
induced by impurity, the transition from the TEK phase to the KZM-AFZM phase is
reflected by a steplike nonlocal factor of the correlation function.

introduction of an explicit and unobtrusive authentication layer can greatly
enhance security. In this study, we focus on deep learning methods for explicit
authentication based on motion sensor signals. In this scenario, attackers
could craft adversarial examples with the aim of gaining unauthorized access
and even restraining a legitimate user to access his mobile device. To our
knowledge, this is the first study that aims at quantifying the impact of
adversarial attacks on machine learning models used for user identification
based on motion sensors. To accomplish our goal, we study multiple methods for
generating adversarial examples. We propose three research questions regarding
the impact and the universality of adversarial examples, conducting relevant
experiments in order to answer our research questions. Our empirical results
demonstrate that certain adversarial example generation methods are specific to
the attacked classification model, while others tend to be generic. We thus
conclude that deep neural networks trained for user identification tasks based
on motion sensors are subject to a high percentage of misclassification when

by machines, differently from humans, have many weaknesses. However, humans'
perception is also fundamentally different from machines, because we do not see
the signals which arrive at the retina but a rather complex recreation of them.
In this paper, we explore how machines could recreate the input as well as
investigate the benefits of such an augmented perception. In this regard, we
propose Perceptual Deep Neural Networks ($\varphi$DNN) which also recreate
their own input before further processing. The concept is formalized
mathematically and two variations of it are developed (one based on inpainting
the whole image and the other based on a noisy resized super resolution
recreation). Experiments reveal that $\varphi$DNNs and their adversarial
training variations can increase the robustness substantially, surpassing both
state-of-the-art defenses and pre-processing types of defenses in 100% of the
tests. $\varphi$DNNs are shown to scale well to bigger image sizes, keeping a
similar high accuracy throughout; while the state-of-the-art worsen up to 35%.
Moreover, the recreation process intentionally corrupts the input image.
Interestingly, we show by ablation tests that corrupting the input is, although
counter-intuitive, beneficial. Thus, $\varphi$DNNs reveal that input recreation
has strong benefits for artificial neural networks similar to biological ones,
shedding light into the importance of purposely corrupting the input as well as
pioneering an area of perception models based on GANs and autoencoders for
robust recognition in artificial intelligence.

reservoirs (1.7-10 kpc), associated with rotating disks with disturbed
kinematics. WISSH QSOs typically show lower CO luminosity and higher star
formation efficiency than FIR matched, z~0-3 main-sequence galaxies, implying
that, given the observed SFR ~170-1100 $M_\odot$/yr, molecular gas is converted
into stars on <50 Myr. Most targets show extreme dynamical to black-hole mass
ratios $M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\rm BH}\sim3-10$, two orders of magnitude smaller than
local relations. The molecular gas fraction in WISSH hosts is lower by a factor
of ~10-100 than in star forming galaxies with similar $M_*$. WISSH QSOs undergo
an intense growth phase of both the central SMBH and host-galaxy. They pinpoint
high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble and mergers play a major role
in the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass. The observed low molecular gas

traced by fast AGN-driven ionised outflows in all our targets.

dimensional, associative, unital algebra over $k$. Let $P(A)$ be the
probability that two elements of $A$ chosen (uniformly and independently) at

simple, then $P(A) \to 1$ as $|A| \to \infty$. We extend this result to a large
class of finite associative algebras. For $A$ simple, we find the optimal lower
bound for $P(A)$ and we estimate the growth rate of $P(A)$ in terms of the
minimal index $m(A)$ of any proper subalgebra of $A$. We also study the random
generation of simple algebras $A$ by two elements that have a given
characteristic polynomial (resp. a given rank). In addition, we bound above and

let $A$ be a profinite algebra over $k$. We show that $A$ is positively

standard for discovering software bugs. Fuzzing techniques are constantly being
improved in a race to build the ultimate bug-finding tool. However, while
fuzzing excels at finding bugs in the wild, evaluating and comparing fuzzer
performance is challenging due to the lack of metrics and benchmarks. For
example, crash count, perhaps the most commonly-used performance metric, is
inaccurate due to imperfections in deduplication techniques. Additionally, the
lack of a unified set of targets results in ad hoc evaluations that hinder fair
comparison.
  We tackle these problems by developing Magma, a ground-truth fuzzing
benchmark that enables uniform fuzzer evaluation and comparison. By introducing
real bugs into real software, Magma allows for the realistic evaluation of
fuzzers against a broad set of targets. By instrumenting these bugs, Magma also
enables the collection of bug-centric performance metrics independent of the
fuzzer. Magma is an open benchmark consisting of seven targets that perform a
variety of input manipulations and complex computations, presenting a challenge
to state-of-the-art fuzzers.
  We evaluate seven widely-used mutation-based fuzzers (AFL, AFLFast, AFL++,
FairFuzz, MOpt-AFL, honggfuzz, and SymCC-AFL) against Magma over 200,000

devices, stationary sensors, and satellites as well as a new user mentality of
using this technology to voluntarily share enriched location information
produces a flood of geo-spatial and geo-spatiotemporal data. This data flood
provides tremendous potential for discovering new and useful knowledge. But in
addition to the fact that measurements are imprecise, spatial data is often
interpolated between discrete observations. To reduce communication and
bandwidth utilization, data is often subjected to a reduction, thereby
eliminating some of the known/recorded values. These issues introduce the
notion of uncertainty in spatial data management, an aspect raising the
imminent need for scalable and flexible solutions. The main scope of this
chapter is to survey existing techniques for managing, querying, and mining
uncertain spatial data. First, this chapter surveys common data representations
for uncertain data, explains the commonly used possible worlds semantics to
interpret an uncertain database, and surveys existing system to process
uncertain data. Then, this chapter defines the notion of probabilistic result
semantics to distinguish the task of computing individual object probabilities
versus computing entire result probabilities. This is important, as, for many
queries, the problem of computing object-level probabilities can be solved
efficiently, whereas result-level probabilities are hard to compute. Finally,
this chapter introduces a novel paradigm to efficiently answer any kind of
query on uncertain data: the Paradigm of Equivalent Worlds, which groups the
exponential set of possible database worlds into a polynomial number of sets of
equivalent worlds that can be processed efficiently. Examples and use-cases of
querying uncertain spatial data are provided using the example of uncertain
range queries.

traffic based on TCP/IP flow features can be framed as a learning task and is
thus vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, unlike e.g. in image processing
where generated adversarial samples can be directly mapped to images, going
from flow features to actual TCP/IP packets requires crafting the sequence of
packets, with no established approach for such crafting and a limitation on the

learning and evasion consequences of the gap between generated and crafted

on a public C2 traffic dataset, white-box adversarial learning, and a
proxy-based approach for crafting longer flows. Our results show 1) the high
evasion rate obtained by using generated adversarial samples on the detector
can be significantly reduced when using crafted adversarial samples; 2)
robustness against adversarial samples by model hardening varies according to
the crafting approach and corresponding set of modifiable features that the
attack allows for; 3) incrementally training hardened models with adversarial
samples can produce a level playing field where no detector is best against all

coupling constants on both sides of the duality between non-relativistic dipole
field theories and string theory in Schr\""odinger spacetime. We consider the
following setup. In the gauge theory side one can deform a given conformal
field theory by a proper scalar operator and compute the quantum information
metric via the two-point correlation function between two such operators. On
the string side the deformation corresponds to a scalar field probing the
background. In the large $N$ limit of the theory the probing can be done
without backreaction on the original spacetime, thus one can construct a
perturbative scheme for the calculation of the dual holographic Fisher
information metric as shown by \cite{Trivella:2016brw}. Considering the
asymptotic behaviour of the holographic Fisher information metric close to the
boundary of the Schr\""odinger spacetime we show that its divergence structure
exactly matches its dual quantum counterpart up to the leading order, thus
extending the holographic setup up to the non-relativistic case. One should
note that the existence of other terms are not seen from the boundary theory to
this level of approximation. Their behaviour near the boundary however, is
pointing what kind of information from the boundary theory is missing to be
able to reconstruct the bulk. Obviously more work is needed to refine and
elucidate their meaning and interrelations in holographic setup.

$k$ spots) before proceeding forward down the street. Note that the parking
functions are the specialization of $k$ to $0$. For a fixed $0\leq k\leq n-1$,
we define a function $\varphi_k$ which maps a $k$-Naples parking function to

  We remark that our formula for enumerating $k$-Naples parking functions is
not recursive, in contrast to the previously known formula of Christensen et al

relate the $q$-analog of our formula to a new statistic that we denote

conjunction with two types of compensators. Next, we deduce the structure of
consistent non-conformal higher-spin ${\cal N}=1$ supercurrents. Explicit
expressions for such supercurrents are derived for various theories in 4D
${\cal N}=1$ Minkowski and AdS superspaces. These include a model of $N$
massive chiral superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix, along with free
theories of tensor and complex linear superfields. The second part of the

formulations for the massless multiplets of arbitrary superspin in (1,1) AdS

(2,0) AdS supersymmetry, we identify a multiplet of conserved higher-spin
currents in models for a chiral superfield, which is then used to construct two

by examining the effects of an external magnetic field on a particular

the singular locus of a log-symplectic manifold. We prove a normal form result
for the log-symplectic structure around such a Lagrangian, which we use to
extract algebraic and geometric information about the Lagrangian deformations.
We show that the deformation problem is governed by a DGLA, we discuss whether
the Lagrangian admits deformations not contained in the singular locus, and we
give precise criteria for unobstructedness of first order deformations. We also
address equivalences of deformations, showing that the gauge equivalence
relation of the DGLA corresponds with the geometric notion of equivalence by
Hamiltonian isotopies. We discuss the corresponding moduli space, and we prove
a rigidity statement for the more flexible equivalence relation by Poisson
isotopies.

uncertainty to the model output. One of the most authoritative measures in
global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol' total-order index, which can be
computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons
exist, it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are
contingent on the benchmark setting defined by the analyst (the sampling
method, the distribution of the model inputs, the number of model runs, the
test function or model and its dimensionality, the weight of higher order
effects or the performance measure selected). Here we compare several
total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where these benchmark
parameters are treated as random parameters. This arrangement significantly
relaxes the dependency of the results on the benchmark design. We observe that
the most accurate estimators are Razavi and Gupta's, Jansen's or Janon/Monod's
for factor prioritization, and Jansen's, Janon/Monod's or Azzini and Rosati's
for approaching the ""true"" total-order indices. The rest lag considerably
behind. Our work helps analysts navigate the myriad of total-order formulae by
reducing the uncertainty in the selection of the most appropriate estimator.

suggest that meta surfaces are a promising tool for nonlinear optical
applications. These nanostructured devices have been utilized for relatively
high efficiency solid-state high-harmonic generation platforms, four-wave
mixing, and Raman scattering experiments, among others. Here we report the
first all-dielectric metasurface to enhance harmonic generation from a
surrounding gas, achieving as much as a factor of 45 increase in the overall
yield for Argon atoms. When compared to metal nanostructures, dielectrics are
more robust against damage for high power applications such as those using
atomic gases. We employ dimerized high-contrast gratings fabricated in
silicon-on-insulator that support bound states in the continuum, a resonance
feature accessible in broken-symmetry planar devices. Our 1D gratings maintain
large mode volumes, overcoming one of the more severe limitations of earlier
device designs and greatly contributing to enhanced third- and fifth- harmonic
generation. The interaction lengths that can be achieved are also significantly
greater than the 10's of nm to which earlier solid-state designs were
restricted. We perform finite-difference time-domain simulations to fully
characterize the wavelength, linewidth, mode profile, and polarization
dependence of the resonances. Our experiments confirm these predictions and are
consistent with other nonlinear optical properties. The tunable wavelength
dependence and quality-factor control we demonstrate in these devices make them
an attractive tool for the next generation of high-harmonic sources, which are
anticipated to be pumped at longer wavelengths and with lower peak power,
higher repetition rate lasers.

first show that the trivial condition of $K_n \geq 2$ for all $n$ is sufficient
to ensure that $H(n;\mu,K_n)$, contains a giant component of size $n-O(1)$ whp.
Next, to model settings where nodes can fail or get compromised, we investigate
the size of the largest connected sub-network in $H(n;\mu,K_n)$, when $d_n$
nodes are selected uniformly at random and removed from the network. We show
that if $d_n=O(1)$, a giant component of size $n- \OO(1)$ persists for all $K_n

class of optimization problems in which interaction between a set of
cooperative agents are modeled as a set of constraints. DCOPs are NP-hard and
significant effort has been devoted to developing methods for finding
incomplete solutions. In this paper, we study an emerging class of such
incomplete algorithms that are broadly termed as population-based algorithms.
The main characteristic of these algorithms is that they maintain a population
of candidate solutions of a given problem and use this population to cover a
large area of the search space and to avoid local-optima. In recent years, this
class of algorithms has gained significant attention due to their ability to
produce high-quality incomplete solutions. With the primary goal of further
improving the quality of solutions compared to the state-of-the-art incomplete
DCOP algorithms, we present two new population-based algorithms in this paper.
Our first approach, Anytime Evolutionary DCOP or AED, exploits evolutionary
optimization meta-heuristics to solve DCOPs. We also present a novel anytime
update mechanism that gives AED its anytime property. While in our second
contribution, we show that population-based approaches can be combined with
local search approaches. Specifically, we develop an algorithm called DPSA
based on the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic. We empirically evaluate these
two algorithms to illustrate their respective effectiveness in different
settings against the state-of-the-art incomplete DCOP algorithms including all
existing population-based algorithms in a wide variety of benchmarks. Our
evaluation shows AED and DPSA markedly outperform the state-of-the-art and
produce up to 75% improved solutions.

that despite the seeming complexity of thermal transport, the thermal
diffusivity $\alpha$ of liquids and supercritical fluids has a lower bound
which is fixed by fundamental physical constants for each system as
$\alpha_m=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{m_em}}$, where $m_e$ and $m$ are

diffusivity has an absolute lower bound dependent on $\hbar$ and the

with the fundamental lower limit of kinematic viscosity $\nu_m$. Consistent
with experiments, this points to a universal lower bound for two distinct
properties, energy and momentum diffusion, and a surprising correlation between
the two transport mechanisms at their minima. We observe that $\alpha_m$ gives
the minimum on the phase diagram except in the vicinity of the critical point,

Reader for Factoid Question Answering. This model enhances the question
answering system in the multi-document scenario from three aspects: model
structure, optimization goal, and training method, corresponding to Multilayer
Attention (MA), Cross Evidence (CE), and Adversarial Training (AT)
respectively. First, we propose a multilayer attention network to obtain a
better representation of the evidences. The multilayer attention mechanism
conducts interaction between the question and the passage within each layer,
making the token representation of evidences in each layer takes the
requirement of the question into account. Second, we design a cross evidence
strategy to choose the answer span within more evidences. We improve the
optimization goal, considering all the answers' locations in multiple evidences
as training targets, which leads the model to reason among multiple evidences.
Third, adversarial training is employed to high-level variables besides the
word embedding in our model. A new normalization method is also proposed for
adversarial perturbations so that we can jointly add perturbations to several
target variables. As an effective regularization method, adversarial training
enhances the model's ability to process noisy data. Combining these three
strategies, we enhance the contextual representation and locating ability of
our model, which could synthetically extract the answer span from several
evidences. We perform SRQA on the WebQA dataset, and experiments show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art models (the best fuzzy score of our
model is up to 78.56%, with an improvement of about 2%).

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2001.01906",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we would like to investigate optimal wireless streaming of a
multi-quality tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) video from a server to multiple
users. To this end, we propose to maximally exploit potential multicast
opportunities by effectively utilizing characteristics of multi-quality tiled
360 VR videos and computation resources at the users' side. In particular, we
consider two requirements for quality variation in one field-of-view (FoV),
i.e., the absolute smoothness requirement and the relative smoothness
requirement, and two video playback modes, i.e., the direct-playback mode
(without user transcoding) and transcode-playback mode (with user transcoding).
Besides natural multicast opportunities, we introduce two new types of
multicast opportunities, namely, relative smoothness-enabled multicast
opportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between viewing quality and
communications resource consumption, and transcoding-enabled multicast
opportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between computation and
communications resource consumptions. Then, we establish a novel mathematical
model that reflects the impacts of natural, relative smoothness-enabled and
transcoding-enabled multicast opportunities on the average transmission energy
and transcoding energy. Based on this model, we optimize the transmission
resource allocation, playback quality level selection and transmission quality
level selection to minimize the energy consumption in the four cases with
different requirements for quality variation and video playback modes. By
comparing the optimal values in the four cases, we prove that the energy
consumption reduces when more multicast opportunities can be utilized. Finally,
numerical results show substantial gains of the proposed solutions over
existing schemes, and demonstrate the importance of effective exploitation of
the three types of multicast opportunities.

new tasks even with a few training samples. However, there is still a dark side
about meta learning in terms of reliability and robustness. In particular, is
meta learning vulnerable to adversarial attacks? In other words, would a
well-trained meta learner utilize its learned experience to build wrong or
likely useless knowledge, if an adversary unnoticeably manipulates the given
training set? Without the understanding of this problem, it is extremely risky
to apply meta learning in safety-critical applications. Thus, in this paper, we
perform the initial study about adversarial attacks on meta learning under the

algorithm against meta learning under various settings. We evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed attacking strategy as well as the robustness of
several representative meta learning algorithms. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy can easily break the meta

between segments, and to select critical subsets for training machine learning
models. Exact and approximate segmentation methods for $k$-segmentation exist
in the literature. Each of these algorithms occupies a different spot in the
trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. A novel heuristic
algorithm is proposed in this paper to improve upon existing methods. It is
empirically found to provide accuracies competitive with exact methods at a
fraction of the computational expense.
  The new algorithm is inspired by Lloyd's algorithm for K-Means and Lloyd-Max
algorithm for scalar quantization, and is called the LM algorithm for
convenience. It works by iteratively minimizing a cost function from any given
initialisation; the commonly used $L_2$ cost is chosen in this paper. While the
greedy minimization makes the algorithm sensitive to initialisation, the
ability to converge from any initial guess to a local optimum allows the
algorithm to be integrated into other existing algorithms. Three variants of
the algorithm are tested over a large number of synthetic datasets, one being a
standalone LM implementation, and two others that combine with existing
algorithms. One of the latter two -- LM-enhanced-Bottom-Up segmentation -- is
found to have the best accuracy and the lowest computational complexity among
all algorithms. This variant of LM can provide $k$-segmentations over data sets

which was recently proposed by Xu {\it et al.} (Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 79}, 708
(2019)). In this theory of gravity, the action contains an arbitrary function
$f(Q,T)$ where $Q$ is non-metricity and $T$ is the trace of energy-momentum
tensor for matter fluid. In our research, we have taken the function $f(Q,T)$
quadratic in $Q$ and linear in $T$ as $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+\beta Q^{2}+\gamma T$
where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are model parameters, motivated by
$f(R,T)$ gravity. We have obtained the various cosmological parameters in
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-walker (FLRW) Universe viz. Hubble parameter $H$,
deceleration parameter $q$ etc. in terms of scale-factor as well as in terms of
redshift $z$ by constraining energy-conservation law. For observational
constraints on the model, we have obtained the best-fit values of model
parameters using the available data sets like Hubble data sets $H(z)$, Joint
Light Curve Analysis (JLA) data sets and union $2.1$ compilation of SNe Ia data
sets by applying $R^{2}$-test formula. We have calculated the present values of
various observational parameters viz. $H_{0}$, $q_{0}$, $t_{0}$ and statefinder
parameters $(s,r)$, these values are very close to the standard cosmological
models. Also, we have observed that the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows
signature-flipping (transition) point within the range $0.423\leq
z_{t}\leq0.668$ through which it changes its phase from decelerated to
accelerated expanding universe with equation of state (EoS)
$-1.071\leq\omega-0.96$ for $0\leq z\leq3$.

platforms and subjected to algorithmic decision-making, and it has become
increasingly important to ensure fair treatment from these algorithms. In this
work, we investigate gender bias in collaborative-filtering recommender systems
trained on social media data. We develop neural fair collaborative filtering
(NFCF), a practical framework for mitigating gender bias in recommending
sensitive items (e.g. jobs, academic concentrations, or courses of study) using
a pre-training and fine-tuning approach to neural collaborative filtering,
augmented with bias correction techniques. We show the utility of our methods
for gender de-biased career and college major recommendations on the MovieLens
dataset and a Facebook dataset, respectively, and achieve better performance
and fairer behavior than several state-of-the-art models.

scalability and maintainability. These systems produce recommendations in two
steps: (i) multiple nominators preselect a small number of items from a large
pool using cheap-to-compute item embeddings; (ii) with a richer set of
features, a ranker rearranges the nominated items and serves them to the user.
A key challenge of this setup is that optimal performance of each stage in
isolation does not imply optimal global performance. In response to this issue,
Ma et al. (2020) proposed a nominator training objective importance weighted by
the ranker's probability of recommending each item. In this work, we focus on
the complementary issue of exploration. Modeled as a contextual bandit problem,
we find LinUCB (a near optimal exploration strategy for single-stage systems)
may lead to linear regret when deployed in two-stage recommenders. We therefore
propose a method of synchronising the exploration strategies between the ranker
and the nominators. Our algorithm only relies on quantities already computed by
standard LinUCB at each stage and can be implemented in three lines of
additional code. We end by demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm
experimentally.

consider some practically relevant restrictions, for which we establish

  text overlap with arXiv:2008.09148",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Substitute model black box attacks can create adversarial examples for a
target model just by accessing its output labels. This poses a major challenge
to machine learning models in practice, particularly in security sensitive
applications. The 01 loss model is known to be more robust to outliers and
noise than convex models that are typically used in practice. Motivated by
these properties we present 01 loss linear and 01 loss dual layer neural
network models as a defense against transfer based substitute model black box
attacks. We compare the accuracy of adversarial examples from substitute model
black box attacks targeting our 01 loss models and their convex counterparts
for binary classification on popular image benchmarks. Our 01 loss dual layer
neural network has an adversarial accuracy of 66.2%, 58%, 60.5%, and 57% on
MNIST, CIFAR10, STL10, and ImageNet respectively whereas the sigmoid activated
logistic loss counterpart has accuracies of 63.5%, 19.3%, 14.9%, and 27.6%.
Except for MNIST the convex counterparts have substantially lower adversarial
accuracies. We show practical applications of our models to deter traffic sign
and facial recognition adversarial attacks. On GTSRB street sign and CelebA
facial detection our 01 loss network has 34.6% and 37.1% adversarial accuracy
respectively whereas the convex logistic counterpart has accuracy 24% and 1.9%.
Finally we show that our 01 loss network can attain robustness on par with
simple convolutional neural networks and much higher than its convex
counterpart even when attacked with a convolutional network substitute model.
Our work shows that 01 loss models offer a powerful defense against substitute
model black box attacks.

the discharge power. This paper is devoted to the experimental and numerical
studies on titanium target temperature in Argon medium. Numerical simulations
for the target temperature are performed by solving the Heat equation for the
magnetron sputtering system enclosed in Argon filled chamber. The simulations
