which estimates gradients of the data density. The model is built on prior work
on score matching and diffusion probabilistic models. It starts from a Gaussian
white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based
sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. WaveGrad offers a natural way to
trade inference speed for sample quality by adjusting the number of refinement
steps, and bridges the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models
in terms of audio quality. We find that it can generate high fidelity audio
samples using as few as six iterations. Experiments reveal WaveGrad to generate
high fidelity audio, outperforming adversarial non-autoregressive baselines and
matching a strong likelihood-based autoregressive baseline using fewer
sequential operations. Audio samples are available at

be effectively modeled by treating unresolved degrees of freedom as random
fluctuations. However, even when the microscopic governing equations and
qualitative macroscopic behavior are known, it is often difficult to derive a
stochastic model that is consistent with observations. This is especially true
for systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like
Gaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behavior to the dynamics. We
address these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable
stochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using both forward and
adjoint Fokker-Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form
of the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide
an appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can effectively
learn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear
Langevin equation forced by colored noise and approximating the second-order
dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding
first-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply the proposed method to
experimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the
statistical behavior of the center of pressure can be described by the dynamics
of the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.

three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations starting soon after the SN
event and following the evolution of the system in the circumstellar medium

the physical scenario of a SNR. Here we focused the analysis on the case of a
progenitor red supergiant of 19.8 M_sun. We also investigated how a
post-explosion large-scale anisotropy in the SN affects the ejecta distribution
and the matter mixing of heavy elements in the remnant, during the first 5000
years of evolution. In the case of a spherically symmetric SN explosion without
large-scale anisotropies, the remnant roughly keeps memory of the original
onion-like layering of ejecta soon after the SN event. Nevertheless, as the
reverse shock hits the ejecta, the element distribution departs from a
homologous expansion, because of the slowing down of the outermost ejecta
layers due to interaction with the reverse shock. In the case of a large-scale
anisotropy developed after the SN, we found that the chemical stratification in
the ejecta can be strongly modified and the original onion-like layering is not
preserved. The anisotropy may cause spatial inversion of ejecta layers, for
instance leading to Fe/Si-rich ejecta outside the O shell, and may determine
the formation of Fe/Si-rich jet-like features that may protrude the remnant
outline. The level of matter mixing and the properties of the jet-like feature
are sensitive to the initial physical (density and velocity) and geometrical
(size and position) initial characteristics of the anisotropy.

precipitation mainly occurring during austral summer, between December and
April 1966-2015. The aim of this study is to classify the main weather regimes
derived from sea level pressure, surface wind speed, 500 or 250 hPa
geopotential heights, in order to measure their influence on precipitation
anomalies and determine if they can be considered sources of predictability of
rainfall in this region. Four weather regimes were found to optimally describe
atmospheric circulation in the study area and for each of the four levels
described above. Using daily precipitation data from a network of 161
meteorological stations across the region, the rainfall anomalies associated
with each weather regime were quantified. They are coherent with the direction
of flow derived from pressure and geopotential anomalies, bringing humid air
masses from the Amazon Basin or the Pacific. The transitions between the
different regimes are also coherent, representing transitions to and from
similar regimes. A few negative and significant trends in the persistence of
different regimes were detected, most likely linked to the absence of
anthropogenic warming in the Antarctic as opposed to the Arctic. Finally, two
of the regimes derived from surface wind speed exhibit a negative and
significant trend in its frequency of occurrence, determining a precipitation
decrease in the south of the study area (28-30 S), which can be compared with
the Megadrought experienced in central Chile.

post-training via transform quantization. Previous CNN quantization techniques
tend to ignore the joint statistics of weights and activations, producing
sub-optimal CNN performance at a given quantization bit-rate, or consider their
joint statistics during training only and do not facilitate efficient
compression of already trained CNN models. We optimally transform (decorrelate)
and quantize the weights post-training using a rate-distortion framework to
improve compression at any given quantization bit-rate. Transform quantization
unifies quantization and dimensionality reduction (decorrelation) techniques in
a single framework to facilitate low bit-rate compression of CNNs and efficient
inference in the transform domain. We first introduce a theory of rate and
distortion for CNN quantization, and pose optimum quantization as a
rate-distortion optimization problem. We then show that this problem can be
solved using optimal bit-depth allocation following decorrelation by the
optimal End-to-end Learned Transform (ELT) we derive in this paper. Experiments
demonstrate that transform quantization advances the state of the art in CNN
compression in both retrained and non-retrained quantization scenarios. In
particular, we find that transform quantization with retraining is able to
compress CNN models such as AlexNet, ResNet and DenseNet to very low bit-rates

examine the performance of CSS over time-varying channels whose gain may change
during the reception of a LoRa frame. This is in contrast to the usually

throughout a frame. Specifically, we investigate the effects of exponentially
correlated Rayleigh fading on the frame-error rate of a CSS receiver in which
the channel gain is estimated at the beginning of each frame. Our primary
observation is that over rapidly-varying channels, the robustness benefits of
the larger spreading factors tend to disappear as the payload size grows. This
observation, which is contrary to the common perception that higher spreading
factors necessarily provide greater immunity against noise, highlights the need
to consider channel characteristics and payload sizes in allocating the

wirelessly during its journey through the GIT, inside the body of the patient.
These images are used to implement an effective and computationally efficient

algorithm further aims to classify the diseased tissues into various GIT
diseases that are commonly known to be affecting the tract. In this manuscript,
the descriptor used for the detection of the interest points is Speeded Up

images which is converted to CIELAB space colours for better identification.
The features extracted at the interest points are then used to train and test a
Support Vector Machine (SVM), so that it automatically classifies the images
into normal or abnormal and further detects the specific abnormalities. SVM,
along with a few parameters, gives a very high accuracy of 94.58% while
classifying normal and abnormal images and an accuracy of 82.91% while
classifying into multi-class. The present work is an improvement on the
previously reported analyses which were only limited to the bi-class

major solution to overcome millimeter-wave (mmWave)'s high propagation

in RIS-aided communication is still a major concern due to the passive nature

multiple-output (MIMO) system. As a consequence, user tracking has not been
analyzed yet. This paper is the first work that addresses channel estimation,
beamforming, and user tracking under practical mmWave RIS-MIMO systems. By
providing the mathematical relation of RIS design with a MIMO system, a
three-stage framework is presented. Starting with estimating the channel
between a base station (BS) and RIS using hierarchical beam searching, followed
by estimating the channel between RIS and user using an iterative resolution
algorithm. Lastly, a popular tracking algorithm is employed to track channel
parameters between the RIS and the user. System analysis demonstrates the
robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-time
scenarios.

pairs of MG parameters, but here, we explore constraints on one parameter at a
time while fixing the other at its GR value. This allows us to analyze various
models while benefiting from a stronger constraining power from the data. We
also explore which specific datasets are in tension with GR. We find that
models with ($\mu=1$, $\eta$) and ($\mu$, $\eta=1$) exhibit a 3.9-$\sigma$ and
3.8-$\sigma$ departure from GR when using Planck18+SNe+BAO, while ($\mu$,
$\eta$) shows a tension of 3.4-$\sigma$. We find no tension with GR for models
with the MG parameter $\Sigma$ fixed to its GR value. Using a Bayesian model
selection analysis, we find that some one-parameter MG models are moderately
favored over $\Lambda$CDM when using all dataset combinations except Planck CMB
Lensing and DES data. Namely, Planck18 shows a moderate tension with GR that
only increases when adding any combination of RSD, SNe, or BAO. However, adding
lensing diminishes or removes these tensions, which can be attributed to the
ability of lensing in constraining the MG parameter $\Sigma$. The two overall
groups of datasets are found to have a dichotomy when performing consistency
tests with GR, which may be due to systematic effects, lack of constraining
power, or modelling. These findings warrant further investigation using more
precise data from ongoing and future surveys.

  hole merger GW190521","39 pages, 13 figures; data available at
  https://dcc.ligo.org/P2000158-v4/public","Astrophys. J. Lett. 900, L13 (2020)","10.3847/2041-8213/aba493","LIGO-P2000021","astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole
merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses,
$85^{+21}_{-14}\,M_{\odot}$ and $66^{+17}_{-18}\,M_{\odot}$, compared to
previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital
precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational)
pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range $65 -
120\,M_{\odot}$. The probability that at least one of the black holes in
GW190521 is in that range is 99.0%. The final mass of the merger
$(142^{+28}_{-16}\,M_{\odot})$ classifies it as an intermediate-mass black
hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular binary black hole coalescence,
we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its
post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three
different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions
of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of
strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of
coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical
predictions. We estimate the merger rate of similar systems to be
$0.13^{+0.30}_{-0.11}\,{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. We discuss the
astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse, and for the
possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through
various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescence, or via hierarchical
merger of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei.
We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a
lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible
sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a
primordial black hole binary.

varieties over the function field of a curve over an algebraically closed
field, and asked about an generalization to higher dimensional bases. In this
paper we answer Beilinson's question by constructing a pairing for varieties
defined over the function field of a smooth variety $B$ over an algebraically
closed field, with values in the second $\ell$-adic cohomology group of $B$.
Over $\Bbb C$ our pairing is in fact $\Bbb Q$-valued, and in general we
speculate about its geometric origin.

consists in determining the pipe diameters of a water network such that

Traditionally, such design decisions are made on the basis of expert
experience. When networks increase in size, however, rules of thumb will rarely
lead to near optimal decisions. Over the past thirty years, a large number of
techniques have been developed to tackle the problem of optimally designing a
water distribution network. In this paper, we tackle the NP-hard water
distribution network design (WDND) optimization problem in a multi-period
setting where time varying demand patterns occur. We propose a new
simulation-based iterated local search metaheuristic which further explores the
structure of the problem in an attempt to obtain high quality solutions.
Computational experiments show that our approach is very competitive as it is
able to improve over a state-of-the-art metaheuristic for most of the performed
tests. Furthermore, it converges much faster to low cost solutions and
demonstrates a more robust performance in that it obtains smaller deviations

galaxy biasing. In this paper we present a detailed test and calibration of the
matter bispectrum counterterms in the Effective Field Theory of LSS against a
suite of $N$-body simulations. We are going beyond previous studies in
employing realisation based perturbation theory that allows for a significant
reduction in cosmic variance error bars. This enables the measurement of the
low-energy constants on large scales before two-loop corrections become
relevant, around $k<0.09 h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$. We also go beyond
previous work in using bispectrum propagator terms, i.e. correlators with
linear and second order fields, to quantify the two new counterterms in
isolation and to establish consistency with the power spectrum counterterm. By
investigating the fully non-linear bispectrum, $B_{\mathrm{nnn}}$, as well as
the terms $B_{\mathrm{n}11}$ and $B_{\mathrm{n}21}$, we find evidence for the
new counterterms deviating from the shape suggested by the UV-limit of the
relevant bispectrum contributions. We also show that the commonly used
Einstein-de Sitter approximation for the time dependence of the tree-level
bispectrum is insufficient for precise studies of the one-loop bispectrum and
that it is necessary to use $\Lambda$CDM growth factors in order to obtain
meaningful one-loop counterterm constraints. Finally, we also find evidence for
small deviations in the growth factors that arise from time integration
inaccuracies in the $N$-body simulations.

large-amplitude fringes and new algorithms including Asymmetric Least Square

clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The STO2 data reduction
software efficiently reduced the amplitude of fringes from a few hundred to 10
K and resulted in baselines of amplitude down to a few K. The Level 1 products
typically have the noise of a few K in [CII] spectra and ~1 K in [NII] spectra.
Using a regridding algorithm, we made spectral maps of star-forming regions and
the Galactic plane survey using an algorithm employing a Bessel-Gaussian

that violate the bonus $U(1)_Y$ charge by a maximum of $2(n-4)$ units. We will
demonstrate that such correlators satisfy $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-covariant
recursion relations that relate $n$-point correlators to $(n-1)$-point
correlators in a manner analogous to the soft dilaton relations that relate the
corresponding amplitudes in flat-space type IIB superstring theory. These
recursion relations are used to determine terms in the large-$N$ expansion of
$n$-point maximal $U(1)_Y$-violating correlators in the chiral sector,
including correlators with four superconformal stress tensor primaries and
$(n-4)$ chiral Lagrangian operators, starting from known properties of the
$n=4$ case. We concentrate on the first three orders in $1/N$ beyond the
supergravity limit. The Mellin representations of the correlators are
polynomials in Mellin variables, which correspond to higher derivative contact
terms in the low-energy expansion of type IIB superstring theory in $AdS_5

constant dependence of these terms is found to be described by non-holomorphic
modular forms with holomorphic and anti-holomorphic weights $(n-4,4-n)$ that

representation is realized as a finite sum of averages of wavelet projections
of either cancellative or noncancellative type, which are themselves
Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. Both properties are out of reach for the
established dyadic-probabilistic technique. Unlike their dyadic counterparts,
our representation reflects the additional kernel smoothness of the operator
being analyzed.
  Our representation formulas lead naturally to a new family of $T(1)$ theorems
on weighted Sobolev spaces whose smoothness index is naturally related to
kernel smoothness. In the one parameter case, we obtain the Sobolev space
analogue of the $A_2$ theorem; that is, sharp dependence of the Sobolev norm of
$T$ on the weight characteristic is obtained in the full range of exponents. In
the bi-parametric setting, where local average sparse domination is not
generally available, we obtain quantitative $A_p$ estimates which are best
known, and sharp in the range $\max\{p,p'\}\geq 3$ for the fully cancellative

that have been observed to repeat and those that have not. There is tentative
evidence that the bursts from repeating sources have different properties than
the non-repeating ones. In order to determine the occurrence rate of repeating
sources and characterize the nature of repeat emission, we have been conducting
sensitive searches for repetitions from bursts detected with the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope,
using the recently commissioned Ultra-wideband Low (UWL) receiver system, over
a band spanning 0.7$-$4.0 GHz. We report the detection of a repeat burst from
the source of FRB 20190711A. The detected burst is 1 ms wide and has a
bandwidth of just 65 MHz. We find no evidence of any emission in the remaining
part of the 3.3 GHz UWL band. While the emission bandwidths of the ASKAP and
UWL bursts show $\nu^{-4}$ scaling consistent with a propagation effect, the
spectral occupancy is inconsistent with diffractive scintillation. This
detection rules out models predicting broad-band emission from the FRB
20190711A source and puts stringent constraints on the emission mechanism. The
low spectral occupancy highlights the importance of sub-banded search methods
in detecting FRBs.

the processes within a cell. Understanding how GRNs manage to consistently
perform a particular function constitutes a key question in cell biology. GRNs
are frequently modeled as Boolean networks, which are intuitive, simple to
describe, and can yield qualitative results even when data is sparse.
  We generate an expandable database of published, expert-curated Boolean GRN
models, and extracted the rules governing these networks. A meta-analysis of
this diverse set of models enables us to identify fundamental design principles
of GRNs.
  The biological term canalization reflects a cell's ability to maintain a
stable phenotype despite ongoing environmental perturbations. Accordingly,
Boolean canalizing functions are functions where the output is already
determined if a specific variable takes on its canalizing input, regardless of
all other inputs. We provide a detailed analysis of the prevalence of
canalization and show that most rules describing the regulatory logic are
highly canalizing. Independent from this, we also find that most rules exhibit
a high level of redundancy. An analysis of the prevalence of small network
motifs, e.g. feed-forward loops or feedback loops, in the wiring diagram of the
identified models reveals several highly abundant types of motifs, as well as a
surprisingly high overabundance of negative regulations in complex feedback
loops. Lastly, we provide the strongest evidence thus far in favor of the
hypothesis that GRNs operate at the critical edge between order and chaos.

assets is vital to pricing options. Rough stochastic volatility models, such as
the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6),
887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that
the log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small
Hurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of
asset prices and option-derived price data indicate that $H$ often takes values
close to $0.1$ or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change
improves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset
prices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of
the driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe
challenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational
practice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution
of the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only
$H$. We prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak convergence of the Euler method for
the rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function
of the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one
for the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro
expansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is
further supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a
first step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats
the volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian
motion.

exist privacy-preserving methods with good theoretical guarantees to solve this

that it is the additive error which dictates the practical performance of these

error then previous works. For input datasets with cardinality $n$ and diameter
$\Delta$, our algorithm has an $O(\Delta^2 (k \log^2 n

working out the QED perturbation theory for quasidegenerate states. The
contributions of all the Feynman diagrams up to the second order are taken into

framework of the extended Furry picture to all orders in the nuclear-strength

considered within the Breit approximation. The nuclear recoil effect is

The most accurate theoretical predictions for the binding and excitation

while wearable gloves severely restrict movement and infringe on daily life.
Methods: This paper proposes the use of RF sensors for HCI applications serving
the Deaf community. A multi-frequency RF sensor network is used to acquire
non-invasive, non-contact measurements of ASL signing irrespective of lighting
conditions. The unique patterns of motion present in the RF data due to the
micro-Doppler effect are revealed using time-frequency analysis with the
Short-Time Fourier Transform. Linguistic properties of RF ASL data are
investigated using machine learning (ML). Results: The information content,
measured by fractal complexity, of ASL signing is shown to be greater than that
of other upper body activities encountered in daily living. This can be used to
differentiate daily activities from signing, while features from RF data show
that imitation signing by non-signers is 99\% differentiable from native ASL
signing. Feature-level fusion of RF sensor network data is used to achieve
72.5\% accuracy in classification of 20 native ASL signs. Implications: RF
sensing can be used to study dynamic linguistic properties of ASL and design
Deaf-centric smart environments for non-invasive, remote recognition of ASL. ML
algorithms should be benchmarked on native, not imitation, ASL data.

memory. It can simultaneously store many memories by using spinful bosons
coupled to a degenerate multimode optical cavity. The associative memory is
realized by a confocal cavity QED neural network, with the cavity modes serving
as the synapses, connecting a network of superradiant atomic spin ensembles,
which serve as the neurons. Memories are encoded in the connectivity matrix
between the spins, and can be accessed through the input and output of patterns
of light. Each aspect of the scheme is based on recently demonstrated
technology using a confocal cavity and Bose-condensed atoms. Our scheme has two
conceptually novel elements. First, it introduces a new form of random spin
system that interpolates between a ferromagnetic and a spin-glass regime as a
physical parameter is tuned---the positions of ensembles within the cavity.
Second, and more importantly, the spins relax via deterministic
steepest-descent dynamics, rather than Glauber dynamics. We show that this
nonequilibrium quantum-optical scheme has significant advantages for
associative memory over Glauber dynamics: These dynamics can enhance the
network's ability to store and recall memories beyond that of the standard
Hopfield model. Surprisingly, the cavity QED dynamics can retrieve memories
even when the system is in the spin glass phase. Thus, the experimental
platform provides a novel physical instantiation of associative memories and
spin glasses as well as provides an unusual form of relaxational dynamics that
is conducive to memory recall even in regimes where it was thought to be
impossible.

superconducting instabilities of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). In this
approach, bosonic fluctuations associated with an emergent SU(4) symmetry,
corresponding to combined rotations in valley and spin spaces, couple to the
low-energy fermions that comprise the flat bands. These fluctuations are peaked
at zero wave-vector, reflecting the ""ferromagnetic-like"" SU(4) ground state
recently found in strong-coupling solutions of microscopic models for TBG.
Focusing on electronic states related to symmetry-imposed points of the Fermi
surface, dubbed here ""valley hot-spots"" and ""van Hove hot-spots"", we find that
the coupling to the itinerant electrons partially lifts the huge degeneracy of
the ferro-SU(4) ground state manifold, favoring inter-valley order, spin-valley
coupled order, ferromagnetic order, spin-current order, and valley-polarized
order, depending on details of the band structure. These fluctuations, in turn,
promote attractive pairing interactions in a variety of closely competing
channels, including a nodeless $f$-wave state, a nodal $i$-wave state, and
topological $d+id$ and $p+ip$ states with unusual Chern numbers $2$ and $4$,
respectively. Nematic superconductivity, although not realized as a primary
instability of the system, still appears as a consequence of the
near-degeneracy of superconducting order parameters that transform as
one-dimensional and two-dimensional irreducible representations of the point
group $D_{6}$.

Eddington-limit for electron scattering causing the increase in opacity
associated with iron at $T\approx180,000\,$K to trigger supersonic convection
in their outer envelopes. Three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations
by Jiang and collaborators with the Athena++ computational tool have found
order of magnitude density and radiative flux fluctuations in these convective
regions, even at optical depths $\gg100$. We show here that radiation can
diffuse out of a parcel during the timescale of convection in these optically
thick parts of the star, motivating our use of a ""pseudo"" Mach number to
characterize both the fluctuation amplitudes and their correlations. In this
first paper, we derive the impact of these fluctuations on the radiative
pressure gradient needed to carry a given radiative luminosity. This
implementation leads to a remarkable improvement between 1D and 3D radiative
pressure gradients, and builds confidence in our path to an eventual 1D
implementation of these intrinsically 3D envelopes. However, simply reducing
the radiation pressure gradient is not enough to implement a new 1D model.
Rather, we must also account for the impact of two other aspects of turbulent
convection: the substantial pressure, and the ability to transport an
appreciable fraction of the luminosity, which will be addressed in upcoming
works. This turbulent convection also arises in other instances where the
stellar luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. Hence, our effort
should apply to other astrophysical situations where an opacity peak arises in
a near Eddington limited, radiation pressure dominated plasma.

The expectation was that, upon returning to the pericenter, the stellar-debris

TDEs were discovered in this energy band. A common explanation for the
optical/UV events is that surrounding optically-thick matter reprocesses the
disk's X-ray emission and emits it from a large photosphere. If accretion
follows the super-Eddington mass infall rate it would inevitably result in an
energetic outflow, providing naturally the reprocessing matter. We describe
here a new method to estimate, using the observed luminosity and temperature,
the mass and energy of outflows from optical transients. When applying this
method to a sample of supernovae our estimates are consistent with a more
detailed hydrodynamic modeling. For the current sample of a few dozen optical

are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity
gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than
the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide
median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have
flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing
processes: (1) the steady ""puffing"" of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven
potential fluctuations, and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at
late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star
formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out
pre-existing gradients from the ""puffing"" process. We use published results
from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between

a function of one complex variable $w$, dual to the Renyi parameter $n$.
Inspired by the inversion formula of Caron-Huot, we argue that if the Renyi

and violations of it are stringently constrained experimentally. Therefore, the
possibility of Lorentz violation (LV) is usually realized at very high energy
scales, resulting in a strong suppression of it (by the new scale) in
experiments. The Standard-Model Extension (SME) parameterizes LV in a
model-independent way, respecting $SU(2)_L$ gauge invariance. This means, e.g.,
that the neutrino and charged-lepton sectors are linked to each other. Hence,
on the one hand, any modification of neutrino properties simultaneously gives
rise to effects for charged leptons, which is why the tight limits on
flavour-off-diagonal LV for neutrinos imply new bounds on modifications of
charged leptons. On the other hand, LV for left-handed charged leptons implies
LV for neutrinos. Since LV modifications of the charged-lepton sector are, in
general, even more constraining than effects in the flavour-diagonal neutrino
sector, we obtain novel tight bounds on LV in the latter. Subsequently, we
apply the same approach to an analysis of time-of-flight data for neutrinos
(detected by IceCube) and photons from gamma ray bursts where discrepancies
have been observed. Our finding is that an explanation of the arrival time
difference between neutrino and photon events by dim-5 operators in the

We construct higher dimensional generalizations of fracton models that host
extended fractal excitations. Finally, by applying fractalization to a 2D

$x^{3k+1} \log^k(x)$ and $x^{3k+5/2} \log^k(x)$ (for PN compactness parameter

multipole moments also yield nontrivial parts of the 1PN correction to the

biomarker searches. We present new HST and Chandra observations of Barnard's
Star (GJ 699), a 10 Gyr old M3.5 dwarf, acquired as part of the Mega-MUSCLES
program. Despite the old age and long rotation period of Barnard's star, we
observe two FUV ($\delta_{130}$ $\approx$ 5000s; $E_{130}$ $\approx$
10$^{29.5}$ erg each) and one X-ray ($E_{X}$ $\approx$ 10$^{29.2}$ erg) flares,
and estimate a high-energy flare duty cycle (defined here as the fraction of
the time the star is in a flare state) of $\sim$ 25\%. A 5 A - 10 $\mu$m SED of
GJ 699 is created and used to evaluate the atmospheric stability of a
hypothetical, unmagnetized terrestrial planet in the habitable zone ($r_{HZ}$
$\sim$ 0.1 AU). Both thermal and non-thermal escape modeling indicate (1) the
$quiescent$ stellar XUV flux does not lead to strong atmospheric escape:
atmospheric heating rates are comparable to periods of high solar activity on
modern Earth, and (2) the $flare$ environment could drive the atmosphere into a
hydrodynamic loss regime at the observed flare duty cycle: sustained exposure
to the flare environment of GJ 699 results in the loss of $\approx$ 87 Earth
atmospheres Gyr$^{-1}$ through thermal processes and $\approx$ 3 Earth
atmospheres Gyr$^{-1}$ through ion loss processes, respectively. These results
suggest that if rocky planet atmospheres can survive the initial $\sim$ 5 Gyr
of high stellar activity, or if a second generation atmosphere can be formed or
acquired, the flare duty cycle may be the controlling stellar parameter for the
stability of Earth-like atmospheres around old M stars.

that disks with SF clumps at z ~ 0 make a similar fraction (~15%) of
star-forming galaxies as at z ~ 2. The clumpy disk contribution to the SF
budget peaks at z ~ 1, rather than z ~ 2, suggesting that the principal epoch

contribute significantly (~15%) to the SF budget at z ~ 1-2, suggesting that
compaction precedes quenching. Among green valley and quiescent galaxies, the

magnetic fields play a major role in the regulation of angular momentum in star
formation, which directly impacts the formation and evolution of protoplanetary
disks and binary systems. The aim of this paper is to quantify those phenomena
in the presence of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics effects, namely the Ohmic and
ambipola r diffusion. We perform three-dimensional simulations of protostellar
collapses varying the mass of the prestellar dense core, the thermal support
(the $\alpha$ ratio) and the dust grain size-distribu tion. The mass mostly
influences the magnetic braking in the pseudo-disk, while the thermal support
impacts the accretion rate and hence the properties of the disk. Removing the
grains smaller than 0. 1 $\mu$m in the Mathis, Rumpl, Nordsieck (MRN)
distribution enhances the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. Similarly to
previous studies, we find that this change in the distribution reduces the
magnet ic braking with an impact on the disk. The outflow is also significantly
weakened. In either case, the magnetic braking largely dominates the outflow as
a process to remove the angular momentum from t he disk. Finally, we report a
large ionic precursor to the outflow with velocities of several km s$^{-1}$,

This dendrite model is a special case of sparse network. This work suggests

a universal measure of the strength of interactions in quantum systems. This
quantity was conjectured to have a universal lower bound $(1/4\pi)\hbar/k_{B}$,
which indicates a very strongly correlated quantum fluid. By solving the
quantum kinetic theory for a nodal-line semimetal in the hydrodynamic regime,
we show that $\eta/s\propto T$ violates the universal lower bound, scaling
towards zero with decreasing temperature $T$ in the perturbative limit. We find
that the hydrodynamic scattering time between collisions is nearly temperature
independent, up to logarithmic scaling corrections, and can be extremely short
for large nodal lines, near the Mott-Ragel-Ioffe limit. Our finding suggests
that nodal-line semimetals can be very strongly correlated quantum systems.

evolves, we study the underlying mechanism of several existing differentiable
NAS frameworks. Our investigation is motivated by three observed searching
patterns of differentiable NAS: 1) they search by growing instead of pruning;
2) wider networks are more preferred than deeper ones; 3) no edges are selected
in bi-level optimization. To anatomize these phenomena, we propose a unified
view on searching algorithms of existing frameworks, transferring the global
optimization to local cost minimization. Based on this reformulation, we
conduct empirical and theoretical analyses, revealing implicit inductive biases
in the cost's assignment mechanism and evolution dynamics that cause the
observed phenomena. These biases indicate strong discrimination towards certain
topologies. To this end, we pose questions that future differentiable methods
for neural wiring discovery need to confront, hoping to evoke a discussion and
rethinking on how much bias has been enforced implicitly in existing NAS
methods.

comparing the effects of different types of treatment, network models have been
proposed to improve the quality of estimation and hypothesis testing. In this
paper, we focus on efficiently estimating the average treatment effect using an
adaptive randomization procedure in networks. We work on models of causal
frameworks, for which the treatment outcome of a subject is affected by its own
covariate as well as those of its neighbors. Moreover, we consider the case in
which, when we assign treatments to the current subject, only the subnetwork of
existing subjects is revealed. New randomized procedures are proposed to
minimize the mean squared error of the estimated differences between treatment
effects. In network data, it is usually difficult to obtain theoretical
properties because the numbers of nodes and connections increase
simultaneously. Under mild assumptions, our proposed procedure is closely
related to a time-varying inhomogeneous Markov chain. We then use Lyapunov
functions to derive the theoretical properties of the proposed procedures. The
advantages of the proposed procedures are also demonstrated by extensive
simulations and experiments on real network data.

compact spheroids, where a high density of dynamically unstable gas leads to
efficient star formation and black hole accretion. For the one system where we
probe the mass of the gas reservoir, we find a gas fraction of just $0.06 \pm
0.04$ and a depletion timescale of $50 \pm 40$ Myr, suggesting it is

based solutions for registration. Deep learning methods such as PointNetLK and
DCP train end-to-end networks and rely on full supervision (namely, ground

completely unsupervised. Furthermore, SPA's training time and model size are
much less. The effectiveness of the SPA method is demonstrated by experiments

fresh plasma into the compact jet base. Such flares are usually strongest and
appear earlier at shorter radio wavelengths. Hence, VLBI at mm-wavelengths is
best suited to study the earliest structural changes of compact jets associated
with emission flares. We study the morphological changes of the parsec-scale
jet in the nearby (z=0.049) gamma-ray bright radio galaxy 3C111 following a
flare that developed into a major radio outburst in 2007. We analyse three
successive observations of 3C111 at 86 GHz with the Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA)
between 2007 and 2008 which yield a very high angular resolution of ~45muas. In
addition, we make use of single-dish radio flux density measurements from the
F-GAMMA and POLAMI programmes, archival single-dish and VLBI data. We resolve
the flare into multiple plasma components with a distinct morphology resembling
a bend in an otherwise remarkably straight jet. The flare-associated features
move with apparent velocities of ~4.0c to ~4.5c and can be traced also at lower
frequencies in later epochs. Near the base of the jet, we find two bright
features with high brightness temperatures up to ~10^11K, which we associate
with the core and a stationary feature in the jet. The flare led to multiple
new jet components indicative of a dynamic modulation during the ejection. We
interpret the bend-like feature as a direct result of the outburst which makes
it possible to trace the transverse structure of the jet. In this scenario, the
components follow different paths in the jet stream consistent with
expectations for a spine-sheath structure, which is not seen during
intermediate levels of activity. The possibility of coordinated multiwavelength
observations during a future bright radio flare in 3C111 makes this source an
excellent target for probing the radio-gamma-ray connection.

momentum continuously changes from one bearing state to the other. For Coulomb
friction (with random friction coefficients) in two dimensions, a sharp line
separates the two bearing states and we show that this line corresponds to the
minimum cut. Astonishingly however, in three dimensions, intermediate bearing
domains, that are not synchronized with either side, are energetically more
favorable than the minimum-cut surface. Instead of a sharp cut, the steady

of graphs (i.e. classes closed under vertex and edge deletion, and edge
contraction). It in some sense describes the global structure of a graph.
Roughly, a graph has treewidth $k$ if it can be decomposed by a sequence of
noncrossing cutsets of size at most $k$ into pieces of size at most $k+1$. The
study of hereditary graph classes (i.e. those closed under vertex deletion
only) reveals a different picture, where cutsets that are not necessarily
bounded in size (such as star cutsets, 2-joins and their generalization) are
required to decompose the graph into simpler pieces that are structured but not
necessarily bounded in size. A number of such decomposition theorems are known
for complex hereditary graph classes, including even-hole-free graphs, perfect
graphs and others. These theorems do not describe the global structure in the
sense that a tree decomposition does, since the cutsets guaranteed by them are
far from being noncrossing. They are also of limited use in algorithmic
applications.
  We show that in the case of even-hole-free graphs of bounded degree the
cutsets described in the previous paragraph can be partitioned into a bounded
number of well-behaved collections. This allows us to prove that even-hole-free
graphs with bounded degree have bounded treewidth, resolving a conjecture of
Aboulker, Adler, Kim, Sintiari and Trotignon [arXiv:2008.05504]. As a
consequence, it follows that many algorithmic problems can be solved in
polynomial time for this class, and that even-hole-freeness is testable in the
bounded degree graph model of property testing. In fact we prove our results
for a larger class of graphs, namely the class of $C_4$-free odd-signable
graphs with bounded degree.

(VANET), an infrastructure-free mechanism, has emerged as a crucial component
in the advanced Intelligent Transport System (ITS) for special information
transmission and inter-vehicular communications. One of the main research
challenges in VANET is the design and implementation of network routing
protocols which manage to trigger V2X communication with the reliable
end-to-end connectivity and efficient packet transmission. The organically
changing nature of road transport vehicles poses a significant threat to VANET
with respect to the accuracy and reliability of packet delivery. Therefore, a
position-based routing protocol tends to be the predominant method in VANET as
they overcome rapid changes in vehicle movements effectively. However, existing
routing protocols have some limitations such as (i) inaccurate in high dynamic
network topology, (ii) defective link-state estimation (iii) poor movement
prediction in heterogeneous road layouts. In this paper, a target-driven and
mobility prediction (TDMP) based routing protocol is therefore developed for
high-speed mobility and dynamic topology of vehicles, fluctuant traffic flow
and diverse road layouts in VANET. The primary idea in TDMP is that the
destination target of a driver is included in the mobility prediction to assist
the implementation of the routing protocol. Compared to existing geographic
routing protocols which mainly greedily forward the packet to the next-hop
based on its current position and partial road layout, TDMP is developed to
enhance the packet transmission with the consideration of the estimation of
inter-vehicles link status, and the prediction of vehicle positions dynamically
in fluctuant mobility and global road layout.

  Expansion -- Applications in Electromagnetics","PhD thesis",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea of the modal expansion in electromagnetics is derived from the
research on electromagnetic resonators, which play an essential role in
developments in nanophotonics. All of the electromagnetic resonators share a
common property: they possess a discrete set of special frequencies that show
up as peaks in scattering spectra and are called resonant modes. These resonant
modes are soon recognized to dictate the interaction between electromagnetic
resonators and light. This leads to a hypothesis that the optical response of
resonators is the synthesis of the excitation of each physical-resonance-state
in the system: Under the excitation of external pulses, these resonant modes
are initially loaded, then release their energy which contributes to the total
optical responses of the resonators. These resonant modes with complex
frequencies are known in the literature as the Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM).
Mathematically, these QNMs correspond to solutions of the eigenvalue problem of
source-free Maxwell's equations. In the case where the optical structure of
resonators is unbounded and the media are dispersive (and possibly anisotropic
and non-reciprocal) this requires solving non-linear (in frequency) and
non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. Thus, the whole problem boils down to the
study of the spectral theory for electromagnetic Maxwell operators. As a
result, modal expansion formalisms have recently received a lot of attention in
photonics because of their capabilities to model the physical properties in the
natural resonance-state basis of the considered system, leading to a
transparent interpretation of the numerical results. This manuscript is
intended to extend the study of QNM expansion formalism, in particular, and
nonlinear spectral theory, in general. At the same time, several numerical
modelings are provided as examples for the application of modal expansion in
computations.

of flavors $N$ of massless two-component Dirac fermions. This lattice system
displays signatures of criticality in gauge observables, without any
fine-tuning of couplings and can be studied without Monte Carlo critical
slow-down. By coupling exactly massless fermion sources to the lattice gauge
model, we demonstrate that non-trivial anomalous dimensions are induced in
fermion bilinears depending on the dimensionless electric charge of the
fermion. We present a proof-of-principle lattice computation of the
Wilson-coefficients of various fermion bilinear three-point functions. Finally,
by mapping the charge $q$ of fermion in the model to a flavor $N$ in massless

evidence of self-duality of $N=2$ QED$_3$.

  Visible Image Fusion Method","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2003.09210",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Infrared and visible image fusion, as a hot topic in image processing and
image enhancement, aims to produce fused images retaining the detail texture
information in visible images and the thermal radiation information in infrared
images. A critical step for this issue is to decompose features in different
scales and to merge them separately. In this paper, we propose a novel
dual-stream auto-encoder (AE) based fusion network. The core idea is that the
encoder decomposes an image into base and detail feature maps with low- and
high-frequency information, respectively, and that the decoder is responsible
for the original image reconstruction. To this end, a well-designed loss
function is established to make the base/detail feature maps
similar/dissimilar. In the test phase, base and detail feature maps are
respectively merged via an additional fusion layer, which contains a saliency
weighted-based spatial attention module and a channel attention module to
adaptively preserve more information from source images and to highlight the
objects. Then the fused image is recovered by the decoder. Qualitative and
quantitative results demonstrate that our method can generate fusion images
containing highlighted targets and abundant detail texture information with
strong reproducibility and meanwhile is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches.

  hierarchical, simulation tool, TRIDENS","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The efficiency of nanoparticle (NP) solar cells has grown impressively in
recent years, exceeding 16%. However, the carrier mobility in NP solar cells,
and in other optoelectronic applications remains low, thus critically limiting
their performance. Therefore, carrier transport in NP solids needs to be better
understood to further improve the overall efficiency of NP solar cell
technology. However, it is technically challenging to simulate experimental
scale samples, as physical processes from atomic to mesoscopic scales all
crucially impact transport. To rise to this challenge, here we report the
development of TRIDENS: the Transport in Defected Nanoparticle Solids
Simulator, that adds three more hierarchical layers to our previously developed
HINTS code for nanoparticle solar cells. In TRIDENS, we first introduced planar
defects, such as twin planes and grain boundaries into individual NP SLs that
comprised the order of 10^3 NPs. Then we used HINTS to simulate the transport
across tens of thousands of defected NP SLs, and constructed the distribution
of the NP SL mobilities with planar defects. Second, the defected NP SLs were
assembled into a resistor network with more than 10^4 NP SLs, thus representing
about 10^7 individual NPs. Finally, the TRIDENS results were analyzed by finite
size scaling to explore whether the percolation transition, separating the
phase where the low mobility defected NP SLs percolate, from the phase where
the high mobility undefected NP SLs percolate drives a
low-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover that can be extrapolated to
macroscopic length scales. For the theoretical description, we adapted the
Efros-Shklovskii bimodal mobility distribution percolation model. We
demonstrated that the ES bimodal theory's two-variable scaling function is an
effective tool to quantitatively characterize this
low-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover.

distances to the southern terminus of the NPS and toward latitudes ranging up
to 55$^{\circ}$. First, we fit for the distance and extinction to stars toward
the NPS using optical and near-infrared photometry and Gaia DR2 astrometry. We
model these per-star distance-extinction estimates as being caused by dust
screens at unknown distances, which we fit for using a nested sampling
algorithm. We then compare the extinction to the Spur derived from our 3D dust
modelling with integrated independent measures from XMM-Newton X-ray absorption
and HI column density measures. We find that we can account for nearly 100% of
the total column density of the NPS as lying within 140 pc for latitudes
$>26^{\circ}$ and within 700 pc for latitudes $< 11^{\circ}$. Based on the
results, we conclude that the NPS is not associated with the Galactic Centre or
the Fermi bubbles. Instead, it is likely associated, especially at higher

several prospective longitudinal cohort studies were conducted in the U.S., in

the cognitive development of the offspring was assessed from early childhood

estimates of the effects of PAE by fitting regression models that adjust for
potential confounding variables using propensity scores. The correlation matrix
characterizing the dependence between the endpoint-specific dose-response

incomplete information on some endpoints. We also compare and discuss

human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to fine-tune a

There are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised learning.
Thus, a number of internal evaluations, which use predicted labels and data,
have been created. They are also named internal cluster validity indices
(CVIs). Without true labels, to design an effective CVI is not simple because
it is similar to create a clustering method. And, to have more CVIs is crucial
because there is no universal CVI that can be used to measure all datasets, and
no specific method for selecting a proper CVI for clusters without true labels.
Therefore, to apply more CVIs to evaluate clustering results is necessary. In
this paper, we propose a novel CVI - called Distance-based Separability Index

quantum processors and provide an important way to entangle qubits. For
fixed-frequency qubits using the cross-resonance entangling technique, using
the higher-frequency qubit to control the lower-frequency qubit enables much
shorter entangling times than using the lower-frequency qubit as the control.
Consequently, when implementing a CNOT gate where logical control by the
lower-frequency qubit is needed, compilers may implement this functionality by
using an equivalent circuit such as placing Hadamard gates on both qubits
before and after a CNOT gate controlled by the higher-frequency qubit. However,
since the implementation is different depending on which qubit is the control,
a natural question arises regarding the relative performance of the
implementations. We have explored this using quantum processors on the IBM Q
network. The basic circuit used consisted of operations to create a Bell State,
followed by the inverse operations so as to return the qubits to their initial
state in the absence of errors (Hadamard + CNOT + barrier + CNOT + Hadamard).
The circuit depth was varied using multiples of this basic circuit. An
asymmetry in the error of the final state was observed that increased with the
circuit depth. The strength and direction of the asymmetry was unique but
repeatable for each pair of coupled qubits tested. This observation suggests
that the asymmetry in CNOT implementation should be characterized for the
qubits of interest and incorporated into circuit transpilation to obtain the
best accuracy for a particular computation.

Through the critical lens of construct validity, we validate the proposed

H2:CO:15N2 ice analogs of the CO-rich layer when exposed to similar fluences to
those expected from the cosmic-ray-induced secondary electrons and UV photons

2 keV electron irradiation: CO2, C2O (and other carbon chainoxides), CH4, H2CO,
H2C2O, and H15NCO. The total product abundances corresponded to 5-10% of the
initial CO molecules exposed to the electron irradiation. Ly-alpha photon
irradiation delivered 1-2 orders of magnitude lower yields with a similar
product branching ratio, which may be due to the low UV-photon absorption
cross-section of the ice sample at this wavelength. Formation of additional
N-bearing species, namely C215N2 and 15NH3, was only observed in the absence of
H2 and CO molecules, respectively, suggesting that reactants derived from H2

its dissociation products. In summary, ice chemistry induced by energetic
processing of the CO-rich apolar ice layer provides alternative formation
pathways for several species detected in the interstellar medium, including
some related to the complex organic molecule chemistry. Further quantification

circular and traces are now rotated by a random cyclic shift. Trace
reconstruction is related to many computational biology problems studying DNA,
which is a primary motivation for this problem as well, as many types of DNA
are known to be circular.
  Our main results are as follows. First, we prove that we can reconstruct
arbitrary circular strings of length $n$ using
$\exp\big(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})\big)$ traces for any constant deletion probability
$q$, as long as $n$ is prime or the product of two primes. For $n$ of this
form, this nearly matches what was the best known bound of
$\exp\big(O(n^{1/3})\big)$ for standard trace reconstruction when this paper
was initially released. We note, however, that Chase very recently improved the
standard trace reconstruction bound to $\exp\big(\tilde{O}(n^{1/5})\big)$.
Next, we prove that we can reconstruct random circular strings with high
probability using $n^{O(1)}$ traces for any constant deletion probability $q$.
Finally, we prove a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^3)$ traces for arbitrary
circular strings, which is greater than the best known lower bound of

Data related to human movement trajectories are scarce, especially in the
context of emergencies, which places a limitation on applications of existing

of learning the mobility patterns from data generated in normal situations and
which can adapt to emergency situations are needed to inform emergency response

tests an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can predict the
destinations of movements, estimate the trajectory for each origin and
destination pair, and examine the impact of perturbations on humans' decisions
related to destinations and movement trajectories. The application of the
proposed model is shown in the context of Houston and the flooding scenario
caused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The results show that the model can
achieve more than 76\% precision and recall. The results also show that the
model could predict traffic patterns and congestion resulting from to urban

in over 355 million tokens. DLMs for predicting IHM using data from all sources

AUC-ROC difference between models was found to be significant for both IHM and
LOS at p=0.05. The observed PR-AUC difference between the models was found to
be significant for IHM and statistically insignificant for LOS at p=0.05. In
this study, deep learning models were constructed using data combined from a

Recent works have explored machine learning techniques for fingerprinting (or
classifying) IoT devices, with promising results. However, existing works have
assumed that the features used for building the machine learning models are
readily available or can be easily extracted from the network traffic; in other
words, they do not consider the costs associated with feature extraction. In
this work, we take a more realistic approach, and argue that feature extraction
has a cost, and the costs are different for different features. We also take a
step forward from the current practice of considering the misclassification
loss as a binary value, and make a case for different losses based on the
misclassification performance. Thereby, and more importantly, we introduce the
notion of risk for IoT device classification. We define and formulate the
problem of cost-aware IoT device classification. This being a combinatorial
optimization problem, we develop a novel algorithm to solve it in a fast and
effective way using the Cross-Entropy (CE) based stochastic optimization
technique. Using traffic of real devices, we demonstrate the capability of the
CE based algorithm in selecting features with minimal risk of misclassification
while keeping the cost for feature extraction within a specified limit.

  Aims. We describe the upgraded hardware and give details of the data
calibration and reduction pipeline. We investigate the influence of meteor
morphology on radiant and velocity measurement precision, and use direct
observations of meteoroid fragmentation to constrain their compressive
strengths.
  Methods. On July 21, 2017, CAMO observed a ~4 second meteor on a JFC orbit.
It had a shallow entry angle ~8 deg and 12 fragments were visible in the
narrow-field video. The event was manually reduced and the exact moment of
fragmentation was determined. The aerodynamic ram pressure at the moment of
fragmentation was used as a proxy for compressive strength, and strengths of an
additional 19 fragmenting meteoroids were measured in the same way. The
uncertainty in the atmosphere mass density was estimated to be +/-25% using
NAVGEM-HA data.
  Results. We find that meteor trajectory accuracy significantly depends on
meteor morphology. The CAMO radiant and initial velocity precision for
non-fragmenting meteors with short wakes is ~0.5' and 1 m/s, while that for
meteors with fragments or long wakes is similar to non-tracking, moderate field
of view optical systems (5', ~50 m/s). Measured compressive strengths of 20
fragmenting meteoroids (with less precise radiants due to their morphology) was
in the range of 1-4 kPa, which is in excellent accord with Rosetta in-situ
measurements of 67P. Fragmentation type and strength do not appear to be
dependent on orbit. The mass index of the 12 fragments in the July 21 meteoroid
was very high (s = 2.8), indicating possible progressive fragmentation.

electronic beam-steering using analog antenna arrays during beam training
process or during channel modeling measurements using either electronic or
mechanical beam-steering. In particular, the proposed technique is used here to
cluster two-dimensional power angular spectrum maps. The proposed clustering is
unsupervised and is well suited to preserve the shape of clusters by
considering the angular connection between neighbor samples, which is useful to
obtain more accurate descriptions of channel angular properties. The approach
is found to outperform approaches based on K-Power- Means in terms of accuracy
as well as computational resource . The technique is assessed in simulation
using IEEE 802.11ad channel model and in measurement using experiments

samples in the joint spatial-spectral spaces are characterized. Finally,
numerous texture images that are visually similar to the exemplary texture

are located in five dense neuronal clusters, named nigrosomes. T2- or
T2*-weighted images are used to delineate the largest nigrosome, named
nigrosome-1. In these images, nigrosome-1 is a hyperintense region in the
caudal and dorsal portion of the T2- or T2*-weighted substantia nigra. In PD,
nigrosome-1 experiences iron accumulation, which leads to a reduction in
T2-weighted hyperintensity. Here, we examine neuromelanin-depletion and iron
deposition in regions of interest (ROIs) derived from quantitative-voxel based
morphometry (qVBM) on neuromelanin-sensitive images and compare the ROIs with
nigrosome-1 identified in T2*-weighted images.
  Methods: Neuromelanin-sensitive and multi-echo gradient echo imaging data
were obtained. R2* was calculated from multi-echo gradient echo imaging data.
qVBM analysis was performed on neuromelanin-sensitive images and restricted to
SNpc. Mean neuromelanin-sensitive contrast and R2* was measured from the
resulting qVBM clusters. Nigrosome-1 was segmented in T2*-weighted images of
control subjects and its location was compared to the spatial location of the
qVBM clusters.
  Results: Two bilateral clusters emerged from the qVBM analysis. These
clusters showed reduced neuromelanin-sensitive contrast and increased mean R2*
in PD as compared to controls. Cluster-1 from the qVBM analysis was in a
similar spatial location as nigrosome-1, as seen in T2*-weighted images.
  Conclusion: qVBM cluster-1 shows reduced neuromelanin-sensitive contrast and
is in a similar spatial position as nigrosome-1. This region likely corresponds
to nigrosome-1 while the second cluster may correspond to nigrosome-2.

alleviate the subjectivity and sensitivity of hard thresholding while retaining
the super-resolution ability. We also evaluate the trade-off between resolution

ignore the underlying stochasticity of spatial transport and reactions, and are
often described as appropriate in regimes where there are large numbers of
particles in a system. Recent studies have proven the rigorous large-population
limit of PBSRD models, showing the resulting mean-field models (MFM) correspond
to non-local systems of partial-integro differential equations. In this work we
explore the rigorous relationship between standard reaction-diffusion PDE
models and the derived MFM. We prove that the former can be interpreted as an
asymptotic approximation to the later in the limit that bimolecular reaction
kernels are short-range and averaging. As the reactive interaction length scale
approaches zero, we prove the MFMs converge at second order to standard
reaction-diffusion PDE models. In proving this result we also establish local
well-posedness of the MFM model in time for general systems, and global
well-posedness for specific reaction systems and kernels. Finally, we
illustrate the agreement and disagreement between the MFM, SM and the

paper, we propose an approach of partial regularization rather than the
original form of penalizing all parameters, which is said to be full
regularization, to conduct model compression at a higher speed. It is
reasonable and feasible according to the existence of the permutation invariant
property of neural networks. Experimental results show that as we expected, the
computational complexity is reduced by observing less running time in almost
all situations. It should be owing to the fact that partial regularization
method invovles a lower number of elements for calculation. Surprisingly, it
helps to improve some important metrics such as regression fitting results and
classification accuracy in both training and test phases on multiple datasets,
telling us that the pruned models have better performance and generalization
ability. What's more, we analyze the results and draw a conclusion that an
optimal network structure must exist and depend on the input data.

mostly on the role of optimization methods rather than on weight
initializations. Recent findings, however, suggest that neural networks rely on
lucky random initial weights of subnetworks called ""lottery tickets"" that
converge quickly to a solution. To investigate how weight initializations
affect performance, we examine small convolutional networks that are trained to
predict n steps of the two-dimensional cellular automaton Conway's Game of
Life, the update rules of which can be implemented efficiently in a 2n+1 layer
convolutional network. We find that networks of this architecture trained on
this task rarely converge. Rather, networks require substantially more
parameters to consistently converge. In addition, near-minimal architectures
are sensitive to tiny changes in parameters: changing the sign of a single
weight can cause the network to fail to learn. Finally, we observe a critical
value d_0 such that training minimal networks with examples in which cells are
alive with probability d_0 dramatically increases the chance of convergence to
a solution. We conclude that training convolutional neural networks to learn
the input/output function represented by n steps of Game of Life exhibits many
characteristics predicted by the lottery ticket hypothesis, namely, that the
size of the networks required to learn this function are often significantly
larger than the minimal network required to implement the function.

conduct a detailed substructure search and dynamical state characterisation of
Abell 2399, a galaxy cluster in the local Universe ($z \sim 0.0579$), by
performing a multi-wavelength analysis and testing the results through
hydro-dynamical simulations. In particular, we apply a Gaussian Mixture Model
to the spectroscopic data from SDSS, WINGS, and Omega WINGS Surveys to identify
substructures. We further use public \textit{XMM-Newton} data to investigate
the intracluster medium (ICM) thermal properties, creating temperature,
metallicity, entropy, and pressure maps. Finally, we run hydro-dynamical
simulations to constrain the merger stage of this system. The ICM is very
asymmetrical and has regions of temperature and pressure enhancement that
evidence a recent merging process. The optical substructure analysis retrieves
the two main X-ray concentrations. The temperature, entropy, and pressure are
smaller in the secondary clump than in the main clump. On the other hand, its
metallicity is considerably higher. This result can be explained by the
scenario found by the hydro-dynamical simulations where the secondary clump
passed very near to the centre of the main cluster possibly causing the
galaxies of that region to release more metals through the increase of
ram-pressure stripping.16

system generally involves a cascaded channel with a sophisticated statistical
distribution. In this case, the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE)
estimator requires the calculation of a multidimensional integration which is
intractable to be implemented in practice. To further improve the channel
estimation performance, in this paper, we model the channel estimation as a
denoising problem and adopt a deep residual learning (DReL) approach to
implicitly learn the residual noise for recovering the channel coefficients
from the noisy pilot-based observations. To this end, we first develop a
versatile DReL-based channel estimation framework where a deep residual network
(DRN)-based MMSE estimator is derived in terms of Bayesian philosophy. As a
realization of the developed DReL framework, a convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based DRN (CDRN) is then proposed for channel estimation in IRS-MC
systems, in which a CNN denoising block equipped with an element-wise
subtraction structure is specifically designed to exploit both the spatial
features of the noisy channel matrices and the additive nature of the noise
simultaneously. In particular, an explicit expression of the proposed CDRN is
derived and analyzed in terms of Bayesian estimation to characterize its
properties theoretically. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the
performance of the proposed method approaches that of the optimal MMSE
estimator requiring the availability of the prior probability density function

convolution (STPC) method to achieve anisotropic convolution filtering on point
clouds. To capture and represent implicit geometric structures, we specifically
introduce spatial direction dictionary to learn those latent geometric
components. To better encode unordered neighbor points, we design sparse
deformer to transform them into the canonical ordered dictionary space by using
direction dictionary learning. In the transformed space, the standard
image-like convolution can be leveraged to generate anisotropic filtering,
which is more robust to express those finer variances of local regions.
Dictionary learning and encoding processes are encapsulated into a network
module and jointly learnt in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on
several public datasets (including S3DIS, Semantic3D, SemanticKITTI)
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in point clouds semantic
segmentation task.

them challenging to implement in hardware. To overcome these difficulties, we
introduce a new quantile-based algorithm to improve the induction of the

simple models for the formation of both stellar mass binary black holes (sBBHs)
and binary neutron stars (BNSs). We consider that the dynamically originated
sBBHs have relatively larger masses and higher eccentricities compared with
those from field binary stars and its possible effect on the GWB spectrum. We
find that the GWB spectrum may have a turnover in the low-frequency (Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna; LISA) band and may be better described by a
broken double power-law than a single power-law with the unique index $2/3$,
and the low-frequency slope depends on the significance of the dynamically
originated sBBHs with high eccentricities. We further generate mock samples of
sBBHs and BNSs, and simulate the mock GWB strain in the time domain. We find
that GWB can be detected with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\gtrsim274/255/21$

However, in many real-world searching scenarios (e.g., video surveillance), the
objects (e.g., persons, vehicles, etc.) are seldom accurately detected or
annotated. Therefore, object-level retrieval becomes intractable without
bounding-box annotation, which leads to a new but challenging topic, i.e.
image-level search. In this paper, to address the image search issue, we first
introduce an end-to-end Integrated Net (I-Net), which has three merits: 1) A
Siamese architecture and an on-line pairing strategy for similar and dissimilar
objects in the given images are designed. 2) A novel on-line pairing (OLP) loss
is introduced with a dynamic feature dictionary, which alleviates the
multi-task training stagnation problem, by automatically generating a number of
negative pairs to restrict the positives. 3) A hard example priority (HEP)
based softmax loss is proposed to improve the robustness of classification task
by selecting hard categories. With the philosophy of divide and conquer, we
further propose an improved I-Net, called DC-I-Net, which makes two new
contributions: 1) two modules are tailored to handle different tasks separately

A class-center guided HEP loss (C2HEP) by exploiting the stored class centers

  https://github.com/ChopinSharp/ref-nms",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prevailing framework for solving referring expression grounding is based
on a two-stage process: 1) detecting proposals with an object detector and 2)
grounding the referent to one of the proposals. Existing two-stage solutions
mostly focus on the grounding step, which aims to align the expressions with
the proposals. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an obvious
mismatch between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they generate
proposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e., expression-agnostic),
hoping that the proposals contain all right instances in the expression (i.e.,
expression-aware). Due to this mismatch, current two-stage methods suffer from
a severe performance drop between detected and ground-truth proposals. To this
end, we propose Ref-NMS, which is the first method to yield expression-aware
proposals at the first stage. Ref-NMS regards all nouns in the expression as
critical objects, and introduces a lightweight module to predict a score for
aligning each box with a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS
operation to filter out the boxes irrelevant to the expression, increasing the
recall of critical objects, resulting in a significantly improved grounding
performance. Since Ref- NMS is agnostic to the grounding step, it can be easily
integrated into any state-of-the-art two-stage method. Extensive ablation
studies on several backbones, benchmarks, and tasks consistently demonstrate
the superiority of Ref-NMS. Codes are available at:

confidence, the HK model obeys a synchronous updating rule, i.e., \emph{all}
agents check and update their opinions at each time point. However, whether
asynchronous bounded confidence models, including the famous Deffuant-Weisbuch
(DW) model, can be synchronized by noise have not been theoretically proved. In
this paper, we propose a generalized bounded confidence model which possesses a
stochastic asynchronous rule. The model takes the DW model and the HK model as
special cases and can significantly generalize the bounded confidence models to
practical application. We discover that the asynchronous model possesses a
different noise-based synchronization behavior compared to the synchronous HK
model. Generally, the HK dynamics can achieve quasi-synchronization
\emph{almost surely} under the drive of noise. For the asynchronous dynamics,
we prove that the model can achieve quasi-synchronization \emph{in mean}, which
is a new type of quasi-synchronization weaker than the ""almost surely"" sense.
The results unify the theory of noise-induced synchronization of bounded
confidence opinion dynamics and hence proves the noise-induced synchronization
of DW model theoretically for the first time. Moreover, the results provide a
theoretical foundation for developing noise-based control strategy of more
complex social opinion systems with stochastic asynchronous rules.

$\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear waveguides, we find a host of remarkable dynamical
features due to the coupling of a discrete pump state to the signal continuum,
from unit-efficiency (i.e., complete) downconversion when the coupling is
dissipative, to Rabi-like oscillations with sub-exponential decay when it is
dispersive. The theory provides a straightforward way to analytically compute a
full characterization of the PDC dynamics, including the complete eigensystem
of the continuum Hamiltonian and expressions for the signal biphoton
correlation function. We also apply the theory to study a pair of linearly
coupled $\chi^{(2)}$ waveguides, where two discrete pump states simultaneously
downconvert into a common-mode signal continuum, resulting in Fano interference
that critically affects the PDC rate. Under appropriate conditions, the theory
predicts characteristic Fano lineshapes and even complete destructive
interference resulting in the full suppression of PDC, due to the formation of
a bound pump state in the continuum. Generalizing further, we show that the
framework can also be applied to higher-order parametric processes such as
parametric three-photon generation, and we also find numerical signatures that
Fano-type interactions occur even for multi-photon PDC under stronger pumping.

auxiliary-variable methods such as the penalty and augmented Lagrangian (AL)
approaches have attracted much interest lately due to their ability to exploit
layer-wise parallelism. However, we observe that large communication overhead
and lacking data augmentation are two key challenges of these methods, which
may lead to low speedup ratio and accuracy drop across multiple compute
devices. Inspired by the optimal control formulation of ResNets, we propose a
novel serial-parallel hybrid training strategy to enable the use of data
augmentation, together with downsampling filters to reduce the communication

succession of independent sub-problems in parallel and then corrects the
network parameters through a full serial forward-backward propagation of data.
Such a strategy can be applied to most of the existing layer-parallel training
methods using auxiliary variables. As an example, we validate the proposed
strategy using penalty and AL methods on ResNet and WideResNet across MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, achieving significant speedup over the

different liquids, water and highly volatile pentane, in a specially designed
setup to understand transient and steady state cooling characteristics of the
proposed wicks. Heat interception and vapour release occur on the same side in
these experiments. These wicks released ~50% of the supplied heat load as the
latent heat; this value remained nearly constant between the explored heat
loads. These wicks have the unique characteristic of potentially very high and
rapid capillary rise induced by near-zero radii (NZR) of contacts formed
between the rods in contact; liquid region reaching the end in NZR has been
called corner meniscus. While the bulk liquid (present between three rods) may
recede, depending on the heat load, the corner meniscus remains pinned; this
unique feature thus leads to sustained high evaporation rate requirements. This
remarkable characteristic seems advantageous compared to a regular wick, whose
cooling performance depends on the heat loads. We also performed 3-D unsteady
state numerical simulations to understand the effect of rod diameter and
materials' thermal conductivity on the overall wick's performance. Steady state
temperature value was in fairly good agreement with the ones measured in
experiments. Based on the geometry of the corner film, fluid mechanics of
liquid transport, and the heat transfer aspects, we present a design of
suitable wicks as per the requirement. These new configurations can represent a
separate class of wicks and may replace the regular wicks in current and
futuristic cooling devices.

United States and is the language most commonly used by Deaf people in the
United States and the English-speaking regions of Canada. Unfortunately, until
recently, ASL received little research. This is due, in part, to its delayed
recognition as a language until William C. Stokoe's publication in 1960.
Limited data has been a long-standing obstacle to ASL research and
computational modeling. The lack of large-scale datasets has prohibited many
modern machine-learning techniques, such as Neural Machine Translation, from
being applied to ASL. In addition, the modality required to capture sign
language (i.e. video) is complex in natural settings (as one must deal with
background noise, motion blur, and the curse of dimensionality). Finally, when
compared with spoken languages, such as English, there has been limited
research conducted into the linguistics of ASL.
  We realize a simplified version of Liddell and Johnson's Movement-Hold (MH)
Model using a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM). We trained our model on
ASLing, a dataset collected from three fluent ASL signers. We evaluate our PGM
against other models to determine its ability to model ASL. Finally, we
interpret various aspects of the PGM and draw conclusions about ASL phonetics.

instance of real-world packing, and develop a neural optimization solution
based on reinforcement learning. Given an initial spatial configuration of
boxes, we seek an efficient method to iteratively transport and pack the boxes
compactly into a target container. Due to obstruction and accessibility
constraints, our problem has to add a new search dimension, i.e., finding an
optimal transport sequence, to the already immense search space for packing
alone. Using a learning-based approach, a trained network can learn and encode
solution patterns to guide the solution of new problem instances instead of
executing an expensive online search. In our work, we represent the transport
constraints using a precedence graph and train a neural network, coined
TAP-Net, using reinforcement learning to reward efficient and stable packing.
The network is built on an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder
employs convolution layers to encode the box geometry and precedence graph and
the decoder is a recurrent neural network (RNN) which inputs the current
encoder output, as well as the current box packing state of the target
container, and outputs the next box to pack, as well as its orientation. We
train our network on randomly generated initial box configurations, without
supervision, via policy gradients to learn optimal TAP policies to maximize
packing efficiency and stability. We demonstrate the performance of TAP-Net on
a variety of examples, evaluating the network through ablation studies and
comparisons to baselines and alternative network designs. We also show that our
network generalizes well to larger problem instances, when trained on
small-sized inputs.

of a group of two-dimensional (2D) moonolayer electrides with the presence of
switchable nearly free electron (NFE) states in their electronic structures.
Unlike conventional electrides, which are metals with floating electrons
forming the partially occupied bands close to the Fermi level, the switchable
electrides are chemically much less active semiconductors holding the NFE
states that are 0.3-1.5 eV above the Fermi level. According to a high
throughput search, we identified 12 2D candidates that possess such low-energy
NFE states. Among them, 11 2D materials can likely be exfoliated from the known
layered materials. Under external forces, such as a compressive strain, these
NFE states stemming from the surface image potential will be pushed downward to
cross the Fermi level. Remarkably, the critical semiconductor-metal transition
can be achieved by a strain as low as 3% in 2D monolayer Na$_2$Pd$_3$O$_4$. As
such, the switchable 2D electrides may provide an ideal platform for exploring
novel quantum phenomena and modern electronic device applications.

growing complexity of modern applications has motivated several flexible

probability parameter via a probit mapping of a Gaussian process indexed by
predictors. However, unlike for continuous settings, there is a lack of
closed-form results for predictive distributions in binary models with Gaussian
process priors. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and approximation strategies
provide common solutions to this problem, but state-of-the-art algorithms are
either computationally intractable or inaccurate in moderate-to-high

expressions for the predictive probabilities in probit Gaussian processes that
rely either on cumulative distribution functions of multivariate Gaussians or
on functionals of multivariate truncated normals. To evaluate these quantities
we develop novel scalable solutions based on tile-low-rank Monte Carlo methods
for computing multivariate Gaussian probabilities, and on mean-field
variational approximations of multivariate truncated normals. Closed-form
expressions for the marginal likelihood and for the posterior distribution of
the Gaussian process are also discussed. As shown in simulated and real-world
empirical studies, the proposed methods scale to dimensions where

amenable to compaction techniques that try to strike a balance between
population size and performance. A well-studied LCS architecture is XCSF, which
in the RL setting acts as a Q-function approximator. We apply XCSF to a
deterministic and stochastic variant of the FrozenLake8x8 environment from
OpenAI Gym, with its performance compared in terms of function approximation
error and policy accuracy to the optimal Q-functions and policies produced by
solving the environments via dynamic programming. We then introduce a novel
compaction algorithm (Greedy Niche Mass Compaction - GNMC) and study its
operation on XCSF's trained populations. Results show that given a suitable
parametrisation, GNMC preserves or even slightly improves function

Our method of proof differs from these previous work. Their proof relies on an
explicit description of certain Galois group via Kummer theory afforded by the
context of a cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension, whereas our approach is via
considering the Iwasawa cohomology groups with coefficients in

possible thanks to the Quillen-Lichtenbaum Conjecture which is now known to be
valid by the works of Rost-Voevodsky. We also note that the approach allows us
to work with more general $p$-adic Lie extensions that do not necessarily
contain the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension, where the Kummer theoretical
approach does not apply. Along the way, we study the torsionness of the second
Iwasawa cohomology groups with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p(i)$ for $i\geq 2$.
Finally, we give examples of $p$-adic Lie extensions, where the second Iwasawa
cohomology groups can have nontrivial $\mu$-invariants.

216 $\pm$ 12 GHz at 20 V reverse bias measured for 685 nm input light, with a
low dark current of 0.12 $\mu$A . This performance is very competitive when

our devices are attractive for visible-light photonics applications in sensing

$\ell$ vertices each that minimize the sum of Fr\'echet distances over all
input curves to their closest median curve. A major shortcoming of their
algorithm is that the input curves are restricted to lie on the real line. In
this paper, we present a randomized bicriteria-approximation algorithm that
works for polygonal curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and achieves approximation factor
$(1+\epsilon)$ with respect to the clustering costs. The algorithm has
worst-case running-time linear in the number of curves, polynomial in the
maximum number of vertices per curve, i.e. their complexity, and exponential in
$d$, $\ell$, $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, i.e., the failure probability. We achieve
this result through a shortcutting lemma, which guarantees the existence of a
polygonal curve with similar cost as an optimal median curve of complexity
$\ell$, but of complexity at most $2\ell-2$, and whose vertices can be computed
efficiently. We combine this lemma with the superset-sampling technique by
Kumar et al. to derive our clustering result. In doing so, we describe and
analyze a generalization of the algorithm by Ackermann et al., which may be of

numerous challenges. An important class of such cryptographic techniques is
known as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Developing Secure MPC
applications in realistic scenarios requires extensive knowledge spanning
multiple areas of cryptography and systems. And while the steps to arrive at a
solution for a particular application are often straightforward, it remains
difficult to make the implementation efficient, and tedious to apply those same
steps to a slightly different application from scratch. Hence, it is an
important problem to design platforms for implementing Secure MPC applications
with minimum effort and using techniques accessible to non-experts in
cryptography. In this paper, we present the HACCLE (High Assurance
Compositional Cryptography: Languages and Environments) toolchain, specifically
targeted to MPC applications. HACCLE contains an embedded domain-specific
language Harpoon, for software developers without cryptographic expertise to
write MPC-based programs, and uses Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) for code
generation. Harpoon programs are compiled into acyclic circuits represented in
HACCLE's Intermediate Representation (HIR) that serves as an abstraction over
different cryptographic protocols such as secret sharing, homomorphic
encryption, or garbled circuits. Implementations of different cryptographic
protocols serve as different backends of our toolchain. The extensible design
of HIR allows cryptographic experts to plug in new primitives and protocols to
realize computation. And the use of standard metaprogramming techniques lowers
the development effort significantly.

mismatch with observed humans' behaviors such as satisficing with sub-optimal,

problem of bounded risk-sensitive Markov Game (BRSMG) and its inverse reward

the BRSMG framework. We validate the proposed forward policy design and inverse

Using an idealized 1D model of thermal disequilibrium between melt-rich
channels and the surrounding melt-poor material, I estimate heat exchange
across channel walls during channelized melt transport at the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). For geologically-reasonable values of
the volume fraction of channels ($\phi$), relative velocity across channel
walls ($v$), channel spacing ($d$), and the timescale of episodic
melt-infiltration ($\tau$), model results suggest disequilibrium heating may
contribute $>$ $10^{-3}$ W/m$^3$ to the LAB heat budget. During episodic
melt-infiltration, a thermal reworking zone (TRZ) associated with
spatio-temporally varying disequilibrium heat exchange forms at the LAB. The
TRZ grows by the transient migration of a disequilibrium-heating front at
material-dependent velocity, reaching a maximum steady-state width $\delta\sim$
$\left[\phi vd^{-2}\tau^{2} \right]$. The spatio-temporal scales associated
with establishment of the TRZ are comparable with those inferred for the

current rise of this approach has encouraged the search of fast solvers for
isogeometric discretizations and nowadays this topic is full of interest. In
this framework, a desired property of the solvers is the robustness with
respect to both the polinomial degree $p$ and the mesh size $h$. For this task,
in this paper we propose a two-level method such that a discretization of order
$p$ is considered in the first level whereas the second level consists of a
linear or quadratic discretization. On the first level, we suggest to apply one
single iteration of a multiplicative Schwarz method. The choice of the
block-size of such an iteration depends on the spline degree $p$, and is
supported by a local Fourier analysis (LFA). At the second level one is free to
apply any given strategy to solve the problem exactly. However, it is also
possible to get an approximation of the solution at this level by using an

analytics and visualization. With very few exceptions, projection techniques
are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as
to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean
distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical
formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most
multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures
that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity
relation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only
interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the
analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more
reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to
topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper
introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological
guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method
performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while
preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the
high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same
connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data.
The presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by
TopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can
be used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.

minute orbital-period binary pulsar now named PSR J1653-0158. The associated
Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source 4FGL J1653.6-0158 has long been
expected to harbor a binary millisecond pulsar. Despite the pulsar-like
gamma-ray spectrum and candidate optical/X-ray associations -- whose periodic
brightness modulations suggested an orbit -- no radio pulsations had been found
in many searches. The pulsar was discovered by directly searching the gamma-ray
data using the GPU-accelerated Einstein@Home distributed volunteer computing
system. The multi-dimensional parameter space was bounded by positional and
orbital constraints obtained from the optical counterpart. More sensitive
analyses of archival and new radio data using knowledge of the pulsar timing
solution yield very stringent upper limits on radio emission. Any radio
emission is thus either exceptionally weak, or eclipsed for a large fraction of
the time. The pulsar has one of the three lowest inferred surface
magnetic-field strengths of any known pulsar with $B_{\rm surf} \approx 4
\times 10^{7}\,$G. The resulting mass function, combined with models of the
companion star's optical light curve and spectra, suggests a pulsar mass
$\gtrsim 2\,M_{\odot}$. The companion is light-weight with mass $\sim
0.01\,M_{\odot}$, and the orbital period is the shortest known for any
rotation-powered binary pulsar. This discovery demonstrates the Fermi Large
Area Telescope's potential to discover extreme pulsars that would otherwise
remain undetected.

propagator in a holonomous plasma that is described by introducing a constant
background field for the vector potential $A_{0}$. Due to the transversality of
the holonomous Hard-Thermal-Loop in gluon self-energy, the resummed propagator
has a similar Lorentz structure as that in the perturbative Quark-Gluon Plasma
where the holonomy vanishes. As for the color structures, since diagonal gluons
are mixed in the over-complete double line basis, only the propagators for
off-diagonal gluons can be obtained unambiguously. On the other hand,
multiplied by a projection operator, the propagators for diagonal gluons, which
exhibit a highly non-trivial dependence on the background field, are uniquely
determined after summing over the color indices. As an application of these
results, we consider the Debye screening effect on the in-medium binding of
quarkonium states by analyzing the static limit of the resummed gluon
propagator. In general, introducing non-zero holonomy merely amounts to
modifications on the perturbative screening mass $m_D$ and the resulting
heavy-quark potential, which remains the standard Debye screened form, is
always deeper than the screened potential in the perturbative Quark-Gluon
Plasma. Therefore, a weaker screening, thus a more tightly bounded quarkonium
state can be expected in a holonomous plasma. In addition, both the diagonal
and off-diagonal gluons become distinguishable by their modified screening
masses ${\cal M}_D$ and the temperature dependence of the ratio ${\cal M}_D/T$
shows a very similar behavior as that found in lattice simulations.

enhanced absorption and induced transparency. The interaction between CPL and
chiral molecules with the opposite chirality to CPL is stronger than that of
the same chirality, and the line width of the two peaks is closer than that of

there are deeper mechanisms for the interaction. This result will be helpful

sceptical Bayes factor is the highest level where replication success can be

factor combines several notions of replicability: it ensures that both studies

(HOVz) approach, which is based on the Fisher-z transformation. Results from
previous studies (Field, 2005; Hafdahl and Williams, 2009), however, indicate
that in random-effects models the performance of the HOVz confidence interval
can be unsatisfactory. To this end, we propose improvements of the HOVz
approach, which are based on enhanced variance estimators for the main effect
estimate. In order to study the coverage of the new confidence intervals in
both fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis models, we perform an extensive
simulation study, comparing them to established approaches. Data were generated
via a truncated normal and beta distribution model. The results show that our
newly proposed confidence intervals based on a Knapp-Hartung-type variance
estimator or robust heteroscedasticity consistent sandwich estimators in
combination with the integral z-to-r transformation (Hafdahl, 2009) provide
more accurate coverage than existing approaches in most scenarios, especially
in the more appropriate beta distribution simulation model.

comparing the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic field vector with those

Milne-Eddington (ME) and (non-)local thermal equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions
of Hinode SOT/SP Fe I 6301.5{\AA} and 6302.5{\AA}. The chromospheric field is
obtained from a spatially-regularised weak field approximation (WFA) and
non-LTE inversions of Ca II 8542{\AA} observed with CRISP at the Swedish 1-m
Solar Telescope. The LTE- and non-LTE-inferred photospheric field components
are strongly correlated throughout the atmosphere, with stronger field and
higher temperatures in the non-LTE inversions. For the chromospheric field, the
non-LTE inversions correlate well with the spatially-regularised WFA. We find
strong-field patches of over 4.5 kG in the photosphere, co-located with similar
concentrations exceeding 3 kG in the chromosphere. The obtained field strengths
are up to 2-3 times higher than in the numerical models, with more concentrated
and structured photosphere-to-chromosphere shear close to the polarity
inversion line. The LTE and non-LTE Fe I inversions yield essentially the same
photospheric field, while ME inversions fail to reproduce the field vector
orientation where Fe I is in emission. Our inversions confirm the locations of
flux rope footpoints that are predicted by numerical models. However,
pre-processing and lower spatial resolution lead to weaker and smoother field
in the models than what the data indicate. This emphasises the need for higher
spatial resolution in the models to better constrain pre-eruptive flux ropes.

nine cases were also reconstructed without any initialization for comparison.
  The reconstructions including initialization were found to reach a lower mean

retrieval of the breast outline and depiction of the skin, confirming that
adding the deep learning-based initialization adds valuable information to the

cohesionless bed of spherical particles, mimicking sediment grains, are
described. The flow around the sediment particles is explicitly computed by
using the immersed boundary method, which allows the force and torque acting on
the particles to be evaluated along with their dynamics. Different values of
the Reynolds number and different values of the ratio between the grain size
and the thickness of the boundary layer are considered such that the results
are useful to quantify the sand transport generated by sea waves in the region
offshore of the breaker line. Therefore, the results are used to test the
capability of empirical sediment transport formulae to predict the sediment
transport rate during the oscillatory cycle.

ambiguous, inconsistent and/or incomplete descriptions, etc. Poor descriptions
lead to missing requirements and eliciting incorrect requirements as well as
less comprehensiveness of produced use case models. This paper proposes a
technique to automate detecting bad smells of use case descriptions, symptoms
of poor descriptions. At first, to clarify bad smells, we analyzed existing use
case models to discover poor use case descriptions concretely and developed the
list of bad smells, i.e., a catalogue of bad smells. Some of the bad smells can
be refined into measures using the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm to automate
their detection. The main contribution of this paper is the automated detection
of bad smells. We have implemented an automated smell detector for 22 bad
smells at first and assessed its usefulness by an experiment. As a result, the
first version of our tool got a precision ratio of 0.591 and recall ratio of
0.981.

cup-shaped structure, and finally develops into a spherical autophagosome. We
have constructed a theoretical model that integrates the membrane morphological

in seismic data analysis since these models play a critical role in detecting
the onset of seismic events. A majority of these models are usually built on
certain critical assumptions, namely, stationarity, linearity, and Gaussianity.
Despite their criticality, very little reported literature exists on validating
these assumptions on real seismic data. The objectives of this work are (i) to
critically study these long-held assumptions and (ii) to propose a systematic
procedure for developing appropriate time-series models. A rigorous statistical
analysis reveals that these standard assumptions do not hold for most of the
data sets under study; rather they exhibit additional special features such as
heteroskedasticity and integrating effects. Resting on these novel discoveries,
ARIMA-GARCH models are developed for seismic noise. Studies are carried out on
$185$ real-time data sets over different time intervals to study the daily and
seasonal variations in noise characteristics and model structure. Nearly all
datasets tested positive for first-order non-stationarity, heteroskedasticity,

solution to classical Patlak-Keller-Segel equation (PKS equation for short)
exists if and only if its initial total mass is not in supercritical regime.
However, to study long-time behavior of a global mild solution to $2$D PKS
equation usually requires finite-free-energy and finite-second-moment
assumptions on initial data. In this article, we introduce a novel argument to
push and stretch a space-time strip. By this way, we gain $L^1$-compactness of
PKS equation expressed under similarity variables. As a consequence, we obtain
global dynamics of 2D PKS equation in subcritical regime with no additional
assumptions. As for the higher dimensional case in which the spatial dimension
$n \geq 3$, we also characterize the long-time asymptotics of global mild
solutions to PKS equation. With a finite-total-mass assumption on density of
cells, any global mild solution to PKS equation will approach a self-similar
profile when time is large, provided that there is a sequence of time going to
infinity on which $L^\infty$-norm of the density of cells converges to zero.
The self-similar profile in the higher dimensional case is given by the
function $M\mathcal{G}_n$, where $M$ is the total mass of cells and
$\mathcal{G}_n$ denotes the standard $n$-dimensional Gaussian probability
density. Convergence rates to self-similar profiles are also discussed in any
dimensions. Particularly in the higher dimensional case, the general
convergence rate for $L^1$-initial data can be improved if the initial data has
a finite second moment. In fact, when time is large and $n \geq 3$, we provide,
in an optimal way, a higher-order approximation of global mild solutions to PKS
equation if the initial density has a finite second moment. All convergence
rates studied in this article are under the $L^p$-norm with $p \in [1,\infty]$.

expressed as f(g(X))=h(f(X)) with f being the application under test, with
input data X, and with the metamorphic relation (g, h). Automatically generated
metamorphic relations can be used for constructing regression tests, and for
comparing different versions of the same software application. Here, we
restrict to h being the identity map. Then, the task of constructing tests
means finding different g which we tackle using machine learning algorithms.
These algorithms typically minimize a cost function. As one possible g is
already known to be the identity map, for finding a second possible g, we
construct the cost function to minimize for g being a metamorphic relation and
to penalize for g being the identity map. After identifying the first
metamorphic relation, the procedure is repeated with a cost function rewarding
g that are orthogonal to previously found metamorphic relations. For
experimental evaluation, two implementations of an ocean-modeling application
will be subjected to the proposed method with the objective of presenting the
use of metamorphic relations to test the implementations of the applications.

research also identifies the most important existing barriers. Among them we

other a closed loop, is theorised to be a crucial process for both maintaining
the structure of the corona and producing the solar wind. This 'interchange
reconnection' is expected to be particularly active at the open-closed
boundaries of coronal holes (CHs). Previous analysis of solar wind data at 1AU
indicated that peaks in the flux of suprathermal electrons at slow-fast stream
interfaces may arise from magnetic connection to the CH boundary, rather than
dynamic effects such as compression. Further, offsets between the peak and
stream interface locations are suggested to be the result of interchange
reconnection at the source. As a preliminary test of these suggestions, we
analyse two solar wind streams observed during the first Parker Solar Probe
(PSP) perihelion encounter, each associated with equatorial CH boundaries (one
leading and one trailing with respect to rotation). Each stream features a peak
in suprathermal electron flux, the locations and associated plasma properties
of which are indicative of a solar origin, in agreement with previous
suggestions from 1AU observations. Discrepancies between locations of the flux
peaks and other features suggest these peaks may too be shifted by source
region interchange reconnection. Our interpretation of each event is compatible
with a global pattern of open flux transport, although random footpoint motions
or other explanations remain feasible. These exploratory results highlight
future opportunities for statistical studies regarding interchange reconnection
and flux transport at CH boundaries with modern near-Sun missions.

turbulence because they are easily solved numerically even at very large
Reynolds numbers. Although bereft of spatial variation, they accurately
reproduce the main statistical properties of fully-developed homogeneous and
isotropic turbulence. Moreover, they enjoy regularity properties which still
remain open for the three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs). The
goal of this study is to make a rigorous comparison between shell models and
the NSEs. It turns out that only the estimate of the mean energy dissipation
rate is the same in both systems. The estimates of the velocity and its
higher-order derivatives display a weaker Reynolds number dependence for shell
models than for the 3D NSEs. Indeed, the velocity-derivative estimates for
shell models are found to be equivalent to those corresponding to a velocity
gradient averaged version of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations (VGA-NSEs), while
the velocity estimates are even milder. Numerical simulations over a wide range
of Reynolds numbers confirm the estimates for shell models.

frequent memory access, which lead to a low processing speed and large power
dissipation. Although the characteristics of the different layers in a CNN are
frequently quite different, previous hardware designs have employed common
optimization schemes for them. This paper proposes a layer-specific design that
employs different organizations that are optimized for the different layers.
The proposed design employs two layer-specific optimizations: layer-specific
mixed data flow and layer-specific mixed precision. The mixed data flow aims to
minimize the off-chip access while demanding a minimal on-chip memory (BRAM)
resource of an FPGA device. The mixed precision quantization is to achieve both
a lossless accuracy and an aggressive model compression, thereby further
reducing the off-chip access. A Bayesian optimization approach is used to
select the best sparsity for each layer, achieving the best trade-off between
the accuracy and compression. This mixing scheme allows the entire network
model to be stored in BRAMs of the FPGA to aggressively reduce the off-chip
access, and thereby achieves a significant performance enhancement. The model
size is reduced by 22.66-28.93 times compared to that in a full-precision
network with a negligible degradation of accuracy on VOC, COCO, and ImageNet
datasets. Furthermore, the combination of mixed dataflow and mixed precision
significantly outperforms the previous works in terms of both throughput,
off-chip access, and on-chip memory requirement.

tool in this context, as they allow to replace the computation of $f(A)$ or
$\text{tr}(f(A))$ by the evaluation of (a small number of) quantities of the
form $f(A)v$ or $v^Tf(A)v$, respectively. These tasks can then efficiently be
solved by standard techniques like, e.g., Krylov subspace methods. It is
well-known that probing methods are particularly efficient when $f(A)$ is
approximately sparse, e.g., when the entries of $f(A)$ show a strong
off-diagonal decay, but a rigorous error analysis is lacking so far. In this
paper we develop new theoretical results on the existence of sparse
approximations for $f(A)$ and error bounds for probing methods based on graph
colorings. As a by-product, by carefully inspecting the proofs of these error

for approximating $f(A)v$ or $v^Tf(A)v$, thus allowing for a practically
efficient implementation of the probing methods.

we shall see, extremely powerful when carefully tuned, Least Square Support
Vector Machine (LSSVM) version of MTL, in the regime where the dimension $p$ of
the data and their number $n$ grow large at the same rate.
  Under mild assumptions on the input data, the theoretical analysis of the
MTL-LSSVM algorithm first reveals the ""sufficient statistics"" exploited by the
algorithm and their interaction at work. These results demonstrate, as a
striking consequence, that the standard approach to MTL-LSSVM is largely
suboptimal, can lead to severe effects of negative transfer but that these
impairments are easily corrected. These corrections are turned into an improved
MTL-LSSVM algorithm which can only benefit from additional data, and the
theoretical performance of which is also analyzed.
  As evidenced and theoretically sustained in numerous recent works, these
large dimensional results are robust to broad ranges of data distributions,
which our present experiments corroborate. Specifically, the article reports a
systematically close behavior between theoretical and empirical performances on
popular datasets, which is strongly suggestive of the applicability of the
proposed carefully tuned MTL-LSSVM method to real data. This fine-tuning is
fully based on the theoretical analysis and does not in particular require any

modelled by a neutral scalar. Two dark matter candidates introduced were the
dark photon and a charged complex scalar. Non-minimal couplings of both scalars
to gravity were included. The coupling channels between the ordinary and dark
matter sectors were kinetic mixing between the electromagnetic and dark $U(1)$
fields and the Higgs portal coupling among the scalars. The structures of
emerging singular spacetimes were either of Schwarzschild or
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m types. The non-minimal scalar--gravity couplings led to
an appearance of timelike portions of apparent horizons where they transform
from spacelike to null. The features of dynamical black holes were described as
functions of the model parameters. The black holes formed later and their radii
and masses were smaller as the mass parameter of the complex scalar increased.
The dependencies on the coupling of the Higgs field to gravity exhibited
extrema, which were a maximum for the time of the black holes formation and
minima in the cases of their radii and masses. A set of quantities associated
with an observer moving with the evolving matter was proposed. The energy
density, radial pressure and pressure anisotropy within dynamical spacetimes
get bigger as the singularity is approached. The increase is more considerable
in the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m spacetimes. The apparent horizon local
temperature changes monotonically in the minimally coupled case and

their output is not accurate since the utilized information is not sufficient.
Additionally, other methods were dependent on the availability of more than one

at an affordable price without having to commit the expense upfront. Although
the cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, there are
still many security concerns due to inherently complex model the cloud
providers operate on (e.g.,multi-tenancy). In addition, the enterprises whose
services have migrated into the cloud have a preference for their own
cybersecurity situation awareness capability on top of the security mechanisms
provided by the cloud providers. In this way, the enterprises can monitor the
performance of the security offerings of the cloud and have a choice to decide
and select potential response strategies more appropriate to the enterprise in
the presence of the attack where the defense provided by the cloud doesn't work
for them. However, some response strategies, such as Moving Target Defense
(MTD) techniques shown to be effective to secure cloud, cannot be deployed by
the enterprise themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework that enables
better collaboration between enterprises and cloud providers. Our proposed
framework, which offers more in-depth security analysis based on the set of
most advanced security metrics, allows the security experts of the enterprise
to obtain better situational awareness in the cloud. With better and more
effective situation awareness of cloud security, our framework can support
better decision making and further allows to deploy more appropriate threat
responses to protect the outsourced resources. We also propose a secure
protocol which can facilitate more secure communication between the enterprises
and cloud provider. Using our proposed secure protocol, which is based on
authentication and key exchange mechanism, the enterprises can send a secure
request to the cloud provider to perform a selected defensive strategy.

this paper, we add signal processing units for a few antennas at RIS to
partially acquire the channels. To solve the crucial active antenna selection

probabilistic sampling theory to select the optimal locations of these active

deep learning (DL) based schemes, i.e., the channel extrapolation scheme and
the beam searching scheme, to enable the RIS communication system. The former
utilizes the selection network and a convolutional neural network to
extrapolate the full channels from the partial channels received by the active

achieve the direct mapping between the partial channels and the optimal
beamforming vector with maximal transmission rate. Simulation results are

spaces in a very straightforward manner from duality and monotonicity. We shall
also show how to deduce comparison principles for nonlinear differential
operators, a program seemingly different from the first. However, we shall
marry these two points of view, for a wide variety of equations, under
something called the correspondence principle. In potential theory one is given
a constraint set F on the 2-jets of a function, and the boundary of F gives a
differential equation. There are many differential operators, suitably
organized around F, which give the same equation. So potential theory gives a
great strengthening and simplification to the operator theory. Conversely, the
set of operators associated to F can have much to say about the potential
theory. An object of central interest here is that of monotonicity, which
explains and unifies much of the theory. We shall always assume that the
maximal monotonicity cone for a potential theory has interior. This is
automatic for gradient-free equations where monotonicity is simply the standard
degenerate ellipticity and properness assumptions. We show that for each such
potential theory F there is an associated canonical operator, defined on the
entire 2-jet space and having all the desired properties. Furthermore,
comparison holds for this operator on any domain which admits a regular
strictly M-subharmonic function, where M is a monotonicity subequation for F.
On the operator side there is an important dichotomy into the unconstrained
cases and constrained cases, where the operator must be restricted to a proper
subset of 2-jet space. These two cases are best illustrated by the canonical
operators and Dirichlet-Garding operators, respectively. The article gives
many, many examples from pure and applied mathematics, and also from
theoretical physics.

$T/B$ varies in a wide range, provided the HF compound is located near the
topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT). Due to the
topological properties of FCQPT, the effective mass $M^*$ exhibits a universal

important technological applications. We also explain how to extract the

observe that the incorporation of N atoms on the $a$-face is stable.
Furthermore, from the analysis of the electronic states, we suggest that this

recent years have gained significant attention in Intelligent Transport Systems
(ITS) in terms of disseminating messages in an efficient manner. VANET uses
Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) for disseminating messages between
vehicles and between infrastructures. Though DSRC based communications are
viable, it is still challenging to disseminate messages in a timely manner when
vehicles are not in the transmission range of each other. Furthermore, DSRC
communication channels are heavily congested when the vehicle density increases
on the road. To address these limitations, two emerging paradigms: 1) vehicular
cloud computing and 2) vehicular fog computing are been adopted to disseminate
message between the vehicles in a connected vehicular environment. Vehicular
fog computing uses fog nodes for the dissemination of messages among vehicles.
Any real-world object can be formed as a fog node by acquiring the properties
such as 1) network connectivity, 2) computation, and 3) storage. In this book
chapter, we highlight the significance of message dissemination in connected
vehicles based on techniques like DSRC, vehicular cloud computing, and
vehicular fog computing. Our objective is to help the readers better understand
the fundamentals of connected vehicles and communication techniques while
disseminating messages between vehicles and between infrastructures.

clusters, filaments, and sheets of matter. This PhD comprises two complementary
projects investigating the cosmic web using correlations between three
different tracers: the cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernovae (SNe), and
large quasar groups (LQGs). In the first project we re-analyse the apparent
correlation between CMB temperature and SNe redshift reported by Yershov, Orlov
and Raikov. They presented evidence that the WMAP/Planck CMB pixel-temperatures
at SNe locations tend to increase with increasing redshift. They suggest this
could be caused by the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and/or by residual
foreground contamination. Our analysis supports the prima facie existence of
the correlation but attributes it instead to a composite selection bias caused
by the chance alignment of seven deep survey fields with CMB hotspots. These
seven fields contain just 9.2% of the SNe sample. We estimate the likelihood of
their falling on CMB hotspots by chance is approximately 1 in 11. In the second
project we investigate for the first time the apparent coherent alignment of
LQGs in the redshift range 1.0 <= z <= 1.8. We find that the position angles
(PAs) of LQGs are correlated, specifically aligned and orthogonal, with a
maximum significance of ~2.4 sigma at typical angular (comoving) separations of
~30 degrees (~1.6 Gpc). Spatial coincidence between our LQG sample and regions
of quasar polarization alignment first reported by Hutsemekers, and the
similarity between LQG PAs and radio polarization angles reported by Pelgrims

atmospheric dispersion due to the wavelength-dependent index of refraction of

fundamental to compensate this effect. Atmospheric dispersion correction
residuals above the level of ~ 100 milli-arcseconds (mas) will affect
astronomical observations, in particular radial velocity and flux losses. The
design of an ADC is based on atmospheric models. To the best of our knowledge,
those models have never been tested on-sky. In this paper, we present a new
method to measure the atmospheric dispersion on-sky in the optical range. We
require an accuracy better than 50 mas that is equal to the difference between
atmospheric models. The method is based on the use of cross-dispersion
spectrographs to determine the position of the centroid of the spatial profile
at each wavelength of each spectral order. The method is validated using
cross-dispersed spectroscopic data acquired with the slit spectrograph UVES. We
measure an instrumental dispersion of 47 mas in the blue arm, 15 mas, and 23
mas in the two ranges of the red arm. We also measure a 4 % deviation in the
pixel scale from the value cited in UVES manual. The accuracy of the method is
~ 17 mas in the range of 315-665 nm. At this level, we can compare and
characterize different atmospheric dispersion models for better future ADC

(RAALL) are proposed for broadband and omnidirectional acoustic collimation and
focusing with reduced aberrations. Ray tracing technique shows that RAALL can
achieve a better acoustic focusing compared with traditional modified acoustic
Luneburg lens. Following that, two models of RAALL are designed and fabricated

counter-intuitive and complex behaviors in a social environment, based on very
simple basic rules. It illustrates that cooperation can be a good thing even in
a competitive world, that individual fitness needs not to be the most important
criteria of success, and that some strategies are very strong in a direct
confrontation but could still perform poorly on average or are evolutionarily
unstable. In this contribution, we present a strategy -- PREDICTOR -- which
appears to be ""sentient"" and chooses to cooperate when playing against some
strategies, but defects when playing against others, without the need to record
""tags"" for its opponents or an involved decision-making mechanism. To be able
to operate in the highly-contextual environment, as modeled by the iterated
prisoner's dilemma, PREDICTOR learns from its experience to choose optimal
actions by modeling its opponent and predicting a (fictive) future.
  It is shown that PREDICTOR is an efficient strategy for playing the iterated
prisoner's dilemma and is simple to implement. In a simulated and
representative tournament, it achieves high average scores and wins the
tournament for various parameter settings. PREDICTOR thereby relies on a brief
phase of exploration to improve its model, and it can evolve morality from
intrinsically selfish behavior.

their most substantial changes occur off the MS stage, either before on the
pre-MS or beyond at the post-MS phase. Due to very complex and varied dynamical
processes, the evolution of planetary systems orbiting non-MS stars
significantly differs from those of MS planetary systems.
  This work focusses on the search for sub-stellar companions in post-MS
systems146 and determination of the evolutionary state of their host stars,
especially subdwarf B stars (sdB stars). The canonical model involves binary
evolution to explain the existence of sdB stars. Formation scenarios for single
sdBs are more controversially discussed. Besides the merger of two helium white
dwarfs or other merger processes for apparently single sdB stars, an
alternative formation channel involves planetary systems. During the red giant
phase, the star would develop a common envelope w146ith a giant planet that
leads to the loss of the envelope. Thus, sdB stars are laboratories to test how
planets survive and influence the late phases of stellar evolution.
  The rapid pulsations of sdB stars can be used to detect sub-stellar
companions from periodic variations in the expected arrival times of the
pulsation maxima. This timing method is particularly sensitive to companions at
large distances and complementary to other exoplanet detection methods. Thus,
the timing method opens up a new parameter range in terms of the host stars and
helps to understand the formation process of single sdBs.
  In this work I implemented, tested and applied the pulsation timing analysis
to search for sub-stellar companions in late evolutionary stage stellar
systems. The method is already established in the literature but not to an
extent which is capable of automatically processing long-time series of
high-cadence data, i.e., from space born observations.

conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark tasks using real-world

paper we propose a coincidence technique, coincidence inelastic neutron

detectors with an additional coincidence detector. Two neutrons from the two
neutron sources are incident on the target magnetic material, and they are
scattered by the electron spins of the magnetic material. The two scattered
neutrons are detected by the two neutron detectors in coincidence with the
coincidence probability described by a two-spin Bethe-Salpeter wave function.
Since the two-spin Bethe-Salpeter wave function defines the momentum-resolved

introduced to study the various spin valence bond states of the quantum

inter-process communication, Amdahl's law, and resource contention. Performance
analysis tools for finding such scaling bottlenecks either base on profiling or
tracing. Profiling incurs low overheads but does not capture detailed
dependencies needed for root-cause analysis. Tracing collects all information
at prohibitive overheads. In this work, we design ScalAna that uses static
analysis techniques to achieve the best of both worlds - it enables the
analyzability of traces at a cost similar to profiling. ScalAna first leverages
static compiler techniques to build a Program Structure Graph, which records
the main computation and communication patterns as well as the program's
control structures. At runtime, we adopt lightweight techniques to collect
performance data according to the graph structure and generate a Program
Performance Graph. With this graph, we propose a novel approach, called
backtracking root cause detection, which can automatically and efficiently
detect the root cause of scaling loss. We evaluate ScalAna with real
applications. Results show that our approach can effectively locate the root
cause of scaling loss for real applications and incurs 1.73% overhead on

suitable site has been identified at LHC Point 5 that is closer to the CMS
Interaction Point (IP) than assumed in the LoI. The decay volume has been
increased from 20 m to 25 m in height. Engineering studies have been made in
order to locate much of the decay volume below ground, bringing the detector
even closer to the IP. With these changes, a 100 m x 100 m detector has the
same physics reach for large c$\tau$ as the 200 m x 200 m detector described in
the LoI and other studies. The performance for small c$\tau$ is improved
because of the proximity to the IP. Detector technology has also evolved while
retaining the strip-like sensor geometry in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC)
described in the LoI. The present design uses extruded scintillator bars read
out using wavelength shifting fibers and silicon photomultipliers (SiPM).
Operations will be simpler and more robust with much lower operating voltages

should result in cost savings. Understanding of backgrounds has also
significantly advanced, thanks to new simulation studies and measurements taken

enterprise-wide stakeholders' needs. The link between business needs and
microservices/APIs is not well captured nor adequately defined.
  In this publication, we describe a structured method to create a logical link

  We prove that for $\epsilon\gg n^{-1/3}$ the pair of vectors $

joint law of the spaces before and after the noise converges to a product

constructing no-scale de Sitter and anti-de Sitter models by combining pairs of

predict ignition, rate of heat release and assess engine performance. This is
particularly important for RANS and LES engine simulations, which often
struggle to accurately predict flame propagation and heat release without first
adjusting model parameters. Detailed measurements of flame transport are
required to guide model development. This work introduces an experimental
dataset designed to study the detailed flame transport and flame/flow dynamics
for SI engines. Simultaneous dual-plane OH-LIF and stereoscopic PIV is used to
acquire 3D measurements of unburnt gas velocity, flame displacement speed and
overall flame velocity during the early flame development. Experiments are
performed in an optical engine operating at 800 and 1500 RPM with premixed
C8H18-air mixtures. Analysis reveals several distinctive flame/flow
configurations that yield a positive or negative flame displacement for which
the flame progresses towards the reactants or products, respectively. For the
operating conditions utilized, Sd exhibits and inverse relationship with flame
curvature; a strong correlation between negative Sd and convex flame contours
is observed. Trends are consistent with thermo-diffusive flames, but have not
been quantified in IC engines. Flame wrinkling is more severe at the higher
RPM, which broadens Sd distribution towards higher positive and negative
velocities. Spatially-resolved distributions of Ugas and Sd describe
in-cylinder locations where convection or thermal diffusion is the dominating
mechanism contributing to flame transport. Findings are discussed in relation
to common engine flow features, including flame transport near solid surfaces.
Findings are designed to support engine simulation validations.

find that the magnetization response to an external magnetic field is
consistent with the response of emergent ""half-orphan"" degrees of freedom that
are expected to dominate the response of the corresponding classical magnet in
a similar temperature range whenever there are two vacancies on the same
triangle. Specifically, for all spin values we have considered (from $S=1/2$ to
$S=4$), there is a large enhancement of the local susceptibility of the lone
spin on such a triangle with two vacancies; in the presence of a uniform
magnetic field $h$, this lone-spin behaves effectively as an almost free spin
$S$ in an effective field $h/2$. Quite remarkably, in the zero temperature
limit, the ground state in the presence of a half-orphan has a non-zero total
spin value $S_{GS}$ that shows a trend similar to $S/2$ when $S\ge 2$. These
qualitative aspects of the response differ strikingly from the more
conventional response of diluted samples without such half-orphan degrees of

  Computer Vision 2021 (WACV2021)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many interesting tasks in machine learning and computer vision are learned by
optimising an objective function defined as a weighted linear combination of
multiple losses. The final performance is sensitive to choosing the correct
(relative) weights for these losses. Finding a good set of weights is often
done by adopting them into the set of hyper-parameters, which are set using an
extensive grid search. This is computationally expensive. In this paper, we
propose a weighting scheme based on the coefficient of variations and set the
weights based on properties observed while training the model. The proposed
method incorporates a measure of uncertainty to balance the losses, and as a
result the loss weights evolve during training without requiring another
(learning based) optimisation. In contrast to many loss weighting methods in
literature, we focus on single-task multi-loss problems, such as monocular
depth estimation and semantic segmentation, and show that multi-task approaches
for loss weighting do not work on those single-tasks. The validity of the
approach is shown empirically for depth estimation and semantic segmentation on
multiple datasets.

an example, we investigate the triangular-lattice monolayer made of group-IV
atoms employing first-principles density functional theory calculations. The
flat Pb monolayer supports a mirror-symmetry-protected spinless nodal line in
the absence spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The introduction of an out-of-plane
buckling creates a glide mirror, protecting an anisotropic Dirac nodal loop.
Both flat and buckled Pb monolayers become topologically trivial after
including SOC. A large buckling will make the Pb sheet a 2D semiconductor with
symmetry-protected Dirac points below the Fermi level. The electronic
structures of other group-IV triangular lattices such as Ge and Sn demonstrate
strong similarity to Pb. We further design a quasi-3D crystal PbHfO$_2$ by
alternately stacking Pb and 1T-HfO$_2$ monolayers. The new compound PbHfO$_2$
is dynamically stable and retains the properties of Pb monolayer. By applying
epitaxial strains to PbHfO$_2$, it is possible to drive an insulator-to-metal
transition coupled with an anti-ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition.
Our results suggest the potential of the 2D triangular lattice as a

a novel object via continuous visual perception and a language prompt (""This is

within-episode knowledge of the appropriate referent for the word ""dax"" with
long-term lexical and motor knowledge acquired across episodes (i.e. ""bed"" and
""putting""). We find that, under certain training conditions and with a

generalizes to novel exemplars within the same ShapeNet category, and is
effective in settings with unfamiliar numbers of objects. We further show how

Aims: Our objective is two-fold. First, we identify current challenges in using
test artifacts to understand why certain quality factors are considered good or
bad. Second, we build an Activity-Based Artifact Quality Model that describes
what Agile test artifacts should look like. Method: We conduct an industrial
survey with 18 practitioners from 12 companies operating in seven different

testers. Interestingly, we observed mostly challenges regarding language and

Although Agile software testing is becoming the norm, we still have little

velocimetry (TPIV) measurements to analyse the 3D spray-induced turbulence
during the intake stroke of a direct-injection engine. The spray produces a
strong spray-induced jet in the far field, which travels through the cylinder
and imparts turbulence onto the surrounding flow. Planar high-speed PIV
measurements at 4.8 kHz are combined with TPIV at 3.3 Hz to evaluate spray
particle distributions and validate TPIV measurements in the particle-laden
flow. An uncertainty analysis is performed to assess the uncertainty associated
with vorticity and strain rate components. TPIV analyses quantify the spatial
domain of the turbulence in relation to the SIJ and describe how turbulent flow
features such as turbulent kinetic energy, strain rate and vorticity evolve
into the surrounding flow field. Access to the full tensors facilitate the
evaluation of turbulence for individual spray events. TPIV images reveal the
presence of strong shear layers (visualized by high S magnitudes) and pockets
of elevated vorticity along the immediate boundary of the SIJ. Values are
extracted from spatial domains extending in 1mm increments from the SIJ.
Turbulence levels are greatest within the 0-1mm region from the SIJ boarder and
dissipate with radial distance. Individual strain rate and vorticity components
are analyzed in detail to describe the relationship between local strain rates
and 3D vortical structures produced within strong shear layers of the SIJ.
Analyses are intended to understand the flow features responsible for rapid

only partial information is given at hand. In the presence of right-censored

clear knowledge of whether each individual is censored or not, although, this

survival function and establish its asymptotic normality under mild conditions.
We further study the supervised learning problem where the conditional survival
function is to be predicted with no censorship indicators. To this aim, we
investigate various approaches estimating the conditional expectation for the
censoring indicator. Along with the theoretical results, we illustrate how the

investigate flows with and without imposed mean temperature gradients. Our
results confirm that the travelling thermal waves can cause zonal flows, i.e.
strong mean horizontal flows. We show that the zonal flows in diffusion
dominated regimes are driven purely by the Reynolds stresses, always travelling
retrograde, while in convection dominated regimes, mean flow advection, caused
by tilted convection cells, becomes dominant, which generally leads to prograde

presented. In particular, it is shown that the hadronic energy loss depends on
the particle species as well as the energy of the probe. A parametrization for
the $\langle \tilde{q} \rangle$ parameter as a function of temperature and

heat loss, which is becoming increasingly important for the development of
high-efficiency internal combustion engines (ICE). The limited number of
available investigations have focused on non-reacting flows near engine
surfaces, while this work focuses on the near-wall flow field dynamics in
response to a propagating flame front. Flow-field and flame distributions were
measured simultaneously at kHz repetition rates using particle tracking
velocimetry (PTV) and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of sulfur
dioxide (SO2). Measurements were performed near the piston surface of an
optically accessible engine operating at 800 rpm with homogeneous,
stoichiometric isooctane-air mixtures. High-speed measurements reveal a strong
interdependency between near-wall flow and flame development which also
influences subsequent combustion. A conditional analysis is performed to
analyze flame/flow dynamics at the piston surface for cycles with weak and
strong flow velocities parallel to the surface. Faster flame propagation
associated with higher velocities before ignition demonstrates a stronger flow
acceleration ahead of the flame. Flow acceleration associated with an advancing
flame front is a transient feature that strongly influences boundary layer
development. The distance from the wall to 75% maximum velocity ({\delta}75) is
analyzed to compare boundary layer development between fired and motored
datasets. Decreases in {\delta}75 are strongly related to flow acceleration
produced by an approaching flame front. Measurements reveal strong deviations
of the boundary layer flow between fired and motored datasets, emphasizing the
need to consider transient flow behavior when modelling boundary layer physics
for reacting flows.

structure present among nodes. For many real-world networks, the true
connections consist of events arriving as streams, which are then aggregated to
form edges, ignoring the dynamic temporal component. A natural way to take
account of these temporal dynamics of interactions is to use point processes as
the foundation of network models for community detection. Computational
complexity hampers the scalability of such approaches to large sparse networks.
To circumvent this challenge, we propose a fast online variational inference
algorithm for estimating the latent structure underlying dynamic event arrivals
on a network, using continuous-time point process latent network models. We
describe this procedure for networks models capturing community structure. This
structure can be learned as new events are observed on the network, updating
the inferred community assignments. We investigate the theoretical properties
of such an inference scheme, and provide regret bounds on the loss function of
this procedure. The proposed inference procedure is then thoroughly compared,
using both simulation studies and real data, to non-online variants. We
demonstrate that online inference can obtain comparable performance, in terms
of community recovery, to non-online variants, while realising computational
gains. Our proposed inference framework can also be readily modified to
incorporate other popular network structures.

strong hierarchical structure for some domains, we found few examples of

biomedical research. The conventional optical-resolution photoacoustic
microscope (OR-PAM) suffers from limited depth of field (DoF) since the
employed focused Gaussian beam only has a narrow depth range in focus, little
details in depth direction can be revealed. Here, we developed a computed
extended depth of field method for photoacoustic microscope by using wavelet
transform image fusion rules. Wavelet transform is performed on the max
amplitude projection (MAP) images acquired at different axial positions by
OR-PAM to separate the low and high frequencies, respectively. The fused low
frequency coefficients is taking the average of the low-frequency coefficients
of the low-frequency part of the images. And maximum selection rule is used in
high frequency coefficients. Wavelet coefficient of the MAP images are compared
and select the maximum value coefficient is taken as fused high-frequency
coefficients. And finally the wavelet inverse transform is performed to achieve
large DoF. Simulation was performed to demonstrate that this method can extend
the depth of field of PAM two times without the sacrifice of lateral
resolution. And the in vivo imaging of the mouse cerebral vasculature with
intact skull further demonstrates the feasibility of our method.

wide range of applications including land resource management, biosphere
monitoring and urban planning. Although the accuracy of semantic segmentation
in remote sensing images has been increased significantly by deep convolutional
neural networks, several limitations exist in standard models. First, for
encoder-decoder architectures such as U-Net, the utilization of multi-scale
features causes the underuse of information, where low-level features and
high-level features are concatenated directly without any refinement. Second,
long-range dependencies of feature maps are insufficiently explored, resulting
in sub-optimal feature representations associated with each semantic class.
Third, even though the dot-product attention mechanism has been introduced and
utilized in semantic segmentation to model long-range dependencies, the large
time and space demands of attention impede the actual usage of attention in
application scenarios with large-scale input. This paper proposed a
Multi-Attention-Network (MANet) to address these issues by extracting
contextual dependencies through multiple efficient attention modules. A novel
attention mechanism of kernel attention with linear complexity is proposed to
alleviate the large computational demand in attention. Based on kernel
attention and channel attention, we integrate local feature maps extracted by
ResNeXt-101 with their corresponding global dependencies and reweight
interdependent channel maps adaptively. Numerical experiments on three
large-scale fine resolution remote sensing images captured by different
satellite sensors demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MANet,
outperforming the DeepLab V3+, PSPNet, FastFCN, DANet, OCRNet, and other
benchmark approaches.

patterned illumination. It is very similar in concept to the single-pixel
camera in that an image may be reconstructed from a set of measurements even
though all imaging quanta that pass through that sample are never recorded with
a position resolving detector. The method was first conceived and applied for
visible-wavelength photons and was subsequently translated to other probes such
as x rays, atomic beams, electrons and neutrons. In the context of ghost
imaging using penetrating probes that enable transmission measurement, we here
consider several questions relating to the achievable signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). This is compared with the SNR for conventional imaging under scenarios
of constant radiation dose and constant experiment time, considering both
photon shot-noise and per-measurement electronic read-out noise. We show that
inherent improved SNR capabilities of ghost imaging are limited to a subset of
these scenarios and are actually due to increased dose (Fellgett advantage). An
explanation is also presented for recent results published in the literature
that are not consistent with these findings.

In this context the theory reduces to General Relativity complemented by a dark
stress-energy tensor due to the torsion of spacetime and is studied under the
simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. The dark stress-energy tensor is
found to satisfy an anisotropic structure equation. In vacuum this is shown to
be equivalent to a wave equation with sources. A natural class of exact
solutions is found which explicitly perturbs any seed spacetime metric by a
conformal factor satisfying a (1+1)-dimensional wave equation. This leads to
the concept of dark coating. The static solutions are then used to construct
structures that model dark matter halos surrounding baryonic bodies. In the
Newtonian r\'egime the baryonic mass $m_b$ and the flat rotation curve velocity
$v_f$ are found to be related by the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation $m_b\propto
v_f^4$. The present work proposes thus a possible theoretical motivation of
this hitherto purely empirical result. The example of a dark halo on the
Schwarzschild geometry is made as a toy model for a galaxy. All qualitative an
quantitative features of galactic rotation curves are recovered. A dark halo
surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole is found to possess a boundary of
staticity called torsion sphere placed between the photon sphere and the event
horizon. The phenomenon of dark radiation is briefly exposed. The way for
cosmological applications is then opened by showing how Hubble expansion is a

(VA). The seller has a set of products available and the VA decides which
product to offer and at what price, seeking to maximize its revenue, consumer-
or total-surplus. The consumer is impatient and rational, seeking to maximize
her expected utility given the information available to her. The VA selects
products based on the consumer's request and other information available to it
and then presents them sequentially. Once a product is presented and priced,
the consumer evaluates it and decides whether to make a purchase. The
consumer's valuation of each product comprises a pre-evaluation value, which is
common knowledge, and a post-evaluation component which is private to the
consumer. We solve for the equilibria and develop efficient algorithms for
implementing the solution. We examine the effects of information asymmetry on
the outcomes and study how incentive misalignment depends on the distribution
of private valuations. We find that monotone rankings are optimal in the cases
of a highly patient or impatient consumer and provide a good approximation for
other levels of patience. The relationship between products' expected
valuations and prices depends on the consumer's patience level and is monotone
increasing (decreasing) when the consumer is highly impatient (patient). Also,
the seller's share of total surplus decreases in the amount of private
information. We compare the VA to a traditional web-based interface, where
multiple products are presented simultaneously on each page. We find that
within a page, the higher-value products are priced lower than the lower-value
products when the private valuations are exponentially distributed. Finally,
the web-based interface generally achieves higher profits for the seller than a
VA due to the greater commitment power inherent in its presentation.

provides a probabilistic quantification of uncertainty incurred in the

order models for the prediction of unsteady fluid flows. The first model
projects the high-fidelity time series data from a finite element Navier-Stokes
solver to a low-dimensional subspace via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).
The time-dependent coefficients in the POD subspace are propagated by the
recurrent net (closed-loop encoder-decoder updates) and mapped to a
high-dimensional state via the mean flow field and POD basis vectors. This
model is referred as POD-RNN. The second model, referred to as convolution
recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN), employs convolutional neural networks
(CNN) as layers of linear kernels with nonlinear activations, to extract
low-dimensional features from flow field snapshots. The flattened features are
advanced using a recurrent (closed-loop manner) net and up-sampled (transpose
convoluted) gradually to high-dimensional snapshots. Two benchmark problems of
the flow past a cylinder and flow past a side-by-side cylinder are selected as
the test problems to assess the efficacy of these models. For the problem of
flow past a single cylinder, the performance of both the models is
satisfactory, with CRAN being a bit overkill. However, it completely
outperforms the POD-RNN model for a more complicated problem of flow past
side-by-side cylinders. Owing to the scalability of CRAN, we briefly introduce
an observer-corrector method for the calculation of integrated pressure force
coefficients on the fluid-solid boundary on a reference grid. This reference
grid, typically a structured and uniform grid, is used to interpolate scattered
high-dimensional field data as snapshot images. These input images are
convenient in training CRAN. This motivates us to further explore the
application of CRAN models for the prediction of fluid flows.

the PINNs are effective in accurately recovering the unknown distribution of

Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK) theory of gravity provides a repulsive
gravitational potential at the very dense states of fermionic matter, which
prevents the formation of black hole singularities inside the deeper horizon.
While the fermionic matter in the black hole is attracted by the black hole at
the beginning, after a critical point it is repelled to bounce at a critical
high density and then expand into other side of the horizon as a newly created
space, which may be considered as a nonsingular, closed universe. We
constructed the action of these fermions in a black hole with torsion in the
framework of ECSK theory of gravity from which the free Dirac action is
inferred to obtain the interaction potential. The creation of a bouncing
universe with the extremely repulsive potential may be related to the running
vacuum and the modified Friedmann equations yield the consistent cosmological
parameters with present FRW universe. Finally, this scenario naturally solves
the flatness and horizon problems of cosmology without introducing finely tuned

software security. Existing program analysis techniques either suffer from high
false positives or false negatives. Recent progress in Deep Learning (DL) has
resulted in a surge of interest in applying DL for automated vulnerability
detection. Several recent studies have demonstrated promising results achieving
an accuracy of up to 95% at detecting vulnerabilities. In this paper, we ask,
""how well do the state-of-the-art DL-based techniques perform in a real-world
vulnerability prediction scenario?"". To our surprise, we find that their
performance drops by more than 50%. A systematic investigation of what causes
such precipitous performance drop reveals that existing DL-based vulnerability
prediction approaches suffer from challenges with the training data (e.g., data
duplication, unrealistic distribution of vulnerable classes, etc.) and with the
model choices (e.g., simple token-based models). As a result, these approaches
often do not learn features related to the actual cause of the vulnerabilities.
Instead, they learn unrelated artifacts from the dataset (e.g., specific
variable/function names, etc.). Leveraging these empirical findings, we
demonstrate how a more principled approach to data collection and model design,
based on realistic settings of vulnerability prediction, can lead to better
solutions. The resulting tools perform significantly better than the studied
baseline: up to 33.57% boost in precision and 128.38% boost in recall compared
to the best performing model in the literature. Overall, this paper elucidates
existing DL-based vulnerability prediction systems' potential issues and draws
a roadmap for future DL-based vulnerability prediction research. In that
spirit, we make available all the artifacts supporting our results:

this paper is to prove the bound $\|V(t)\|_{H^1}\le c$ for any
$t\in\mathbb{R}_+$, where $c$ depends on data. The proof is divided into two
steps. In the first step the Lam\'e system with a special version of the
convective term is considered. The system has two viscosities. Assuming that
the second viscosity (the bulk one) is sufficiently large we are able to prove
the existence of global regular solutions to this system. The proof is divided
into two steps. First the long time existence in interval $(0,T)$ is proved,
where $T$ is proportional to the bulk viscosity. Having the bulk viscosity
large we are able to show that data at time $T$ are sufficiently small. Then by
the small data arguments a global existence follows. In this paper we are
restricted to derive appropriate estimates only. To prove the existence we
should use the method of successive approximations and the continuation
argument. Let $v$ be a solution to it. In the second step we consider a problem
for $u=v-V$. Assuming that $\|u\|_{H^1}$ at $t=0$ is sufficiently small we show
that $\|u(t)\|_{H^1}$ is also sufficiently small for any $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$.
Estimates for $v$ and $u$ in $H^1$ imply estimate for $\|V(t)\|_{H^1}$ for any

enough point features and, hence, the performance of these solutions drops
drastically. An alternative for human-made scenarios, due to their structural
regularity, is the use of geometrical cues such as straight segments,
frequently present within these environments. Under this context, in this paper
we introduce LiPo-LCD, a novel appearance-based loop closure detection method
that integrates lines and points. Adopting the idea of incremental
Bag-of-Binary-Words schemes, we build separate BoW models for each feature, and
use them to retrieve previously seen images using a late fusion strategy.
Additionally, a simple but effective mechanism, based on the concept of island,
groups similar images close in time to reduce the image candidate search
effort. A final step validates geometrically the loop candidates by
incorporating the detected lines by means of a process comprising a line
feature matching stage, followed by a robust spatial verification stage, now
combining both lines and points. As it is reported in the paper, LiPo-LCD
compares well with several state-of-the-art solutions for a number of datasets

nm-thick dielectric. Although recently detected in the far-field regime,
optical near-fields of this mode are yet to be observed and characterized.
Direct optical probing of the plasmonic fields reflected by the edges of
graphene via near-field scattering microscope reveals a relatively small
damping rate of the mid-IR acoustic plasmons in our devices, which allows for
their real-space mapping even with unprotected, chemically grown, large-area
graphene at ambient conditions. We show an acoustic mode that is twice as
confined - yet 1.4 times less damped - compared to the graphene surface plasmon
under similar conditions. We also image the resonant acoustic Bloch state in a
1D array of gold nanoribbons responsible for the high efficiency of the
far-field coupling. Our results highlight the importance of acoustic plasmons
as an exceptionally promising platform for large-area graphene-based
optoelectronic devices operating in mid-IR.
