preventing their application in many sensitive domains. Hence, many
methodologies for explaining machine learning models have been proposed to
address this problem. In this work, we introduce strategies to improve local
explanations taking into account the distribution of the data used to train the
black-box models. We show that our approach, MeLIME, produces more meaningful
explanations compared to other techniques over different ML models, operating
on various types of data. MeLIME generalizes the LIME method, allowing more
flexible perturbation sampling and the use of different local interpretable
models. Additionally, we introduce modifications to standard training
algorithms of local interpretable models fostering more robust explanations,
even allowing the production of counterfactual examples. To show the strengths
of the proposed approach, we include experiments on tabular data, images, and
text; all showing improved explanations. In particular, MeLIME generated more
meaningful explanations on the MNIST dataset than methods such as
GuidedBackprop, SmoothGrad, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. MeLIME is

triplet state 2$^3$S, has been suggested as an excellent probe for the extended
atmospheres of hot Jupiters and their hydrodynamic escape processes, and has
recently been detected in the transmission spectra of a handful of planets. The
isotropic re-emission will lead to helium airglow that may be observable at
other orbital phases. The goal of this paper is to investigate the
detectability of He I emission at 10830 {\AA} in the atmospheres of exoplanets
using high-resolution spectroscopy, providing insights into the properties of
the upper atmospheres of close-in gas giants. We estimated the expected
strength of He I emission in hot Jupiters based on their transmission signal.
We searched for the He I 10830 {\AA} emission feature in tau Boo b in three
nights of high-resolution spectra taken by CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto
telescope. The spectra from each night were corrected for telluric absorption,
sky emission lines, and stellar features, and were shifted to the planetary
rest frame to search for the emission. The He I emission is not detected in tau
Boo b, reaching a 5 sigma contrast limit of 4$\times$10$^{-4}$ for emission
line widths above 20 km/s. This is roughly a factor of 8 above the expected
level of emission (assuming a typical He I transit absorption of 1% for hot
Jupiters). This suggests that targeting the He I emission with well-designed
observations using upcoming instruments such as VLT/CRIRES+ and E-ELT/HIRES is
possible.

problems where items must be fairly divided among agents having individual
preferences. In comparison, fairness in settings with preferences on both
sides, that is, where agents have to be matched to other agents, has received
much less attention. Moreover, two-sided matching literature has largely
focused on ordinal preferences. This paper initiates the study of fairness in
stable many-to-one matchings under cardinal valuations. Motivated by real-world
settings, we study leximin optimality over stable many-to-one matchings. We
first investigate matching problems with ranked valuations where all agents on
each side have the same preference orders or rankings over the agents on the
other side (but not necessarily the same valuations). Here, we provide a
complete characterisation of the space of stable matchings. This leads to FaSt,
a novel and efficient algorithm to compute a leximin optimal stable matching
under ranked isometric valuations (where, for each pair of agents, the
valuation of one agent for the other is the same). Building upon FaSt, we
present an efficient algorithm, FaSt-Gen, that finds the leximin optimal stable
matching for a more general ranked setting. When there are exactly two agents
on one side who may be matched to many agents on the other, strict preferences
are enough to guarantee an efficient algorithm. We next establish that, in the
absence of rankings and under strict preferences (with no restriction on the
number of agents on either side), finding a leximin optimal stable matching is
NP-Hard. Further, with weak rankings, the problem is strongly NP-Hard, even
under isometric valuations. In fact, when additivity and non-negativity are the
only assumptions, we show that, unless P=NP, no efficient polynomial factor
approximation is possible.

a *-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space which is closed with
respect to the topology induced by the operator norm. Hence, the C*-algebras
furnish an axiomatisation of the structure of those operator algebras. In fact,
the axiomatisation is complete in the sense that the entire structural
information considered on the closed *-algebra -- namely addition, scalar
multiplication, adjunction and composition of operators as well as the operator
norm -- is reflected in the C*-algebra. From this point of view, we treat
Von-Neumann algebras, another class of operator algebras also defined as closed
*-algebras, but with respect to another topology -- one possibility is the weak
operator topology. The problem asking for an axiomatisation of Von-Neumann
algebras was solved by S. Sakai who introduced so-called W*-algebras. They are
C*-algebras which, considered as a Banach space, are isometrically isomorphic
to the dual space of another Banach space called the predual. Sakai's theorem
asserts that the W*-algebras provide an axiomatisation of Von-Neumann algebras.
In this master's thesis, we give a proof of Sakai's theorem. In fact, we
provide a stronger version of Sakai's theorem which shows that W*-algebras
indeed form a complete axiomatisation analogous to the situation for
C*-algebras. Additionally, we show uniqueness of the predual up to isometric
isomorphism, simplifying Sakai's original proof by using our strengthened
version of Sakai's theorem.

quantification, where we ask the question: How much can we trust a deep neural
network? In this study, we take a step towards simple, interpretable metrics
for trust quantification by introducing a suite of metrics for assessing the
overall trustworthiness of deep neural networks based on their behaviour when
answering a set of questions. We conduct a thought experiment and explore two
key questions about trust in relation to confidence: 1) How much trust do we
have in actors who give wrong answers with great confidence? and 2) How much
trust do we have in actors who give right answers hesitantly? Based on insights
gained, we introduce the concept of question-answer trust to quantify
trustworthiness of an individual answer based on confident behaviour under
correct and incorrect answer scenarios, and the concept of trust density to
characterize the distribution of overall trust for an individual answer
scenario. We further introduce the concept of trust spectrum for representing
overall trust with respect to the spectrum of possible answer scenarios across
correctly and incorrectly answered questions. Finally, we introduce
NetTrustScore, a scalar metric summarizing overall trustworthiness. The suite
of metrics aligns with past social psychology studies that study the
relationship between trust and confidence. Leveraging these metrics, we
quantify the trustworthiness of several well-known deep neural network
architectures for image recognition to get a deeper understanding of where
trust breaks down. The proposed metrics are by no means perfect, but the hope
is to push the conversation towards better metrics to help guide practitioners

which have found tremendous success in control, signal processing, and machine
learning problems, where such methods, due to their simplicity, serve as the
first method of choice for many complex inference and training tasks. In
particular, we provide a general framework of decentralized first-order methods
that is applicable to undirected and directed communication networks alike, and
show that much of the existing work on optimization and consensus can be
related explicitly to this framework. We further extend the discussion to
decentralized stochastic first-order methods that rely on stochastic gradients
at each node and describe how local variance reduction schemes, previously
shown to have promise in the centralized settings, are able to improve the
performance of decentralized methods when combined with what is known as
gradient tracking. We motivate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
corresponding methods in the context of machine learning and signal processing
problems that arise in decentralized environments.

designing three-dimensional (3D) compliant mechanisms and loadbearing

To ensure continuous transition of pressure loads as the design evolves, the
flow coefficient of a finite element is defined using a smooth Heaviside
function. The obtained pressure field is converted into consistent nodal loads
using a transformation matrix. The presented approach employs the standard
finite element formulation and also, allows consistent and computationally
inexpensive calculation of load sensitivities using the adjoint-variable
method. For compliant mechanism design, a multi-criteria objective is
minimized, whereas minimization of compliance is performed for designing
loadbearing structures. Efficacy and robustness of the presented approach is
demonstrated by designing various pressure-actuated 3D compliant mechanisms and
structures.

allows an unhampered passage of humans and vehicles, the interaction of this
traffic with an air curtain is not well understood. We study this problem by
conducting small-scale waterbath experiments with fresh water and salt water
solutions. As a model of human passage, a vertical cylinder is pulled through a
planar jet representing an air curtain and separating two zones at different
densities. For a fixed travel distance of the cylinder before and after the air
curtain, the average infiltration flux of dense fluid in light fluid side
increases with increasing cylinder velocity. However, we find that the
infiltration flux is independent of density difference across the doorway and
the travel direction of the cylinder. As a consequence, the sealing
effectiveness of an air curtain reduces with an increasing cylinder speed and
this reduction is independent of the direction of the buoyancy-driven flow. Dye
visualisations of the air curtain and the cylinder wake are used to examine the
re-establishment process of the air curtain after its disruption by the
cylinder. We observe that the re-establishment time of the air curtain and the

sensitivity, and specificity are equal to 1 for most of the different tumor
types even with a modest amount of data, and the same method works well on a

samples too. Our system can be used in practice because once the classifier is
trained, it can be used to classify any new sample of new potential patients.
One advantage of our work is that the aforementioned perfect precision and
recall are obtained on samples of all stages including very early stages of
cancer; therefore, it is a promising tool for diagnosis of cancers in early
stages. Another advantage of our novel model is that it works with normalized

Propagation Method (SSBPM) suggests that spatial Modulation Instabilty (MI) can

discrete plasmon solitons rather than the diffracted profile resulted for the
modest nonlinearity. Adding then the temporal variations to the nonlinear
amplitude equation and solving numerically by predictor-corrector method, it is
revealed that temporal MI appears as ultrashort pulse trains with

waveguide can be assumed as a spasing system-assuming the large nonlinearity
regime-in which if the coupling depth is raised, the character of MI will be
changed from the convective to absolute and the amplitude of SPPs will grow
fast. The procedure can be even chaotic and unpredictable. This spasing system

  Catheter",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) is a powerful imaging modality for
guiding electrophysiology and structural heart interventions. ICE provides
real-time observation of anatomy, catheters, and emergent complications.
However, this increased reliance on intraprocedural imaging creates a high
cognitive demand on physicians who can often serve as interventionalist and
imager. We present a robotic manipulator for ICE catheters to assist physicians
with imaging and serve as a platform for developing processes for procedural
automation. Herein, we introduce two application modules towards these goals:
(1) a view recovery process that allows physicians to save views during
intervention and automatically return with the push of a button and (2) a
data-driven approach to compensate kinematic model errors that result from
non-linear behaviors in catheter bending, providing more precise control of the
catheter tip. View recovery is validated by repeated catheter positioning in
cardiac phantom and animal experiments with position- and image-based analysis.
We present a simplified calibration approach for error compensation and verify
with complex rotation of the catheter in benchtop and phantom experiments under
varying realistic curvature conditions. Results support that a robotic
manipulator for ICE can provide an efficient and reproducible tool, potentially
reducing execution time and promoting greater utilization of ICE imaging.

epidemiology: estimating the empirical rate of transmission during an outbreak
(formally, the time-varying reproduction number) from case counts. While
standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state
scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial
observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools
or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of
infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual
tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they
are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial
observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior
over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations
sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our
framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody,
antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional
screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens
or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this
challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method
which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective.
Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method
produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for
estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.

based on our series of works in this field. Our first result is the development
of a generic theoretical mechanism responsible for the generation of chaos in
an arbitrary Bohmian system (in 2 and 3 dimensions). This mechanism allows us
to explore the effect of chaos on Bohmian trajectories and study in detail
(both analytically and numerically) the different kinds of Bohmian trajectories
where, in general, chaos and order coexist. Finally we explore the effect of
quantum entanglement on the evolution of the Bohmian trajectories and study
chaos and ergodicity in qubit systems which are of great theoretical and
practical interest. We find that the chaotic trajectories are also ergodic,
i.e. they give the same final distribution of their points after a long time
regardless of their initial conditions. In the case of strong entanglement most
trajectories are chaotic and ergodic and an arbitrary initial distribution of
particles will tends to Born's rule over the course of time. On the other hand,
in the case of weak entanglement the distribution of Born's rule is dominated
by ordered trajectories and consequently an arbitrary initial configuration of
particles will not tend, in general, to Born's rule, unless it is initially
satisfied. Our results shed light on a fundamental problem in Bohmian
Mechanics, namely whether there is a dynamical approximation of Born's rule by
an arbitrary initial distribution of Bohmian particles.

receiving a reparative batch and order overlapping in a fuzzy environment by
employing triangular fuzzy numbers. It is assumed that the imperfect items
identified by screening are divided into either scrap or reworkable items. The
reworkable items are kept in store until the next items are received.
Afterward, the items are returned to the supplier to be reworked. Also, a
discount on the purchasing cost is employed as an offer of cooperation from a
supplier to a buyer to compensate for all additional holding costs incurred to
the buyer. The rework process is error-free. An order overlapping scheme is
employed so that the vendor is allowed to use the previous shipment to meet the
demand by the inspection period. In the fuzzy model, the graded mean
integration method is taken to defuzzify the model and determine its
approximation of a profit function and optimal policy. In doing so, numerical
examples are rendered to represent the model behavior and, eventually, the
sensitivity analysis is presented.

randomized experiment with covariates, classical nonparametric tests based on
ranks of observations/residuals have been employed (eg: by Rosenbaum), with
finite-sample valid inference enabled via permutations. This paper proposes a
different principle on which to base inference: if -- with access to all
covariates and outcomes, but without access to any treatment assignments -- one
can form a ranking of the subjects that is sufficiently nonrandom (eg: mostly
treated followed by mostly control), then we can confidently conclude that
there must be a treatment effect. Based on a more nuanced, quantifiable,
version of this principle, we design an interactive test called i-bet: the
analyst forms a single permutation of the subjects one element at a time, and
at each step the analyst bets toy money on whether that subject was actually
treated or not, and learns the truth immediately after. The wealth process
forms a real-valued measure of evidence against the global causal null, and we
may reject the null at level $\alpha$ if the wealth ever crosses $1/\alpha$.
Apart from providing a fresh ""game-theoretic"" principle on which to base the
causal conclusion, the i-bet has other statistical and computational benefits,
for example (A) allowing a human to adaptively design the test statistic based
on increasing amounts of data being revealed (along with any working causal
models and prior knowledge), and (B) not requiring permutation resampling,
instead noting that under the null, the wealth forms a nonnegative martingale,
and the type-1 error control of the aforementioned decision rule follows from a
tight inequality by Ville. Further, if the null is not rejected, new subjects
can later be added and the test can be simply continued, without any
corrections (unlike with permutation p-values).

actual deployment of THz lies in its inherent huge attenuation. Intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) represent
two effective solutions for compensating the large pathloss in THz systems. In
this paper, we consider an IRS-aided multi-user THz MIMO system with orthogonal
frequency division multiple access, where the sparse radio frequency chain
antenna structure is adopted for reducing the power consumption. The objective
is to maximize the weighted sum rate via jointly optimizing the hybrid
analog/digital beamforming at the base station and reflection matrix at the
IRS. {Since the analog beamforming and reflection matrix need to cater all
users and subcarriers, it is difficult to directly solve the formulated
problem, and thus, an alternatively iterative optimization algorithm is
proposed.} Specifically, the analog beamforming is designed by solving a MIMO
capacity maximization problem, while the digital beamforming and reflection
matrix optimization are both tackled using semidefinite relaxation technique.
Considering that obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is a
challenging task in IRS-based systems, we further explore the case with the
imperfect CSI for the channels from the IRS to users. Under this setup, we
propose a robust beamforming and reflection matrix design scheme for the
originally formulated non-convex optimization problem. Finally, simulation
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.

  with Motion Correction Using Convolutional Neural Network","Accepted to MICCAI 2020",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Patlak model is widely used in 18F-FDG dynamic positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging, where the estimated parametric images reveal important
biochemical and physiology information. Because of better noise modeling and
more information extracted from raw sinogram, direct Patlak reconstruction
gains its popularity over the indirect approach which utilizes reconstructed
dynamic PET images alone. As the prerequisite of direct Patlak methods, raw
data from dynamic PET are rarely stored in clinics and difficult to obtain. In
addition, the direct reconstruction is time-consuming due to the bottleneck of
multiple-frame reconstruction. All of these impede the clinical adoption of
direct Patlak reconstruction.In this work, we proposed a data-driven framework
which maps the dynamic PET images to the high-quality motion-corrected direct
Patlak images through a convolutional neural network. For the patient motion
during the long period of dynamic PET scan, we combined the correction with the
backward/forward projection in direct reconstruction to better fit the
statistical model. Results based on fifteen clinical 18F-FDG dynamic brain PET
datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework over Gaussian,
nonlocal mean and BM4D denoising, regarding the image bias and
contrast-to-noise ratio.

to the product of temperature and Seebeck coefficient is a fundamental
principle in thermoelectricity. It has been regarded as an important
application and direct experimental verification of Onsager reciprocal relation
(ORR) that is a cornerstone of irreversible thermodynamics. However, some
critical questions still remain: why Kelvin's proof that omits all
irreversibility within a thermoelectric transport process can reach the correct
result, how to properly select the generalized-force-flux pairs for deriving
the first Kelvin relation from ORR, and whether the first Kelvin relation is
restricted by the requirement of linear transport regime. The present work is
to answer these questions based on the fundamental thermodynamic principles.
Since the thermoelectric effects are reversible, we can redefine the Seebeck
and Peltier coefficients using the quantities in reversible processes with no
time derivative involved, which are renamed as ""reversible Seebeck and Peltier
coefficients"". The relation between them (called ""the reversible reciprocal
relation of thermoelectricity"") is derived from the Maxwell relations, which
can be reduced to the conventional Kelvin relation, when the local equilibrium
assumption (LEA) is adopted. In this sense, the validity of the first Kelvin
relation is guaranteed by the reversible thermodynamic principles and LEA,
without the requirement of linear transport process. Additionally, the
generalized force-flux pairs to obtain the first Kelvin relation from ORR can
be proper both mathematically and thermodynamically, only when they correspond
to the conjugate-variable pairs of which Maxwell relations can yield the
reversible reciprocal relation. The present theoretical framework can be
further extended to other coupled phenomena.

attention cube network (A-CubeNet) for image restoration for more powerful
feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically, we design a
novel attention mechanism from three dimensions, namely spatial dimension,
channel-wise dimension and hierarchical dimension. The adaptive spatial
attention branch (ASAB) and the adaptive channel attention branch (ACAB)
constitute the adaptive dual attention module (ADAM), which can capture the
long-range spatial and channel-wise contextual information to expand the
receptive field and distinguish different types of information for more
effective feature representations. Furthermore, the adaptive hierarchical
attention module (AHAM) can capture the long-range hierarchical contextual
information to flexibly aggregate different feature maps by weights depending
on the global context. The ADAM and AHAM cooperate to form an ""attention in

Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art

parts: 1) A data-driven model identification component to learn a linear
approximation between reference signals given to an existing lower-level
controller and uncertain time-varying plant outputs. 2) A higher-level
controller component that utilizes the identified approximation and wraps
around the existing controller for the system to handle modeling errors and
environment uncertainties during system deployment.
  We derive loose and tight bounds for the identified approximation's
sensitivity to noisy data. Further, we show that adding the higher-level
controller maintains the original system's stability. A benefit of the proposed
approach is that it requires only a small amount of observations on states and
inputs, and it thus works online; that feature makes our approach appealing to
robotics applications where real-time operation is critical. The efficacy of
the DHC structure is demonstrated in simulation and is validated experimentally

demonstrated how the mean magnetic field orientation relative to the global

distribution reported earlier, we show here that the mass cumulative function

closer to the field direction tends to have a shallower MCF, in other words, a
higher portion of the gas in high density. The evidence is consistent with our

In many real-world problems, the number of labeled graphs available for
training classification models is limited, which renders these models prone to
overfitting. To address this problem, we propose two approaches based on
contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) to alleviate overfitting. In the
first approach, we use CSSL to pretrain graph encoders on widely-available
unlabeled graphs without relying on human-provided labels, then finetune the
pretrained encoders on labeled graphs. In the second approach, we develop a
regularizer based on CSSL, and solve the supervised classification task and the
unsupervised CSSL task simultaneously. To perform CSSL on graphs, given a
collection of original graphs, we perform data augmentation to create augmented
graphs out of the original graphs. An augmented graph is created by
consecutively applying a sequence of graph alteration operations. A contrastive
loss is defined to learn graph encoders by judging whether two augmented graphs
are from the same original graph. Experiments on various graph classification
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

use GL, we aimed to become aware of the criteria to assess the credibility of
their use, as well as the benefits and challenges. Method: We surveyed 76
active SE researchers participants of a flagship SE conference in Brazil, using
a questionnaire with 11 questions to share their views on the use of GL in the
context of SE research. We followed a qualitative approach to analyze open
questions. Results: We found that most surveyed researchers use GL mainly to
understand new topics. Our work identified new findings, including: 1) GL
sources used by SE researchers (e.g., blogs, community website); 2) motivations
to use (e.g., to understand problems and to complement research findings) or
reasons to avoid GL (e.g., lack of reliability, lack of scientific value); 3)
the benefit that is easy to access and read GL and the challenge of GL to have
its scientific value recognized; and 4) criteria to assess GL credibility,
showing the importance of the content owner to be renowned (e.g., renowned

an all-powerful eavesdropper in secret key distillation. However the assumption

In this paper we study the realistic application model of secret key
distillation over satellite-to-satellite free space channel in which we impose
a reasonable restriction on the eavesdropper by setting an exclusion zone
around the legitimate receiver as a defense strategy. We first study the case
where the eavesdropper's aperture size is unlimited so her power is only
restricted by the exclusion zone. Then we limit Eve's aperture to a finite size
and study the straightforward case when her aperture is in the same plane of
Bob, investigating how an exclusion zone can help improve security.
Correspondingly, we determine the secret key rate lower bounds as well as upper
bounds. Further more, we also apply our results on specific discrete variable
(DV) and continuous variable (CV) protocols for comparison. We show that by
putting reasonable restrictions on the eavesdropper through the realistic
assumptions of an inaccessible exclusion zone, we can increase the key rate in
comparison to those without and do so with relatively lower transmission
frequency. We conclude that this model is suitable for extended analysis in
many light gathering scenarios and for different carrier wavelengths.

the second part comprises the data of a pilot study, which took place in July

use in a competitive team-based game, and search for useful lessons for
structuring communication protocol between autonomous agents. We construct
Pow-Wow, a new dataset for studying situated goal-directed human communication.
Using the Pommerman game environment, we enlisted teams of humans to play
against teams of AI agents, recording their observations, actions, and
communications. We analyze the types of communications which result in
effective game strategies, annotate them accordingly, and present corpus-level
statistical analysis of how trends in communications affect game outcomes.
Based on this analysis, we design a communication policy for learning agents,
and show that agents which utilize communication achieve higher win-rates
against baseline systems than those which do not.

investigated vigorously in various remote sensing applications. However, it is

effect embedded in the PolSAR imaging process, which greatly degrades the
quality of the images and further complicates the classification. To this end,
we present a novel PolSAR image classification method, which removes speckle
noise via low-rank (LR) feature extraction and enforces smoothness priors via
Markov random field (MRF). Specifically, we employ the mixture of
Gaussian-based robust LR matrix factorization to simultaneously extract
discriminative features and remove complex noises. Then, a classification map
is obtained by applying convolutional neural network with data augmentation on
the extracted features, where local consistency is implicitly involved, and the
insufficient label issue is alleviated. Finally, we refine the classification
map by MRF to enforce contextual smoothness. We conduct experiments on two
benchmark PolSAR datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method achieves promising classification performance and preferable spatial

this work, we study, for the first time, automatic contact detection when the

a novel, private, and fully distributed WiFi-based approach called vContact.
Users installing an app continuously scan WiFi and store its hashed IDs. Given
a confirmed case, the signals of the major places he/she visited are then
uploaded to a server and matched with the stored signals of users to detect
contact. vContact is not based on phone pairing, and no information of any

demonstrate that vContact is efficient and robust for contact detection. The

effects on quantum statistics for particles moving on it. Here, we have
undertaken the first step towards realizing the emerging fractional statistics
for particles restricted to move on the sphere, instead of on the plane. We
show that such a model arises naturally in the context of quantum impurity
problems. In particular, we demonstrate a setup in which the lowest-energy
spectrum of two linear bosonic/fermionic molecules immersed in a quantum
many-particle environment can coincide with the anyonic spectrum on the sphere.
This paves the way towards experimental realization of anyons on the sphere
using molecular impurities. Furthermore, since a change in the alignment of the
molecules corresponds to the exchange of the particles on the sphere, such a
realization reveals a novel type of exclusion principle for molecular
impurities, which could also be of use as a powerful technique to measure the
statistics parameter. Finally, our approach opens up a new numerical route to
investigate the spectra of many anyons on the sphere. Accordingly, we present
the spectrum of two anyons on the sphere in the presence of a Dirac monopole

storage, thermoelectrics, and spintronics. Using a combination of statistical
design of experiments and density functional theory, we clarify how the
out-of-equilibrium van der Waals epitaxial deposition methods can improve the
crystal quality of Sb2Te3 films. We compare films grown by radio frequency
sputtering and pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The growth factors that influence
the crystal quality for each method are different. For PLD grown films a thin
amorphous Sb2Te3 seed layer most significantly influences the crystal quality.
In contrast, the crystalline quality of films grown by sputtering is rather
sensitive to the deposition temperature and less affected by the presence of a
seed layer. This difference is somewhat surprising as both methods are
out-of-thermal-equilibrium plasma-based methods. Non-adiabatic quantum
molecular dynamics simulations show that this difference originates from the
density of excited atoms in the plasma. The PLD plasma is more intense and with
higher energy than that used in sputtering, and this increases the electronic
temperature of the deposited atoms, which concomitantly increases the adatom
diffusion lengths in PLD. In contrast, the adatom diffusivity is dominated by
the thermal temperature for sputter grown films. These results explain the wide
range of Sb2Te3 and superlattice crystal qualities observed in the literature.
These results indicate that, contrary to popular belief, plasma-based
deposition methods are suitable for growing high quality crystalline

BoostingBERT achieves new state-of-the-art results in several NLP Tasks. We

optimize the transmit beamforming, adaptive to the channel state information

compute a closed-form solution of the optimal transmit and receive beamforming.
In addition, we propose a practical RF combining circuit using RF phase shifter

to CSI. We also analytically derive the scaling laws of the output DC power as
a function of the number of transmit and receive antennas. Those scaling laws
confirm the benefits of using multiple antennas at the transmitter or receiver.
They also highlight that RF combining significantly outperforms DC combining
since it leverages the rectenna nonlinearity more efficiently. Two types of
performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and based on
realistic and accurate rectenna circuit simulations, are provided. The
evaluations demonstrate that the output DC power can be linearly increased by

addressed from the standpoint of heterogeneous elasticity, namely the spatial
fluctuations of elastic constants caused by the structural disorder of the
amorphous materials. In the first part of this review article a mathematical
analogy between diffusive motion in a disordered environment and a scalar
simplification of vibrational motion under the same condition is emploited. We
demonstrate that the disorder-induced long-time tails of diffusion correspond
to the Rayleigh scattering law in the vibrational system and that the
cross-over from normal to anomalous diffusion corresponds to the boson peak.
The anomalous motion arises as soon as the disorder-induced self-energy exceeds
the frequency-independent diffusivity/elasticity. For this model a variational
scheme is emploited for deriving two mean-field theories of disorder, the
self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) and coherent-potential approximation
(CPA). The former applies if the fluctuations are weak and Gaussian, the latter
applies for stronger and non-Gaussian fluctuations. In the second part the
vectorial theory of heterogenous elasticity is presented and solved in SCBA and
CPA, introduced for the scalar model. Both approaches predict and explain the
boson-peak and the associated anomalies, namely a dip in the acoustic phase
velocity and a characteristic strong increase of the acoustic attenuation below
the boson peak. Explicit expressions for the density of states and the
inelastic Raman, neutron and X-ray scattering laws are given. Recent
conflicting ways of explaining the boson-peak anomalies are discussed.

the large discrepancy between the source domain and the target domain. To
reduce the domain discrepancy, existing methods mainly attempt to generate
pseudo labels for unlabeled target images by clustering algorithms. However,
clustering methods tend to bring noisy labels and the rich fine-grained details
in unlabeled images are not sufficiently exploited. In this paper, we seek to
improve the quality of labels by capturing feature representation from multiple
augmented views of unlabeled images. To this end, we propose a Self-Supervised
Knowledge Distillation (SSKD) technique containing two modules, the identity
learning and the soft label learning. Identity learning explores the
relationship between unlabeled samples and predicts their one-hot labels by
clustering to give exact information for confidently distinguished images. Soft
label learning regards labels as a distribution and induces an image to be
associated with several related classes for training peer network in a
self-supervised manner, where the slowly evolving network is a core to obtain
soft labels as a gentle constraint for reliable images. Finally, the two
modules can resist label noise for re-ID by enhancing each other and
systematically integrating label information from unlabeled images. Extensive
experiments on several adaptation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches by large margins.

this twistor distribution has exactly two integral leaves and is `maximally

result establishes a simple correspondence between the anti-self-dual Weyl
tensor of a pKE metric with non-vanishing Einstein constant and the Cartan
quartic of the associated twistor distribution. This will be followed by a

shown to be much more involved. We use Cartan's method of equivalence to
produce a large number of explicit examples of pKE metrics with nonvanishing
Einstein constant whose anti-self-dual Weyl tensor have special real Petrov

classification. Combined with the main result, this produces twistor
distributions whose Cartan quartic has the same algebraic type as the Petrov
type of the constructed pKE metrics. In a similar manner, one can obtain
twistor distributions with Cartan quartic of arbitrary algebraic type. As a
byproduct of our pKE examples we naturally obtain para-Sasaki-Einstein metrics

associated to certain classes of pKE 4-dimensional metrics. We observe that in
some geometrically distinguished cases the corresponding \emph{Cartan
connections} satisfy the Yang-Mills equations. We then provide explicit

secrecy outage probability (SOP), the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity

$\textit{WISE}$ AGN region. We find that the BPT and $\textit{WISE}$ diagrams
agree on the classification for 85$\%$ and 8$\%$ of the galaxies as non-AGN
(star forming = SF) and AGN, respectively, and disagree on $\sim$7$\%$ of the
entire classified sample. 39$\%$ of the AGN (all types) are broad-line systems
for which the [\ion{N}{ii}] and [H$\alpha$] fluxes can barely be disentangled,
giving in most cases spurious [\ion{N}{ii}]/[H$\alpha$] flux ratios. However,
several optical AGN appear to be completely consistent with SF in
$\textit{WISE}$. We argue that these could be low power AGN, or systems whose
hosts dominate the IR emission. Alternatively, given the sometimes high
[\ion{O}{iii}] luminosity in these galaxies, the emission lines may be
generated by shocks coming from super-winds associated with SF rather than the
AGN activity. Based on our findings, we have created a new diagnostic: [W1-W2]
vs [\ion{N}{ii}]/[H$\alpha$], which has the virtue of separating SF from AGN
and high-excitation sources. It classifies 3$\sim$5 times more galaxies than

in which we use multi-resolution representations instead of single-resolution
representations for both the input flow maps and the output motion features of
the MV encoder. To handle complex or simple motion patterns globally, our
frame-level scheme RaFC-frame automatically decides the optimal flow map
resolution for each video frame. To cope different types of motion patterns
locally, our block-level scheme called RaFC-block can also select the optimal
resolution for each local block of motion features. In addition, the
rate-distortion criterion is applied to both RaFC-frame and RaFC-block and
select the optimal motion coding mode for effective flow coding. Comprehensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets HEVC, VTL, UVG and MCL-JCV clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness of our overall RaFC framework after combing

(OSC) devices such as photovoltaics, photodetectors, and photocatalytic
systems. However, photo-generated excitons in OSC films mostly occupy highly
localized states over their lifetime. Energy transport is hence thought to be
mainly mediated by the site-to-site hopping of localized excitons, limiting
exciton diffusion coefficients to below ~10^{-2} cm^2/s with corresponding
diffusion lengths below ~50 nm. Here, using ultrafast optical microscopy
combined with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we present evidence
for a new highly-efficient energy transport regime: transient exciton
delocalization, where energy exchange with vibrational modes allows excitons to
temporarily re-access spatially extended states under equilibrium conditions.
In films of highly-ordered poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofibers, prepared using
living crystallization-driven self-assembly, we show that this enables exciton
diffusion constants up to 1.1+-0.1 cm^2/s and diffusion lengths of 300+-50 nm.
Our results reveal the dynamic interplay between localized and delocalized
exciton configurations at equilibrium conditions, calling for a re-evaluation
of the basic picture of exciton dynamics. This establishes new design rules to
engineer efficient energy transport in OSC films, which will enable new devices
architectures not based on restrictive bulk heterojunctions.

focus on understanding the minimax statistical limits of IL in episodic Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). We first consider the setting where the learner is
provided a dataset of $N$ expert trajectories ahead of time, and cannot
interact with the MDP. Here, we show that the policy which mimics the expert
whenever possible is in expectation $\lesssim \frac{|\mathcal{S}| H^2 \log
(N)}{N}$ suboptimal compared to the value of the expert, even when the expert
follows an arbitrary stochastic policy. Here $\mathcal{S}$ is the state space,
and $H$ is the length of the episode. Furthermore, we establish a suboptimality
lower bound of $\gtrsim |\mathcal{S}| H^2 / N$ which applies even if the expert
is constrained to be deterministic, or if the learner is allowed to actively
query the expert at visited states while interacting with the MDP for $N$
episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with suboptimality
having no dependence on the number of actions, under no additional assumptions.
We then propose a novel algorithm based on minimum-distance functionals in the
setting where the transition model is given and the expert is deterministic.
The algorithm is suboptimal by $\lesssim \min \{ H \sqrt{|\mathcal{S}| / N} ,\
|\mathcal{S}| H^{3/2} / N \}$, showing that knowledge of transition improves
the minimax rate by at least a $\sqrt{H}$ factor.

However, the previous literature fails to involve question information together
with high-order question-skill correlations, which is mostly limited by data
sparsity and multi-skill problems. From the model perspective, previous models
can hardly capture the long-term dependency of student exercise history, and
cannot model the interactions between student-questions, and student-skills in
a consistent way. In this paper, we propose a Graph-based Interaction model for
Knowledge Tracing (GIKT) to tackle the above probems. More specifically, GIKT
utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to substantially incorporate
question-skill correlations via embedding propagation. Besides, considering
that relevant questions are usually scattered throughout the exercise history,
and that question and skill are just different instantiations of knowledge,
GIKT generalizes the degree of students' master of the question to the
interactions between the student's current state, the student's history related
exercises, the target question, and related skills. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that GIKT achieves the new state-of-the-art performance,

used to generate a mesh of subsampled cloud points online. The generated mesh
is further used for surface normal computation of those points on the basis of
which surface segments are estimated. A novel descriptor to represent the
surface segments is proposed and utilized to determine the surface class of the

  In this article, we consider trees with matrix weights on their edges. More
precisely, we are interested in trees with the following classes of matrix edge
weights: 1. positive definite matrix weights, 2. lower (or upper) triangular
matrix weights with positive diagonal entries. For trees with the above classes
of matrix edge weights, we define Perron values and Perron branches. Further,
we have shown the existence of vertices satisfying properties analogous to the

potential barrier with probability 1 in the zero-energy limit, which is known
as the anomalous tunneling. In this paper, we investigate the tunneling
properties of quasiparticles in a dynamically unstable BEC. We prepare a
multi-component BEC (binary and spin-1 BEC) in a dynamically unstable state and
solve the tunneling problem of the spin-wave excitation from the condensate. We
find that the perfect transmission occurs even when the BEC is dynamically
unstable if the spin-wave is the NG mode. Here, the mode that exhibits the
perfect transmission is the dynamically unstable spin-wave mode, which is a
pure-imaginary-eigenvalue solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Hence,
we should take the zero-energy limit along not the real axis but the imaginary
axis. We also demonstrate the existence of the perfect reflection of a
dynamically unstable mode at the point where the imaginary part of the
eigenvalue takes its maximum. In this case, the incident and reflected waves
destructively interfere, and the amplitude of the quasiparticle wave function
is strongly suppressed. We numerically confirm that the perfect reflection is a
generic nature of dynamically unstable modes and not related to the NG mode.

this way, sensitive data does not leave the user devices. FL uses the FedAvg
algorithm, which is trained in the iterative model averaging way, on the
non-iid and unbalanced distributed data, without depending on the data
quantity. Some issues with the FL are, 1) no scalability, as the model is
iteratively trained over all the devices, which amplifies with device drops; 2)
security and privacy trade-off of the learning process still not robust enough
and 3) overall communication efficiency and the cost are higher. To mitigate
these challenges we present Federated Learning and Privately Scaling (FLaPS)
architecture, which improves scalability as well as the security and privacy of
the system. The devices are grouped into clusters which further gives better
privacy scaled turn around time to finish a round of training. Therefore, even
if a device gets dropped in the middle of training, the whole process can be
started again after a definite amount of time. The data and model both are
communicated using differentially private reports with iterative shuffling
which provides a better privacy-utility trade-off. We evaluated FLaPS on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and TINY-IMAGENET-200 dataset using various CNN models. Experimental
results prove FLaPS to be an improved, time and privacy scaled environment
having better and comparable after-learning-parameters with respect to the

achromatic diffractive lenses can cover a wide spectral range, limited only by
loss of efficiency caused by manufacturing limitations related to feature depth

provide near diffraction limited performance only at very low Fresnel numbers,

comparative analysis is conducted for various formulations of boundary
conditions in the representative volume element (RVE) with uniform and
isotropic distribution of CNTs. Three types of boundary conditions studied:
uniform boundary potentials for an RVE, uniform boundary potentials for a chain
of two RVEs, and periodic boundary potentials. It is demonstrated that to
calculate the electrical conductivity of the material correctly, the
implementation of periodic boundary conditions for the RVE is required; on the
contrary, the use of uniform boundary potentials leads to significant
overestimation in conductance. The sensitivity of average conductivity to the
RVE size is determined for different volume fractions (Vf) of CNTs. For
example, the 5 micrometer size of the RVE is found to be optimal for 1% Vf of
CNTs with 50 nm diameter and 5 micrometer average length. Beside the RVE size,
we verify how model output changes in response to tuning parameters of the CNT
geometry, such as curvature and torsion (twist). We find the presence of the
second parameter, torsion, to be imperative for correct conductivity modelling
since usage of the curvature alone leads to unavoidable dependence on segment
size during CNT discretization. In literature, the influence of intrinsic MWCNT
resistivity is often discarded as negligible due to ballistic transport of
electrons. To verify this assumption, we check the sensitivity of results to
finite resistivity of CNTs. Percolation threshold and the critical index are
calculated for different sets of model parameters. The model finite-size effect
on the percolation threshold is investigated.

involved Erbium ions, between 10$^{11}$ and 10$^{13}$, definitely identifies
the cooperative nature of the two pulsed emissions, that are generated by the

of the time interval between the paired pulses and, most importantly, its
correlation with the second pulse duration, demonstrate that the Erbium ions

  minutes book, which will be published in the Springer series CCIS -
  Communications in Computer and Information Science",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Astronomical databases currently provide high-volume spectroscopic and
photometric data. While spectroscopic data is better suited to the analysis of
many astronomical objects, photometric data is relatively easier to obtain due
to shorter telescope usage time. Therefore, there is a growing need to use
photometric information to automatically identify objects for further detailed
studies, specially H{\alpha} emission line stars such as Be stars. Photometric
color-color diagrams (CCDs) are commonly used to identify this kind of objects.
However, their identification in CCDs is further complicated by the reddening
effect caused by both the circumstellar and interstellar gas. This effect
prevents the generalization of candidate identification systems. Therefore, in
this work we evaluate the use of neural networks to identify Be star candidates
from a set of OB-type stars. The networks are trained using a labeled subset of
the VPHAS+ and 2MASS databases, with filters u, g, r, H{\alpha}, i, J, H, and
K. In order to avoid the reddening effect, we propose and evaluate the use of
reddening-free Q indices to enhance the generalization of the model to other
databases and objects. To test the validity of the approach, we manually
labeled a subset of the database, and use it to evaluate candidate
identification models. We also labeled an independent dataset for cross dataset
evaluation. We evaluate the recall of the models at a 99% precision level on
both test sets. Our results show that the proposed features provide a
significant improvement over the original filter magnitudes.

cationic arrangement in SNMO is reflected as the competition of long range
ferromagnetic (FM) and short scale antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions
originated from ordered Ni-O-Mn and disordered Ni-O-Ni or Mn-O-Mn bonds,
respectively, which leads to systematic shift in magnetic transition
temperature and drastic drop in saturation magnetization. In addition, we have
observed that the gradual increment in density of ASD leads to significant
deviation from uniaxial anisotropy character, reduction in anisotropy energy
and enhancement of moment pinning efficiency. However, the observed signatures
of $ Ni^{2+}+Mn^{4+} \longrightarrow Ni^{3+}+Mn^{3+} $ charge

candidate which is assumed to be a neutral scalar field. The favored mass
region of the dark matter is obtained by numerical computations of the relic
abundance and the cross section of the nucleon. We also investigate the

quantum mechanics based on a group theoretical construction from a
Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry with position and momentum operators transforming as
Minkowski four-vectors under the Lorentz symmetry. The basic representation is
identified as a coherent state representation, essentially an irreducible
component of the regular representation, with the matching representation of an
extension of the group $C^*$-algebra giving the algebra of observables. The key
feature of the formulation is that it is not unitary but pseudo-unitary,
exactly in the same sense as the Minkowski spacetime representation. The
language of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics is adopted for a clear
illustration of the aspect, with a metric operator obtained as really the
manifestation of the Minkowski metric on the space of the state vectors.
Explicit wavefunction description is given without any restriction of the
variable domains, yet with a finite integral inner product. The associated
covariant harmonic oscillator Fock state basis has all the standard properties
in exact analog to those of a harmonic oscillator with Euclidean position and
momentum operators of any `dimension'. Galilean limit of the Lorentz symmetry
and the classical limit are retrieved rigorously through appropriate symmetry
contractions of the algebra and its representation, including the dynamics
described through the symmetry of the phase space.

wireless power transfer (WPT) system with the objective to increase the output
DC power. We jointly optimize the multi-sine waveform and beamforming
accounting for the rectenna nonlinearity, and consider two combining schemes
for the rectennas at the receiver, namely DC and RF combinings. For DC
combining, the waveform and transmit beamforming are optimized, as a function
of the channel state information (CSI). For RF combining, the optimal transmit
and receive beamformings are provided in closed form and the waveform is
optimized. We also consider a practical RF combining circuit using phase
shifter and RF power combiner and optimize the waveform, transmit beamforming,
and analog receive beamforming adaptive to the CSI. Two types of performance
evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and accurate and realistic
circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the joint
waveform and beamforming design can increase the output DC power by leveraging
the beamforming gain, the frequency diversity gain, and the rectenna
nonlinearity. It also shows that the joint waveform and beamforming design
provides a higher output DC power than the beamforming-only design with a
relative gain of 180% in a two-transmit antenna sixteen-sinewave two-receive
antenna setup.

electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, specifically ocular, muscular, and
cardiac artifacts. Rejection of EEG artifacts is an essential process in EEG
analysis since such artifacts cause many problems in EEG signals analysis. One
of the most challenging issues in EEG denoising processes is removing the
ocular artifacts where Electrooculographic (EOG), and EEG signals have an
overlap in both frequency and time domains. In this paper, we build and train a
deep learning model to deal with this challenge and remove the ocular artifacts
effectively. In the proposed scheme, we convert each EEG signal to an image to
be fed to a U-NET model, which is a deep learning model usually used in image
segmentation tasks. We proposed three different schemes and made our U-NET
based models learn to purify contaminated EEG signals similar to the process
used in the image segmentation process. The results confirm that one of our
schemes can achieve a reliable and promising accuracy to reduce the Mean square
error between the target signal (Pure EEGs) and the predicted signal (Purified
EEGs).

framework for the discovery of parsimonious dynamic models and governing

noisy measurements compromise the accuracy and robustness of the model
discovery procedure. In this work, we develop a variant of the SINDy algorithm
that integrates automatic differentiation and recent time-stepping constrained
motivated by Rudy et al. for simultaneously (i) denoising the data, (ii)
learning and parametrizing the noise probability distribution, and (iii)
identifying the underlying parsimonious dynamical system responsible for
generating the time-series data. Thus within an integrated optimization
framework, noise can be separated from signal, resulting in an architecture
that is approximately twice as robust to noise as state-of-the-art methods,
handling as much as 40% noise on a given time-series signal and explicitly
parametrizing the noise probability distribution. We demonstrate this approach
on several numerical examples, from Lotka-Volterra models to the
spatio-temporal Lorenz 96 model. Further, we show the method can identify a
diversity of probability distributions including Gaussian, uniform, Gamma, and
Rayleigh.

for information transmission over wireless networks. Well-known networks based
on the Poisson point process model have limitations vis-a-vis network
efficiency, whereas strongly correlated alternatives, such as those based on
random matrix spectra (RMT), have tractability and robustness issues. In this
work, we demonstrate that network models based on random perturbations of
Euclidean lattices interpolate between Poisson and rigidly structured networks,
and allow us to achieve the best of both worlds : significantly improve upon
the Poisson model in terms of network efficacy measured by the Signal to
Interference plus Noise Ratio (abbrv. SINR) and the related concept of coverage
probabilities, at the same time retaining a considerable measure of
mathematical and computational simplicity and robustness to erasure and noise.
  We investigate the optimal choice of the base lattice in this model,
connecting it to the celebrated problem optimality of Euclidean lattices with
respect to the Epstein Zeta function, which is in turn related to notions of
lattice energy. This leads us to the choice of the triangular lattice in 2D and
face centered cubic lattice in 3D. We demonstrate that the coverage probability
decreases with increasing strength of perturbation, eventually converging to
that of the Poisson network. In the regime of low disorder, we approximately
characterize the statistical law of the coverage function.
  In 2D, we determine the disorder strength at which the PTL and the RMT
networks are the closest measured by comparing their network topologies via a
comparison of their Persistence Diagrams . We demonstrate that the PTL network
at this disorder strength can be taken to be an effective substitute for the
RMT network model, while at the same time offering the advantages of greater
tractability.

discuss contributions of statistics to the field of artificial intelligence
concerning methodological development, planning and design of studies,

  Short-texts Analysis","13 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Analysis of mobile app reviews has shown its important role in requirement
engineering, software maintenance and evolution of mobile apps. Mobile app
developers check their users' reviews frequently to clarify the issues
experienced by users or capture the new issues that are introduced due to a
recent app update. App reviews have a dynamic nature and their discussed topics
change over time. The changes in the topics among collected reviews for
different versions of an app can reveal important issues about the app update.
A main technique in this analysis is using topic modeling algorithms. However,
app reviews are short texts and it is challenging to unveil their latent topics
over time. Conventional topic models suffer from the sparsity of word
co-occurrence patterns while inferring topics for short texts. Furthermore,
these algorithms cannot capture topics over numerous consecutive time-slices.
Online topic modeling algorithms speed up the inference of topic models for the
texts collected in the latest time-slice by saving a fraction of data from the
previous time-slice. But these algorithms do not analyze the statistical-data
of all the previous time-slices, which can confer contributions to the topic
distribution of the current time-slice.
  We propose Adaptive Online Biterm Topic Model (AOBTM) to model topics in
short texts adaptively. AOBTM alleviates the sparsity problem in short-texts
and considers the statistical-data for an optimal number of previous
time-slices. We also propose parallel algorithms to automatically determine the
optimal number of topics and the best number of previous versions that should
be considered in topic inference phase. Automatic evaluation on collections of
app reviews and real-world short text datasets confirm that AOBTM can find more
coherent topics and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

shallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart
Deep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric
matrix embeddings for each field pair along with the usual single vector
embeddings for each feature. FEFM has significantly lower model complexity than
FFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful
mathematical properties about important fields and field interactions. DeepFEFM
combines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN
