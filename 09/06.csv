interpretable dynamical models using sampled trajectory data from physical
processes based on a generalized Onsager principle. The learned dynamics are
autonomous ordinary differential equations parameterized by neural networks
that retain clear physical structure information, such as free energy,
diffusion, conservative motion and external forces. For high dimensional
problems with a low dimensional slow manifold, an autoencoder with metric
preserving regularization is introduced to find the low dimensional generalized
coordinates on which we learn the generalized Onsager dynamics. Our method
exhibits clear advantages over existing methods on benchmark problems for
learning ordinary differential equations. We further apply this method to study
Rayleigh-Benard convection and learn Lorenz-like low dimensional autonomous
reduced order models that capture both qualitative and quantitative properties
of the underlying dynamics. This forms a general approach to building reduced
order models for forced dissipative systems.

engineering scenario (features are stored in many different IoT devices),
direct and unlimited multivariate feature transformations will quickly exhaust

directly judge the usefulness of the transformation on a feature. Explored the
new useful feature, the framework forsakes the encryption-based algorithm for
the well-designed feature exchange mechanism, which largely decreases the
communication overhead under the premise of confidentiality. We made
experiments on datasets of both open-sourced and real-world thus validating the
comparable effectiveness of FLFE to evaluation-based approaches, along with the

In this work, we aim to make variational dynamical simulation even more

for fast forwarding, i.e., simulation beyond the coherence time of the quantum

error and allows simulation of the entire Hilbert space. We prove an
operational meaning for the VHD cost function in terms of the average
simulation fidelity. Moreover, we prove that the VHD cost function does not
exhibit a shallow-depth barren plateau, i.e., its gradient does not vanish

connect locality to trainability. Our numerical simulations verify that VHD can

selection of parameters to build local Machine Learning (ML) models. To this
aim, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based technique to optimize
the hyperparameter settings for the local ML models in an FL environment. We
evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using two case studies.
First, we consider smart city services and use an experimental transportation
dataset for traffic prediction as a proxy for this setting. Second, we consider
Industrial IoT (IIoT) services and use the real-time telemetry dataset to
predict the probability that a machine will fail shortly due to component
failures. Our experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for
tuning the hyperparameters of deep Long short-term memory (LSTM) models when
compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the number
of clients-server communication rounds to explore the landscape of
configurations to find the near-optimal parameters are greatly reduced (roughly
by two orders of magnitude needing only 2%--4% of the rounds compared to state
of the art non-PSO-based approaches). We also demonstrate that utilizing the

of decentralized crowdsourcing systems on top of open smart contract platforms

numerous benefits compared to centralized solutions, current implementations of
decentralized crowdsourcing suffer from fundamental scalability limitations by
requiring all participants to pay a small transaction fee every time they
interact with the blockchain. This increases the cost of using decentralized
crowdsourcing solutions, resulting in a total payment that could be even higher
than the price charged by centralized crowdsourcing platforms. This paper
proposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the
scalability issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a
decentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1). NF-Crowd is a highly reliable
solution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing. We prove that as long as
participants of a project powered by NF-Crowd are rational, the O(1) lower
bound of cost could be reached regardless of the scale of the crowd. We also
demonstrate that as long as at least one participant of a project powered by
NF-Crowd is honest, the project cannot be aborted and the results are
guaranteed to be correct. We design NF-Crowd protocols for a representative
type of project named crowdsourcing contest with open community review

Our results demonstrate that NF-Crowd protocols can reduce the cost of running

small angular size induced by its mass and redshift, the cluster is
contaminated by point sources that significantly affect the SZ signal.
Therefore, this is an interesting case study for the most challenging sources
of the NIKA2 cluster sample. We present the NIKA2 observations of this cluster
and the resulting data. We reconstruct the ICM pressure profile by performing a
joint analysis of the SZ signal and of the point sources in the NIKA2 150 GHz

with NIKA2. We compare the pressure profile extracted from the NIKA2 map to the
pressure profile obtained from X-ray data only by deprojecting XMM-Newton
observations of the cluster. We combine the NIKA2 pressure profile with the
X-ray deprojected density to extract detailed information on the ICM. The
radial distribution of its thermodynamic properties indicate that the cluster
has a disturbed core. The hydrostatic mass of the cluster is to be compatible

images plays a significant role in diagnosis and management for a variety of
cardiac diseases. However, the performance of relevant algorithms is
significantly affected by the proper fusion of the multi-modal information.
Furthermore, particular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, display
irregular shapes on images and occupy small regions at random locations. These
facts make pathology segmentation of multi-modal CMR images a challenging task.
In this paper, we present the Max-Fusion U-Net that achieves improved pathology
segmentation performance given aligned multi-modal images of LGE, T2-weighted,
and bSSFP modalities. Specifically, modality-specific features are extracted by
dedicated encoders. Then they are fused with the pixel-wise maximum operator.
Together with the corresponding encoding features, these representations are
propagated to decoding layers with U-Net skip-connections. Furthermore, a
spatial-attention module is applied in the last decoding layer to encourage the
network to focus on those small semantically meaningful pathological regions
that trigger relatively high responses by the network neurons. We also use a
simple image patch extraction strategy to dynamically resample training
examples with varying spacial and batch sizes. With limited GPU memory, this
strategy reduces the imbalance of classes and forces the model to focus on
regions around the interested pathology. It further improves segmentation
accuracy and reduces the mis-classification of pathology. We evaluate our
methods using the Myocardial pathology segmentation (MyoPS) combining the

relativistic heavy ion collisions, which can induce a splitting of the directed
flow of charged particles and anti-particles ($\Delta v_1$). Such a splitting
manifests even for neutral charmed mesons pairs ($D^0,\bar{D}^0$), hence being
a direct probe of the formation of deconfined phase with charm quarks as degree
of freedom.
  In the limit of large $p_T$ and weak interaction with the QGP, a formula of
$\Delta v_1(p_T,y_z)$ of charged particles and anti-particles as a function of
$p_T$ and rapidity $y_z$ can be obtained, which is found to be related to the
spectra of charged particles and the integrated effect of the Lorentz force.
This formula is expected to be valid to heavy quarks and leptons at high $p_T$,
where the modification to their equations of motion due to the interaction with
both QGP and electromagnetic fields is small, and should have a general
application. We also proposed a measurement of $\Delta v_1(p_T,y_z)$ of leptons
from $Z^0$ decay and its correlation to that of $D$ mesons, which would be a
strong probe determining whether the large splitting measured in experiments
has the electromagnetic origin.

real-time gesture classification using the active sEMG sensor system was 85%.
The common-mode rejection ratio of the sensor was measured to 59 dB, and thus
the sensor's performance was not substantially limited by its active circuitry.
The proposed sensors can be interfaced with a variety of amplifiers to perform
fully wearable sEMG acquisition. This satisfies the need for a low-cost sEMG

complicates comparisons between the Milky Way and external galaxies, due to our
inability to observe the Milky Way from an external point of view. Milky Way
analog galaxies offer us a chance to bridge this divide by providing the
external perspective that we otherwise lack. However, over-precise definitions
of ""analog"" yield little-to-no galaxies, so it is vital to understand which
selection criteria produce the most meaningful analog samples. To address this,
we compare the properties of complementary samples of Milky Way analogs
selected using different criteria. We find the Milky Way to be within 1$\sigma$
of its analogs in terms of star-formation rate and bulge-to-total ratio in most
cases, but we find larger offsets between the Milky Way and its analogs in
terms of disc scale length; this suggests that scale length must be included in
analog selections in addition to other criteria if the most accurate analogs
are to be selected. We also apply our methodology to the neighbouring Andromeda
galaxy. We find analogs selected on the basis of strong morphological features
to display much higher star-formation rates than Andromeda, and we also find
analogs selected on Andromeda's star-formation rate to over-predict Andromeda's
bulge extent. This suggests both structure and star-formation rate should be
considered when selecting the most stringent Andromeda analogs.

accurate deep learning models. However, due to the annotation cost, datasets in
medical imaging are often either partially-labeled or small. For example,
DeepLesion is such a large-scale CT image dataset with lesions of various
types, but it also has many unlabeled lesions (missing annotations). When
training a lesion detector on a partially-labeled dataset, the missing
annotations will generate incorrect negative signals and degrade the
performance. Besides DeepLesion, there are several small single-type datasets,
such as LUNA for lung nodules and LiTS for liver tumors. These datasets have
heterogeneous label scopes, i.e., different lesion types are labeled in
different datasets with other types ignored. In this work, we aim to develop a
universal lesion detection algorithm to detect a variety of lesions. The
problem of heterogeneous and partial labels is tackled. First, we build a
simple yet effective lesion detection framework named Lesion ENSemble (LENS).
LENS can efficiently learn from multiple heterogeneous lesion datasets in a
multi-task fashion and leverage their synergy by proposal fusion. Next, we
propose strategies to mine missing annotations from partially-labeled datasets
by exploiting clinical prior knowledge and cross-dataset knowledge transfer.
Finally, we train our framework on four public lesion datasets and evaluate it
on 800 manually-labeled sub-volumes in DeepLesion. Our method brings a relative
improvement of 49% compared to the current state-of-the-art approach in the
metric of average sensitivity. We have publicly released our manual 3D

can answer path-queries $s \rightarrowtail v$ for any $v \in V$. In the more
general single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem the goal is to return an
approximate shortest path to $v$, and in the SCC problem the goal is to
maintain strongly connected components of $G$ and to answer path queries within
each component. All of these problems have been very actively studied over the
past two decades, but all the fast algorithms are randomized and, more
significantly, they can only answer path queries if they assume a weaker model:
they assume an oblivious adversary which is not adaptive and must fix the
update sequence in advance. This assumption significantly limits the use of
these data structures, most notably preventing them from being used as
subroutines in static algorithms. All the above problems are notoriously
difficult in the adaptive setting. In fact, the state-of-the-art is still the
Even and Shiloach tree, which dates back all the way to 1981 and achieves total
update time $O(mn)$. We present the first algorithms to break through this
barrier:
  1) deterministic decremental SSR/SCC with total update time $mn^{2/3 + o(1)}$
  2) deterministic decremental SSSP with total update time $n^{2+2/3+o(1)}$.
  To achieve these results, we develop two general techniques of broader
interest for working with dynamic graphs: 1) a generalization of expander-based
tools to dynamic directed graphs, and 2) a technique that we call congestion
balancing and which provides a new method for maintaining flow under
adversarial deletions. Using the second technique, we provide the first
near-optimal algorithm for decremental bipartite matching.

simulating floating wind turbine platform motion coupled with wake transport
under time-varying wind conditions. The simulator is named FOWFSim-Dyn as it is
a dynamic extension of the previously developed steady-state Floating Offshore
Wind Farm Simulator (FOWFSim). One-dimensional momentum conservation is used to
model dynamic propagation of wake centerline locations and average velocities,
while momentum recovery is approximated with the assumption of a constant
temporal wake expansion rate. Platform dynamics are captured by treating a
floating offshore wind farm as a distribution of particles that are subject to
aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and mooring line forces. The finite difference
method is used to discretize the momentum conservation equations to yield a
nonlinear state-space model. Simulated data are validated against steady-state
experimental wind tunnel results obtained from the literature. Predictions of
wake centerlines differed from experimental results by at most 8.19% of the
rotor diameter. Simulated wake velocity profiles in the far-wake region
differed from experimental measurements by less than 3.87% of the free stream
wind speed. FOWFSim-Dyn thus possesses a satisfactory level of fidelity for
engineering applications. Finally, dynamic simulations are conducted to ensure
that time-varying predictions match physical expectations and intuition.

address this gap, we introduce a design space for representing synchronous

situatedness, or whether collaborators' interactions are overlaid on or shown

depicted through abstract, generic representations or through specific means

variety of examples including generic and custom synchronized cursors, and user
legends that collect these cursors together or reproduce collaborators' views
as thumbnails. To build common ground, users can interact with these
representations by peeking to take a quick look at a collaborator's view,
tracking to follow along with a collaborator in real-time, and forking to
independently explore the visualization based on a collaborator's work. We

experiments involving only one particle, it is subtler in the case of
experiments involving two entangled particles because they give rise to
EPR-like situations. Considering that a measurement is not an actual change of
the physical state of a system and is relative to the observer allows to
understand that there is neither backward in time effects nor instantaneous

not entirely determined and that it becomes determined only when certain
measurements are done latter. This apparent contradiction disappears if one
understand that each observer builds, through her own measurements, her own

  First, we parameterize the circular Viterbi algorithm, a baseline decoder

combines multiple such weighted decoders, each decoder specializes in decoding
words from a specific region of the channel words' distribution. A region
corresponds to a subset of termination states; the ensemble covers the entire
states space. A non-learnable gating satisfies two goals: it filters easily
decoded words and mitigates the overhead of executing multiple weighted
decoders. The CRC criterion is employed to choose only a subset of experts for
decoding purpose. Our method achieves FER improvement of up to 0.75dB over the
CVA in the waterfall region for multiple code lengths, adding negligible
computational complexity compared to the circular Viterbi algorithm in high

tasks, tend to have a large number of parameters, which increases training time

methods, however, often require extensive parameter tuning or multiple cycles
of pruning and retraining to convergence in order to obtain a favorable
accuracy-sparsity trade-off. To address these issues, we propose a novel
pruning method which uses the oscillations around $0$ (i.e. sign flips) that a
weight has undergone during training in order to determine its saliency. Our
method can perform pruning before the network has converged, requires little
tuning effort due to having good default values for its hyperparameters, and
can directly target the level of sparsity desired by the user. Our experiments,
performed on a variety of object classification architectures, show that it is
competitive with existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance for
levels of sparsity of $99.6\%$ and above for most of the architectures tested.

large graphs $G$ that are covered by $X$ and that have (nontrivial) spectrum at
Hausdorff distance at most $\varepsilon$ from that of $X$. This significantly
generalizes the recent work of Mohanty et al., which provided explicit

behavioral healthcare, we use medical claims data to study the risk of
subsequent suicide attempts for patients who were hospitalized due to suicide

patients at elevated suicide risk is an important step toward the goal of ""Zero
Suicide."" An immediate and unconventional challenge is that the identification
of suicide attempts from medical claims contains substantial uncertainty:
almost 20% of ""suspected"" suicide attempts are identified from diagnosis codes
indicating external causes of injury and poisoning with undermined intent. It
is thus of great interest to learn which of these undetermined events are more
likely actual suicide attempts and how to properly utilize them in survival

develop an integrative Cox cure model with regularization to perform survival
regression with uncertain events and a latent cure fraction. We apply the
proposed approach to study the risk of subsequent suicide attempts after
suicide-related hospitalization for the adolescent and young adult population,
using medical claims data from Connecticut. The identified risk factors are
highly interpretable; more intriguingly, our method distinguishes the risk
factors that are most helpful in assessing either susceptibility or timing of
subsequent attempts. The predicted statuses of the uncertain attempts are
further investigated, leading to several new insights on suicide event

effective models with limited data resource. Previous works have explored
different approaches to tackle this challenge including data enhancement,
transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning etc. However, the weakness of
these existing approaches includes such as training instability, large
performance loss during transfer, or marginal improvement.
  In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal emotion
recognition model based on cross-modality distribution matching, which
leverages abundant unlabeled data to enhance the model training under the
assumption that the inner emotional status is consistent at the utterance level
across modalities.
  We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model on two
benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD. The experiment results prove that the
proposed semi-supervised learning model can effectively utilize unlabeled data
and combine multi-modalities to boost the emotion recognition performance,
which outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches under the same condition.
The proposed model also achieves competitive capacity compared with existing
approaches which take advantage of additional auxiliary information such as

exist within pelagic pair trawlers. Since these vessels need to be in pairs for
their fishing operations, in practice some of them decide to move together
throughout their whole fishing trips, and others for only a segment of their
trips. To identify partners at sea, we used a heuristic approach based on
joint-movement metrics and Gaussian mixture models. The models were first
fitted on the pelagic pair trawlers and then used on the other fleets. From all
of these fisheries, only the tuna purse-seiners did not present partners at

respect for human autonomy as a key principle arising from human rights
considerations, and several emerging frameworks for AI include this principle.
Yet, no specific formalization has been defined. Separately, self-determination
theory shows that autonomy is an innate psychological need for people, and
moreover has a significant body of experimental work that formalizes and
measures level of human autonomy. In this position paper, we argue that there
is a need to specifically operationalize respect for human autonomy in the

can be developed based on well-established approaches from experimental
psychology, which can then be used to design future recommender systems that

versions of this problem have received significant attention, our focus is on
the multivariate case $d \geq 3$. We study both the minimax risk of estimation
(in empirical $L_2$ loss) and the fundamental limits of adaptation (quantified
by the adaptivity index) to a family of piecewise constant functions. We
provide a computationally efficient Mirsky partition estimator that is minimax
optimal while also achieving the smallest adaptivity index possible for
polynomial time procedures. Thus, from a worst-case perspective and in sharp
contrast to the bivariate case, the latent permutations in the model do not
introduce significant computational difficulties over and above vanilla
isotonic regression. On the other hand, the fundamental limits of adaptation
are significantly different with and without unknown permutations: Assuming a
hardness conjecture from average-case complexity theory, a
statistical-computational gap manifests in the former case. In a complementary

The investigations are inspired by recent experiments that have directly
measured the increase in the decay length for highly-concentrated electrolytes
with increase in concentration. The behavior of ions in the nanoconfinement
created by the interfaces is probed by evaluating the ionic density profiles,
net charge densities, screening factors, and decay length associated with the
screening of the charged interface. Results show the presence of two distinct
regimes of screening behavior as the concentration is changed from 0.1 M to 2.5
M for a wide range of electrolyte systems generated by tuning the interfacial
separation, surface charge density, and ionic size. For low concentrations, the
screening factor exhibits a monotonic decay to 0 with a decay length that
decreases sharply with increasing concentration. For high concentrations
($\gtrsim 1$ M), the screening factor has a non-monotonic behavior signaling
charge inversion and formation of structured layers of ions near the
interfaces. The decay length under these conditions rises with increasing
concentration, exhibiting a power-law behavior. To complement the simulation
results, a variational approach is developed that produces charge densities
with characteristics consistent with those observed in simulations. The results
demonstrate the relation between the rise in the strength of steric
correlations and the changes in the screening behavior.

medical images registration is essential in a variety of medical applications.
Deep learning-based methods have recently gained popularity in this area for
the significant lower inference time. However, they suffer from drawbacks of
non-optimal accuracy and the requirement of a large amount of training data. A
new method named GroupRegNet is proposed to address both limitations. The
deformation fields to warp all images in the group into a common template is
obtained through one-shot learning. The use of the implicit template reduces
bias and accumulated error associated with the specified reference image. The
one-shot learning strategy is similar to the conventional iterative
optimization method but the motion model and parameters are replaced with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and the weights of the network. GroupRegNet
also features a simpler network design and a more straightforward registration
process, which eliminates the need to break up the input image into patches.
The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated on two public
respiratory-binned 4D-CT datasets. The results suggest that GroupRegNet
outperforms the latest published deep learning-based methods and is comparable
to the top conventional method pTVreg. To facilitate future research, the
source code is available at https://github.com/vincentme/GroupRegNet.

each of these abstract actions into robot motion trajectories through learned

rope geometry, the motion primitives take the observed rope configuration as

reinforcement learning in simulation. To generalize human demonstrations of
simple knots into more complex knots, we observe similarities in the motion
strategies of different topological actions and design the neural network
structure to exploit such similarities. We demonstrate that our learned motion
primitives can be used to efficiently generate motion plans for tying the
overhand knot. The motion plan can then be executed on a real robot using

exploiting the use of these various metrics for model calibration can be
helpful to infer such patient-specific parameters both accurately and early, so
that treatment protocols can be adjusted mid-course for maximum efficacy.
However, taking measurements can be costly and invasive, limiting clinicians to
a sparse collection schedule. As such, the determination of optimal times and
metrics for which to collect data in order to best inform proper treatment
protocols could be of great assistance to clinicians. In this investigation, we
employ a Bayesian information-theoretic calibration protocol for experimental

are chosen sequentially to maximize the reduction in parameter uncertainty with
each added measurement, ensuring that a budget of $n$ high-fidelity

low-fidelity model parameter values. In addition to investigating the optimal
temporal pattern for data collection, we also develop a framework for deciding
which metrics should be utilized at each data collection point. We illustrate
this framework with a variety of toy examples, each utilizing a radiotherapy
treatment regimen. For each scenario, we analyze the dependence of the
predictive power of the low-fidelity model upon the measurement budget.

contrastive information loss and an additional output confidence penalty, which
facilitates balanced learning between the factual and counterfactual domains.

enhances both shallow and deep models, which sheds light on counterfactual

attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial
revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems.
One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator
attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this
paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks.
We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the
existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand-supply
relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set
of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the
attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the
latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string
to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor
attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are
regular, it is computationally feasible to remove all such risky pairs from the
plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to
establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor
resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks.
The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that
guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far
has not been achieved in the literature.

Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from the SMS dissociates H$_2$ in the inner regions
of the gas flow, increasing gas temperature and thermal pressure, and
temporarily stopping the accretion. However, this negative feedback ceases when
the self-gravity and inward ram pressure force on larger scales push the gas
inward. The central protostar is unable to expand an HII region due to the high
density, and grows to a mass of $\gtrsim10^5\,{{\rm M}_\odot}$. Our results

communications hardware, however, suffer from a limited angular field-of-view
and low estimation accuracy for radars due to the employed directional
communication beam. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and fast combined
waveform-beamforming design for the mmWave automotive JCR with a phased-array
architecture that permits a trade-off between communication and radar
performances. To rapidly estimate the mmWave automotive radar channel in the
Doppler-angle domain with a wide field-of-view, our JCR design employs a few
circulant shifts of the transmit beamformer and apply two-dimensional partial
Fourier compressed sensing technique. We optimize these circulant shifts to
achieve minimum coherence in compressed sensing. We evaluate the JCR
performance trade-offs using a normalized mean square error (MSE) metric for
radar estimation and a distortion MSE metric for data communication, which is
analogous to the distortion metric in the rate distortion theory. Additionally,
we develop a MSE-based weighted average optimization problem for the adaptive
JCR combined waveform-beamforming design. Numerical results demonstrate that
our proposed JCR design enables the estimation of short- and medium-range radar
channels in the Doppler-angle domain with a low normalized MSE, at the expense
of a small degradation in the communication distortion MSE.

avalanches, whose sizes obey a power-law probability distribution with the
avalanche critical exponent $\tau$. Although mean-field theory predicts a
universal value of this exponent, $\tau_{\rm MF}=1.5$, numerical simulations
have reported different values depending on the literature. Moreover, in the
elastic regime, it has been noted that the critical exponent can be different
from that in the steady state, and even criticality itself is a matter of
debate. Because these confusingly varying results were reported under different
setups, our knowledge of avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is greatly
limited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work, we conduct a
comprehensive numerical investigation of avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses
under athermal quasistatic shear. In particular, by excluding the ambiguity and
arbitrariness that has crept into the conventional measurement schemes, we
achieve high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the exponent $\tau$ in
the steady state follows the mean-field prediction of $\tau_{\rm MF}=1.5$. Our
results also suggest that there are two qualitatively different avalanche
events. This binariness leads to the non-universal behavior of the avalanche
size distribution and is likely to be the cause of the varying values of $\tau$
reported thus far. To investigate the dependence of criticality and
universality on applied shear, we further study the statistics of avalanches in
the elastic regime and the ensemble of the first avalanche event in different
samples, which provide information about the unperturbed system. We show that
while the unperturbed system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually
develops as shear is applied. Moreover, the critical exponent obeys the
mean-field prediction $\tau_{\rm MF}$ universally, once the system becomes
critical.

objects, and their relations are often encapsulated as bipartite graphs.
Detecting user community in such heterogeneous graphs is an essential task to
uncover user information needs and to further enhance recommendation
performance. While several main cyber domains carrying high-quality graphs,
unfortunately, most others can be quite sparse. However, as users may appear in
multiple domains (graphs), their high-quality activities in the main domains
can supply community detection in the sparse ones, e.g., user behaviors on
Google can help thousands of applications to locate his/her local community
when s/he uses Google ID to login those applications. In this paper, our model,
Pairwise Cross-graph Community Detection (PCCD), is proposed to cope with the
sparse graph problem by involving external graph knowledge to learn user
pairwise community closeness instead of detecting direct communities.
Particularly in our model, to avoid taking excessive propagated information, a
two-level filtering module is utilized to select the most informative
connections through both community and node level filters. Subsequently, a
Community Recurrent Unit (CRU) is designed to estimate pairwise user community
closeness. Extensive experiments on two real-world graph datasets validate our
model against several strong alternatives. Supplementary experiments also
validate its robustness on graphs with varied sparsity scales.

demonstrate that QCQPs with forest-structured aggregate sparsity matrix, such

internet of things (IIoT). However, in conventional IIoT device failure
detection, client devices need to upload raw data to the central server for
model training, which might lead to disclosure of sensitive business data.
Therefore, in this paper, to ensure client data privacy, we propose a
blockchain-based federated learning approach for device failure detection in
IIoT. First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated
learning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable
integrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates
a Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and
stores the tree root on a blockchain. Further, to address the data
heterogeneity issue in IIoT failure detection, we propose a novel centroid
distance weighted federated averaging (CDW\_FedAvg) algorithm taking into
account the distance between positive class and negative class of each client
dataset. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning,
a smart contact based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and
the centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype
of the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and
evaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy and performance. The results show
that the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.

papers are the most intuitive embodiment of the research results of scholars,
which can reflect the level of researchers. It is also the evaluation standard
for decision-making such as promotion and allocation of funds. Therefore, how
to measure the quality of an academic paper is very important. The most common
standard for measuring academic papers is the number of citation counts of
papers, because this indicator is widely used in the evaluation of scientific
publications, and it also serves as the basis for many other indicators (such
as the h-index). Therefore, it is very important to be able to accurately
predict the citation counts of academic papers.
  This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning network, DeepCCP, which
combines the effect of information cascade and looks at the citation counts
prediction problem from the perspective of information cascade prediction.
DeepCCP directly uses the citation network formed in the early stage of the
paper as the input, and the output is the citation counts of the corresponding
paper after a period of time. DeepCCP only uses the structure and temporal
information of the citation network, and does not require other additional
information, but it can still achieve outstanding performance. According to

understanding the transmission dynamics of an outbreak as it unfolds in
real-time. However, transmission model parameter estimation can be imprecise,
and sometimes even impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not
informative about all aspects of the mechanistic model. To partially overcome
this obstacle, Bayesian models have been proposed to integrate multiple
surveillance data streams. We devised a modeling framework for integrating
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics test and mortality time series data, as well as
seroprevalence data from cross-sectional studies, and tested the importance of
individual data streams for both inference and forecasting. Importantly, our
model for incidence data accounts for changes in the total number of tests
performed. We model the transmission rate, infection-to-fatality ratio, and a
parameter controlling a functional relationship between the true case incidence
and the fraction of positive tests as time-varying quantities and estimate
changes of these parameters nonparametrically. We compare our base model
against modified versions which do not use diagnostics test counts or
seroprevalence data to demonstrate the utility of including these often unused
data streams. We apply our Bayesian data integration method to COVID-19
surveillance data collected in Orange County, California between March 2020 and
February 2021 and find that 32--72\% of the Orange County residents experienced
SARS-CoV-2 infection by mid-January, 2021. Despite this high number of
infections, our results suggest that the abrupt end of the winter surge in

exponentially decaying weight function results in an algorithm with essentially
the same recursive structure as the Kalman filter. It differs, however, in the
manner in which old and new data are combined. While in the classical KF, the
uncertainty associated with the previous estimate is inflated by adding the
process noise covariance, in the present case, the uncertainty inflation is
done by multiplying the previous covariance matrix by an exponential factor.
This difference allows us to solve a larger variety of problems using
essentially the same algorithm. We thus propose a unified and optimal, in the

out-of-sequence updates. All of these tasks require different Kalman-like

freeform surfaces represented either as parametric surfaces or as triangular

direction field and the constant scallop height, and yields a minimized overall
path length. The optimality is achieved by formulating tool path planning as a
Poisson problem that minimizes a simple, quadratic energy. This Poisson
formulation considers all tool paths at once, without resorting to any
heuristic sampling or initial tool path choosing as in existing methods, and is
thus a globally optimal solution. Finding the optimal tool paths amounts to
solving a well-conditioned sparse linear system, which is computationally
convenient and efficient. Tool paths are represented with an implicit scheme
that can completely avoid the challenging topological issues of path
singularities and self-intersections seen in previous methods. The presented
method has been validated with a series of examples and comparisons.

contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our
previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them

cryptographic Encrypt-to-Self primitive that is dedicated to use cases of
symmetric encryption where encryptor and decryptor coincide. The primitive is
envisioned to be useful whenever a memory-bounded computing device is required
to encrypt some data with the aim of temporarily depositing it on an untrusted
storage device. While the new primitive protects the confidentiality of
payloads as much as classic authenticated encryption primitives would do, it
provides considerably better authenticity guarantees: Specifically, while
classic solutions would completely fail in a context involving user
corruptions, if an encrypt-to-self scheme is used to protect the data, all
ciphertexts and messages fully remain unforgeable.
  To instantiate their encrypt-to-self primitive, Pijnenburg et al propose a
mode of operation of the compression function of a hash function, with a
carefully designed encoding function playing the central role in the
serialization of the processed message and associated data. In the present work
we revisit the design of this encoding function. Without questioning its
adequacy for securely accomplishing the encrypt-to-self job, we improve on it
from a technical/implementational perspective by proposing modifications that
alleviate certain conditions that would inevitably require implementations to
disrespect memory alignment restrictions imposed by the word-wise operation of
modern CPUs, ultimately leading to performance penalties. Our main
contributions are thus to propose an improved encoding function, to explain why
it offers better performance, and to prove that it provides as much security as
its predecessor. We finally report on our open-source implementation of the

it tends to be fragile under challenging environments. Comparing with classical
geometry-based methods, deep learning-based methods can automatically learn
effective and robust representations, such as depth, optical flow, feature,
ego-motion, etc., from data without explicit computation. Nevertheless, there
still lacks a thorough review of the recent advances of deep learning-based VO
(Deep VO). Therefore, this paper aims to gain a deep insight on how deep
learning can profit and optimize the VO systems. We first screen out a number
of qualifications including accuracy, efficiency, scalability, dynamicity,
practicability, and extensibility, and employ them as the criteria. Then, using
the offered criteria as the uniform measurements, we detailedly evaluate and
discuss how deep learning improves the performance of VO from the aspects of
depth estimation, feature extraction and matching, pose estimation. We also
summarize the complicated and emerging areas of Deep VO, such as mobile robots,
medical robots, augmented reality and virtual reality, etc. Through the
literature decomposition, analysis, and comparison, we finally put forward a
number of open issues and raise some future research directions in this field.

mixing with antiferromagnetism (AFM), weak FM, and charge ordering (CO)

We reveal the phase diagrams in the interaction and interaction-temperature

clarify the stabilization mechanism of the phases, we focus on the microscopic

schemes where joint maximum likelihood (JML) decoding is implemented at the
destination. Then, we define the performance metrics (i.e., bit error rate
(BER) and the diversity order ) of the NOMA-DRN with the JML and analyze the

a spectral efficient NOMA-CRS scheme can be achieved with high data

Furthermore, with the proposed NOMA-DRN with the JML, the full diversity order

mutual dependence, which provides the key mechanisms in spin-dependent
phenomena. Recently, antiferromagnetic orders are focused on as the magnetic
order, where current-induced spin-transfer torques, a typical effect of
electron transport on the magnetic order, have been debatable mainly because of
the lack of an analytic derivation based on quantum field theory. Here, we
construct the microscopic theory of spin-transfer torques on the slowly-varying
staggered magnetization in antiferromagnets with weak canting. In our theory,
the electron is captured by bonding/antibonding states, each of which is the
eigenstate of the system, doubly degenerates, and spatially spreads to
sublattices because of electron hopping. The spin of the eigenstates depends on
the momentum in general, and a nontrivial spin-momentum locking arises for the
case with no site inversion symmetry, without considering any spin-orbit
couplings. The spin current of the eigenstates includes an anomalous component
proportional to a kind of gauge field defined by derivatives in momentum space
and induces the adiabatic spin-transfer torques on the magnetization.
Unexpectedly, we find that one of the nonadiabatic torques has the same form as
the adiabatic spin-transfer torque, while the obtained forms for the adiabatic
and nonadiabatic spin-transfer torques agree with the phenomenological
derivation based on the symmetry consideration. This finding suggests that the
conventional explanation for the spin-transfer torques in antiferromagnets
should be changed. Our microscopic theory provides a fundamental understanding
of spin-related physics in antiferromagnets.

parametrized partial differential equation from $m$ linear measurements, when
the parameter vector $y$ is unknown. Fast numerical recovery methods have been
proposed based on reduced models which are linear spaces of moderate dimension
$n$ which are tailored to approximate the solution manifold $\mathcal{M}$ where
the solution sits. These methods can be viewed as deterministic counterparts to
Bayesian estimation approaches, and are proved to be optimal when the prior is
expressed by approximability of the solution with respect to the reduced model.
However, they are inherently limited by their linear nature, which bounds from
below their best possible performance by the Kolmogorov width
$d_m(\mathcal{M})$ of the solution manifold. In this paper we propose to break
this barrier by using simple nonlinear reduced models that consist of a finite
union of linear spaces $V_k$, each having dimension at most $m$ and leading to
different estimators $u_k^*$. A model selection mechanism based on minimizing
the PDE residual over the parameter space is used to select from this
collection the final estimator $u^*$. Our analysis shows that $u^*$ meets
optimal recovery benchmarks that are inherent to the solution manifold and not
tied to its Kolmogorov width. The residual minimization procedure is
computationally simple in the relevant case of affine parameter dependence in
the PDE. In addition, it results in an estimator $y^*$ for the unknown
parameter vector. In this setting, we also discuss an alternating minimization
(coordinate descent) algorithm for joint state and parameter estimation, that
potentially improves the quality of both estimators.

self-similarity characteristics of the former which are central to theoretical
models for wall-turbulence. The approach is based on analyzing datasets

respectively. This is confirmed by ${\Phi}_{a}$ exhibiting wall-scaling, for
both streamwise and spanwise wavelengths, corresponding well with the Reynolds

distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes
these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two

distinct classes of uncertain multi-agent optimization programs. We first
assume that only the constraints of the program are affected by uncertainty,
while the cost function is arbitrary. Leveraging recent a posteriori
developments of the scenario approach, we provide probabilistic guarantees for
all feasible solutions of the program under study. This result is particularly
useful in cases where numerical difficulties related to the convergence of the
solution-seeking algorithm hinder the exact quantification of the optimal
solution. Furthermore, it can be applied to cases where the agents' incentives
lead to a suboptimal solution, e.g., under a non-cooperative setting. We then
focus on optimization programs where the cost function admits an aggregate
representation and depends on uncertainty while constraints are deterministic.
By exploiting the structure of the program under study and leveraging the so
called support rank notion, we provide agent-independent robustness
certificates for the optimal solution, i.e., the constructed bound on the
probability of constraint violation does not depend on the number of agents,
but only on the dimension of the agents' decision. This substantially reduces
the number of samples required to achieve a certain level of probabilistic
robustness as the number of agents increases. All robustness certificates
provided in this paper are distribution-free and can be used alongside any
optimization algorithm. Our theoretical results are accompanied by a numerical

that the distribution of the generated signals closely resembles the underlying

accumulation, core radiation, and radiative collapse. In this work, we focus on
bolometer tomography to reconstruct the plasma radiation profile and, on top of
it, we apply anomaly detection to identify the radiation patterns that precede
major disruptions. The approach makes extensive use of machine learning. First,
we train a surrogate model for plasma tomography based on matrix
multiplication, which provides a fast method to compute the plasma radiation
profiles across the full extent of any given pulse. Then, we train a
variational autoencoder to reproduce the radiation profiles by encoding them
into a latent distribution and subsequently decoding them. As an anomaly
detector, the variational autoencoder struggles to reproduce unusual behaviors,
which includes not only the actual disruptions but their precursors as well.
These precursors are identified based on an analysis of the anomaly score

  Conference on Decision and Control 2020",,,,"eess.SY cs.MA cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consensus of autonomous agents is a benchmark problem in cooperative control.
In this paper, we consider standard continuous-time averaging consensus
policies (or Laplacian flows) over time-varying graphs and focus on robustness
of consensus against communication delays. Such a robustness has been proved
under the assumption of uniform quasi-strong connectivity of the graph. It is
known, however, that the uniform connectivity is not necessary for consensus.
For instance, in the case of undirected graph and undelayed communication
consensus requires a much weaker condition of integral connectivity. In this
paper, we show that the latter results remain valid in presence of unknown but
bounded communication delays, furthermore, the condition of undirected graph
can be substantially relaxed and replaced by the conditions of
non-instantaneous type-symmetry. Furthermore, consensus can be proved for any
feasible solution of the delay differential inequalities associated to the
consensus algorithm. Such inequalities naturally arise in problems of
containment control, distributed optimization and models of social dynamics.

dense X-ray filament ($\sim$ 700 kpc in length) between A2384(N) (Northern
cluster) and A2384(S) (Southern cluster). The origin of the radio relic is
puzzling. By using the MeerKAT observation of A2384, we estimate that the
physical size of the radio relic is 824 $\times$ 264 kpc$^{2}$ and that it is a
steep spectrum source. The radio power of the relic is $P_{1.4\mathrm{GHz}}$
$\sim$ (3.87 $\pm$ 0.40) $\times$ 10$^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This radio relic could
be the result of shock wave propagation during the passage of the low-mass
A2384(S) cluster through the massive A2384(N) cluster, creating a trail
appearing as a hot X-ray filament. In the previous GMRT 325 MHz observation we
detected a peculiar FR I radio galaxy interacting with the hot X-ray filament
of A2384, but the extended radio relic was not detected; it was confused with
the southern lobe of the FR I galaxy. This newly detected radio relic is
elongated and perpendicular to the merger axis, as seen in other relic
clusters. In addition to the relic, we notice a candidate radio ridge in the
hot X-ray filament. The physical size of the radio ridge source is $\sim$ 182
$\times$ 129 kpc$^{2}$. Detection of the diffuse radio sources in the X-ray
filament is a rare phenomenon, and could be a new class of radio source found
between the two merging clusters of A2384(N) and A2384(S).

speaker-independent, dense and rich spoken content representations from
spectral features. Then a multi-speaker location-relative attention based
seq2seq synthesis model is trained to reconstruct spectral features from the
bottle-neck features, conditioning on speaker representations for speaker
identity control in the generated speech. To mitigate the difficulties of using
seq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral
feature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a
discretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism. Since the phoneme
recognizer is trained with large speech recognition data corpus, the proposed
approach can conduct any-to-many voice conversion. Objective and subjective
evaluations show that the proposed any-to-many approach has superior voice
conversion performance in terms of both naturalness and speaker similarity.
Ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of feature
selection and model design strategies in the proposed approach. The proposed VC
approach can readily be extended to support any-to-any VC (also known as
one/few-shot VC), and achieve high performance according to objective and

controlled experiments, such rules have to be inferred from past observations

First, observational effects are often unrepresentative of the underlying
causal effect because they are skewed by the presence of confounding factors.
Second, naive empirical estimations of a rule's effect have a high variance,
and, hence, their maximisation can lead to random results.
  To address these issues, first we measure the causal effect of a rule from
observational data---adjusting for the effect of potential confounders.
Importantly, we provide a graphical criteria under which causal rule discovery
is possible. Moreover, to discover reliable causal rules from a sample, we
propose a conservative and consistent estimator of the causal effect, and
derive an efficient and exact algorithm that maximises the estimator. On
synthetic data, the proposed estimator converges faster to the ground truth
than the naive estimator and recovers relevant causal rules even at small
sample sizes. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets show
that the proposed algorithm is efficient and discovers meaningful rules.

performance in video artifacts reduction. However, the high complexity of
existing methods makes it difficult to be applied in real usage. In this paper,
a CNN-based low complexity filter is proposed. We utilize depth separable
convolution (DSC) merged with the batch normalization (BN) as the backbone of
our proposed CNN-based network. Besides, a weight initialization method is
proposed to enhance the training performance. To solve the well known over
smoothing problem for the inter frames, a frame-level residual mapping (RM) is
presented. We analyze some of the mainstream methods like frame-level and
block-level based filters quantitatively and build our CNN-based filter with
frame-level control to avoid the extra complexity and artificial boundaries
caused by block-level control. In addition, a novel module called RM is
designed to restore the distortion from the learned residuals. As a result, we
can effectively improve the generalization ability of the learning-based filter
and reach an adaptive filtering effect. Moreover, this module is flexible and
can be combined with other learning-based filters. The experimental results
show that our proposed method achieves significant BD-rate reduction than
H.265/HEVC. It achieves about 1.2% BD-rate reduction and 79.1% decrease in
FLOPs than VR-CNN. Finally, the measurement on H.266/VVC and ablation studies
are also conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Brownian particle to find a stochastically-gated target under the additional
condition that the position of the particle is reset to a fixed position $\x_r$
at a rate $r$. The gate switches between an open and closed state according to
a two-state Markov chain and can only be detected by the searcher in the open
state. One possible example of such a target is a protein switching between
different conformational states. As expected, the MFPT with or without
resetting is an increasing function of the fraction of time $\rho_0$ that the
gate is closed. However, the interplay between stochastic resetting and
stochastic gating has non-trivial effects with regards the optimization of the
search process under resetting. First, by considering the diffusive search for
a gated target at one end of an interval, we show that the fractional change in
the MFPT under resetting exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\rho_0$. In
particular, the percentage reduction of the MFPT at the optimal resetting rate
(when it exists) increases with $\rho_0$ up to some critical value, after which
it decreases and eventually vanishes. Second, in the case of a spherical target
in $\R^d$, the dependence of the MFPT on the spatial dimension $d$ is
significantly amplified in the presence of stochastic gating.

algorithms that mainly concentrating on their non-asymptotic properties, we not

also asymptotic normality and asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm. Firstly,
for general constrained convex optimization problem distributed over a random

of agents converge to the same optimal point. For the case of linear
constrained convex optimization, we show that the mirror map of the averaged

earlier review of O'Dea (1998). There are three main hypotheses for the nature
of PS and CSS sources. (1) The PS sources might be very young radio galaxies
which will evolve into CSS sources on their way to becoming large radio
galaxies. (2) The PS and CSS sources might be compact because they are confined
(and enhanced in radio power) by interaction with dense gas in their
environments. (3) Alternately, the PS sources might be transient or
intermittent sources. Each of these hypotheses may apply to individual objects.
The relative number in each population will have significant implications for
the radio galaxy paradigm. Proper motion studies over long time baselines have
helped determine hotspot speeds for over three dozen sources and establish that
these are young objects. Multifrequency polarization observations have
demonstrated that many CSS/PS sources are embedded in a dense interstellar
medium and vigorously interacting with it. The detection of emission line gas
aligned with the radio source, and blue-shifted HI absorption and [OIII]
emission lines indicates that AGN feedback is present in these objects --
possibly driven by the radio source. CSS/PS sources with evidence of episodic
AGN over a large range of time-scales have been discussed. The review closes

power-efficiently because its stress or vibration patterns are significantly
influenced by the gait. However, as PEHs are not designed for precise
measurement of motion, achievable gait recognition accuracy remains low with
conventional classification algorithms. The accuracy deteriorates further when
the generated electricity is stored simultaneously. To classify gait reliably
while simultaneously storing generated energy, we make two distinct
contributions. First, we propose a preprocessing algorithm to filter out the
effect of energy storage on PEH electricity signal. Second, we propose a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network-based classifier to accurately capture
temporal information in gait-induced electricity generation. We prototype the
proposed gait recognition architecture in the form factor of an insole and
evaluate its gait recognition as well as energy harvesting performance with 20
subjects. Our results show that the proposed architecture detects human gait
with 12% higher recall and harvests up to 127% more energy while consuming 38%
less power compared to the state-of-the-art.

addition is commutative and subtraction is not. However, in a surprising 2006
result, Martin and O'Bryant proved that a positive percentage of sets are MSTD,
although this percentage is extremely small, about $10^{-4}$ percent. This
result was extended by Iyer, Lazarev, Miller, ans Zhang [ILMZ] who showed that
a positive percentage of sets are generalized MSTD sets, sets for $\{s_1,d_1\}
\neq \{s_2, d_2\}$ and $s_1+d_1=s_2+d_2$ with $|s_1A-d_1A| > |s_2A-d_2A|$, and
that in $d$-dimensions, a positive percentage of sets are MSTD.
  For many such results, establishing explicit MSTD sets in $1$-dimensions
relies on the specific choice of the elements on the left and right fringes of
the set to force certain differences to be missed while desired sums are
attained. In higher dimensions, the geometry forces a more careful assessment
of what elements have the same behavior as $1$-dimensional fringe elements. We
study fringes in $d$-dimensions and use these to create new explicit
constructions. We prove the existence of generalized MSTD sets in
$d$-dimensions and the existence of $k$-generational sets, which are sets where
$|cA+cA|>|cA-cA|$ for all $1\leq c \leq k$. We then prove that under certain

quantum coherence measures in disguise (or closely related to them). We further
this connection for all quantum coherence measures by using tools from
majorization theory. Then, we numerically study the coherence of

that the coherence-generating power (CGP) -- a measure of how much coherence a

attention in web applications because they have become a target for

improperly specified due to lack of security expertise and emphasis on security
during early stages of software development. This often leads to unspecified or
ill-defined security-related aspects. These concerns become even more
challenging in agile contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically
produced. To tackle this problem, we designed an approach for reviewing
security-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web

component on which it resides into two components. Bredges are vulnerable links
that play an important role in network collapse processes, which may result
from node or link failures, attacks or epidemics. Therefore, the abundance and
properties of bredges affect the resilience of the network. We present
analytical results for the statistical properties of bredges in configuration
model networks. Using a generating function approach based on the cavity
method, we calculate the probability $\hat P(e\in{\rm B})$ that a random edge e
in a configuration model network with degree distribution P(k) is a bredge (B).
We also calculate the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm B})$ of the
end-nodes of a random bredge. We examine the distinct properties of bredges on
the giant component (GC) and on the finite tree components (FC) of the network.
On the finite components all the edges are bredges and there are no
degree-degree correlations. We calculate the probability $\hat P(e\in{\rm
B}|{\rm GC})$ that a random edge on the giant component is a bredge. We also
calculate the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm B},{\rm GC})$ of the
end-nodes of bredges and the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm
NB},{\rm GC})$ of the end-nodes of non-bredge (NB) edges on the giant
component. Surprisingly, it is found that the degrees k and k' of the end-nodes
of bredges are correlated, while the degrees of the end-nodes of NB edges are
uncorrelated. We thus conclude that all the degree-degree correlations on the
giant component are concentrated on the bredges. We calculate the covariance of
end-nodes of bredges and show it is negative, namely bredges tend to connect
high degree nodes to low degree nodes. The implications of the results are
discussed in the context of common attack scenarios and dismantling processes.

deep learning. Synchronous methods are widely used in distributed training the
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To reduce the communication and synchronization
overhead of synchronous methods, decreasing the synchronization frequency
(e.g., every $n$ mini-batches) is a straightforward approach. However, it often
suffers from poor convergence. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm of
integrating Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) into the distributed training
process of DNNs to automatically compute new parameters. In the proposed
algorithm, a computing work is encoded by a particle, the weights of DNNs and
the training loss are modeled by the particle attributes. At each
synchronization stage, the weights are updated by PSO from the sub weights
gathered from all workers, instead of averaging the weights or the gradients.
To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, the experiments are
performed on two commonly used image classification benchmarks: MNIST and
CIFAR10, and compared with the peer competitors at multiple different
synchronization configurations. The experimental results demonstrate the
competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.

such as VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), VHD (Vehicle Hours of Delay), and VHT
(Vehicle Hours Traveled). Public transportation agencies typically rely on
point detector data to estimate these freeway performance measures. Point
detectors, such as inductive loops cannot capture the travel time for a
corridor, which can lead to inaccurate performance measure estimation. This
research develops a hybrid method, which estimates of freeway performance
measures using a mix of probe data from third-parties and data from traditional
point detectors. Using a simulated I-210 model, the overall framework using
multiple data sources is evaluated, and compared with the traditional point
detector-based estimation method. In the traditional method, point speeds are
estimated with the flow and occupancy values using the g-factors. Data from 5%
of the total vehicle are used to generate the third-party vendor provided
travel time data. The analysis is conducted for multiple scenarios, including
peak and off-peak periods. Findings suggest that fusing data from both

strategy. Instead of weighing all committee models equally to select the next

this paper is the Igbo language, which uses compounding as a common type of
word formation and as well has many vocabularies of compound words. The issues
of collocation, word ordering and compounding play high role in Igbo language.
The ambiguity in dealing with these compound words has made the representation
of Igbo language text document very difficult because this cannot be addressed
using the most common and standard approach of the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) model of
text representation, which ignores the word order and relation. However, this
cause for a concern and the need to develop an improved model to capture this
situation. This paper presents the analysis of Igbo language text document,
considering its compounding nature and describes its representation with the
Word-based N-gram model to properly prepare it for any text-based application.
The result shows that Bigram and Trigram n-gram text representation models
provide more semantic information as well addresses the issues of compounding,
word ordering and collocations which are the major language peculiarities in
Igbo. They are likely to give better performance when used in any Igbo
text-based system.

be concisely reproduced by considering waves in the spacetime defined by
special relativity. This approach unifies kinematics and dynamics, and
introduces inertial mass not via a definition, but rather as the real-space
effect of a reciprocal-space invariant.

We first
give a review for the formulation of the generalized uncertainty relations in
the stochastic variational method (SVM), following the paper by two of the
present authors [Phys. Lett. A382, 1472 (2018)]. In this approach, the origin
of the finite minimum value of uncertainty is attributed to the
non-differentiable (virtual) trajectory of a quantum particle and then both of
the Kennard and Robertson-Schr\""{o}dinger inequalities in quantum mechanics are
reproduced. The same non-differentiable trajectory is applied to the motion of
fluid elements in hydrodynamics. By introducing the standard deviations of
position and momentum for fluid elements, the uncertainty relations in
hydrodynamics are derived. These are applicable even to the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation and then the field-theoretical uncertainty relation is reproduced. We
further investigate numerically the derived relations and find that the
behaviors of the uncertainty relations for liquid and gas are qualitatively
different. This suggests that the uncertainty relations in hydrodynamics are
used as a criterion to classify liquid and gas in fluid.
