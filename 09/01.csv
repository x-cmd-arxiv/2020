played (in part) over a discrete graph called the $d$ dimensional de Bruijn

work [11] established $O(\varepsilon)$ optimal strategies for $n=2$ experts and
$d\leq 4$ days of history, while [10] established $O(\varepsilon^{1/3})$

the optimality conditions over the de Bruijn graph correspond to a graph

hole merger events seen in gravitational waves are primordial black hole (PBH)
mergers. Using the latest merger rate models for PBH binaries drawn from a
lognormal mass function we compute posterior parameter constraints and Bayesian
evidences using data from the first two observing runs of LIGO-Virgo. We
account for theoretical uncertainty due to possible disruption of the binary by
surrounding PBHs, which can suppress the merger rate significantly. We also
consider simple astrophysically motivated models and find that these are
favoured decisively over the PBH scenario, quantified by the Bayesian evidence
ratio. Paying careful attention to the influence of the parameter priors and
the quality of the model fits, we show that the evidence ratios can be
understood by comparing the predicted chirp mass distribution to that of the
data. We identify the posterior predictive distribution of chirp mass as a
vital tool for discriminating between models. A model in which all mergers are
PBH binaries is strongly disfavoured compared with astrophysical models, in
part due to the over-prediction of heavy systems having $\mathcal{M}_{{\rm
chirp}} \gtrsim 40 \, M_\odot$ and positive skewness over the range of observed
masses which does not match the observations. We find that the fit is not
significantly improved by adding a maximum mass cut-off, a bimodal mass
function, or imposing that PBH binaries form at late times. We argue that a
successful PBH model must either modify the lognormal shape of the initial mass
function significantly or abandon the hypothesis that all observed merging
binaries are primordial. We develop and apply techniques for analysing PBH
models with gravitational wave data which will be necessary for robust
statistical inference as the gravitational wave source sample size increases.

contains an action instance), humans could routinely localize an action
temporally in an untrimmed video. Nevertheless, most practical methods still
require all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action
category and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised
manner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories.
In this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn
action localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action
moments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed
videos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action
Herald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action
localization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely
devised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or
foreground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual
moments or untrimmed videos. The context of each moment is learnt through the
adversarial mechanism to differentiate the generated features from those of
background in untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on the
learning both across the splits of ActivityNet v1.3 and from THUMOS14 to
ActivityNet v1.3. Our AherNet demonstrates the superiority even comparing to
most fully-supervised action localization methods. More remarkably, we train
AherNet to localize actions from 600 categories on the leverage of action
moments in Kinetics-600 and temporal annotations from 200 classes in

streams of data and do not have access to all data at all times. The most
challenging setting requires a constant complexity of the deep model and an
incremental model update without access to a bounded memory of past data. Then,
the representations of past classes are strongly affected by catastrophic
forgetting. To mitigate its negative effect, an adapted fine tuning which
includes knowledge distillation is usually deployed. We propose a different
approach based on a vanilla fine tuning backbone. It leverages initial
classifier weights which provide a strong representation of past classes
because they are trained with all class data. However, the magnitude of
classifiers learned in different states varies and normalization is needed for
a fair handling of all classes. Normalization is performed by standardizing the
initial classifier weights, which are assumed to be normally distributed. In
addition, a calibration of prediction scores is done by using state level
statistics to further improve classification fairness. We conduct a thorough
evaluation with four public datasets in a memoryless incremental learning
setting. Results show that our method outperforms existing techniques by a
large margin for large-scale datasets.

that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order
to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a
two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge
distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot
network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the
spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking 1x1 convolution
layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and
image-specific noise model (CNN\_est) can be jointly trained via maximizing the
constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level
map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes'
rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to
clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real
noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form
another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by
training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments

drive-induced MBL, where a high-frequency drive can convert the ergodic phase
into the MBL phase. Remarkably, we find that coherent destruction of MBL is
also possible with the aid of a resonant drive. Thus in both the static and

the system are independent of whether the hopping is short-ranged or

SMMC densities for both the even- and odd-mass isotopes. For the even-mass
isotopes, we also compare our results with mean-field state densities
calculated with the finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
approximation. We find that the SPA+RPA repairs the deficiencies of the
mean-field approximation associated with broken rotational symmetry in deformed
nuclei and the violation of particle-number conservation in the pairing
condensate. In particular, in deformed nuclei the SPA+RPA reproduces the
rotational enhancement of the state density relative to the mean-field state
density.

Several Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, e.g., CycleGAN and cross-lingual

unsupervised setting---the mappings between the domains are learned from two
independent sets of training data in both domains (without paired samples).
However, those methods typically do not perform well on a significant
proportion of test samples. In this paper, we hypothesize that many of such
unsuccessful samples lie at the fringe---relatively low-density areas---of data
distribution, where the DNN was not trained very well, and propose to perform
Langevin dynamics to bring such fringe samples towards high density areas. We

undergone a metamorphosis from a stripped envelope to an interacting supernova.
An early spectrum indicates it exploded as a Type Ib supernova. Later, the
ejecta caught up with a dense circumstellar H-shell, ejected a few thousand
years before the explosion, triggering interaction between the supernova ejecta
and the dense shell, producing radio, X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission. We use
archival data with the Very Large Array in radio bands and with Chandra,
XMM-NEWTON and SWIFT-XRT in X-ray bands, along with published H$\alpha$
measurements. We combine these data with our low radio frequency observations
with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at two epochs covering three
frequencies. While the observations missed the phase when the shock entered the
dense shell, the X-rays indicate that the shock came out of the dense shell at
around 1750 days. The data suggest a forward shock origin of the X-ray
emission. Radio data show a spectral inversion at late epochs ($> 5000$\,d) at
around 3 GHz, which mimics the properties of the central absorbed component
seen in SN 1986J. A possible explanation for this component is that the
progenitor of \snem\ was a massive binary system which had undergone a period
of common envelope evolution. The hydrogen envelope from the \snem\ progenitor
may have been lost as a result of binary interaction.

such as disturbances, systems delays, constraints, uncertainties,
underperforming controllers, and unmodeled parameters that do not allow them to
achieve the desired performance. In situations where it is not possible to
redesign the inner-loop system, it is usual to incorporate an outer-loop
control that instructs the system to follow a modified reference path such that
the resultant path is close to the ideal one. Typically, strategies to design
the outer-loop control need to know a model of the system, which can be an
unfeasible task. In this paper, we propose a framework based on deep
reinforcement learning that can learn a policy to generate a modified reference

challenging cases in engineering: a flight control with a pilot model that

noise distributions. Given a rank-1 deformation of a random noise matrix, whose
entries are independently distributed with zero mean and unit variance, the
goal is to estimate the rank-1 part. For the case of Gaussian noise, the top
eigenvector of the given matrix is a widely-studied estimator known to achieve
optimal statistical guarantees, e.g., in the sense of the celebrated BBP phase
transition. However, this estimator can fail completely for heavy-tailed noise.
In this work, we exhibit an estimator that works for heavy-tailed noise up to
the BBP threshold that is optimal even for Gaussian noise. We give a
non-asymptotic analysis of our estimator which relies only on the variance of
each entry remaining constant as the size of the matrix grows: higher moments
may grow arbitrarily fast or even fail to exist. Previously, it was only known
how to achieve these guarantees if higher-order moments of the noises are
bounded by a constant independent of the size of the matrix. Our estimator can
be evaluated in polynomial time by counting self-avoiding walks via a color
-coding technique. Moreover, we extend our estimator to spiked tensor models
and establish analogous results.

the Sun was extremely quiet and unusually free from sunspots. However, despite
reduced frequency, candidate aurorae were reported in the mid-European sector
during this period and have been associated with occurrences of interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), whereas some of them have been identified as
misinterpretations. Here, we have analysed reports of candidate aurorae on 1
June 1680 with simultaneous observations in mid-Europe, and compared their
descriptions with visual accounts of early modern aurorae. Most contemporary
sunspot drawings from 22, 24, and 27 May 1680 have shown that this apparent
sunspot may have been a source of ICMEs, which caused the reported candidate
aurorae. On the other hand, its intensity estimate shows that the magnetic
storm during this candidate aurora was probably within the capability of the
storms derived from the corotating interaction region (CIR). Therefore, we
accommodate both ICMEs and CIRs as their possible origin. This interpretation
is probably applicable to the candidate aurorae in the often-cited Hungarian
catalogue, on the basis of the reconstructed margin of their equatorward
auroral boundary. Moreover, this catalogue itself has clarified that the
considerable candidates during the MM were probably misinterpretations.
Therefore, frequency of the auroral visibility in Hungary was probably lower
than previously considered and agree more with the generally slow solar wind in
the existing reconstructions, whereas sporadic occurrences of sunspots and
coronal holes still caused occasional geomagnetic storms.

better prediction performance without the use of models with huge number of

in arXiv:2008.12514. Here we extend the conjecture to 3-folds with
non-$(p,p)$-cohomology and we prove it in two specializations. For the first
specialization, we let $S$ be a simply-connected surface and consider the
moduli space $P_n(S\times \mathbb{P}^1, n[\mathbb{P}^1])$, which happens to be
isomorphic to the Hilbert scheme $S^{[n]}$ of $n$ points on $S$. The Virasoro
constraints for stable pairs, in this case, can be formulated entirely in terms
of descendents in the Hilbert scheme of points. The two main ingredients of the
proof are the toric case and the existence of universal formulas for integrals
of descendents on $S^{[n]}$. The second specialization consists in taking the
3-fold $X$ to be a cubic and the curve class $\beta$ to be the line class. In
this case we compute the full theory of stable pairs using the geometry of the
Fano variety of lines.

gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply
role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in
data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of
including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded
in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design, and
education science. We create two versions of a game -- one with narrative
elements and one without -- and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants
between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite
participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to
additional elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve
engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant
differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences
in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and

  https://github.com/cszn/DPIR",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent works on plug-and-play image restoration have shown that a denoiser
can implicitly serve as the image prior for model-based methods to solve many
inverse problems. Such a property induces considerable advantages for
plug-and-play image restoration (e.g., integrating the flexibility of
model-based method and effectiveness of learning-based methods) when the
denoiser is discriminatively learned via deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) with large modeling capacity. However, while deeper and larger CNN models
are rapidly gaining popularity, existing plug-and-play image restoration
hinders its performance due to the lack of suitable denoiser prior. In order to
push the limits of plug-and-play image restoration, we set up a benchmark deep
denoiser prior by training a highly flexible and effective CNN denoiser. We
then plug the deep denoiser prior as a modular part into a half quadratic
splitting based iterative algorithm to solve various image restoration
problems. We, meanwhile, provide a thorough analysis of parameter setting,
intermediate results and empirical convergence to better understand the working
mechanism. Experimental results on three representative image restoration
tasks, including deblurring, super-resolution and demosaicing, demonstrate that
the proposed plug-and-play image restoration with deep denoiser prior not only
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art model-based methods but also
achieves competitive or even superior performance against state-of-the-art
learning-based methods. The source code is available at

Earlier, we found a mechanism of a loose fixation of the background scale of
Regge lengths. This elementary length scale is defined by the Planck scale and
some free parameter of such a quantum extension of the theory. Besides, Regge
action was reduced to an expansion over metric variations between the
tetrahedra and, in the main approximation, is a finite-difference form of the
Hilbert-Einstein action. Using for the Schwarzschild problem a priori general
non-spherically symmetrical ansatz, we get finite-difference equations for its
discrete version. This defines a solution which at large distances is close to
the continuum Schwarzschild geometry, and the metric and effective curvature at
the center are cut off at the elementary length scale. Slow rotation can also
be taken into account (Lense-Thirring-like metric). Thus we get a general
approach to the classical background in the quantum framework in zero order: it
is an optimal starting point for the perturbative expansion of the theory;
finite-difference equations are classical, the elementary length scale has

screw dislocations in face centered cubic (fcc) metals can achieve stable
steady state motion above the lowest shear wave speed ($v_\text{shear}$) which
is parallel to their direction of motion (often referred to as transonic
motion). This is in direct contrast to classical continuum analyses which
predict a divergence in the elastic energy of the host material at a crystal
geometry dependent `critical' velocity $v_\text{crit}$. Within this work, we
first demonstrate through analytic analyses that the elastic energy of the host
material diverges at a dislocation velocity ($v_\text{crit}$) which is greater
than $v_\text{shear}$, i.e. $v_\text{crit} > v_\text{shear}$. We argue that it
is this latter derived velocity ($v_\text{crit}$) which separates `subsonic'
and `supersonic' regimes of dislocation motion in the analytic solution.
  In addition to our analyses, we also present a comprehensive suite of MD
simulation results of steady state screw dislocation motion for a range of
stresses and several cubic metals at both cryogenic and room temperatures. At
room temperature, both our independent MD simulations and the earlier works
find stable screw dislocation motion only below our derived $v_\text{crit}$.
Nonetheless, in real-world polycrystalline materials $v_\text{crit}$ cannot be
interpreted as a hard limit for subsonic dislocation motion. In fact, at very
low temperatures our MD simulations of Cu at 10 Kelvin confirm a recent claim
in the literature that true `supersonic' screw dislocations with dislocation
velocities $v>v_\text{crit}$ are possible at very low temperatures.

MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) which enables
detection of non-beam events such as those from a supernova neutrino burst. The
low energies of the supernova neutrinos and the intense cosmic-ray background
flux due to the near-surface detector location makes triggering on these events
very challenging. Instead, MicroBooNE relies on a delayed trigger generated by
SNEWS (the Supernova Early Warning System) for detecting supernova neutrinos.
The continuous readout of the LArTPC generates large data volumes, and requires
the use of real-time compression algorithms (zero suppression and Huffman
compression) implemented in an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) in the
readout electronics. We present the results of the optimization of the data
reduction algorithms, and their operational performance. To demonstrate the
capability of the continuous stream to detect low-energy electrons, a sample of
Michel electrons from stopping cosmic-ray muons is reconstructed and compared
to a similar sample from the lossless triggered readout stream.

many-body systems, a phenomenon dubbed dynamical quantum phase transitions
(DQPTs), whose phenomenology is often divided in two types. One refers to
distinct phases according to long-time averaged order parameters, while the
other is focused on the non-analytical behavior emerging in the rate function
of the Loschmidt echo. Here we show that such DQPTs can be found in systems
with few degrees of freedom, i.e. they can take place without resorting to the
traditional thermodynamic limit. We illustrate this by showing the existence of
the two types of DQPTs in a quantum Rabi model -- a system involving a
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and a bosonic mode. The dynamical criticality appears in the
limit of an infinitely large ratio of the spin frequency with respect to the
bosonic one. We determine its dynamical phase diagram and study the long-time
averaged order parameters, whose semiclassical approximation yields a jump at
the transition point. We find the critical times at which the rate function
becomes non-analytical, showing its associated critical exponent as well as the
corrections introduced by a finite frequency ratio. Our results open the door
for the study of DQPTs without the need to scale up the number of components,
thus allowing for their investigation in well controllable systems.

More specifically, widespread third party libraries and inherited components

non-quadratic losses, which do not satisfy such properties. For these problems,
standard nonconvex approaches such as rank-constrained projected gradient

could have poor empirical performance, and there is no satisfactory theory

  In this paper, we show that a critical component in provable low-rank
recovery with non-quadratic loss is a regularity projection oracle. This oracle
restricts iterates to low-rank matrices within an appropriate bounded set, over
which the loss function is well behaved and satisfies a set of approximate
RSC/RSM conditions. Accordingly, we analyze an (averaged) projected gradient
method equipped with such an oracle, and prove that it converges globally and

satellites. Moons in extrasolar systems are difficult to detect, but a
Neptune-sized exomoon candidate has been recently found around a Jupiter-sized
planet in the Kepler-1625bsystem. Due to their relative ease of detection, hot
Jupiters (HJs), which reside in close orbits around their host stars with a
period of a few days, may be very good candidates to search for exomoons. It is
still unknown whether the HJ population can host (or may have hosted) exomoons.
One suggested formation channel for HJs is high-eccentricity migration induced
by a stellar binary companion combined with tidal dissipation. Here, we
investigate under which circumstances an exomoon can prevent or allow
high-eccentricity migration of a HJ, and in the latter case, if the exomoon can
survive the migration process. We use both semianalytic arguments, as well as
direct N-body simulations including tidal interactions. Our results show that
massive exomoons are efficient at preventing high-eccentricity migration. If an
exomoon does instead allow for planetary migration, it is unlikely that the HJ
formed can host exomoons since the moon will either spiral onto the planet or
escape from it during the migration process. A few escaped exomoons can become
stable planets after the Jupiter has migrated, or by tidally migrating
themselves. The majority of the exomoons end up being ejected from the system
or colliding with the primary star and the host planet. Such collisions might
nonetheless leave observable features, such as a debris disc around the primary

finite-horizon Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. The formulation includes both
induced $\mathcal{L}_2$ and terminal Euclidean norm penalties. Existing
computational approaches include the power iteration and bisection of a Riccati
Differential Equation (RDE). The power iteration has low computation time per
iteration but overall convergence can be slow. In contrast, the RDE condition
provides guaranteed bounds on the induced gain but single RDE integration can
be slow. The complementary features of these two algorithms are combined to
develop a new algorithm that is both fast and provides provable upper and lower
bounds on the induced norm within the desired tolerance. The algorithm also
provides a worst-case disturbance input that achieves the lower bound on the
norm. We also present a new proof which shows that the power iteration for this
problem converges monotonically. Finally, we show a controllability Gramian
based simpler computational method for induced $\mathcal{L}_2$-to-Euclidean
norm. This can be used to compute the reachable set at any time on the horizon.
Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.

the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to
automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in
science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related
research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted
from visual, linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, which
behavioral modalities are uniquely important to the prediction of emotional
expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to
emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable
transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an
existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test
predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on
this dataset (RMSE=0.65, R^2=0.45, r=0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform
best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform
models trained on the visual modality. Finally, examination of our
interpretable models' coefficients reveals a number of visual and linguistic
behavioral signals--such as facial action unit intensity, overall word count,
and use of words related to social processes--that reliably predict emotional
expressiveness.

is not yet possible, but we generally assume that planets have compositions
similar to those of their host stars. Therefore, using the Hypatia Catalog of

~1% of all stars and 1% of exoplanet hosts, makes it difficult to deduce clear
trends in the stellar data, let alone the role of P in the evolution of an
exoplanet. Our Sun has relatively high P and Earth biology requires a small,
but finite, amount of P. On rocky planets that form around host stars with
substantially less P, the strong partitioning of P into the core could rule out
the potential for surface P and, consequently, for life on that planet's

states accessible from theories of Abelian composite particles. Here we focus
on dualities relating theories of Abelian quantum Hall states of bosons or
fermions to theories of non-Abelian ""composite fermions"" partially filling

a non-Abelian, $U(k)_2$ Blok-Wen state. Rather than being in conflict with the

infrared and lowest Landau level limits fail to commute across the duality. In
such a scenario, the non-Abelian topological order can be destabilized in favor
of the Abelian ground state, suggesting the presence of a phase transition
between the Abelian and non-Abelian states that is likely to be first order. We
also generalize these constructions to other non-Abelian fermion-fermion
dualities, in the process obtaining new derivations of a variety of paired
composite fermion phases using duality, including the anti-Pfaffian state.
Finally, we describe how, in multilayer constructions, excitonic pairing of the

describe the interaction between a massive black hole and the surrounding

collapse of baryonic matter at the galactic center. It also depicts dark matter
depletion as a reaction to an inspiralling binary within the halo. We calculate
total energy loss, and linear and angular momenta radiated during these

friction acting on moving bodies in these backgrounds. We show that the
gravitational collapse to a supermassive black hole at the center of a

dependency of galaxy properties on large-scale environment is mostly inherited
from the (large-scale) environmental dependency of their host halo mass. When
adopting a residual analysis that removes the host halo mass effect, we detect
a direct and non-negligible influence of cosmic filaments. Proximity to
filaments enhances the build-up of stellar mass, a result in agreement with
previous studies. However, our multi-scale analysis also reveals that, at the
edge of filaments, star formation is suppressed. In addition, we find clues for
compaction of the stellar distribution at close proximity to filaments. We
suggest that gas transfer from the outside to the inside of the haloes (where
galaxies reside) becomes less efficient closer to filaments, due to high
angular momentum supply at the vorticity-rich edge of filaments. This quenching
mechanism may partly explain the larger fraction of passive galaxies in
filaments, as inferred from observations at lower redshifts.

reduces to $M=\frac32 \pi^{\frac13} J^{\frac23} + \pi \alpha$. The positive
sign of the $\alpha$-correction implies that the centrifugal repulsion
associated with rotations becomes weaker than the gravitational attraction
under the unitary requirement for the Gauss-Bonnet term.

redshift bins in the redshift range $2 \leq z \leq 4$ with a sample of 103 high
resolution, high S/N Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra using four different flux
distribution statistics. Our measurements are calibrated with mock spectra from
a large suite of hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with our thermal IGM
evolution code CITE, finely sampling amplitude and slope of the expected
temperature-density relation. The thermal parameters inferred from our
measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter distribution, as
well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective
errors and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the
temperature density relation expected from HeII reionization. Combining our
measurements from the different flux statistics gives $T_0=(14750 \pm 1322)$K
for the peak temperature at mean density and a corresponding minimum slope
$\gamma = 1.225 \pm 0.120$. The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at $z
\approx 3$, in agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the
presence of such a peak, albeit with a large scatter. Using CITE, we also
calculate the thermal state of the IGM predicted by five widely used (spatially
homogeneous) UV-background models. The rather rapid thermal evolution inferred
by our measurements is well reproduced by two of the models, if we assume
(physically well motivated) non-equilibrium evolution with photo-heating rates
that are reduced by a moderate factor of $\sim 0.7-0.8$. The other three models
predict HeII reionization to be more extended with a somewhat earlier as well
as higher temperature peak than our measurements suggest.

quantum tunneling in field theory. Of particular interest is a stochastic
approach which involves (i) sampling from the free theory Gaussian
approximation to the Wigner distribution in order to obtain stochastic initial
conditions for the field and momentum conjugate, then (ii) evolving under the
classical field equations of motion, which leads to random bubble formation.
Previous work showed parametric agreement between the logarithm of the
tunneling rate in this stochastic approach and the usual instanton
approximation. However, recent work [1] claimed excellent agreement between
these methods. Here we show that this approach does not in fact match
precisely; the stochastic method tends to overpredict the instanton tunneling
rate. To quantify this, we parameterize the standard deviations in the initial
stochastic fluctuations by $\epsilon \sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the actual
standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution and $\epsilon$ is a fudge
factor; $\epsilon = 1$ is the physical value. We numerically implement the
stochastic approach to obtain the bubble formation rate for a range of
potentials in 1+1-dimensions, finding that $\epsilon$ always needs to be
somewhat smaller than unity to suppress the otherwise much larger stochastic
rates towards the instanton rates; for example, in the potential of [1] one
needs $\epsilon \approx 1/2$. We find that a mismatch in predictions also
occurs when sampling from other Wigner distributions, and in single particle
quantum mechanics even when the initial quantum system is prepared in an exact
Gaussian state. If the goal is to obtain agreement between the two methods, our
results show that the stochastic approach would be useful if a prescription to
specify optimal fudge factors for fluctuations can be developed.

subhalos with no detectable associated stellar component. Such subhalos are
invisible unless their dark matter annihilates to visible states such as
photons. One of the established methods for identifying candidate subhalos is
to search for individual unassociated gamma-ray sources with properties
consistent with the dark matter expectation. However, robustly ruling out an
astrophysical origin for any such candidate is challenging. In this work, we
present a complementary approach that harnesses information about the entire
population of subhalos---such as their spatial and mass distribution in the
Galaxy---to search for a signal of annihilating dark matter. Using simulated
data, we show that the collective emission from subhalos can imprint itself in
a unique way on the statistics of observed photons, even when individual
subhalos may be too dim to be resolved on their own. Additionally, we
demonstrate that, for the models we consider, the signal can be identified even
in the face of unresolved astrophysical point-source emission of extragalactic
and Galactic origin. This establishes a new search technique for subhalos that
is complementary to established methods, and that could have important
ramifications for gamma-ray dark matter searches using observatories such as
the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the Cherenkov Telescope Array.

the luminous, z=6.31 QSO SDSS~J1030+0524, that is powered by a billion solar
mass black hole. The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). The four LBGs have
been identified among a sample of 21 i-band dropouts with z{AB}<25.5 selected
up to projected separations of 5 physical Mpc (15 arcmin) from the QSO. Their
redshifts have been determined through up to 8hr-long multi-object
spectroscopic observations at 8-10m class telescopes. The two LAEs have been
identified in a 6hr VLT/MUSE observation centered on the QSO. The redshifts of
the six galaxies cover the range 6.129-6.355. Assuming that peculiar velocities
are negligible, this range corresponds to radial separations of +/-5 physical
Mpc from the QSO, that is comparable to the projected scale of the observed LBG
distribution on the sky. We conservatively estimate that this structure is
significant at >3.5 sigma level, and that the level of the galaxy overdensity
is at least 1.5-2 within the large volume sampled (~780 physical Mpc^3). The
spectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV
luminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This
is the first spectroscopic identification of a galaxy overdensity around a
super-massive black hole in the first billion years of the Universe. Our
finding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes
form and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale
structures, and that the absence of earlier detections of such systems was
likely due to observational limitations.

charmonium states in the $D^+D^-$ channel. A model-independent analysis, using
LHCb proton-proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of
$\sqrt{s}=7,8,$ and $13$ TeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of
9 fb$^{-1}$, is carried out to test this hypothesis. The description of the
data assuming that resonances only manifest in decays to the $D^+D^-$ pair is
shown to be incomplete. This constitutes evidence for a new contribution to the
decay, potentially one or more new charm-strange resonances in the $D^-K^+$
channel with masses around 2.9 GeV$/c^2$.

reasonable system parameters, allowing for submicrosecond readout with high
fidelity. For Majorana transmons, the light-matter interaction used for readout
manifestly conserves Majorana parity, which leads to a notion of quantum
nondemolition (QND) readout that is stronger than for conventional charge
qubits. In contrast, Majorana box qubits only recover an approximately QND
readout mechanism in the dispersive limit where the resonator detuning is
large. We also compare dispersive readout to longitudinal readout for the

is to measure radiation in the mHz range from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.
Such a detection would place strong constraints on hypothetical departures from
a Kerr description for astrophysically stable black holes. The Kerr geometry,
which is unique in general relativity, admits a higher-order symmetry in the
form of a Carter constant, which implies that the equations of motion
describing test particle motion in a Kerr background are Liouville-integrable.
In this article, we investigate whether the Carter symmetry itself is
discernible from a generic deformation of the Kerr metric in the gravitational
waveforms for such inspirals. We build on previous studies by constructing a
new metric which respects current observational constraints, describes a black
hole, and contains two non-Kerr parameters, one of which controls the presence
or absence of the Carter symmetry, thereby controlling the existence of chaotic
orbits, and another which serves as a generic deformation parameter. We find
that these two parameters introduce fundamentally distinct features into the
orbital dynamics, and evince themselves in the gravitational waveforms through
a significant dephasing. Although only explored in the quadrupole
approximation, this, together with a Fisher metric analysis, suggests that
gravitational wave data analysis may be able to test, in addition to the
governing theory of gravity, the underlying symmetries of spacetime.

least $10\%-14\%$. However, by using non-unitary NLO multi-jet matching, we
estimate that these same corrections are at most $10\%-12\%$, and at the same
time exhibit the enhanced jet multiplicities that are slightly favored by data.

anomalous Hall conductivity. Since intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is not
expected for a chiral superconducting pairing developed on the single Ru
$d_{xy}$ orbital, multiorbital chiral pairing actively involving the Ru
$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals has been proposed as a potential mechanism. Here
we propose that AHE could still arise even if the chiral superconductivity is
predominantly driven by the $d_{xy}$ orbital. This is demonstrated through two
separate models which take into account subdominant orbitals in the Cooper
pairing, one involving the oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in the RuO$_2$
plane, and another the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. In both models, finite
orbital mixing between the dominant $d_{xy}$ and the other orbitals may induce
inter-orbital pairing between them, and the resultant states support intrinsic
AHE, with Kerr rotation angles that could potentially reconcile with the
experimental observation. Our proposal therefore sheds new light on the
microscopic pairing in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We also show that intrinsic Hall effect
is generally absent for non-chiral states such as $\mathcal{S}+i\mathcal{D}$,
$\mathcal{D}+i\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{D}+i\mathcal{G}$, which provides a
clear constraint on the symmetry of the superconducting order in this material.

characterisation of exoplanets to Galactic archaeology. Among them, the age of
stars cannot be directly measured, while the mass and radius can be measured in
some particular cases (binary systems, interferometry). Stellar ages, masses,
and radii have to be inferred from stellar evolution models by appropriate
techniques. We have designed a Python tool named SPInS. It takes a set of
photometric, spectroscopic, interferometric, and/or asteroseismic observational
constraints and, relying on a stellar model grid, provides the age, mass, and
radius of a star, among others, as well as error bars and correlations. We make
the tool available to the community via a dedicated website. SPInS uses a
Bayesian approach to find the PDF of stellar parameters from a set of classical
constraints. At the heart of the code is a MCMC solver coupled with
interpolation within a pre-computed stellar model grid. Priors can be
considered, such as the IMF or SFR. SPInS can characterise single stars or
coeval stars, such as members of binary systems or of stellar clusters. We
illustrate the capabilities of SPInS by studying stars that are spread over the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We then validate the tool by inferring the ages
and masses of stars in several catalogues and by comparing them with literature
results. We show that in addition to the age and mass, SPInS can efficiently
provide derived quantities, such as the radius, surface gravity, and seismic
indices. We demonstrate that SPInS can age-date and characterise coeval stars
that share a common age and chemical composition. The SPInS tool will be very
helpful in preparing and interpreting the results of large-scale surveys, such
as the wealth of data expected or already provided by space missions, such as
Gaia, Kepler, TESS, and PLATO.

Markov Random Fields. Markov Random Fields (MRF) are structured, probabilistic
graphical models over undirected graphs, and provide a fundamental unifying
modeling tool for statistical mechanics, probabilistic machine learning, and
artificial intelligence. Typically MRFs are complex and high-dimensional with
nodes and edges (connections) built in a modular fashion from simpler,
low-dimensional probabilistic models and their local connections; in turn, this
modularity allows to incorporate available data to MRFs and efficiently
simulate them by leveraging their graph-theoretic structure. Learning graphical
models from data and/or constructing them from physical modeling and
constraints necessarily involves uncertainties inherited from data, modeling
choices, or numerical approximations. These uncertainties in the MRF can be
manifested either in the graph structure or the probability distribution
functions, and necessarily will propagate in predictions for quantities of
interest. Here we quantify such uncertainties using tight, information based
bounds on the predictions of quantities of interest; these bounds take
advantage of the graphical structure of MRFs and are capable of handling the
inherent high-dimensionality of such graphical models. We demonstrate our
methods in MRFs for medical diagnostics and statistical mechanics models. In

Extensive efforts have been made on this field but there is still lack of ideal
MTI candidate with magnetic ordering of ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. Here,
we demonstrate a MTI sample of Mn(Bi0.7Sb0.3)4Te7 which holds the coexistence
of FM ground state and topological non-triviality. The dramatic modulation of
the magnetism is induced by a charge carrier engineering process by the way of
Sb substitution in MnBi4Te7 matrix with AFM ordering. The evolution of
magnetism in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)4Te7 is systematically investigated by magnetic
measurements and theoretical calculations. The clear topological surface states
of the FM sample of x = 0.3 are also verified by angle-resolved photoemission
spectra. We also aware that the FM sample of x = 0.3 is close to the charge
neutral point. Therefore, the demonstration of intrinsic FM-MTI of
Mn(Bi0.7Sb0.3)4Te7 in this work sheds light to the further studies of QAHE

transport approach employing a non-perturbative QCD description of the strongly
interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) in terms of dynamical quasiparticles and
the EoS based on lattice QCD. We compare the PHSD results for charm observables
with the calculations from BAMPS (Boltzmann Approach to Multi-Parton
Scatterings) which is based on perturbative QCD with massless partons and
interaction cross sections calculated in leading order of the QCD coupling. We
compare the $p_T$ dependence of the ratio $R_{AA}$ of $D$-mesons in $A+A$ over
$p+p$ collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions $N_{bin}$ as well as
the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D$-mesons calculated within the PHSD and BAMPS at
LHC energies. In other study, based on the PHSD calculations we find that the
dileptons from correlated $D-$meson semi-leptonic decays dominate the 'thermal'
radiation from the QGP in central Pb+Pb collisions at the intermediate masses
($1.2 < M < 3$ GeV) for higher invariant energies However, for invariant
energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 40$ GeV the QGP radiation overshines the contribution
from $D,{\bar D}$ decays such that one should observe a rather clear signal
from the partonic dilepton radiation. This finding provides promising
perspectives to measure the QGP radiation in the dilepton experiments at RHIC
BES and the future FAIR/NICA facilities.

include contributions from myriad noise sources in addition to any
gravitational wave signals. When regularly sampled data are available, such as
for ground based and future space based interferometers, analyses are typically
performed in the frequency domain, where stationary (time invariant) noise
processes can be modeled very efficiently. In reality, detector noise is not
stationary due to a combination of short duration noise transients and longer
duration drifts in the power spectrum. This non-stationarity produces
correlations across samples at different frequencies, obviating the main
advantage of a frequency domain analysis. Here an alternative time-frequency
approach to gravitational wave data analysis is proposed that uses discrete,
orthogonal wavelet wavepackets. The time domain data is mapped onto a uniform
grid of time-frequency pixels. For locally stationary noise - that is, noise
with an adiabatically varying spectrum - the time-frequency pixels are
uncorrelated, which greatly simplifies the calculation of quantities such as
the likelihood. Moreover, the gravitational wave signals from binary systems
can be compactly represented as a collection of lines in time-frequency space,
resulting in a computational cost for computing waveforms and likelihoods that
scales as the square root of the number of time samples, as opposed to the
linear scaling for time or frequency based analyses. Key to this approach is
having fast methods for computing binary signals directly in the wavelet
domain. Multiple fast transform methods are developed in detail.

described and predicted by an inverted catenary in several publications. The
underlying assumptions are a stationary fountain and the knowledge of the

existing methods could be addressed by a new technique - intermediate energy
proton irradiation (IEPI) - using beams of 10 - 30 MeV protons to rapidly and
uniformly damage bulk material specimens before direct testing of engineering
properties. IEPI is shown to achieve high fidelity to fusion and fission
environments in both primary damage production and transmutation, often
superior to nuclear reactor or typical (low-range) ion irradiation. Modeling
demonstrates that high doserates (0.1 - 1 DPA/per day) can be achieved in bulk

induced radioactivity. The capabilities of IEPI are demonstrated through a 12

of a nickel alloy (Alloy 718), reproducing neutron-induced data. These results
demonstrate that IEPI enables high throughput assessment of materials under

the quasi-stable Majorana edge mode occurring in non-integrable spin chains.
The dynamics of the edge mode is studied using exact diagonalization, and
compared with time-evolution with respect to an effective semi-infinite model
in Krylov space obtained from the recursion method. The effective Krylov
Hamiltonian is found to resemble a spatially inhomogeneous SSH model where the
hopping amplitude increases linearly with distance into the bulk, typical of
thermalizing systems, but also has a staggered or dimerized structure
superimposed on it. The non-perturbatively long lifetime of the edge mode is
shown to be due to this staggered structure which diminishes the effectiveness
of the linearly growing hopping amplitude. On taking the continuum limit of the
Krylov Hamiltonian, the edge mode is found to be equivalent to the quasi-stable
mode of a Dirac Hamiltonian on a half line, with a mass which is non-zero over
a finite distance, before terminating into a gapless metallic bulk. The

accordingly is critical for evolutionary success. However, exactly how the
sensory ability influences fitness is a topic of active research, while the
necessity of a time delay between when unreliable environmental cues are sensed
and when organisms can mount a response has yet to be explored at any length.
Accounting for this delay in phenotype response in models of population growth,
we find that a critical error probability can exist under certain environmental
conditions: an organism with a sensory system with any error probability less
than the critical value can achieve the same long-term growth rate as an
organism with a perfect sensing system. We also observe a trade off between the
evolutionary value of sensory information and robustness to error, mediated by
the rate at which the phenotype distribution relaxes to steady-state. The
existence of the critical error probability could have several important
evolutionary consequences, primarily that sensory systems operating at the
non-zero critical error probability may be evolutionarily optimal.

VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often
abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data
visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key
themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a
critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We
find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the
qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which
complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data
visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a
one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such
as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of
future directions for data visceralization.

the electromagnetic spectrum. The core of the model are observationally derived
probabilites on the occupation of galaxies by X-ray selected AGN. These are
used to seed mock galaxies drawn from stellar-mass functions with accretion
events and then associate them with spectral energy distributions that describe
both the stellar and AGN emission components. This approach is used to study
the complementarity between X-ray and WISE mid-infrared AGN selection methods.
We first show that the basic observational properties of the X-ray and WISE AGN
(magnitude, redshift distributions) are adequately reproduced by the model. We
then infer the level of contamination of the WISE selection and show that this
is dominated by non-AGN at redshifts z < 0.5. These are star-forming galaxies
that scatter into the WISE AGN selection wedge because of photometric
uncertainties affecting their colours. Our baseline model shows a sharp drop in
the number density of heavily obscured AGN above the Compton thick limit in the
WISE bands. The model also overpredicts by a factor of 1.5 the fraction of
X-ray associations in the WISE AGN selection box compared to observations. This
suggests a population of X-ray faint sources that is not reproduced by the
model. This discrepancy is discussed in the context of either heavily obscured
or intrinsically X-ray weak AGN. Evidence is found in favour of the latter.

important resource for understanding health disparities, but rarely is the full
dataset utilized for analysis. A barrier to incorporating the full data is a
lack of solid recommendations for variable selection, with researchers often
hand-selecting a few variables. Thus, we evaluated the ability of empirical
machine learning approaches to identify social-environmental factors having a
true association with a health outcome.
  Materials and Methods: We compared several popular machine learning methods,
including penalized regressions (e.g. lasso, elastic net), and tree ensemble
methods. Via simulation, we assessed the methods' ability to identify census
variables truly associated with binary and continuous outcomes while minimizing
false positive results (10 true associations, 1,000 total variables). We
applied the most promising method to the full census data (p=14,663 variables)
linked to prostate cancer registry data (n=76,186 cases) to identify
social-environmental factors associated with advanced prostate cancer.
  Results: In simulations, we found that elastic net identified many
true-positive variables, while lasso provided good control of false positives.
Using a combined measure of accuracy, hierarchical clustering based on
Spearman's correlation with sparse group lasso regression performed the best
overall. Bayesian Adaptive Regression Trees outperformed other tree ensemble
methods, but not the sparse group lasso. In the full dataset, the sparse group
lasso successfully identified a subset of variables, three of which replicated
earlier findings.
  Discussion: This analysis demonstrated the potential of empirical machine
learning approaches to identify a small subset of census variables having a
true association with the outcome, and that replicate across empiric methods.

shows a $T^2$ dependence below $T_c$ which though modifies to $T^{3/2}$
dependence at low temperature. In Ti substituted samples, temperature range for
$T^{3/2}$ dependence extends to higher temperature. Interestingly, this
$T^{3/2}$ dependence dominates in whole ferromagnetic regime in presence of
magnetic field. This evolution of electronic transport behavior can be
explained within the framework of Fermi liquid theory and electron-magnon
scattering mechanism. The negative magnetoresistance exhibits a hysteresis and
a crossover between negative and positive value with magnetic field which is
connected with magnetic behavior in series. The decreasing electronic
coefficient of specific heat with $x$ supports the increasing insulating

and localization of the gravitational wave and gamma-ray source led all other
space- and ground-based observatories to measure its kilonova and afterglow
across the electromagnetic spectrum, which started a new era in astronomy, the
so-called multi-messenger astronomy. Therefore, localizations of short
gamma-ray bursts, as counterparts of verified gravitational waves, is of
crucial importance since this will allow observatories to measure the kilonovae
and afterglows associated with these explosions. Our results show that, an
automated network of observatories, such as the Stellar Observations Network
Group (SONG), can be coupled with an interconnected multi-hop array of CubeSats
for transients (IMPACT) to localize SGRBs. IMPACT is a mega-constellation of
$\sim$80 CubeSats, each of which is equipped with gamma-ray detectors with
ultra-high temporal resolution to conduct full sky surveys in an energy range
of 50-300 keV and downlink the required data promptly for high accuracy
localization of the detected SGRB to a ground station. Additionally, we analyze
propagation and transmission delays from receipt of a SGRB signal to ground
station offload to consider the effects of constellation design, link, and
network parameters such as satellites per plane, data rate, and coding gain
from erasure correcting codes among others. IMPACT will provide near-real-time
localization of SGRBs with a total delay of $\sim$5 s, and will enable SONG
telescopes to join the efforts to pursue multi-messenger astronomy and help

one-electron orbitals are optimized and independent of basis set used, there
are no problems with using plane-wave basis sets. However, for methods
currently used in quantum computing such as select configuration interaction
(CI) and coupled cluster (CC) methods, it is necessary to have a virtual space
that is able to capture a significant amount of electron-electron correlation
in the system. The virtual orbitals in a pseudopotential plane-wave
Hartree--Fock calculation, because of Coulomb repulsion, are often scattering
states that interact very weakly with the filled orbitals. As a result, very
little correlation energy is captured from them. The use of virtual spaces
derived from the one-electron operators have also been tried, and while some
correlation is captured, the amount is quite low. To overcome these
limitations, we have been developing new classes of algorithms to define
virtual spaces by optimizing orbitals from small pairwise CI Hamiltonians,
which we term as correlation optimized virtual orbitals with the abbreviation
COVOs. With these procedures we have been able to derive virtual spaces,
containing only a few orbitals, that are able to capture a significant amount
of correlation. Besides, using these derived basis sets for quantum computing
calculations targeting full CI (FCI) quality-results, they can also be used in
other many-body approaches, including CC and M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation
theories, and open up the door to many-body calculations for pseudopotential
plane-wave basis set methods. For the H$_2$ molecule, we were able to obtain
good agreement with FCI/cc-pVTZ results with just 4 virtual orbitals, for both
FCI and quantum simulations.

of scalar data, an essential pre-processing step of topological data analysis
(TDA). Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the
proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that
is close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, sub-
and superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first
locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field,
such that these regions are guaranteed -- from a combinatorial perspective --
to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global
approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that
actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup.
Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize
shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high
parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for
the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent
topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall
execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds,
with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to x36.
Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on
topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the
persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined
persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and
its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and
acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics,
chemistry, and biomedical imaging.

complex interplay between the thermalizing effect of the dye molecules and the
nonequilibrium influence of driving and loss. The propagation of light in the
conductive regime occurs when several localized cavity modes undergo dynamical
phase transitions to a condensed, or lasing, state. Further, we observe that
while such transport is robust for weak disorder in the cavity potential,
strong disorder can lead to localization of light even under good thermalizing
conditions. Importantly, the exhibited transport and localization of light is a
manifestation of the nonequilibrium dynamics rather than any coherent

integral formulation, the lead degrees of freedom are integrated out in order
to compute both the current and the current correlations (noise) in this class
of systems, in terms of the dressed Green's function matrix of the quantum
dots. In order to illustrate the efficiency of this formalism, we apply our
results to the ""all superconducting Cooper pair beam splitter"", a device
composed of three superconducting leads connected via two quantum dots, where
crossed Andreev reflection operates Cooper pair splitting. Commensurate voltage
differences between the three leads allow to obtain expressions for the current

of the dot system. This voltage configuration allows the occurrence of
non-local processes involving multiple Cooper pairs which ultimately lead to
the presence of non-zero DC currents in an out-of-equilibrium situation. We
investigate in details the results for the noise obtained numerically in the

dominated by the so called ""quartet processes"", involving the coherent exchange
of two Cooper pairs among all three superconducting terminals. We show that
these processes are noiseless in the non-resonant case, and that this property

manipulate our graph such that the resulting topological sort is the sorted
array. By taking advantage of the many relations between Hamiltonian paths and
topological sorts in comparison graphs, we design a Divide-and-Conquer
algorithm that runs in the optimal $O(n \log n)$ time. In the process, we
construct a new merge process for graphs with relevant invariant properties for
our use. Furthermore, this method is more space-efficient than the famous {\sc
MergeSort} since we modify our fixed graph only.

applications. The literature contains personalized and socialized POI
recommendation approaches which employ historical check-ins and social links to
make recommendations. However these systems still lack customizability
(incorporating session-based user interactions with the system) and
contextuality (incorporating the situational context of the user), particularly
in cold start situations, where nearly no user information is available. In
this paper, we propose LikeMind, a POI recommendation system which tackles the
challenges of cold start, customizability, contextuality, and explainability by
exploiting look-alike groups mined in public POI datasets. LikeMind
reformulates the problem of POI recommendation, as recommending explainable
look-alike groups (and their POIs) which are in line with user's interests.
LikeMind frames the task of POI recommendation as an exploratory process where
users interact with the system by expressing their favorite POIs, and their
interactions impact the way look-alike groups are selected out. Moreover,
LikeMind employs ""mindsets"", which capture actual situation and intent of the
user, and enforce the semantics of POI interestingness. In an extensive set of
experiments, we show the quality of our approach in recommending relevant
look-alike groups and their POIs, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

tracking and segmentation (MOTS) method that uses instance segmentation results
as an input. The proposed method is based on the Gaussian mixture probability
hypothesis density (GMPHD) filter, a hierarchical data association (HDA), and a
mask-based affinity fusion (MAF) model to achieve high-performance online
tracking. The HDA consists of two associations: segment-to-track and
track-to-track associations. One affinity, for position and motion, is computed
by using the GMPHD filter, and the other affinity, for appearance is computed
by using the responses from a single object tracker such as a kernalized
correlation filter. These two affinities are simply fused by using a
score-level fusion method such as min-max normalization referred to as MAF. In
addition, to reduce the number of false positive segments, we adopt mask
IoU-based merging (mask merging). The proposed MOTS framework with the key
modules: HDA, MAF, and mask merging, is easily extensible to simultaneously
track multiple types of objects with CPU only execution in parallel processing.
In addition, the developed framework only requires simple parameter tuning
unlike many existing MOTS methods that need intensive hyperparameter
optimization. In the experiments on the two popular MOTS datasets, the key
modules show some improvements. For instance, ID-switch decreases by more than
half compared to a baseline method in the training sets. In conclusion, our
tracker achieves state-of-the-art MOTS performance in the test sets.

distributed manner to reduce signaling overhead. Due to the limited capability
of information gathering at the BS in massive scenarios, learning techniques
are best fit for such problems. Therefore, multi-arm bandit learning is adopted
to schedule the fast grant MTDs. Then, constrained random NOMA pairing is
proposed that assists in decoupling the two main challenges of fast uplink

we were able to significantly reduce the resource wastage due to prediction

Later on, with the works of W. Ross Ashby, for example, biological concepts
such as adaptation were interpreted in the light of cybernetic systems theory.
Adaptation is the process by which a system is capable of regulating or
controlling itself in order to adapt to changes of its inner and outer
environment maintaining a homeostatic state. In earlier works we have developed
a system metamodel that on the one hand refers to cybernetic concepts such as
structure, operation, and system, and on the other to the philosophy of
individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The result is the so-called allagmatic
method that is capable of creating concrete models of systems such as
artificial neural networks and cellular automata starting from abstract
building blocks. In this paper, we add to our already existing method the
cybernetic concepts of control and especially adaptation. In regard to the
system metamodel, we rely again on philosophical theories, this time the
philosophy of organism of Alfred N. Whitehead. We show how these new
meta-theoretical concepts are described formally and how they are implemented
in program code. We also show what role they play in simple experiments. We
conclude that philosophical abstract concepts help to better understand the
process of creating computer models and their control and adaptation. In the
outlook we discuss how the allagmatic method needs to be extended in order to
cover the field of complex systems and Norbert Wiener's ideas on control.

decades. The fundamental goal of homomorphic encryption is to enable
(untrusted) Oscar to perform a computation for Alice without Oscar knowing the
input to the computation or the output from the computation. Alice encrypts the
input before sending it to Oscar, and Oscar performs the computation directly
on the encrypted data, producing an encrypted result. Oscar then sends the
encrypted result of the computation back to Alice, who can decrypt it. We
describe an approach to homomorphic encryption for quantum annealing based on
spin reversal transformations and show that it comes with little or no
performance penalty. This is in contrast to approaches to homomorphic
encryption for classical computing, which incur a significant additional
computational cost. This implies that the performance gap between quantum
annealing and classical computing is reduced when both paradigms use
homomorphic encryption. Further, homomorphic encryption is critical for quantum
annealing because quantum annealers are native to the cloud -- a third party
(such as untrusted Oscar) performs the computation. If sensitive information,
such as health-related data subject to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, is to be processed with quantum annealers, such a technique
could be useful.

within the applicability of the KdV dynamics, which we refer to as weak
$(|\nu_o|< \sqrt{gh^3}/6)$ and strong $(|\nu_o|> \sqrt{gh^3}/6)$
parity-breaking regimes. While the `weak' parity breaking regime results in
minor qualitative differences in the soliton amplitude and velocity between the
right and left movers, the `strong' parity breaking regime on the contrary
results in solitons of depression (negative amplitude) in one of the chiral
sectors.

this study are collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and correspond
to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The W$^+$W$^-$ candidate events
are selected by requiring two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons).
Two methods for reducing background contributions are employed. In the first
one, a sequence of requirements on kinematic quantities is applied allowing a
measurement of the total production cross section: 117.6 $\pm$ 6.8 pb, which
agrees well with the theoretical prediction. Fiducial cross sections are also
reported for events with zero or one jet, and the change in the zero-jet
fiducial cross section with the jet transverse momentum threshold is measured.
Normalized differential cross sections are reported within the fiducial region.
A second method for suppressing background contributions employs two random
forest classifiers. The analysis based on this method includes a measurement of
the total production cross section and also a measurement of the normalized jet
multiplicity distribution in W$^+$W$^-$ events. Finally, a dilepton invariant
mass distribution is used to probe for physics beyond the standard model in the
context of an effective field theory, and constraints on the presence of
dimension-6 operators are derived.

of matter that suppress single scattering events for a finite range of
wavenumbers around the origin in reciprocal space. We derive analytical
formulas for the nearest-neighbor functions of disordered stealthy systems.
First, we analyze asymptotic small-$r$ approximations and bounding expressions
of the nearest-neighbor functions based on the pseudo-hard-sphere ansatz. We
then determine how many of the standard $n$-point correlation functions are
needed to determine the nearest neighbor functions, and find that a finite
number suffice. Via theoretical and computational methods, we compare the
large-$r$ behavior of these functions for disordered stealthy systems to those
belonging to crystalline lattices. Such ordered and disordered stealthy systems
have bounded hole sizes. However, we find that the approach to the
critical-hole size can be quantitatively different. We argue that the
probability of finding a hole close to the critical-hole size should decrease
as a power law with an exponent only dependent on the space dimension $d$ for
ordered systems, but that this probability decays asymptotically faster for
disordered systems. This implies that holes close to the critical-hole size are
rarer in disordered systems. The rarity of observing large holes in disordered
systems creates substantial numerical difficulties in sampling the nearest
neighbor distributions near the critical-hole size. This motivates both the
need for new computational methods for efficient sampling and the development
of novel theoretical methods. We also devise a simple analytical formula that
accurately describes these systems in the underconstrained regime for all $r$.
These results provide a foundation for the analytical description of the
nearest-neighbor functions of stealthy systems in the disordered,
underconstrained regime.

and Tur\'an says that this number of edges is $O\left(n^{2 - 1/k}\right)$. An
important variant of this problem is the analogous question in bipartite graphs
with VC-dimension at most $d$, where $d$ is a fixed integer such that $k \geq d
\geq 2$. A remarkable result of Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl [J. Eur.
Math. Soc. (JEMS), no. 19, 1785-1810] with multiple applications in incidence

We approach the estimation of a CIMM as a multi-class classification problem,
since dividing the dataset into different categories naturally leads to the
estimation of the mixture model. InClass nets consist of multiple independent
classifier neural networks (NNs), each of which handles one of the variates of
the CIMM. Fitting the CIMM to the data is performed by simultaneously training
the individual NNs using suitable cost functions. The ability of NNs to
approximate arbitrary functions makes our technique nonparametric. Further
leveraging the power of NNs, we allow the conditionally independent variates of
the model to be individually high-dimensional, which is the main advantage of
our technique over existing non-machine-learning-based approaches. We derive
some new results on the nonparametric identifiability of bivariate CIMMs, in
the form of a necessary and a (different) sufficient condition for a bivariate
CIMM to be identifiable. We provide a public implementation of InClass nets as
a Python package called RainDancesVI and validate our InClass nets technique
with several worked out examples. Our method also has applications in
unsupervised and semi-supervised classification problems.

modeling of coronal loops to obtain physically motivated observables that can
be quantitatively compared with observational measurements of active region

the plasma and subsequently the emission measure distribution. We find the that
the photospheric driving of the MHD model produces only very low-frequency

recent observations of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in

fact that charge transport through nanoscopic chiral structures favors a
particular electronic spin orientation, resulting in large room-temperature
spin polarizations. Observations of the CISS effect suggest opportunities for
spin control and for the design and fabrication of room-temperature quantum
devices from the bottom up, with atomic-scale precision. Any technology that
relies on optimal charge transport, including quantum devices for logic,
sensing, and storage, may benefit from chiral quantum properties. These
properties can be theoretically and experimentally investigated from a quantum
information perspective, which is presently lacking. There are uncharted
implications for the quantum sciences once chiral couplings can be engineered

  Journal Letters",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have shown that the thermal emission of the amorphous dust composed of
amorphous silicate dust (a-Si) and amorphous carbon dust (a-C) provides
excellent fit both to the observed intensity and the polarization spectra of
molecular clouds. The anomalous microwave emission (AME) originates from the
resonance transition of the two-level systems (TLS) attributed to the a-C with
an almost spherical shape. On the other hand, the observed polarized emission
in submillimeter wavebands is coming from a-Si. By taking into account a-C, the
model prediction of the polarization fraction of the AME is reduced
dramatically. Our model prediction of the 3$\sigma$ lower limits of the
polarization fraction of the Perseus and W 43 molecular clouds at 17 GHz are
$8.129 \times 10^{-5}$ and $8.012 \times 10^{-6}$, respectively. The
temperature dependence of the heat capacity of a-C shows the peculiar behavior
compared with that of a-Si. So far, the properties of a-C are unique to
interstellar dust grains. Therefore, we coin our dust model as the cosmic
amorphous dust model (CAD).

higher-form global symmetries. Every Yang-Mills gauge theory in six dimensions,
with field strength $f^{(2)}$, naturally gives rise to a continuous 1-form
global symmetry associated with the 2-form instanton current $J^{(2)} \sim *
\text{Tr} \left( f^{(2)} \wedge f^{(2)}\right)$. We show that suitable mixed
anomalies involving the gauge field $f^{(2)}$ and ordinary 0-form global
symmetries, such as flavor or Poincar\'e symmetries, lead to continuous 2-group
global symmetries, which allow two flavor currents or two stress tensors to
fuse into the 2-form current $J^{(2)}$. We discuss several features of 2-group
symmetry in six dimensions, many of which parallel the four-dimensional case.
The majority of six-dimensional supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs)
and little string theories have infrared phases with non-abelian gauge fields.
We show that the mixed anomalies leading to 2-group symmetries can be present
in little string theories, but that they are necessarily absent in SCFTs. This
allows us to establish a previously conjectured algorithm for computing the 't
Hooft anomalies of most SCFTs from the spectrum of weakly-coupled massless
particles on the tensor branch of these theories. We then apply this
understanding to prove that the $a$-type Weyl anomaly of all SCFTs with a
tensor branch must be positive, $a > 0$.

applications ranging from node-role discovery to link prediction and molecule
classification. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in
graph representation learning. However, expressive power of GNNs is limited by
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identical
representations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different.
More powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, only
focus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient as
they cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose and
mathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termed
Distance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, while
providing strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures the
distance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and each
node in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distance
measures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. We
propose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) as
controllers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize the
sparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computational
efficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node sets
embedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail. We
evaluate DE on three tasks over six real networks: structural role prediction,
link prediction, and triangle prediction. Results show that our models
outperform GNNs without DE by up-to 15\% in accuracy and AUROC. Furthermore,
our models also significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods
especially designed for the above tasks.

benefits, b. A defector is one who does not pay any cost but enjoys the
benefits of cooperators. Human societies, especially, have evolved a strategy
to discourage defection, punishment. Costly punishment is a type of punishment
where an agent in a biological network or some cooperative scheme pays a cost
to ensure another agent incurs some cost. A previous study shows how parameters
like diversity in neighbors across games, density of connectivity, and costly
punishment influence the evolution of cooperation in non-regular networks. In
this study, evolution in regular networks due to the influence of costly
punishment is also considered, specifically spatial lattices. This study
compares observations between non-regular and regular networks as these
parameters change and brings a clearer understanding of interactions that occur
in these networks. The models, results and analysis bring a new understanding
to game theory and punishment. The results show that costly punishment never
arises as a sole evolutionary strategy. However, in evolutionary games where
costly punishers could evolve more favorable strategies, the initial presence
of costly punishers would bring about high average payoffs in all types of
regular networks and heterogeneous networks. In regular networks, every node
has the same degree, k. Although punishment is conventionally thought to be
anti-progressive, in the presence of diversity in neighbors, it magnifies the
payoff of a group for all heterogeneous networks. In regular networks however,
diversity in neighbors is not required for costly punishment to boost average
payoff. This suggests an answer to the question on why costly punishment has
been favored by natural selection, which is particularly obvious in human
populations.

beyond the visible content to answer questions about an image. This ability is
challenging but indispensable to achieve general VQA. One limitation of
existing KVQA solutions is that they jointly embed all kinds of information
without fine-grained selection, which introduces unexpected noises for
reasoning the correct answer. How to capture the question-oriented and
information-complementary evidence remains a key challenge to solve the
problem. Inspired by the human cognition theory, in this paper, we depict an
image by multiple knowledge graphs from the visual, semantic and factual views.
Thereinto, the visual graph and semantic graph are regarded as
image-conditioned instantiation of the factual graph. On top of these new
representations, we re-formulate Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering as a
recurrent reasoning process for obtaining complementary evidence from
multimodal information. To this end, we decompose the model into a series of
memory-based reasoning steps, each performed by a G raph-based R ead, U pdate,
and C ontrol ( GRUC ) module that conducts parallel reasoning over both visual
and semantic information. By stacking the modules multiple times, our model
performs transitive reasoning and obtains question-oriented concept
representations under the constrain of different modalities. Finally, we
perform graph neural networks to infer the global-optimal answer by jointly
considering all the concepts. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on
three popular benchmark datasets, including FVQA, Visual7W-KB and OK-VQA, and
demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model with extensive

distancing during the spread of an epidemic. The payoffs of the agents depend
on the social distancing they practice and on the probability of getting
infected. We consider two types of agents, the non-vulnerable agents who have a
small cost if they get infected, and the vulnerable agents who have a higher
cost. For the modeling of the epidemic outbreak, we consider a variant of the
SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model involving populations of susceptible,
infected, and removed persons of vulnerable and non-vulnerable types. The Nash
equilibria of this social distancing game are studied. The main contribution of
this work is the analysis of the case where the players, desiring to achieve a
low social inequality, pose a bound on the variance of the payoffs. In this
case, we introduce and characterize a notion of Generalized Nash Equilibrium
(GNE) for games with a continuum of players. Through numerical studies, we show
that inequality constraints result in a slower spread of the epidemic and an
improved cost for the vulnerable players. Furthermore, it is possible that
inequality constraints are beneficial for non-vulnerable players as well.

technology sector, with applications ranging from ride-hailing platforms to

the derivation of the optimal design has been elusive, hindering practitioners
from drawing valid causal conclusions with enough statistical power. We address
this limitation by deriving the optimal design of switchback experiments under
a range of different assumptions on the order of the carryover effect -- the
length of time a treatment persists in impacting the outcome. We cast the
optimal experimental design problem as a minimax discrete optimization problem,
identify the worst-case adversarial strategy, establish structural results, and
solve the reduced problem via a continuous relaxation. For switchback
experiments conducted under the optimal design, we provide two approaches for
performing inference. The first provides exact randomization based p-values,
and the second uses a new finite population central limit theorem to conduct
conservative hypothesis tests and build confidence intervals. We further
provide theoretical results when the order of the carryover effect is
misspecified and provide a data-driven procedure to identify the order of the
carryover effect. We conduct extensive simulations to study the numerical

one we study quantum channels, which are the most general operations mapping
quantum states into quantum states, from the point of view of their
divisibility properties. We introduced tools to test if a given quantum channel
can be implemented by a process described by a Lindblad master equation. This
in turn defines channels that can be divided in such a way that they form a
one-parameter semigroup, thus introducing the most restricted studied
divisibility type of this work. Using our results, together with the study of
other types of divisibility that can be found in the literature, we
characterized the space of qubit quantum channels. We found interesting results
connecting the concept of entanglement-breaking channel and infinitesimal
divisibility. Additionally we proved that infinitely divisible channels are
equivalent to the ones that are implementable by one-parameter semigroups,
opening this question for more general channel spaces. In the second project we
study the functional forms of one-mode Gaussian quantum channels in the
position state representation, beyond Gaussian functional forms. We perform a
black-box characterization using complete positivity and trace preserving
conditions, and report the existence of two subsets that do not have a
functional Gaussian form. The study covers as particular limit the case of
singular channels, thus connecting our results with the known classification
scheme based on canonical forms. Our full characterization of Gaussian channels
without Gaussian functional form is completed by showing how Gaussian states
are transformed under these operations, and by deriving the conditions for the
existence of master equations for the non-singular cases.

(P2P) energy markets. It is proved that if no trade weights are enforced and
the communication structure between successfully traded peers is connected,
then the optimal clearing price and total traded powers in P2P market are the
same with that in the pool-based market. However, if such communication
structure is unconnected, then the P2P market is clustered into smaller P2P
markets. If the trade weights are imposed, then the derived P2P market
solutions can be significantly changed. Next, a novel decentralized
optimization approach is proposed to derive a trading mechanism for P2P
markets, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which
naturally fits into the bidirectional trading in P2P energy systems and
converges reasonably fast. Analytical formulas of variable updates reveal
insightful relations for each pair of prosumers on their individually traded
prices and powers with their total traded powers. Further, based on those
formulas, decentralized learning schemes for tuning parameters of prosumers
cost functions are proposed to attain successful trading with total traded
power amount as desired. Case studies on a synthetic system and the IEEE
European Low Voltage Test Feeder are then carried out to verify the proposed
approaches.

fusarium wilt in radish crops. Recent wilt detection algorithms are either
based on image processing techniques or conventional machine learning
algorithms. However, our methodology is based on a hybrid algorithm, which
combines image processing and machine learning. First, the crop image is
divided into three segments, which include viz., healthy vegetation, ground and
packing material. Based on the HSV decision tree algorithm, all the three
segments are segregated from the image. Second, the extracted segments are
summed together into an empty canvas of the same resolution as the image and
one new image is produced. Third, this new image is compared with the original
image, and a final noisy image, which contains traces of wilt is extracted.
Finally, a k-means algorithm is applied to eliminate the noise and to extract
the accurate wilt from it. Moreover, the extracted wilt is mapped on the
original image using the contouring method. The proposed combination of
algorithms detects the wilt appropriately, which surpasses the traditional
practice of separately using the image processing techniques or machine
learning.

Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) have the potential to
enable an unprecedented characterization of the physical processes and

paper, we focus on investigating the dynamical formation of BHBs in dense star
clusters through a state-of-art set of 58 direct N-body simulations with N <=
200,000 particles which include stellar evolution, gravitational braking,
orbital decay through gravitational radiation and galactic tidal interactions.
The simulations encompass a range of initial conditions representing typical
young globular clusters, including the presence of primordial binaries. The
systems are simulated for ~ 12 Gyr. The dataset yields 117 BHB gravitational
wave events, with 97 binaries merging within their host cluster, and 20 merging
after having been ejected. Only 8% of all ejected BHBs merge within the age of
the Universe. Systems in this merging subset tend to have smaller separations
and larger eccentricities, as this combination of parameters results in greater
emission of gravitational radiation. We confirm known trends from Monte Carlo
simulations, such as the anti-correlation between the mass of the binary and
age of the cluster. In addition, we highlight for the first time a difference
at low values of the mass ratio distribution between in-cluster and ejected
mergers. However, the results depend on assumptions on the strength of
gravitational wave recoils, thus in-cluster mergers cannot be ruled out at a
significant level of confidence. A more substantial catalogue of BHB mergers
and a more extensive library of N-body simulations are needed to constrain the
origin of the observed events.

regions, called districts. Voters in each district elect a representative. The
primary criteria are: each district is connected, district populations are
equal (or nearly equal), and districts are ""compact"". There are multiple
competing definitions of compactness, usually minimizing some quantity.
  One measure that has been recently promoted by Duchin and others is number of
cut edges. In redistricting, one is given atomic regions out of which each
district must be built. The populations of the atomic regions are given.
Consider the graph with one vertex per atomic region (with weight equal to the
region's population) and an edge between atomic regions that share a boundary.
A districting plan is a partition of vertices into $k$ parts, each connnected,
of nearly equal weight. The districts are considered compact to the extent that
the plan minimizes the number of edges crossing between different parts.
  Consider two problems: find the most compact districting plan, and sample
districting plans under a compactness constraint uniformly at random. Both
problems are NP-hard so we restrict the input graph to have branchwidth at most
$w$. (A planar graph's branchwidth is bounded by its diameter.) If both $k$ and
$w$ are bounded by constants, the problems are solvable in polynomial time.
Assume vertices have weight~1. One would like algorithms whose running times
are of the form $O(f(k,w) n^c)$ for some constant $c$ independent of $k$ and
$w$, in which case the problems are said to be fixed-parameter tractable with
respect to $k$ and $w$). We show that, under a complexity-theoretic assumption,
no such algorithms exist. However, we do give algorithms with running time
$O(c^wn^{k+1})$. Thus if the diameter of the graph is moderately small and the
number of districts is very small, our algorithm is useable.

on introducing a parameter $c > \inf U$, which de facto modifies the
optimization landscape and clips the critical height in IKSA at a maximum of $c

logarithmic cooling than KSA. To tune the parameter $c$, we propose an adaptive

costs, the equilibrium they reach can be worse than the socially optimal
routing. Tolls are often used to mitigate this effect in traditional congestion

the proliferation of autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance technology,
vehicles become heterogeneous in how they contribute to road latency. This
magnifies the potential inefficiencies due to selfish routing and invalidates
traditional tolling methods. To address this, we consider a network of parallel
roads where the latency on each road is an affine function of the quantity of
flow of each vehicle type. We provide tolls (which differentiate between
vehicle types) which are guaranteed to minimize social cost at equilibrium. The
tolls are a function of a calculated optimal routing; to enable this tolling,
we prove that some element in the set of optimal routings has a lack of cycles
in a graph representing the way vehicles types share roads. We then show that
unless a planner can differentiate between vehicle types in the tolls given,
the resulting equilibrium can be unboundedly worse than the optimal routing,

  A supermatroid is a generalization of a matroid defined on lattices. Here,
the central question is whether a supermatroid can be characterized by several

many graph-related tasks, e.g., node classification. However, recent works show
that GNNs are vulnerable to evasion attacks, i.e., an attacker can slightly
perturb the graph structure to fool GNN models. Existing evasion attacks to
GNNs have several key drawbacks: 1) they are limited to attack two-layer GNNs;
2) they are not efficient; or/and 3) they need to know GNN model parameters. We
address the above drawbacks in this paper and propose an influence-based
evasion attack against GNNs. Specifically, we first introduce two influence
functions, i.e., feature-label influence and label influence, that are defined
on GNNs and label propagation (LP), respectively. Then, we build a strong
connection between GNNs and LP in terms of influence. Next, we reformulate the
evasion attack against GNNs to be related to calculating label influence on LP,
which is applicable to multi-layer GNNs and does not need to know the GNN

Finally, we evaluate our influence-based attack on three benchmark graph

sparsity issue and speed up the running time, the two representations are still
computationally inefficient. Compared to them, the range image representation
is dense and compact which can exploit powerful 2D convolution. Even so, the
range image is not preferred in 3D object detection due to scale variation and
occlusion. In this paper, we utilize the dilated residual block (DRB) to better
adapt different object scales and obtain a more flexible receptive field.
Considering scale variation and occlusion, we propose the RV-PV-BEV (range
view-point view-bird's eye view) module to transfer features from RV to BEV.
The anchor is defined in BEV which avoids scale variation and occlusion.
Neither RV nor BEV can provide enough information for height estimation;
therefore, we propose a two-stage RCNN for better 3D detection performance. The
aforementioned point view not only serves as a bridge from RV to BEV but also
provides pointwise features for RCNN. Experiments show that RangeRCNN achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset,

problem by iteratively updating a set of particles with a ""sampling-weighting""
loop. Sampling is decisive to the performance of MCL [1]. However, traditional
MCL can only sample from a uniform distribution over the state space. Although
variants of MCL propose different sampling models, they fail to provide an
accurate distribution or generalize across scenes. To better deal with these
problems, we present a distribution proposal model, named Deep Samplable
Observation Model (DSOM). DSOM takes a map and a 2D laser scan as inputs and
outputs a conditional multimodal probability distribution of the pose, making
the samples more focusing on the regions with higher likelihood. With such
samples, the convergence is expected to be more effective and efficient.
Considering that the learning-based sampling model may fail to capture the true
pose sometimes, we furthermore propose the Adaptive Mixture MCL (AdaM MCL),
which deploys a trusty mechanism to adaptively select updating mode for each
particle to tolerate this situation. Equipped with DSOM, AdaM MCL can achieve
more accurate estimation, faster convergence and better scalability compared to
previous methods in both synthetic and real scenes. Even in real environments
with long-term changing, AdaM MCL is able to localize the robot using DSOM
trained only by simulation observations from a SLAM map or a blueprint map.

form a directed network. Agents' preferences over the form of the network
consist of an arbitrary network benefit function (e.g., agents may have
preferences over their network centrality) and a private component which is
additively separable in own links. This latter component allows for unobserved
heterogeneity in the costs of sending and receiving links across agents
(respectively out- and in- degree heterogeneity) as well as
homophily/heterophily across the $K$ types of agents. In contrast, the network
benefit function allows agents' preferences over links to vary with the
presence or absence of links elsewhere in the network (and hence with the link
formation behavior of their peers). In the null model which excludes the
network benefit function, links form independently across dyads in the manner
described by \cite{Charbonneau_EJ17}. Under the alternative there is
interdependence across linking decisions (i.e., strategic interaction). We show
how to test the null with power optimized in specific directions. These
alternative directions include many common models of strategic network
formation (e.g., ""connections"" models, ""structural hole"" models etc.). Our
random utility specification induces an exponential family structure under the
null which we exploit to construct a similar test which exactly controls size

endpoint, there is a statistically significant excess of observed events over
the expected background. We estimate that in the region 88 MeV/c < p < 95 MeV/c
there are 13 events with an expected background of about 1-1.5 event, which has
not been discussed by the authors. Those 13 events form a bump with a width
consistent with the experimental resolution, making one think of a $\mu^-

bump is about 1 MeV/c, or $\sim\ 4\sigma_p$, lower than the expected $\mu^- Au
\rightarrow e^+ Ir $ signal, which strongly discourages the exotic
interpretation. The excess, however, could be due to an exclusive dipole
radiative muon capture (RMC) transition $^{197}Au(GS) ~\rightarrow~
^{197}Pt(GS)$ with the branching fraction of about $2\cdot 10^{-4}$. Such a
transition would not be resolved by the existing RMC measurements. We conclude
that the exclusive RMC transitions could significantly modify the positron
spectrum near the kinematic endpoint, to fully exploit the physics potential of
the upcoming experiments such as Mu2e and COMET, a better theoretical
understanding of the RMC spectrum on nuclei is needed. A high-resolution
measurement of the RMC photon spectra has to be carried out. Without that, the
sensitivity of the searches for $\mu^- \rightarrow e^+$ and $\mu^- \rightarrow

the exclusive low-lying states of the daughter nuclei.

AVD is used to compare ground truth images with segmentation results allowing
their ranking. We identified, however, a ranking bias of AVD making it less
suitable for segmentation ranking. To mitigate this bias, we present a modified
calculation of AVD that we have coined balanced AVD (bAVD). To simulate
segmentations for ranking, we manually created non-overlapping segmentation
errors common in cerebral vessel segmentation as our use-case. Adding the
created errors consecutively and randomly to the ground truth, we created sets
of simulated segmentations with increasing number of errors. Each set of
simulated segmentations was ranked using AVD and bAVD. We calculated the
Kendall-rank-correlation-coefficient between the segmentation ranking and the
number of errors in each simulated segmentation. The rankings produced by bAVD
had a significantly higher average correlation (0.969) than those of AVD
(0.847). In 200 total rankings, bAVD misranked 52 and AVD misranked 179
segmentations. Our proposed evaluation measure, bAVD, alleviates AVDs ranking
bias making it more suitable for rankings and quality assessment of

Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is
challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are

are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal
analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an
adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual

the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate
user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes
an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal
exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal

two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements

recognition approaches less effective than in urban or man-made environments.
This paper presents a method to solve the loop closure problem using only
spatial information. The key idea is to use a novel continuous and
probabilistic representations of terrain elevation maps. Given 3D point clouds
of the environment, the proposed approach exploits Gaussian Process (GP)
regression with linear operators to generate continuous gradient maps of the
terrain elevation information. Traditional image registration techniques are
then used to search for potential matches. Loop closures are verified by
leveraging both the spatial characteristic of the elevation maps (SE(2)
registration) and the probabilistic nature of the GP representation. A
submap-based localization and mapping framework is used to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed approach. The performance of this pipeline is
evaluated and benchmarked using real data from a rover that is equipped with a
stereo camera and navigates in challenging, unstructured planetary-like
environments in Morocco and on Mt. Etna.

studying $2$-connected graphs with diameter two, and give two upper bounds of

learning-based semantic landmark localization, including in facial landmark
localization and human pose estimation. Though heatmap regression is robust to
large variations in pose, illumination, and occlusion in unconstrained
settings, it usually suffers from a sub-pixel localization problem.
Specifically, considering that the activation point indices in heatmaps are
always integers, quantization error thus appears when using heatmaps as the
representation of numerical coordinates. Previous methods to overcome the
sub-pixel localization problem usually rely on high-resolution heatmaps. As a
result, there is always a trade-off between achieving localization accuracy and
computational cost, where the computational complexity of heatmap regression
depends on the heatmap resolution in a quadratic manner. In this paper, we
formally analyze the quantization error of vanilla heatmap regression and
propose a simple yet effective quantization system to address the sub-pixel
localization problem. The proposed quantization system induced by the
randomized rounding operation 1) encodes the fractional part of numerical
coordinates into the ground truth heatmap using a probabilistic approach during
training; and 2) decodes the predicted numerical coordinates from a set of
activation points during testing. We prove that the proposed quantization
system for heatmap regression is unbiased and lossless. Experimental results on
popular facial landmark localization datasets (WFLW, 300W, COFW, and AFLW) and
human pose estimation datasets (MPII and COCO) demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method for efficient and accurate semantic landmark localization.

duration of $T_{90}=10\pm4$ ms and a temperature of $kT=8.4\pm0.7$ keV. The
2--8 keV pulse shows a broad, single peak profile with a pulse fraction
increasing with time from 30% to 43%. The NICER observations reveal strong
timing noise with $\dot{\nu}$ varying erratically by a factor of 10, with an
average long-term spin-down rate of
$\dot{\nu}=(-2.48\pm0.03)\times10^{-11}$~s$^{-2}$, implying an equatorial
surface magnetic field of $2.5\times10^{14}$ G and a young characteristic age
of $\sim$470 yr. We detect a large spin-up glitch at MJD 58928.56 followed by a
candidate spin-down glitch at MJD 58934.81, with no accompanying flux
enhancements. The persistent soft X-ray spectrum of Swift~J1818.0-1607 can be
modeled as an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of ~1 keV. Its flux decayed
by ~60% while the modeled emitting area decreased by ~30% over the NICER
observing campaign. This decrease, coupled with the increase in the pulse
fraction points to a shrinking hot spot on the neutron star surface. Assuming a
distance of 6.5 kpc, we measure a peak X-ray luminosity of $1.9\times10^{35}$
erg/s, lower than its spin-down luminosity of $7.2\times10^{35}$ erg/s. Its
quiescent thermal luminosity is $\lesssim 1.7\times10^{34}$ erg/s, lower than
those of canonical young magnetars. We conclude that Swift J1818.0-1607 is an
important link between regular magnetars and high magnetic field rotation

for capturing real-world complex networks. Existing research primarily focuses
on global characteristics of these models, e.g., degree distribution. We aim to
shift the focus towards studying the network growth dynamics from the
perspective of individual nodes. In this paper, we study how a metric for node
influence in network growth models behaves over time as the network evolves.
This metric, which we call node visibility, captures the probability of the
node to form new connections. First, we conduct an investigation on three
popular network growth models -- preferential attachment, additive, and
multiplicative fitness models; and primarily look into the ""influential nodes""
or ""leaders"" to understand how their visibility evolves over time.
Subsequently, we consider a generic fitness model and observe that the
multiplicative model strikes a balance between allowing influential nodes to
maintain their visibility, while at the same time making it possible for new
nodes to gain visibility in the network. Finally, we observe that a spatial
growth model with multiplicative fitness can curtail the global reach of
influential nodes, thereby allowing the emergence of a multiplicity of ""local
leaders"" in the network.

neuro-fuzzy systems for classification problems. However, a disadvantage of
most of the current learning algorithms for GFMM is that they can handle
effectively numerical valued features only. Therefore, this paper provides some
potential approaches to adapting GFMM learning algorithms for classification
problems with mixed-type or only categorical features as they are very common
in practical applications and often carry very useful information. We will
compare and assess three main methods of handling datasets with mixed features,
including the use of encoding methods, the combination of the GFMM model with
other classifiers, and employing the specific learning algorithms for both
types of features. The experimental results showed that the target and
James-Stein are appropriate categorical encoding methods for learning
algorithms of GFMM models, while the combination of GFMM neural networks and
decision trees is a flexible way to enhance the classification performance of
GFMM models on datasets with the mixed features. The learning algorithms with
the mixed-type feature abilities are potential approaches to deal with
mixed-attribute data in a natural way, but they need further improvement to
achieve a better classification accuracy. Based on the analysis, we also
identify the strong and weak points of different methods and propose potential

temporally continuous nature of images within-camera jointly with spatial

reliable samples keep on growing adaptively which in turn boosts representation

is proposed. The fifth dimension is compactified on $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. The
standard model fermions charged under the extra abelian symmetry along with
their superpartners live in the 5D bulk. Bulk masses of fermions are generated
by the vacuum expectation value of $N=2$ superpartner of $U(1)_F$ gauge field,
and they are proportional to $U(1)_F$ charges of respective fermions. This
decides localization of fermions in the extra dimension, which in turn gives
rise to exponentially suppressed Yukawa couplings in the effective 4D theory.
Anomaly cancellation puts stringent constraints on the allowed $U(1)_F$ charges
which leads to correlations between the masses of quarks and leptons. We
perform an extensive numerical scan and obtain several solutions for
anomaly-free $U(1)_F$, which describe the observed pattern of fermion masses
and mixing with all the fundamental parameters of order unity. It is found that
the possible existence of SM singlet neutrinos substantially improves the
spectrum of solutions by offering more freedom in choosing $U(1)_F$ charges.

both the quark and lepton sectors with the couplings which can be explicitly
determined from the Yukawa couplings.

formulated as a system of partial integro-differential equations that describe
the phenotypic evolution of cancer cells in response to dynamic variations in
the spatial distribution of three abiotic factors that are key players in
tumour metabolism: oxygen, glucose and lactate. The results of numerical
simulations of a calibrated version of the model based on real data
recapitulate the eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics of tumour cells and their
adaptation to hypoxic and acidic microenvironments. Moreover, such results
demonstrate how nonlinear interactions between tumour cells and abiotic factors

with phenotypic characteristics that vary with distance from intra-tumour blood
vessels, thus promoting the emergence of intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity.
Finally, our theoretical findings reconcile the conclusions of earlier studies

considered an on-demand approach for tailoring electronic band dispersions and
even inducing topological phase transitions. For probing such dressed bands,
photoemission spectroscopy is an ideal tool, and we employ here a novel
experiment based on ultrafast photoemission momentum microscopy. Using this
setup, we measure the in-plane momentum-dependent intensity fingerprints of the
electromagnetically-dressed sidebands from a Au(111) surface for s- and
p-polarized infrared driving. We find that at metal surfaces, due to screening
of the driving laser, the contribution from Floquet-Bloch bands is negligible,
and the dressed bands are dominated by the laser-assisted photoelectric effect.
Also, we find that in contrast to general expectations, s-polarized light can
dress free-electron states at large photoelectron momenta. Our results show
that the dielectric response of the material must carefully be taken into
account when using photoemission for the identification of light-engineered
electronic band structures.

to directly obtain the symmetric pressure tensor which includes the effect of

least-squares estimation to extract the fingerprint, and does binary hypothesis

transmitter sends a common message to multiple single-antenna users, aided by
an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) equipped with $N$ passive reflecting
elements. Prior works on IRS have mostly assumed the availability of channel
state information (CSI) for designing its passive beamforming. However, the
acquisition of CSI requires substantial training overhead that increases with
$N$. In contrast, we propose in this letter a novel \emph{random passive
beamforming} scheme, where the IRS performs independent random reflection for
$Q\geq 1$ times in each channel coherence interval without the need of CSI
acquisition. For the proposed scheme, we first derive a closed-form
approximation of the outage probability, based on which the optimal $Q$ with
best outage performance can be efficiently obtained. Then, for the purpose of
comparison, we derive a lower bound of the outage probability with traditional
CSI-based passive beamforming. Numerical results show that a small $Q$ is
preferred in the high-outage regime (or with high rate target) and the optimal
$Q$ becomes larger as the outage probability decreases (or as the rate target
decreases). Moreover, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the
CSI-based passive beamforming scheme with training overhead taken into
consideration when $N$ and/or the number of users are large, thus offering a
promising CSI-free alternative to existing CSI-based schemes.

standpoint. The mainstay of the present approach is to treat quantities defined
on the co-tangent bundles of reference and deformed configurations as primal.
Such a treatment invites compatibility equations so that the base space
(configurations of the solid body) could be realised as a subset of an
Euclidean space. Cartan's method of moving frames and the associated structure
equations establish this compatibility. Moreover, they permit us to write the
metric and connection using 1-forms. With the mathematical machinery provided
by differentiable manifolds, we rewrite the deformation gradient and
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The
geometric understanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely
within our overall program. We also show that for a hyperelastic solid, an
equation similar to the Doyle-Erciksen formula may be written for the co-vector
part of the stress 2-form. Using this kinetic and kinematic understanding, we
rewrite the HW functional in terms of frames and differential forms. Finally,
we show that the compatibility of deformation, constitutive rules and equations
of equilibrium are obtainable as Euler-Lagrange equations of the HW functional
when varied with respect to traction 1-forms, deformation 1-forms and the
deformation. This new perspective that involves the notion of kinematic closure
precisely explicates the necessary geometrical restrictions on the variational
principle, without which the deformed body may not be realized as a subset of
the Euclidean space. It also provides a pointer to how these restrictions could
be adjusted within a non-Euclidean setting.

at redshifts ranging from $0.3$ to $2$. The shape-tidal field alignment
increases with galaxy mass and the linear alignment coefficient $A_{\rm IA}$,
defined with respect to the primordial tidal field, is found to have weak
redshift dependence. We also show a promising detection of the shape/spin-tidal
field alignments for stellar mass limited samples and a weak or almost null
signal for star-forming galaxies for the TNG300 volume, $\sim 0.01~(h^{-1}{\rm
Gpc})^3$. We further study the morphology and environmental dependence of the
intrinsic alignment power spectra. The shape of massive disk- and
spheroid-galaxies tend to align with the tidal field. The spin of low mass
disks (and spheroids at low redshifts) tend to be parallel with the tidal
field, while the spin of massive spheroids and disks tend to be perpendicular
to tidal field. The shape and spin of massive centrals align with the tidal
field at both small and large scales. Satellites show a radial alignment within
the one-halo term region, and low mass satellites have an intriguing alignment
signal in the two-halo term region. We also forecast a feasibility to measure
the intrinsic alignment power spectrum for spectroscopic and imaging surveys
such as Subaru HSC/PFS and DESI. Our results thus suggest that galaxy intrinsic
alignment can be used as a promising tool for constraining the galaxy formation
models.

both important open issues in theoretical physics, and the holographic duality
between quantum field theory and gravity theory nicely brings these two topics
together. Nevertheless, direct connections between gravity physics and
experimental observations in quantum matter are still rare. Here we utilize the
gravity physics picture to understand quench dynamics experimentally observed
in a class of random spin models realized in several different quantum systems,
where the dynamics of magnetization are measured after the external
polarization field is suddenly turned off. Two universal features of the
magnetization dynamics, namely, a slow decay described by a stretched
exponential function and an oscillatory behavior, are respectively found in
different parameter regimes across different systems. This work addresses the
issues of generic conditions under which these two universal features can
occur, and we find that a natural answer to this question emerges in the
gravity picture. By the holographic duality bridged by a model proposed by
Maldacena and Qi, the quench dynamics after suddenly turning off the external
polarization field is mapped to disconnecting an eternal traversable wormhole.
Our studies show that insight from gravity physics can help unifying different
experiments in quantum systems.

with edge devices, such as mobile phones, drones, robots and wearables. To run
DNN inference directly on edge devices (a.k.a. edge inference) with a
satisfactory performance, optimizing the DNN design (e.g., network architecture
and quantization policy) is crucial. While state-of-the-art DNN designs have
leveraged performance predictors to speed up the optimization process, they are
device-specific (i.e., each predictor for only one target device) and hence
cannot scale well in the presence of extremely diverse edge devices. Moreover,
even with performance predictors, the optimizer (e.g., search-based
optimization) can still be time-consuming when optimizing DNNs for many
different devices. In this work, we propose two approaches to scaling up DNN
optimization. In the first approach, we reuse the performance predictors built
on a proxy device, and leverage the performance monotonicity to scale up the
DNN optimization without re-building performance predictors for each different
device. In the second approach, we build scalable performance predictors that
can estimate the resulting performance (e.g., inference
accuracy/latency/energy) given a DNN-device pair, and use a neural
network-based automated optimizer that takes both device features and
optimization parameters as input and then directly outputs the optimal DNN
design without going through a lengthy optimization process for each individual
device.

phase transition and pion superfluidity phase transition, have been
investigated in the framework of soft-wall AdS/QCD. In chiral limit, it is
proved both numerically and analytically that pions are massless Goldstone
bosons even at finite temperature, which was usually considered as an
assumption in soft-wall models. Above $T_c$, at which chiral condensate
$\langle \bar{q}q\rangle$ vanishes, the spectra of pions and scalar mesons
merge together, showing the evidence of the restored chiral symmetry in
hadronic spectrum level. Extending to finite quark mass, pion masses increase
with quark mass. Further, it is more interesting to observe that the pole
masses of pions decrease with temperature below $T_c$, which agrees with the
analysis in Phys.Rev.Lett.88(2002)202302. Meanwhile, symmetry restoration above
$T_c$ could be seen in the spectra of scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons. With
finite temperature and isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$, it is shown that the
masses of charged pions would split. The mass of positive charged pion $\pi^+$
decreases almost linearly to zero when $\mu_I$ grows to $\mu_{I}^c$, where pion
condensation starts to form. This reveals the Goldstone nature of $\pi^+$ after
pion superfluidity transition, which are closely related to the experimental
observation.

importance for industrial flow problems, where unstructured grids are typically
employed due to the necessity to handle complex geometries. Here, a systematic
simulation-based study is presented, investigating the effect of grid-cell type
on the predictive accuracy of wall-modelled LES in the framework of a
general-purpose finite-volume solver. Following standard practice for meshing
near-wall regions, it is proposed to use prismatic cells. Three candidate

turbulent boundary layer. A grid construction strategy is employed, which
adapts the grid metric to the outer length scale of the boundary layer. The
results are compared with DNS data concerning mean wall shear stress and
profiles of flow statistics. The principle outcome is that unstructured
simulations may provide the same accuracy as simulations on structured
orthogonal hexahedral grids. The choice of base shape of the near-wall cells
has a significant impact on the computational cost, but in terms of accuracy
appears to be a factor of secondary importance.

defines learning problems with Neural Networks in the context of the principle

defining Neural Networks, that is different from the majority of existing
approaches. In particular, the structure of the neural architecture is defined
by means of a special class of constraints that are extended also to the
interaction with data, leading to ""architectural"" and ""input-related""
constraints, respectively. The proposed theory is cast into the time domain, in
which data are presented to the network in an ordered manner, that makes this
study an important step toward alternative ways of processing continuous
streams of data with Neural Networks. The connection with the classic
Backpropagation-based update rule of the weights of networks is discussed,
showing that there are conditions under which our approach degenerates to
Backpropagation. Moreover, the theory is experimentally evaluated on a simple
problem that allows us to deeply study several aspects of the theory itself and
to show the soundness of the model.

demonstrated its capability when combined with linear classification models in
some specific applications, its expressive power from the theoretical

password checking, face recognition or fingerprint scanning, are susceptible to
various kinds of attacks. In order to prevent some of the possible attacks,
these explicit authentication systems can be enhanced by considering a
two-factor authentication scheme, in which the second factor is an implicit
authentication system based on analyzing motion sensor data captured by
accelerometers or gyroscopes. In order to avoid any additional burdens to the
user, the registration process of the implicit authentication system must be
performed quickly, i.e. the number of data samples collected from the user is
typically small. In the context of designing a machine learning model for
implicit user authentication based on motion signals, data augmentation can
play an important role. In this paper, we study several data augmentation
techniques in the quest of finding useful augmentation methods for motion
sensor data. We propose a set of four research questions related to data
augmentation in the context of few-shot user identification based on motion
sensor signals. We conduct experiments on a benchmark data set, using two deep
learning architectures, convolutional neural networks and Long Short-Term
Memory networks, showing which and when data augmentation methods bring
accuracy improvements. Interestingly, we find that data augmentation is not
very helpful, most likely because the signal patterns useful to discriminate
users are too sensitive to the transformations brought by certain data
augmentation techniques. This result is somewhat contradictory to the common
belief that data augmentation is expected to increase the accuracy of machine
learning models.

classes by transferring knowledge from semantic descriptions to visual

problem, which mainly adopts GANs or VAEs to generate visual features for
unseen classes. However, GANs often suffer from instability, and VAEs can only
optimize the lower bound on the log-likelihood of observed data. To overcome
the above limitations, we resort to generative flows, a family of generative
models with the advantage of accurate likelihood estimation. More specifically,
we propose a conditional version of generative flows for GZSL, i.e.,
VAE-Conditioned Generative Flow (VAE-cFlow). By using VAE, the semantic
descriptions are firstly encoded into tractable latent distributions,
conditioned on that the generative flow optimizes the exact log-likelihood of
the observed visual features. We ensure the conditional latent distribution to
be both semantic meaningful and inter-class discriminative by i) adopting the
VAE reconstruction objective, ii) releasing the zero-mean constraint in VAE
posterior regularization, and iii) adding a classification regularization on
the latent variables. Our method achieves state-of-the-art GZSL results on five

Electron Content (TEC) maps are being used to investigate the state of the

mostly have low spatial and temporal resolution and the techniques used for
generating these maps are generally not accessible.
  TEC maps can also be generated from GNSS/GPS based Continuously Operating

receiver networks are not dense enough to form a map directly. Therefore, an
algorithm should be used to estimate the TEC values at coordinates without a

using the asymptotic deformed oscillator basis for the single particle

shells is achieved by a change of the number of quanta in the z-direction by
one unit for the intruder parity orbitals. The same definition suffices within
the cartesian basis of the Elliott SU(3) model. Through a mapping of the
cartesian Elliott basis onto the spherical shell model basis, we translate the
proxy-SU(3) approximation into spherical coordinates, proving, that in the
spherical shell model basis the proxy-SU(3) approximation corresponds to the
replacement of the intruder parity orbitals by their de Shalit--Goldhaber
partners. Furthermore it is shown, that the proxy-SU(3) approximation in the
cartesian Elliott basis is equivalent to a unitary transformation in the
z-coordinate, leaving the x-y plane intact, a result which in the asymptotic
deformed oscillator coordinates implies, that the z-projections of angular

justification of the proxy-SU(3) approximation and in addition paves the way,
for taking advantage of the proxy-SU(3) symmetry in shell model calculations.

O.B.Zaslavskii shows this particle can not move in a asymptotic region in this

impossible. However, recently, Mandar Patil and Tomohiro Harada show this
particle can enter event horizon, turns back and emerges through white hole
event horizon into asymptotic region in other universe. This means super
Penrose process for extremal Kerr white hole is possible. During this progress,
they assume this high energy particle's trajectory is geodesic in Kerr
background. However, according to rainbow gravity, an unbounded energy particle
will change the spacetime background and observe different effective space-time
geometries. Furthermore, this particle's angular momentum is slightly less than
the max value which particle can enter black hole. Therefore, when one
considers rainbow gravity, this particle with unbounded energy may not enter
black hole. In this paper, we will consider rainbow gravity's effect. We will
show for some rainbow functions, there is a critical energy. If particle's
energy is greater than it, particle will not enter black hole and turn back. It
means super Penrose process for extremal Kerr white hole becomes impossible in
some rainbow gravity. Because of this high energy particle turning back, the
super Penrose process for extremal Kerr black hole becomes possible. Therefore,
we see the possibility of super Penrose process for Kerr black hole or white
hole depends on rainbow gravity.

complexity of determining whether pedestrians intrude the AoI, which makes
previous algorithms incapable of this task. In this paper, we propose a novel

PIDNet is mainly designed by considering two factors: accurately segmenting the

quickly detecting pedestrians from the generated AoI-contained areas. Three

the computational complexity: 1) a special PID task backbone for feature

the ledger's efficiency, which is increased by wallet agents transacting in a

transactions uniformly across the available shards. Since there is no central

design the system such that it is in agents' interest to act in a way that

hyperspectral image classification over the past few years. However, the
success of deep learning is attributed greatly to numerous labeled samples. It
is still very challenging to use only a few labeled samples to train deep
learning models to reach a high classification accuracy. An active
deep-learning framework trained by an end-to-end manner is, therefore, proposed
by this paper in order to minimize the hyperspectral image classification
costs. First, a deep densely connected convolutional network is considered for
hyperspectral image classification. Different from the traditional active
learning methods, an additional network is added to the designed deep densely
connected convolutional network to predict the loss of input samples. Then, the
additional network could be used to suggest unlabeled samples that the deep
densely connected convolutional network is more likely to produce a wrong

deep densely connected convolutional network as input. Therefore, the proposed
method is an end-to-end framework. Subsequently, a few of the selected samples
are labelled manually and added to the training samples. The deep densely
connected convolutional network is therefore trained using the new training
set. Finally, the steps above are repeated to train the whole framework
iteratively. Extensive experiments illustrates that the method proposed could
reach a high accuracy in classification after selecting just a few samples.

physical theories? Philosophers frequently use epistemic logic to model
reasoning and knowledge abstractly, and to formally study the ramifications of
epistemic assumptions. One famous example is Fitch's paradox, which begins with
minimal knowledge axioms and derives the counter-intuitive result that ""every
agent knows every true statement."" Accounting for knowledge that arises from
physical theories complicates matters further. For example, quantum mechanics
allows observers to model other agents as quantum systems themselves, and to
make predictions about measurements performed on each others' memories.
Moreover, complex thought experiments in which agents' memories are modelled as
quantum systems show that multi-agent reasoning chains can yield paradoxical
results.
  Here, we bridge the gap between quantum paradoxes and foundational problems
in epistemic logic, by relating the assumptions behind the recent
Frauchiger-Renner quantum thought experiment and the axioms for knowledge used
in Fitch's knowability paradox. Our results indicate that agents' knowledge of
quantum systems must violate at least one of the following assumptions: it
cannot be distributive over conjunction, have a kind of internal continuity,
and yield a constructive interpretation all at once. Indeed, knowledge provided
by quantum mechanics apparently contradicts traditional notions of how
knowledge behaves; for instance, it may not be possible to universally assign
objective truth values to claims about agent knowledge. We discuss the
relations of this work to results in quantum contextuality and explore possible
modifications to standard epistemic logic that could make it consistent with
quantum theory.

motivated torus-like flux rope structure that expands self-similarly within the

environment, and carries along an embedded analytical magnetic field. The
improved 3DCORE implementation allows us to generate extremely large ensemble
simulations which we then use to find global best-fit model parameters using an
ABC sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm. The usage of this algorithm, under
some basic assumptions on the uncertainty of the magnetic field measurements,
allows us to furthermore generate estimates on the uncertainty of model

strings produce cosmic string loops of all sizes with a given power-law.
Precise estimations of the power-law exponent are still matter of debate while
numerical simulations do not incorporate all the radiation and back-reaction
effects expected to affect the network at small scales. Previously it has been
shown, using a Boltzmann approach, that depending on the steepness of the loop
production function and the gravitational back-reaction scale, a so-called
Extra Population of Small Loops (EPSL) can be generated in the loop number
density. We propose a framework to study the influence of this extra population
of small loops on the Stochastic Background of Gravitational Waves (SBGW). We
show that this extra population can have a significant signature at frequencies
higher than $H_0(\Gamma G\mu)^{-1}$ where $\Gamma$ is of order $50$ and $H_0$
is the Hubble constant. We propose a complete classification of the
gravitational wave power spectra expected from cosmic strings into four
classes, including the model of Blanco-Pillado, Olum and Shlaer and the model
of Lorenz, Ringeval and Sakellariadou. Finally we show that given the
uncertainties on the Polchinski-Rocha exponents, two hybrid classes of
gravitational wave power spectrum can be considered giving very different
predictions for the SBGW.

molecule copy numbers at a given future time $T$ by the sample average over $n$
sample paths, and the goal is to reduce the variance of this sample-average

reductions by factors in the thousands can be obtained. These factors are much
larger than those observed previously by other authors who tried RQMC methods
for the same examples. Array-RQMC simulates an array of realizations of the
Markov chain and requires a sorting function to reorder these chains according
to their states, after each step. The choice of sorting function is a key
ingredient for the efficiency of the method, although in our experiments,
Array-RQMC was never worse than ordinary Monte Carlo, regardless of the sorting
method. The expected number of reactions of each type per step also has an
impact on the efficiency gain.

constraint using the kernel density estimator. Moreover, we derive necessary
optimality conditions for the stationary and the dynamic case. Throughout the

with a classical Monte Carlo approach to compute the desired probability.

measurements can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-31})\text{ cm}^{2}$ for a constant
DM-nucleon scattering cross section. We show that if the CR energy spectrum
follows a power law of type $\sim E^{-3}$, the derived constraints on the
scattering cross section will be highly insensitive to DM particle mass. This
suggests that ultrahigh-energy CRs (UHECRs) indirectly measured by ground-based
detectors can be used to place constraints on ultralight DM particles, as
$E^{-3}$ is a very good approximation of the UHECR energy spectrum up to energy
$\sim10^{20}\text{ eV}$. Using the recent UHECR flux data, we show that the
current constraints derived from space-based CR measurements can in principle
be extended to ultralight DM particles far below eV scale.

multiscale simulation of post-stenting tissue growth, in which the most costly
submodel is the blood flow simulation. Surrogate modeling for non-intrusive
uncertainty quantification takes the whole model as a black-box and maps
directly from the three uncertain inputs to the quantity of interest, the
neointimal area. The corresponding uncertain estimates matched the results from
quasi-Monte Carlo simulations well. In the semi-intrusive uncertainty
quantification, the most expensive submodel is replaced with a surrogate model.
We developed a surrogate model for the blood flow simulation by using a
convolutional neural network. The semi-intrusive method with the new surrogate
model offered efficient estimates of uncertainty and sensitivity while keeping
relatively high accuracy. It outperformed the result obtained with earlier
surrogate models. It also achieved the estimates comparable to the
non-intrusive method with similar efficiency. Presented results on uncertainty
propagation with non-intrusive and semi-intrusive metamodeling methods allow us
to draw some conclusions on the advantages and limitations of these methods.

superrotating eastward equatorial jet. We develop a predictive theory for the
formation of this jet, proposing a mechanism in which the three-dimensional
stationary waves induced by the day-night forcing gradient produce an
equatorial acceleration. This is balanced in equilibrium by an interaction
between the resulting jet and the vertical motion of the atmosphere. The
three-dimensional structure of the zonal acceleration is vital to this
mechanism.
  We demonstrate this mechanism in a hierarchy of models. We calculate the
three-dimensional stationary waves induced by the forcing on these planets, and
show the vertical structure of the zonal acceleration produced by these waves,
which we use to suggest a mechanism for how the jet forms. GCM simulations are
used to confirm the equilibrium state predicted by this mechanism, where the
acceleration from these waves is balanced by an interaction between the
zonal-mean vertical velocity and the jet. We derive a simple model of this
using the ""Weak Temperature Gradient"" approximation, which gives an estimate of
the jet speed on a terrestrial tidally locked planet.
  We conclude that the proposed mechanism is a good description of the
formation of an equatorial jet on a terrestrial tidally locked planet, and
should be useful for interpreting observations and simulations of these
planets. The mechanism requires assumptions such as a large equatorial Rossby
radius and weak acceleration due to transient waves, and a different mechanism
may produce the equatorial jets on gaseous tidally locked planets.

behaviour of biological systems. Nonetheless, it might be difficult to gather
enough data to precisely capture the behavior of a biological system into a set
of Boolean functions. These issues can be dealt with to some extent using
parametrised Boolean networks (ParBNs), as it allows to leave some update
functions unspecified. In this paper, we attack the control problem for ParBNs
with asynchronous semantics. While there is an extensive work on controlling
BNs without parameters, the problem of control for ParBNs has not been in fact
addressed yet. The goal of control is to ensure the stabilisation of a system
in a given state using as few interventions as possible. There are many ways to
control BN dynamics. Here, we consider the one-step approach in which the
system is instantaneously perturbed out of its actual state. A naive approach
to handle control of ParBNs is using parameter scan and solve the control
problem for each parameter valuation separately using known techniques for
non-parametrised BNs. This approach is however highly inefficient as the
parameter space of ParBNs grows doubly-exponentially in the worst case. In this
paper, we propose a novel semi-symbolic algorithm for the one-step control
problem of ParBNs, that builds on a symbolic data structures to avoid scanning
individual parameters. We evaluate the performance of our approach on real
biological models.

employed to simulate the flow on an appropriate grid resolution for tip vortex
propagation, at least 32 cells per vortex diameter according to our previous
guidelines. The effect of roughness is modeled by modified wall functions. The
analysis focuses on two types of vortices appearing on marine propellers: tip
vortices developing in lower advance ratio numbers and leading-edge tip

origin and formation of these two types of vortices differ, different roughness
patterns are needed to mitigate them with respect to performance degradation of
propeller performance. Our findings clarify that the combination of having
roughness on the blade tip and a limited area on the leading edge is the
optimum roughness pattern where a reasonable balance between tip vortex

we empirically examine the structural balance theory which predicts that a
signed network evolves toward a more ""balanced"" structure where in many
triangular relationships (i.e., triads) two states tend to share a common enemy
or three states cooperate with each other. We investigate the network of
alliances (positive edges) and rivalries (negative edges) between sovereign

the structural balance theory. We find the consistency with the structural
balance theory drastically changes over time. The empirical pattern follows the
prediction by the theory before the German unification in the nineteenth
century and after World War II while inconsistent in the middle period. This
result reveals the impact of the two historical events on the underlying
mechanism of network evolution. Moreover, the contrast with previous studies of

indicates that international alliance and rivalry networks can be a promising
material to study novel mechanisms behind the time evolution of signed

activities in different locations through check-ins. These check-in locations
signify user preferences for various socio-spatial activities and can be used
to build their profiles to improve the quality of services in some applications
such as recommendation systems, advertising, and group formation. To support
such applications, in this paper, we formulate a new problem of identifying
top-k Socio-Spatial co-engaged Location Selection (SSLS) for users in a social
graph, that selects the best set of k locations from a large number of location
candidates relating to the user and her friends. The selected locations should
be (i) spatially and socially relevant to the user and her friends, and (ii)
diversified in both spatially and socially to maximize the coverage of friends
in the spatial space. This problem has been proved as NP-hard. To address the
challenging problem, we first develop a branch-and-bound based Exact solution
by designing some pruning strategies based on the derived bounds on diversity.
To make the solution scalable for large datasets, we also develop an
approximate solution by deriving the relaxed bounds and advanced termination
rules to filter out insignificant intermediate results. To further accelerate
the efficiency, we present one fast exact approach and a meta-heuristic
approximate approach by avoiding the repeated computation of diversity at the
running time. Finally, we have performed extensive experiments to evaluate the
performance of our proposed models and algorithms against the adapted existing
methods using four real-world large datasets.

calculate the ground state binding energies of the fragments. It is well known
that the surface and symmetry energy of the hot fragments at the low density
freeze out can be considerably modified. In addition to this, the level density
parameter also has a wide variation. The effect of variation of these
parameters is studied on fragmentation observables which are related to the
nuclear liquid gas phase transition. The canonical thermodynamical model which
has been very successful in describing the phenomenon of fragmentation is used
for the study. The shift in transition temperature owing to the variation in

the signal with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CEOAE signals within limited measurement time by
optimal shrinkage (OS) in two different settings: the covariance-based OS (cOS)
and the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OS (sOS). By simulation and
analyzing human CEOAE data, the cOS consistently reduced the noise and enhanced
the SNR by 1 to 2 dB from a baseline method (BM) that is based on calculating
the median. The sOS achieved an SNR enhancement of 2 to 3 dB in simulation, and
demonstrated capability to enhance the SNR in real recordings when the SNR
achieved by the BM was below 0 dB. An appealing property of OS is that it
produces an estimate of every individual column of the signal matrix. This
property makes it possible to investigate CEOAE dynamics across a longer period
of time when the cochlear conditions are not strictly stationary.

$n^{-2/3}\ll t \ll 1$. This regime is harder than the $t=1$ case, because on

$t\ll 1$ is ""small"", while on the other hand, the edge statistics of $Y_t$ is

semi-major axis due to the Yarkovsky effect. The amount of drift is modulated
by the asteroid spin state evolution which determines the balance between the
diurnal and seasonal Yarkovsky force. The asteroid's spin state is, in turn,
controlled in part by the YORP effect. The otherwise smooth evolution of an
asteroid can be abruptly altered by collisions, which can cause impulsive
changes in the spin state and can move the asteroid onto a different YORP
track. In addition, collisions may also alter the YORP parameters by changing
the superficial features and overall shape of the asteroid. Thus, the coupling
between YORP and Yarkovsky is also strongly affected by the impact history of
each body. To investigate this coupling we developed a statistical code
modeling the time evolution of semi--major axis under YORP-Yarkovsky coupling.
It includes the contributions of NYORP (normal YORP), TYORP (tangential YORP)
and collisions whose effects are deterministically calculated and not added in
a statistical way. We find that both collisions and TYORP increase the
dispersion of a family in semi-major axis by making the spin axis evolution
less smooth and regular. We show that the evolution of a family's structure
with time is complex and collisions randomize the YORP evolution. In our test
families we do not observe the formation of a 'YORP-eye' in the semi-major axis
vs. diameter distribution, even after a long period of time. If present, the
'YORP-eye' might be a relic of an initial ejection velocity pattern of the

what are the challenges of syndromic surveillance systems and how continuous
Artificial Prediction Market [Jahedpari et al., 2017] can effectively be
applied to the problem of syndromic surveillance.
  We use two well-known models of (i) Google Flu Trends, and (ii) the latest
improvement of Google Flu Trends model, named as GP [Lampos et al., 2015], as
our case study and we show how c-APM can improve upon their performance. Our
results demonstrate that c-APM typically has a lower MAE to that of Google Flu
Trends in each year. Though this difference is relatively small in some years
like 2004 and 2007, it is relatively large in most years and very large between
2011 and 2013.

privacy of their training set. We focus on membership inference attacks on
machine learning models which aim to determine whether a data point was used to
train the victim model. Our work consists of two sides: We introduce sampling
attack, a novel membership inference technique that unlike other standard
membership adversaries is able to work under severe restriction of no access to
scores of the victim model. We show that a victim model that only publishes the
labels is still susceptible to sampling attacks and the adversary can recover
up to 100% of its performance compared to when posterior vectors are provided.
The other sides of our work includes experimental results on two recent
membership inference attack models and the defenses against them. For defense,
we choose differential privacy in the form of gradient perturbation during the
training of the victim model as well as output perturbation at prediction time.
We carry out our experiments on a wide range of datasets which allows us to
better analyze the interaction between adversaries, defense mechanism and
datasets. We find out that our proposed fast and easy-to-implement output
perturbation technique offers good privacy protection for membership inference
attacks at little impact on utility.

for postoperative prostate patients with varying extents to which rectum dose
sparing was prioritized over target coverage. Examination on a test set of

well both spatially and in terms of their dose-volume histograms. A special

time-varying aerodynamic forces, such systems do not display fixed points of
equilibrium. The problem is therefore approached via a limit cycle analysis
based on Floquet theory. Stability is assessed from the eigenvalues of the
Jacobian matrix associated to the limit cycle, also known as the Floquet
multipliers. We developed this framework to analyze the flapping flight
equations of motion of a bird in the longitudinal plane. Such a system is known
to be not only non-linear and time-dependent, but also driven by
state-dependent forcing aerodynamic forces. A model accounting for wing
morphing under prescribed kinematics is developed for generating realistic
state-dependent aerodynamic forces. The morphing wing geometry results from the
envelope of continuously articulated rigid bodies, modeling bones and feather
rachises, and capturing biologically relevant degrees of freedom. A sensitivity
analysis is carried out which allows studying several flight configurations in
trimmed state. Our numerical results show that in such a system one instability
mode is ubiquitous, thus suggesting the importance of sensory feedback to
achieve steady-state flapping flight in birds. The effect of wingbeat
amplitude, governed by the shoulder joint, is found to be crucial in tuning the
gait towards level flight, but marginally affects stability. In contrast, the
relative position between the wing and the center of mass is found to
significantly affect the values of Floquet multipliers, suggesting that the
distribution of pitching moment plays a very important role in flapping flight
stability.

relationships between health risk factors and outcomes from observational
studies. Due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
and abundant fully accessible GWASs summary statistics, a variety of two-sample
MR methods for summary data have been developed to either detect or account for
horizontal pleiotropy, primarily based on the assumption that the effects of
variants on exposure ({\gamma}) and horizontal pleiotropy ({\alpha}) are
independent. This assumption is too strict and can be easily violated because
of the correlated horizontal pleiotropy (CHP). To account for this CHP, we
propose a Bayesian approach, MR-Corr2, that uses the orthogonal projection to
reparameterize the bivariate normal distribution for {\gamma} and {\alpha}, and
a spike-slab prior to mitigate the impact of CHP. We develop an efficient
algorithm with paralleled Gibbs sampling. To demonstrate the advantages of
MR-Corr2 over existing methods, we conducted comprehensive simulation studies
to compare for both type-I error control and point estimates in various
scenarios. By applying MR-Corr2 to study the relationships between pairs in two
sets of complex traits, we did not identify the contradictory causal
relationship between HDL-c and CAD. Moreover, the results provide a new
perspective of the causal network among complex traits. The developed R package

unclear for three decades. Previous accounts assigned a replicative advantage
to the deletions, but there is evidence that cells can, instead, selectively
remove defective mtDNA. We present a spatial model that, without a replicative
advantage, but instead through a combination of enhanced density for mutants
and noise, produces a wave of expanding mutations with wave speed consistent
with experimental data, unlike a standard model based on replicative advantage.
We provide a formula that predicts that the wave speed drops with copy number,
in agreement with experimental data. Crucially, our model yields travelling
waves of mutants even if mutants are preferentially eliminated. Justified by
this exemplar of how noise, density and spatial structure affect muscle ageing,
we introduce the mechanism of stochastic survival of the densest, an

observations using magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of high-mass collapsing
molecular cores, including deuteration chemistry. We studied different
evolutionary times and source distances (from 1 to 7 kpc) to estimate the
information loss when comparing the column densities inferred from the
synthetic observations to the column densities in the model. We mimicked
single-dish observations considering an APEX-like beam and interferometric
observations using CASA and assuming the most compact configuration for the
ALMA antennas. We found that, for centrally concentrated density distributions,
the column densities are underestimated by about 51% in the case of
high-resolution ALMA observations ($\leqslant$1"") and up to 90% for APEX
observations (17""). Interferometers retrieve values closer to the real ones,
however, their finite spatial sampling results in the loss of contribution from
large-scale structures due to the lack of short baselines. We conclude that,
the emission of o-H$_2$D$^+$ in distant massive dense cores is faint and would
require from $\sim$1 to $\sim$7 hours of observation at distances of 1 and 7
kpc, respectively, to achieve a 14$\sigma$ detection in the best case scenario.
Additionally, the column densities derived from such observations will
certainly be affected by beam dilution in the case of single-dishes and spatial

rise to integrable mappings. To obtain the double-row monodromy matrix, we use
the notion of boundary matrix and discrete boundary zero curvature condition,
themselves related to the boundary consistency condition, which complements the

an integrability criterion for boundary equations. This relation is made

that every total function of type $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is computable,
i.e. definable in a model of computation. $\mathsf{CT}$ is inconsistent in both
classical mathematics and in Brouwer's intuitionism since it contradicts Weak
K\""onig's Lemma and the fan theorem, respectively. Recently, $\mathsf{CT}$ was
proved consistent for (univalent) constructive type theory.
  Since neither Weak K\""onig's Lemma nor the fan theorem are a consequence of
just logical axioms or just choice-like axioms assumed in constructive logic,
it seems likely that $\mathsf{CT}$ is inconsistent only with a combination of
classical logic and choice axioms. We study consequences of $\mathsf{CT}$ and
its relation to several classes of axioms in Coq's type theory, a constructive
type theory with a universe of propositions which does neither prove classical
logical axioms nor strong choice axioms.
  We thereby provide a partial answer to the question which axioms may preserve
computational intuitions inherent to type theory, and which certainly do not.
The paper can also be read as a broad survey of axioms in type theory, with all
results mechanised in the Coq proof assistant.

recovers this invariance property for the discrete solution, by mapping
discretely divergence-free test functions to exactly divergence-free functions
in the sense of $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{div})$. Moreover, the Stokes
solution has locally singular behavior in three-dimensional domains near
concave edges, which degrades the convergence rates on quasi-uniform meshes and
makes anisotropic mesh grading reasonable in order to regain optimal
convergence characteristics. Finite element error estimates of optimal order on

for the pressure-robust modified Crouzeix--Raviart method using the

use in our subsequent modelling of word recognition. In a context-free
scenario, word recognition often occurs via anticipation when, part-way into a
word, we can correctly guess its full form. We give a quantitative estimate of
this anticipation threshold when no mishearings occur, in terms of model
parameters. As might be expected, the whole anticipation effect disappears when
there are sufficiently many mishearings. Our global approach to the problem of
speech perception is in the spirit of an optimisation problem. We show for
instance that speech perception is easy when the word length is less than a
threshold, to be identified with a static transition, and hard otherwise. We
extend this to the dynamics of word recognition, proposing an intuitive
approach highlighting the distinction between individual, isolated mishearings
and clusters of contiguous mishearings. At least in some parameter range, a
dynamical transition is manifest well before the static transition is reached,
as is the case for many other examples of complex systems.

provides line characteristic catalogs and integrated line-intensity maps of the
sources. HCO+(2-1) is detected in 20 and HCN(2-1) in 8 of the 29 pointings

field derived from the stellar population. The HCN emission is less extended

denser lines of sight. The dense gas luminosities correlate with the star

  Methods: The coupling is based on a thermal analogy of the neural electrical

includes a real-time coupling, modulated threshold for spiking activation and
independent alteration of the electrical properties for each 3-layer fibre

  Results: Results of the coupled electro-mechanical model are validated with
previously published experimental results of damaged axons. Here, the cases of
compression and tension are simulated to induce (mild, moderate and severe)

non-oscillatory (WENO) method combined with the modified ghost fluid method
(MGFM) [28] to simulate the compressible two-medium flow problems. The MGFM can
turn the two-medium flow problems into two single-medium cases by defining the
ghost fluids status in terms of the predicted the interface status, which makes
the material interface ""invisible"". For the single medium flow case, we adapt
between the linear upwind scheme and the WENO scheme automatically by
identifying the regions of the extreme points for the reconstruction polynomial
as same as the hybrid WENO scheme [50]. Instead of calculating their exact
locations, we only need to know the regions of the extreme points based on the
zero point existence theorem, which is simpler for implementation and saves
computation time. Meanwhile, it still keeps the robustness and has high
efficiency. Extensive numerical results for both one and two dimensional
two-medium flow problems are performed to demonstrate the good performances of
the proposed method.

each other for decades. Recently, hyperspectral-depth (HS-D) imaging emerges to
capture both information simultaneously by combining two different imaging
systems; one for depth, the other for spectrum. While being accurate, this
combinational approach induces increased form factor, cost, capture time, and
alignment/registration problems. In this work, departing from the combinational
principle, we propose a compact single-shot monocular HS-D imaging method. Our
method uses a diffractive optical element (DOE), the point spread function of
which changes with respect to both depth and spectrum. This enables us to
reconstruct spectrum and depth from a single captured image. To this end, we
develop a differentiable simulator and a neural-network-based reconstruction
that are jointly optimized via automatic differentiation. To facilitate
learning the DOE, we present a first HS-D dataset by building a benchtop HS-D
imager that acquires high-quality ground truth. We evaluate our method with
synthetic and real experiments by building an experimental prototype and
achieve state-of-the-art HS-D imaging results.

pencils $\lambda B-A$, in which both $A$ and $B$ are complex matrices (square

the row and column norms of the pencil. We see that the problem of scaling a
matrix pencil is equivalent to the problem of scaling the row and column sums
of a particular nonnegative matrix. However, it is known that there exist
square and nonsquare nonnegative matrices that can not be scaled arbitrarily.
To address this issue, we consider an approximate embedded problem, in which
the corresponding nonnegative matrix is square and can always be scaled. The
new scaling methods are then based on the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for scaling
a square nonnegative matrix with total support to be doubly stochastic or on a
variant of it. In addition, using results of U. G. Rothblum and H. Schneider
(1989), we give simple sufficient conditions on the zero pattern for the
existence of diagonal scalings of square nonnegative matrices to have any
prescribed common vector for the row and column sums. We illustrate numerically
that the new scaling techniques for pencils improve the accuracy of the
computation of their eigenvalues.

\`a la Cvitani\'c, Possama\""i, and Touzi [27], while an epidemic is spreading
according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as
proposed respectively by Gray, Greenhalgh, Hu, Mao, and Pan [45] and Tornatore,
Buccellato, and Vetro [88]. More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the
population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing
interactions between individuals. However, this effort, which cannot be
perfectly monitored by the government, comes at social and monetary cost for
the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the
population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of
a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing
policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the
country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we
demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected
individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the
transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government's optimisation
problem then boils down to solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.
Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population
is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also
adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side,
individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained
by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.

which were interpreted as the transverse wobbling (TW) band but with different
behavior of their wobbling energies as a function of spin. It increases
(decreases) with spin for the positive (negative) parity configuration. The
crucial evidence for the wobbling nature of the bands, dominance of the $E2$
component in the $\Delta I = 1$ transitions between the partner bands, is
provided by the simultaneous measurements of directional correlation from the
oriented states (DCO) ratio and the linear polarization of the $\gamma$ rays.
Particle rotor model calculations with triaxial deformation reproduce the
experimental data well. A value of spin, $I_m$, has been determined for the
observed TW bands below which the wobbling energy increases and above which it
decreases with spin. The nucleus $^{183}$Au is, so far, the only nucleus in
which both the increasing and the decreasing parts are observed and thus gives
the experimental evidence of the complete transverse wobbling phenomenon.

around ions, molecules, and interfaces. This induced water polarization
consequently influences multiple phenomena. In particular, water polarization
modulated by nanoconfinement affects ion adsorption and transport, biomolecular
self-assembly, and surface chemical reactions. Therefore, it is of paramount
importance to understand how water-mediated interactions change at the
nanoscale. Here we show that near the graphene surface anion-cation
interactions do not obey the translational and isotropic symmetries of
Coulomb's law. We identify a new property, referred to as non-reciprocity,
which describes the non-equivalent and directional interaction between two
oppositely charged ions near the confining surface when their positions with
respect to the interface are exchanged. Specifically, upon exchange of the two
ions' positions along the surface normal direction the interaction energy
changes by about 5$k_BT$. In both cases, confinement enhances the attraction
between two oppositely charged ions near the graphene surface, while
intercalation of one ion into the graphene layers shifts the interaction to
repulsive. While the water permittivity in confinement is different from that
in bulk, the effects observed here via molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray
reflectivity experiments cannot be accounted for by current permittivity
models. Our work shows that the water structure is not enough to infer
electrostatic interactions near interfaces.

allows them to adapt, to rearrange, and to explore their surroundings. The
biophysical characterization of such motile processes, in health and disease,
has so far focused mostly on two limiting cases: single-cell motility on the
one hand, and the dynamics of confluent tissues such as the epithelium on the
other. The in-between regime of clusters, composed of relatively few cells,
moving as a coherent unit has received less attention. Such small clusters are,
however, deeply relevant in development but also in cancer metastasis. In this
work, we use cellular Potts models and analytical active matter theory to
understand how the motility of small cell clusters changes with N, the number
of cells in the cluster. Modeling and theory reveal our two main findings:
Cluster persistence time increases with N while the intrinsic diffusivity
decreases with N. We discuss a number of settings in which the motile
properties of more complex clusters can be analytically understood, revealing
that the focusing effects of small-scale cooperation and cell-cell alignment
can overcome the increased bulkiness and internal disorder of multicellular
clusters to enhance overall migrational efficacy. We demonstrate this
enhancement for small-cluster collective durotaxis, which is shown to proceed
more effectively than for single cells. Our results may provide some novel
insights into the connection between single-cell and large-scale collective
motion and may point the way to the biophysical origins of the enhanced
metastatic potential of small tumor cell clusters.

robustness of gaze-estimation results against perturbations, such as outdoor

digitized reflect the population of published books? An affirmative answer
would allow book and literary historians to use holdings of major digital
libraries as proxies for the population of published works, sparing them the
labor of collecting a representative sample. We address this question by taking
advantage of exhaustive bibliographies of novels published for the first time
in the British Isles in 1836 and 1838, identifying which of these novels have
at least one digital surrogate in the Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Google
Books, and the British Library. We find that digital surrogate availability is
not random. Certain kinds of novels, notably novels written by men and novels
published in multivolume format, have digital surrogates available at
distinctly higher rates than other kinds of novels. As the processes leading to
this outcome are unlikely to be isolated to the novel and the late 1830s, these
findings suggest that similar patterns will likely be observed during adjacent
decades and in other genres of publishing (e.g., non-fiction).

within the Standard Model of particle physics, in particular in the Higgs
sector. While the first part focuses on phenomenological results, the second
part reviews some of the techniques which allowed the rapid progress in the
field of precision calculations. The focus is on analytic and semi-numerical
techniques for multi-loop amplitudes, however fully numerical methods as well
as subtraction schemes for infrared divergent real radiation beyond NLO are
also briefly described.

by transferring knowledge from labeled source domain with domain shift. Most of
the existing UDA methods try to mitigate the adverse impact induced by the
shift via reducing domain discrepancy. However, such approaches easily suffer a
notorious mode collapse issue due to the lack of labels in target domain.
Naturally, one of the effective ways to mitigate this issue is to reliably
estimate the pseudo labels for target domain, which itself is hard. To overcome
this, we propose a novel UDA method named Progressive Adaptation of Subspaces
approach (PAS) in which we utilize such an intuition that appears much
reasonable to gradually obtain reliable pseudo labels. Speci fically, we
progressively and steadily refine the shared subspaces as bridge of knowledge
transfer by adaptively anchoring/selecting and leveraging those target samples
with reliable pseudo labels. Subsequently, the refined subspaces can in turn
provide more reliable pseudo-labels of the target domain, making the mode
collapse highly mitigated. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates that PAS is not
only effective for common UDA, but also outperforms the state-of-the arts for
more challenging Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) situation, where the source
label set subsumes the target one.

elaborate on the sequence of steps in the pipeline to perform the evaluation,

importance of the transverse formation length (TFL) by investigating nonlinear
Compton scattering by an electron initially counterpropagating with respect to

wavelength, where any laser field can be assumed to be approximately uniform,
related quantum interference effects have been ignored. However, we show
analytically that if the focus in a flying focus beam with $n_L\gg 1$ cycles
moves at the speed of light and backwards with respect to the beam propagation
direction, the effects of the TFL undergo a large enhancement proportional to
$n_L$ and may substantially alter the differential emission probability for

In this study, we propose a heterogeneous network model which allows greater
flexibility for embedding additional non-linearity at the core of the data

Operational Neural Networks (ONN), which enables a flexible non-linear and

by the Hebbian theory, called the Synaptic Plasticity Monitoring (SPM) which
can make data-driven choices for non-linearities in any architecture. An
extensive set of comparative evaluations of ONNs and CNNs over two severe image
denoising problems yield conclusive evidence that ONNs enriched by non-linear
operators can achieve a superior denoising performance against CNNs with both
equivalent and well-known deep configurations.

use only deflators, with no arguments involving equivalent martingale measures,
so do not require the stronger condition of No Free Lunch with Vanishing Risk
(NFLVR). Our formalism also works without alteration for the finite horizon
version of the problem. As well as extending work of Bouchard and Pham to any
horizon and to a weaker no-arbitrage setting, we obtain a stronger duality
statement, because we do not assume by definition that the dual domain is the
polar set of the primal space. Instead, we adopt a method akin to that used for
inter-temporal consumption problems, developing a supermartingale property of
the deflated wealth and its path that yields an infinite horizon budget
constraint and serves to define the correct dual variables. The structure of
our dual space allows us to show that it is convex, without forcing this
property by assumption. We proceed to enlarge the primal and dual domains to
confer solidity to them, and use supermartingale convergence results which
exploit Fatou convergence, to establish that the enlarged dual domain is the
bipolar of the original dual space. The resulting duality theorem shows that
all the classical tenets of convex duality hold. Moreover, at the optimum, the
deflated wealth process is a potential converging to zero. We work out
examples, including a case with a stock whose market price of risk is a
three-dimensional Bessel process, so satisfying NUPBR but not NFLVR.

regions. Cellular systems arising from a variety of physical and biological
processes have been observed to closely follow scaling laws relating their

Most of these approaches have a strong prior assumption that all the input
frames are blurry whereas in a real-world setting, the quality of frames
varies. Moreover, such approaches are trained to perform either of the two
tasks - deblurring or interpolation - in isolation, while many practical
situations call for both. Different from these works, we address a more
realistic problem of high frame-rate sharp video synthesis with no prior
assumption that input is always blurry. We introduce a novel architecture,
Adaptive Latent Attention Network (ALANET), which synthesizes sharp high
frame-rate videos with no prior knowledge of input frames being blurry or not,
thereby performing the task of both deblurring and interpolation. We
hypothesize that information from the latent representation of the consecutive
frames can be utilized to generate optimized representations for both frame
deblurring and frame interpolation. Specifically, we employ combination of
self-attention and cross-attention module between consecutive frames in the
latent space to generate optimized representation for each frame. The optimized
representation learnt using these attention modules help the model to generate
and interpolate sharp frames. Extensive experiments on standard datasets
demonstrate that our method performs favorably against various state-of-the-art
approaches, even though we tackle a much more difficult problem.

suggests that this critical case could share many features with 2+1 general

order in derivatives. To deepen on this relationship, we study the
asymptotically flat solutions of the effective action. We take the general
definition of asymptotic flatness from 2+1 general relativity, where an
asymptotically flat region with a nonfixed conical angle is approached. We show
that a class of regular asymptotically flat solutions are totally flat. The
class is characterized by having nonnegative energy (when the coupling constant
of the Ricci scalar is positive). We present a detailed canonical analysis on
the effective action showing that the dynamics of the theory forbids local
degrees of freedom. Another similarity with 2+1 general relativity is the
absence of a Newtonian force. In contrast to these results, we find evidence
against the similarity with 2+1 general relativity: we find an exact nonflat
solution of the same effective theory. This solution is out of the set of
asymptotically flat solutions.

deformation, which can be seen as a mixture of compression, tension and shear.
Moreover, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) occurs in animals and humans when both
the strains and strain rates exceed 10% and 10/s, respectively. Knowing the
mechanical properties of brain tissue in shear at these strains and strain
rates is thus of particular importance, as they can be used in finite element
simulations to predict the occurrence of brain injuries under different impact

simple shear tests on porcine brain tissue at strain rates < 120/s. The maximum
measured shear stress at strain rates of 30, 60, 90 and 120/s was 1.15 +/- 0.25
kPa, 1.34 +/- 0.19 kPa, 2.19 +/- 0.225 kPa and 2.52 +/- 0.27 kPa, (mean +/-

experimental, theoretical (Ogden and MooneyRivlin models) and numerical shear
stresses was achieved (p = 0.7866 - 0.9935). Specimen thickness effects (2.0 -
10.0 mm thick specimens) were also analyzed numerically and we found that there
is no significant difference (p = 0.9954) in the shear stress magnitudes,
indicating a homogeneous deformation of the specimens during simple shear
tests. Stress relaxation tests in simple shear were also conducted at different

considers the case where c = cr + ici is complex with an imaginary part ci
often used to represent losses in wave behavior. The methods for c real
modified to complex arithmetic work reasonably well as long as ci is very
small. This paper describes the substantial changes necessary to obtain useful
results for larger values of ci. It shows that accurate eigenvalues can usually
be obtained even though the matrix methods used to obtain them for c real
provide increasingly inaccurate values, primarily for those with relatively
small magnitude, as ci increases. It also shows that some of the eigenvalues
can be prolate-like with values that are well approximated using asymptotic
estimates for prolate eigenvalues where c is replaced with -ic. A method to
order the eigenvalues is presented. The modifications necessary to compute
accurately the radial and angular functions for complex c are discussed. A
resulting Fortran program coblfcn provides useful function values for a
reasonably wide range of c, the order m, and the radial coordinate when using
double precision arithmetic. The results can be improved by using quadruple
precision for the Bouwkamp procedure to ensure accurate double precision
eigenvalues. Further improvement is obtained using full quadruple precision.

herd immunity, taking into account the heterogeneity in infectiousness and
susceptibility, as well as the correlation between those two parameters. We
show that these cause the effective reproduction number to decrease more
rapidly, and consequently have a drastic effect on the estimate of the
necessary percentage of the population that has to contract the disease for
herd immunity to be reached. We quantify the difference between the size of the
infected population when the effective reproduction number decreases below 1
vs. the ultimate fraction of population that had contracted the disease. This
sheds light on an important distinction between herd immunity and the end of
the disease and highlights the importance of limiting the spread of the disease
even if we plan to naturally reach herd immunity. We analyze the effect of
various lock-down scenarios on the resulting final fraction of infected
population. We discuss implications to COVID-19 and other pandemics and compare
our theoretical results to population-based simulations. We consider the
dependence of the disease spread on the architecture of the infectiousness

resulted in the emergence of the Fog computing paradigm, which allows
seamlessly harnessing both mobile-edge and cloud resources. Efficient
scheduling of application tasks in such environments is challenging due to
constrained resource capabilities, mobility factors in IoT, resource
heterogeneity, network hierarchy, and stochastic behaviors. xisting heuristics
and Reinforcement Learning based approaches lack generalizability and quick
adaptability, thus failing to tackle this problem optimally. They are also
unable to utilize the temporal workload patterns and are suitable only for
centralized setups. However, Asynchronous-Advantage-Actor-Critic (A3C) learning
is known to quickly adapt to dynamic scenarios with less data and Residual
Recurrent Neural Network (R2N2) to quickly update model parameters. Thus, we
propose an A3C based real-time scheduler for stochastic Edge-Cloud environments
allowing decentralized learning, concurrently across multiple agents. We use
the R2N2 architecture to capture a large number of host and task parameters
together with temporal patterns to provide efficient scheduling decisions. The
proposed model is adaptive and able to tune different hyper-parameters based on
the application requirements. We explicate our choice of hyper-parameters
through sensitivity analysis. The experiments conducted on real-world data set
show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time,
Service-Level-Agreement and running cost by 14.4%, 7.74%, 31.9%, and 4.64%,
respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

possible to apply efficient hybrid simulation models using different meshes for
flow and acoustics, which leads to a powerful computational procedure. Our
study applies the hybrid workflow to the computationally efficient perturbed
convective wave equation with only one scalar unknown, the acoustic velocity
potential. The workflow of this aeroacoustic approach is based on three steps:
1. perform unsteady incompressible flow computations on a sub-domain; 2.
compute the acoustic sources; 3. simulate the acoustic field using a mesh
specifically suited for computational aeroacoustics. In general, hybrid
aeroacoustic methods seek for robust and conservative mesh-to-mesh
transformation of the aeroacoustic sources while high computational efficiency
is ensured. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of a cell-centroid based
conservative interpolation scheme compared to the more accurate cut-volume cell
approach and their application to the computation of rotating systems, namely
an axial fan. The capability and robustness of the cut-volume cell
interpolation in a hybrid workflow on different meshes are investigated by a

glasses, which was segmented into smaller datasets for each property
investigated. Using the decision tree induction, k-nearest neighbors, and
random forest algorithms, selected from a previous study of six algorithms, we
induced predictive models for glass transition temperature, liquidus
temperature, elastic modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, refractive index,
and Abbe number. Moreover, each model was induced with default and tuned
hyperparameter values. We demonstrate that, apart from the elastic modulus
(which had the smallest training dataset), the induced predictive models for
the other five properties yield a comparable uncertainty to the usual data
spread. However, for glasses with extremely low or high values of these
properties, the prediction uncertainty is significantly higher. Finally, as
expected, glasses containing chemical elements that are poorly represented in
the training set yielded higher prediction errors. The method developed here
calls attention to the success and possible pitfalls of machine learning
algorithms. The analysis of the SHAP values indicated the key elements that
increase or decrease the value of the modeled properties. It also estimated the
maximum possible increase or decrease. Insights gained by this analysis can
help empirical compositional tuning and computer-aided inverse design of glass

specific binding of AFM1 in a solution, the tapered fiber is functionalized
with DNA aptamers followed by validation of the conjugation via FTIR, TGA, and

decision-making process for simulation adequacy in a practical, transparent,
and consistent manner. This paper suggests a framework ""Predictive Capability
Maturity Quantification using Bayesian network (PCMQBN)"" as a quantified
framework for assessing simulation adequacy based on information collected from
validation activities. A case study is prepared for evaluating the adequacy of
a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic simulation in predicting the hydrodynamic
forces onto static structures during an external flooding scenario. Comparing
to the qualitative and implicit adequacy assessment, PCMQBN is able to improve
confidence in the simulation adequacy result and to reduce expected loss in the
risk-informed safety analysis.

  analysis",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Analyzing social networks is challenging. Key features of relational data
require the use of non-standard statistical methods such as developing
system-specific null, or reference, models that randomize one or more
components of the observed data. Here we review a variety of randomization
procedures that generate reference models for social network analysis.
Reference models provide an expectation for hypothesis-testing when analyzing
network data. We outline the key stages in producing an effective reference
model and detail four approaches for generating reference distributions:
permutation, resampling, sampling from a distribution, and generative models.
We highlight when each type of approach would be appropriate and note potential
pitfalls for researchers to avoid. Throughout, we illustrate our points with
examples from a simulated social system. Our aim is to provide social network
researchers with a deeper understanding of analytical approaches to enhance
their confidence when tailoring reference models to specific research
questions.
