of natural language well enough to generate realistic text, it is difficult to
control which regions of the distribution they generate. This is especially
problematic because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain
significant toxicity, hate, bias, and negativity. We propose GeDi as an
efficient method for using smaller LMs as generative discriminators to guide
generation from large LMs to make them safer and more controllable. GeDi guides
generation at each step by computing classification probabilities for all
possible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional
distributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and
another conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find
that GeDi gives stronger controllability than the state of the art method while
also achieving generation speeds more than 30 times faster. Additionally,
training GeDi on only four topics allows us to controllably generate new topics
zero-shot from just a keyword, unlocking a new capability that previous
controllable generation methods do not have. Lastly, we show that GeDi can make
GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) significantly less toxic without sacrificing linguistic
quality, making it by far the most practical existing method for detoxifying
large language models while maintaining a fast generation speed.

for acceleration of a partial integro-differential equation, the
Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator. This is part of the governing equation
in the massively parallel particle-in-cell code, XGC, which is used to study
turbulence in fusion energy devices. The neural network emphasizes
physics-inspired learning, where it is taught to respect physical conservation
constraints of the collision operator by including them in the training loss,
along with the L2 loss. In particular, network architectures used for the
computer vision task of semantic segmentation have been used for training. A
penalization method is used to enforce the ""soft"" constraints of the system and
integrate error in the conservation properties into the loss function. During
training, quantities representing the density, momentum, and energy for all
species of the system is calculated at each configuration vertex, mirroring the
procedure in XGC. This simple training has produced a median relative loss,
across configuration space, on the order of 10E-04, which is low enough if the
error is of random nature, but not if it is of drift nature in timesteps. The
run time for the Picard iterative solver of the operator scales as order n
squared, where n is the number of plasma species. As the XGC1 code begins to
attack problems including a larger number of species, the collision operator
will become expensive computationally, making the neural network solver even
more important, since the training only scales as n. A wide enough range of
collisionality is considered in the training data to ensure the full domain of
collision physics is captured. An advanced technique to decrease the losses
further will be discussed, which will be subject of a subsequent report.
Eventual work will include expansion of the network to include multiple plasma
species.

absorption depends on the local film thickness. Our focus is on modeling film
evolution while the film is molten. The evolution of the film modifies local
heat flow, which in turn may influence the film surface evolution through
thermal variation of the film's material properties. Thermal conductivity of
the substrate plays an important role in determining the heat flow and the
temperature field in the evolving film and in the substrate itself. In order to
reach a tractable formulation, we use asymptotic analysis to develop a novel
thermal model that is accurate, computationally efficient, and that accounts
for the heat flow in both the in-plane and out-of plane directions. We apply
this model to metal films of nanoscale thickness exposed to heating and melting
by laser pulses, a setup commonly used for self and directed assembly of
various metal geometries via dewetting while the films are in the liquid phase.
We find that thermal effects play an important role, and in particular that the
inclusion of temperature dependence in the metal viscosity modifies the time
scale of the evolution significantly. On the other hand, in the considered

that the dynamics of the inner solar wind just outside the Alfv\'en critical
zone, and in the vicinity of the first $\beta=1$ surface, is powered by the
relative velocities of adjacent coronal magnetic flux tubes. We suggest that
large amplitude flow contrasts are magnetically constrained at lower altitude
but shear-driven dynamics are triggered as such constraints are released above
the Alfv\'en critical zone, as suggested by global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations that include self-consistent turbulence transport. We argue that
this dynamical evolution accounts for features observed by {\it Parker Solar
Probe} ({\it PSP}) near initial perihelia, including magnetic ``switchbacks'',
and large transverse velocities that are partially corotational and saturate
near the local Alfv\'en speed. Large-scale magnetic increments are more
longitudinal than latitudinal, a state unlikely to originate in or below the
lower corona. We attribute this to preferentially longitudinal velocity shear
from varying degrees of corotation. Supporting evidence includes comparison
with a high Mach number three-dimensional compressible MHD simulation of
nonlinear shear-driven turbulence, reproducing several observed diagnostics,
including characteristic distributions of fluctuations that are qualitatively
similar to {\it PSP} observations near the first perihelion. The concurrence of
evidence from remote sensing observations, {\it in situ} measurements, and both
global and local simulations supports the idea that the dynamics just above the
Alfv\'en critical zone boost low-frequency plasma turbulence to the level
routinely observed throughout the explored solar system.

queries under local differential privacy. There are three key technical
challenges: capturing the correlations among attributes, avoiding the curse of
dimensionality, and dealing with the large domains of attributes. None of the
existing approaches satisfactorily deals with all three challenges. Overcoming
these three challenges, we first propose an approach called Two-Dimensional
Grids (TDG). Its main idea is to carefully use binning to partition the
two-dimensional (2-D) domains of all attribute pairs into 2-D grids that can
answer all 2-D range queries and then estimate the answer of a higher
dimensional range query from the answers of the associated 2-D range queries.
However, in order to reduce errors due to noises, coarse granularities are
needed for each attribute in 2-D grids, losing fine-grained distribution
information for individual attributes. To correct this deficiency, we further
propose Hybrid-Dimensional Grids (HDG), which also introduces 1-D grids to
capture finer-grained information on distribution of each individual attribute
and combines information from 1-D and 2-D grids to answer range queries. To
make HDG consistently effective, we provide a guideline for properly choosing
granularities of grids based on an analysis of how different sources of errors
are impacted by these choices. Extensive experiments conducted on real and
synthetic datasets show that HDG can give a significant improvement over the
existing approaches.

at O2 sensitivity are exceedingly small for both galaxy and galaxy cluster

$\mathcal{P}$ in total variation distance. Most prior work in distribution
testing studied the constant confidence case (corresponding to $\delta =
\Omega(1)$), and provided sample-optimal testers for a range of properties.
While one can always boost the confidence probability of any such tester by
black-box amplification, this generic boosting method typically leads to
sub-optimal sample bounds.
  Here we study the following broad question: For a given property
$\mathcal{P}$, can we {\em characterize} the sample complexity of testing
$\mathcal{P}$ as a function of all relevant problem parameters, including the
error probability $\delta$? Prior to this work, uniformity testing was the only
statistical task whose sample complexity had been characterized in this
setting. As our main results, we provide the first algorithms for closeness and
independence testing that are sample-optimal, within constant factors, as a
function of all relevant parameters. We also show matching
information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of these problems.
Our techniques naturally extend to give optimal testers for related problems.
To illustrate the generality of our methods, we give optimal algorithms for
testing collections of distributions and testing closeness with unequal sized

privatisation protocol based on Bell tests. This allows the building of
device-independent random number generators which output (near-)perfectly
unbiased and private numbers, even if using an uncharacterised quantum device
potentially built by an adversary. Our generation rates are linear in the
repetition rate of the quantum device and the classical randomness
post-processing has quasi-linear complexity - making it efficient on a standard
personal laptop. The statistical analysis is also tailored for real-world
quantum devices.
  Our protocol is then showcased on several different quantum computers.
Although not purposely built for the task, we show that quantum computers can
run faithful Bell tests by adding minimal assumptions. In this
semi-device-independent manner, our protocol generates (near-)perfectly
unbiased and private random numbers on today's quantum computers.

resolutions of 15 to 5 milli-arcsecond (mas) at 275-950GHz (0.87-0.32mm) with
16km baselines. Calibration at higher-frequencies is challenging as ALMA
sensitivity and quasar density decrease. The Band-to-Band (B2B) technique
observes a detectable quasar at lower frequency that is closer to the target,
compared to one at the target high-frequency. Calibration involves a nearly
constant instrumental phase offset between the frequencies and the conversion
of the temporal phases to the target frequency. The instrumental offsets are
solved with a differential-gain-calibration (DGC) sequence, consisting of
alternating low and high frequency scans of strong quasar. Here we compare B2B
and in-band phase referencing for high-frequencies ($>$289GHz) using 2-15km
baselines and calibrator separation angles between $\sim$0.68 and
$\sim$11.65$^{\circ}$. The analysis shows that: (1) DGC for B2B produces a
coherence loss $<$7% for DGC phase RMS residuals $<$30$^{\circ}$. (2) B2B
images using close calibrators ( $<$1.67$^{\circ}$ ) are superior to in-band
images using distant ones ( $>$2.42$^{\circ}$ ). (3) For more distant
calibrators, B2B is preferred if it provides a calibrator $\sim$2$^{\circ}$
closer than the best in-band calibrator. (4) Decreasing image coherence and
poorer image quality occur with increasing phase calibrator separation angle
because of uncertainties in the antenna positions and sub-optimal phase
referencing. (5) To achieve $>$70% coherence for long-baseline (16 km) band 7

observations of the nearby luminous radio galaxy Cygnus A with the Jansky Very
Large Array. The high surface brightness of this source enables detailed
polarimetric imaging, providing images at $0.75\arcsec$, spanning 2 - 18 GHz,
and at 0.30$\arcsec$ (6 - 18 GHz). The fractional polarization from 2000
independent lines of sight across the lobes decreases strongly with decreasing
frequency, with the eastern lobe depolarizing at higher frequencies than the
western lobe. The depolarization shows considerable structure, varying from
monotonic to strongly oscillatory. The fractional polarization in general
increases with increasing resolution at a given frequency, as expected.
However, there are numerous lines of sight with more complicated behavior. We
have fitted the $0.3\arcsec$ images with a simple model incorporating random,
unresolved fluctuations in the cluster magnetic field to determine the high
resolution, high-frequency properties of the source and the cluster. From these
derived properties, we generate predicted polarization images of the source at
lower frequencies, convolved to 0.75$\arcsec$. These predictions are remarkably
consistent with the observed emission. The observations are consistent with the
lower-frequency depolarization being due to unresolved fluctuations on scales
$\gtrsim$ 300 - 700 pc in the magnetic field and/or electron density superposed
on a partially ordered field component. There is no indication in our data of
the location of the depolarizing screen or the large-scale field, either, or
both of which could be located throughout the cluster, or in a boundary region
between the lobes and the cluster.

equilibrium statistical mechanics in high dimensional systems does not depend
on the details of the dynamics. This point of view is supported by extensive
numerical simulation of the one-dimensional Toda chain, an integrable
non-linear Hamiltonian system where all Lyapunov exponents are zero by
definition. We study the relaxation to equilibrium starting from very atypical
initial conditions and focusing on energy equipartion among Fourier modes, as
done in the original Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou numerical experiment. We find
evidence that in the general case, i.e., not in the perturbative regime where
Toda and Fourier modes are close to each other, there is a fast reaching of
thermal equilibrium in terms of a single temperature. We also find that
equilibrium fluctuations, in particular the behaviour of specific heat as
function of temperature, are in agreement with analytic predictions drawn from
the ordinary Gibbs ensemble, still having no conflict with the established
validity of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble for the Toda model. Our results
suggest thus that even an integrable Hamiltonian system reaches thermalization
on the constant energy hypersurface, provided that the considered observables
do not strongly depend on one or few of the conserved quantities. This suggests
that dynamical chaos is irrelevant for thermalization in the large-$N$ limit,
where any macroscopic observable reads of as a collective variable with respect
to the coordinate which diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The possibility for our
results to be relevant for the problem of thermalization in generic quantum
systems, i.e., non-integrable ones, is commented at the end.

forests are constrained by the limited availability of defenders (i.e.,

poachers or illegal loggers). Defenders must choose how much time to spend in
each region of the protected area, balancing exploration of infrequently
visited regions and exploitation of known hotspots. We formulate the problem as
a stochastic multi-armed bandit, where each action represents a patrol
strategy, enabling us to guarantee the rate of convergence of the patrolling
policy. However, a naive bandit approach would compromise short-term
performance for long-term optimality, resulting in animals poached and forests
destroyed. To speed up performance, we leverage smoothness in the reward
function and decomposability of actions. We show a synergy between
Lipschitz-continuity and decomposition as each aids the convergence of the
other. In doing so, we bridge the gap between combinatorial and Lipschitz
bandits, presenting a no-regret approach that tightens existing guarantees

computing stochastic gradients. A unified analytic approach is developed to
examine the convergence and computational complexity of these methods, allowing
us to compare the different sampling schemes. We show that the independent

difficult due to clutter and occlusions that are produced when rendering all

problem by using focus on specific elements that are then rendered opaque, and
carving away all elements occluding their view. In this work, we make use of
advanced GPU shader functionality to generate a focus+context rendering that
highlights the elements in a selected region and simultaneously conveys the
global mesh structure in the surrounding. To achieve this, we propose a gradual
transition from edge-based focus rendering to volumetric context rendering, by
combining fragment shader-based edge and face rendering with per-pixel fragment
lists. A fragment shader smoothly transitions between wireframe and face-based
rendering, including focus-dependent rendering style and depth-dependent edge
thickness and halos, and per-pixel fragment lists are used to blend fragments
in correct visibility order. To maintain the global mesh structure in the
context regions, we propose a new method to construct a sheet-based
level-of-detail hierarchy and smoothly blend it with volumetric information.
The user guides the exploration process by moving a lens-like hotspot. Since

allocation for 5G radio access network slicing. Available communication
resources (frequency-time blocks and transmit powers) and computational
resources (processor usage) are allocated to stochastic arrivals of network
slice requests. Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput,
computational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible,
it is served with available communication and computational resources allocated
over its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some
of the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that
can optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for
network slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the
network utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing
requests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational
constraints. Results show that reinforcement learning provides major
improvements in the 5G network utility relative to myopic, random, and first
come first served solutions. While reinforcement learning sustains scalable
performance as the number of served users increases, it can also be effectively
used to assign resources to network slices when 5G needs to share the spectrum
with incumbent users that may dynamically occupy some of the frequency-time
blocks.

pair-instability regime and produce a black hole with a mass in the mass gap by
fallback. We present a series of new stellar evolution models at zero and low

compare to existing grids of models. Models with a metallicity in the range
0-0.0004 have three properties which favour higher BH masses as compared to
higher metallicity models. These are (i) lower mass-loss rates during the

conclude that it is possible that GW190521 may be the merger of black holes

to ~15 sigma) from the JCMT and ALMA telescopes have no other plausible
identification. Atmospheric PH3 at ~20 parts-per-billion abundance is inferred.
The presence of phosphine is unexplained after exhaustive study of steady-state
chemistry and photochemical pathways, with no currently-known abiotic
production routes in Venusian atmosphere, clouds, surface and subsurface, or
from lightning, volcanic or meteoritic delivery. Phosphine could originate from
unknown photochemistry or geochemistry, or, by analogy with biological
production of phosphine on Earth, from the presence of life. Other PH3 spectral
features should be sought, while in-situ cloud and surface sampling could
examine sources of this gas.

appealing approach toward ultra-fast non-conventional computing based on

to the network, tuning its individual oscillators, their coupling, and
providing built-in memory units for training purposes, remain substantial
challenges. Here, we address all these challenges using memristive gating of
W/CoFeB/MgO/AlOx based SHNOs. In its high resistance state (HRS), the memristor
modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at the CoFeB/MgO
interface purely by the applied electric field. In its low resistance state
(LRS), and depending on the voltage polarity, the memristor adds/subtracts
current to/from the SHNO drive. The operation in both the HRS and LRS affects
the SHNO auto-oscillation mode and frequency, which can be tuned up to 28
MHz/V. This tuning allows us to reversibly turn on/off mutual synchronization
in chains of four SHNOs. We also demonstrate two individually controlled
memristors to tailor both the coupling strength and the frequency of the
synchronized state. Memristor gating is therefore an efficient approach to
input, tune, and store the state of the SHNO array for any non-conventional
computing paradigm, all in one platform.

lack of the mathematical understanding of the theory stands out in theoretical
physics. In order to address this problem we observe that a recently proposed
general model beyond the Standard Model resolves the energy scales of a lattice
regularized Yang-Mills theory by means of an extra dimension. The extra
dimension ensures that all intermediate length scales of the physical system
are available by definition. In this paper we study the role of the extra
dimension also in the case of the free boson field. We find that if the extra
dimension size is large, the model describes the classical motion of the
system. In the opposite limit we recover its standard quantum mechanical motion
without loss of information. Therefore, the Hilbert space of states in the
presence of the extra dimension describes physical phenomena at all energy
scales. This observation allows us to raise the description of length scales by
an extra dimension at the level of a principle for the theories beyond the
Standard Model, the only modeling constraint being the correspondence
principle. As it was shown recently, the fermion ground state energy of a gauge
invariant Hamilton operator of Dirac fermions gives a particular lattice
regularization of the Yang-Mills theory. Integration of gauge fields gives a
pure fermion theory of color singlet fermion-antifermion pairs at each lattice
site evolving along the extra dimension. Color confinement follows directly
from this property. It allows for a saddle point solution in the limit of a
large number of colors. In this paper we find that the glueball spectrum of the
Yang-Mills regularized theory is of the Hagedron type and bounded below by a
positive value. We show also that the color charge is screened and the
quark-antiquark potential is constant.

information from different views to improve the learning performance. Obtaining
informative view-specific representation plays an essential role in MVAR.
Attention has been widely adopted as an effective strategy for discovering
discriminative cues underlying temporal data. However, most existing MVAR
methods only utilize attention to extract representation for each view
individually, ignoring the potential to dig latent patterns based on
mutual-support information in attention space. To this end, we propose a
collaborative attention mechanism (CAM) for solving the MVAR problem in this
paper. The proposed CAM detects the attention differences among multi-view, and
adaptively integrates frame-level information to benefit each other.
Specifically, we extend the long short-term memory (LSTM) to a Mutual-Aid RNN
(MAR) to achieve the multi-view collaboration process. CAM takes advantages of
view-specific attention pattern to guide another view and discover potential
information which is hard to be explored by itself. It paves a novel way to
leverage attention information and enhances the multi-view representation

diffusion MRI that leverages non-linear redundancy in the data to boost the SNR
while preserving signal information. Methods: We exploit non-linear redundancy
of the dMRI data by means of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), a
non-linear generalization of PCAto reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. By
mapping the signal to a high-dimensional space, better redundancy is achieved
despite nonlinearities in the data thereby enabling better denoising than
linear PCA. We implement KPCA with a Gaussian kernel, with parameters
automatically selected from knowledge of the noise statistics, and validate it
on realistic Monte-Carlo simulations as well as with in-vivo human brain
submillimeter resolution dMRI data. We demonstrate KPCA denoising using
multi-coil dMRI data also. Results: SNR improvements up to 2.7 X were obtained
in real in-vivo datasets denoised with KPCA, in comparison to SNR gains of up
to 1.8 X when using state-of-the-art PCA denoising, e.g., Marchenko- Pastur PCA
(MPPCA). Compared to gold-standard dataset references created from averaged
data, we showed that lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) was
achieved with KPCA compared to MPPCA. Statistical analysis of residuals shows
that only noise is removed. Improvements in the estimation of diffusion model
parameters such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and fiber
orientation distribution functions (fODFs)were demonstrated.
Conclusion:Non-linear redundancy of the dMRI signal can be exploited with KPCA,
which allows superior noise reduction/ SNR improvements than state-of-the-art
PCA methods, without loss of signal information.

community because its accurate understanding requires dealing with consecutive
multi-time quantum measurements. Here, a modeling of the quantum measurement of
the current at THz frequencies is introduced in terms of quantum (Bohmian)
trajectories. With this new understanding, we develop an analytic model for THz
noise as a function of the electron transit time and the sampling integration
time, which finally determine the maximum device working frequency. The model
is confirmed by either semi-classical or full-quantum time-dependent Monte

unlimitedly when the volume of the active region decreases. All attempts to
minimize the low signal-to-noise ratio of these ultra-small devices to get
effective THz working frequencies are incompatible with the basic elements of

i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to

components from spectral data is a signal reconstruction problem and often
associated with detailed physical modeling and substantial computational
effort. We aim to build an effective and self-instructing algorithm detecting
the essential spectral information contained Galactic all-sky data covering
spectral bands from $\gamma$-ray to radio waves. Utilizing principles from
information theory, we develop a state-of-the-art variational autoencoder
specialized on the adaption to Gaussian noise statistics. We first derive a
generic generative process that leads from a low-dimensional set of emission
features to the observed high-dimensional data. We formulate a posterior
distribution of these features using Bayesian methods and approximate this
posterior with variational inference. The algorithm efficiently encodes the
information of 35 Galactic emission data sets in ten latent feature maps. These
contain the essential information required to reconstruct the initial data with
high fidelity and are ranked by the algorithm according to their significance
for data regeneration. The three most significant feature maps encode
astrophysical components: (1) The dense interstellar medium (ISM), (2) the hot

uses a machine-readable representation of knowledge of legal professionals.
This knowledgebase has two components - the formal knowledge of legal norms
represented as a rule-base and the tacit knowledge represented by a document
template. A document assembly system is developed as a proof of concept. It
collects input data in the form of an interactive interview, performs legal
reasoning over input data, and generates the output document. The system also
creates an argument graph as an explanation of the reasoning process providing
the user with an interpretation of how the input data and the rule-base
influence the content of the output document. The system also semantically
marks up data in the output document, facilitating its further processing and
providing support to the interoperability of information systems in the legal
domain.

$2$ as sums over integer partitions. First we consider a formula by N. J. Fine
that allows us to express a binomial coefficient in terms of multinomial
coefficients as a sum over partitions. The second method invokes the central
binomial coefficients and the logarithmic differentiation of their generating
function. Some experimental results suggest the existence of other methods of
decomposing the power of $2$ as sums over partitions.

Conventionally, deep learning approaches take the whole input image and an
associated trimap to infer the alpha matte using convolutional neural networks.
Such approaches set state-of-the-arts in image matting; however, they may fail
in real-world matting applications due to hardware limitations, since
real-world input images for matting are mostly of very high resolution. In this
paper, we propose HDMatt, a first deep learning based image matting approach
for high-resolution inputs. More concretely, HDMatt runs matting in a
patch-based crop-and-stitch manner for high-resolution inputs with a novel
module design to address the contextual dependency and consistency issues
between different patches. Compared with vanilla patch-based inference which
computes each patch independently, we explicitly model the cross-patch
contextual dependency with a newly-proposed Cross-Patch Contextual module (CPC)
guided by the given trimap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method and its necessity for high-resolution inputs. Our HDMatt
approach also sets new state-of-the-art performance on Adobe Image Matting and
AlphaMatting benchmarks and produce impressive visual results on more
real-world high-resolution images.

performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results.
Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain
precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. These ratings could
function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. We conduct an
independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and
on the streets of Belarus. The Viber and the street data samples consist of
almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. Bayesian regressions
with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and
rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various
focus subgroups. We show that both the officially announced results of the
election and early voting rates are highly improbable. With a probability of at
least 95%, Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya's rating lies between 75% and 80%, whereas
Aliaksandr Lukashenka's rating lies between 13% and 18% and early voting rate
predicted by the method ranges from 9% to 13% of those who took part in the
election. These results contradict the officially announced outcomes, which are
10.12%, 80.11%, and 49.54% respectively and lie far outside even the 99.9%
credible intervals predicted by our model. The only marginal groups of people
where the upper bounds of the 99.9% credible intervals of the rating of
Lukashenka are above 50% are people older than 60 and uneducated people. For
all other marginal subgroups, including rural residents, even the upper bounds
of 99.9% credible intervals for Lukashenka are far below 50%. The same is true
for the population as a whole. Thus, with a probability of at least 99.9%
Lukashenka could not have had enough electoral support to win the 2020
presidential election in Belarus.

make up the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 75 using concurrent 2017 Aug 17-20
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, during which the pulsar PSR J1846-0258 is
found to be in the quiescent state. The young remnant hosts a bright pulsar
wind nebula powered by the highly-energetic (Edot = 8.1E36 erg/s) isolated,
rotation-powered pulsar, with a spin-down age of only P/2Pdot ~ 728 yr. Its
inferred magnetic field (Bs = 4.9E13 G) is the largest known for these objects,
and is likely responsible for intervals of flare and burst activity, suggesting
a transition between/to a magnetar state. The pulsed emission from PSR
J1846-0258 is well-characterized in the 2-50 keV range by a power-law model
with photon index Gamma_PSR = 1.24+/-0.09 and a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux of
(2.3+/-0.4)E-12 erg/s/cm^2). We find no evidence for an additional non-thermal
component above 10 keV in the current state, as would be typical for a
magnetar. Compared to the Chandra pulsar spectrum, the intrinsic pulsed
fraction is 71+/-16% in 2-10 keV band. A power-law spectrum for the PWN yields
Gamma_PWN = 2.03+/-0.03 in the 1-55 keV band, with no evidence of curvature in
this range, and a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux (2.13+/-0.02)E-11 erg/s/cm^2. The
NuSTAR data reveal evidence for a hard X-ray component dominating the SNR
spectrum above 10 keV which we attribute to a dust-scattered PWN component. We
model the dynamical and radiative evolution of the Kes 75 system to estimate
the birth properties of the neutron star, the energetics of its progenitor, and
properties of the PWN. This suggests that the progenitor of Kes 75 was
originally in a binary system which transferred most its mass to a companion
before exploding.

there is the need to add an artificial low-density atmosphere. Here we discuss
a new framework in which we can effectively set the density surrounding the
neutron stars to zero to ensure a more accurate simulation. We test our method
with a number of single star test cases and for an equal mass binary neutron
star simulation. While the bulk motion of the system is not influenced, and
hence, there is no improvement with respect to the emitted gravitational-wave
signal, we find that the new approach is superior with respect to mass
conservation and it allows a much better tracking of outward moving material.
This will allow a more accurate simulation of the ejected material and supports
the interpretation of present and future multi-messenger observations with more
accurate numerical relativity simulations.

focus on the relation between the linear density galaxy bias $b_1$ and local
PNG bias $b_\phi$ in an idealized forecast setup with multitracer galaxy power
spectrum and bispectrum data. We consider two parametrizations of galaxy bias:
1) one inspired by the universality relation where $b_\phi = 2\delta_c\left(b_1
- p\right)$ and $p$ is a free parameter; and 2) another in which the product of
bias parameters and $f_{\rm NL}$, like $f_{\rm NL} b_\phi$, is directly fitted
for. The constraints on the $f_{\rm NL}-p$ plane are markedly bimodal, and both
the central value and width of marginalized constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ depend
sensitively on the priors on $p$. Assuming fixed $p=1$ in the constraints with
a fiducial value of $p=0.55$ can bias the inferred $f_{\rm NL}$ by $0.5\sigma$
to $1\sigma$; priors $\Delta p \approx 0.5$ around this fiducial value are
however sufficient in our setup to return unbiased constraints. In power
spectrum analyses, parametrization 2, that makes no assumptions on $b_\phi$,
can distinguish $f_{\rm NL} \neq 0$ with the same significance as
parametrization 1 assuming perfect knowledge of $b_\phi$ (the value of $f_{\rm
NL}$ is however left unknown). A drawback of parametrization 2 is that the
addition of the bispectrum information is not as beneficial as in
parametrization 1. Our results motivate strongly the incorporation of
mitigation strategies for bias uncertainties in PNG constraint analyses, as
well as further theoretical studies on the relations between bias parameters to
better inform those strategies.

TNG100 simulated galaxies at $z=0$, we inspect the relationship between the
masses of SMBHs and the hot gas temperatures and luminosities at various
spatial and halo scales -- from galactic ($\sim R_{\rm e}$) to group/cluster
scales ($\sim R_{\rm 500c}$). We find strong SMBH-X-ray correlations mostly in
quenched galaxies and find that the correlations become stronger and tighter at
larger radii. Critically, the X-ray temperature ($k_{\rm B}T_{\rm X}$) at large
radii ($r\gtrsim5R_{\rm e}$) traces the SMBH mass with a remarkably small
scatter ($\sim0.2$ dex). The relations emerging from IllustrisTNG are broadly
consistent with those obtained from recent X-ray observations. Overall, our
analysis suggests that, within the framework of IllustrisTNG, the present-time
$M_{\rm BH}-k_{\rm B}T_{X}$ correlations at the high-mass end ($M_{\rm

the near UV and optical has challenged conventional TDE emission models. By
idealizing a disk as a nested sequence of elliptical orbits which communicate
adiabatically via pressure forces, and are heated by energy dissipated during
the circularization of the nearly parabolic debris streams, we investigate the

effect of General-Relativistic apsidal precession from the SMBH. We calculate
the properties of uniformly precessing, apsidally aligned, and highly eccentric

late-type dwarf stars depends on host star metallicity. Using the Kepler Data
Release 25 planet candidate list and its completeness data products, we explore
planet occurrence as a function of metallicity in the Kepler field's late-type
dwarf stellar population. We find that planet occurrence increases with
metallicity for all planet radii $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ down to at least
$R_{\mathrm{p}}\approx2~R_{\oplus}$ and that in the range $2~R_{\oplus}\lesssim
R_{\mathrm{p}}\lesssim 5~R_{\oplus}$ planet occurrence scales linearly with
metallicity $Z$. Extrapolating our results, we predict that short-period
planets with $R_{\mathrm{p}}\lesssim 2~R_{\oplus}$ should be rare around early
M dwarf stars with $\mathrm{[M/H]}\lesssim-0.5$ or late M dwarf stars with
$\mathrm{[M/H]}\lesssim+0.0$. This dependence of planet occurrence on
metallicity observed in the Kepler field emphasizes the need to control for
metallicity in estimates of planet occurrence for late-type dwarf stars like
those targeted by Kepler's K2 extension and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). We confirm the theoretical expectation that the small planet
occurrence--host star metallicity relation is stronger for low-mass stars than
for solar-type stars. We establish that the expected solid mass in planets
around late-type dwarfs in the Kepler field is comparable to the total amount
of planet-making solids in their protoplanetary disks. We argue that this high

need for lens and source modeling and develop a neural network to both locate
subhalos in an image as well as determine their mass using the technique of
image segmentation. The network is trained on images with a single subhalo
located near the Einstein ring across a wide range of apparent source
magnitudes. The network is then able to resolve subhalos with masses $m\gtrsim
10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$. Training in this way allows the network to learn the
gravitational lensing of light, and remarkably, it is then able to detect
entire populations of substructure, even for locations further away from the
Einstein ring than those used in training. Over a wide range of the apparent
source magnitude, the false-positive rate is around three false subhalos per
100 images, coming mostly from the lightest detectable subhalo for that
signal-to-noise ratio. With good accuracy and a low false-positive rate,
counting the number of pixels assigned to each subhalo class over multiple

using controlled $N$-body simulations. We consider perturbations by a moving
point mass and by a disc, and vary the duration of the perturbation as well as
the cluster density profile. For fast perturbations (i.e. `shocks'), the
cluster gains energy in agreement with theoretical predictions in the impulsive
limit. For slow disc perturbations, the energy gain is lower, and this has
previously been attributed to adiabatic damping. However, the energy gain due
to slow perturbations by a point-mass is similar to, or larger than that due to
fast shocks, which is not expected because adiabatic damping should be almost
independent of the nature of the tides. We show that the geometric distortion
of the cluster during slow perturbations is of comparable importance for the
energy gain as adiabatic damping, and that the combined effect can
qualitatively explain the results. The half-mass radius of the bound stars
after a shock increases up to $\sim$7\% for low-concentration clusters, and
decreases $\sim$3\% for the most concentrated ones. The fractional mass loss is
a non-linear function of the energy gain, and depends on the nature of the
tides and most strongly on the cluster density profile, making semi-analytic

control the evolution of galaxies. We derive the baryonic specific angular

angular momentum. Using a combination of high-quality HI rotation curves and
HI/near-IR surface densities, we homogeneously measure the stellar ($j_{\rm
*}$) and gas ($j_{\rm gas}$) specific angular momenta for a large sample of
local disc galaxies. This allows us to determine the baryonic specific angular
momentum ($j_{\rm bar}$) with high accuracy and across a very wide range of
masses. The $j_{\ast}-M_\ast$ relation is an unbroken power-law from $7
\lesssim$ log($M_\ast$/$M_\odot) \lesssim 11.5$, with slope $0.54 \pm 0.02$.
For the gas component, we find that the $j_{\rm gas}-M_{\rm gas}$ relation is
also an unbroken power-law from $6 \lesssim$ log($M_{\rm gas}$/$M_\odot)
\lesssim 11$, with a steeper slope of $1.02 \pm 0.04$. Regarding the baryonic
relation, our data support a correlation characterized by single power-law with
slope $0.60 \pm 0.02$. Our most massive spirals and smallest dwarfs lie along
the same $j_{\rm bar}-M_{\rm bar}$ sequence. While the relations are tight and
unbroken, we find internal correlations inside them: At fixed $M_\ast$,
galaxies with larger $j_\ast$ have larger disc scale lengths, and at fixed
$M_{\rm bar}$, gas-poor galaxies have lower $j_{\rm bar}$ than expected. We
estimate the retained fraction of baryonic specific angular momentum, finding
it constant across our entire mass range with a value of $\sim 0.6$, indicating
that the $j_{\rm bar}$ of present-day disc galaxies is comparable to the
initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes. These results
set important constraints for hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytical

simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies with the ""superbubble"" model for
clustered SN feedback, accounting for thermal conduction and cold gas
evaporation. The initial conditions and the galaxy formation physics, other
than SN feedback, are the same as in Shen et al. (2014). The simulated luminous
galaxies have blue colors, low star formation efficiencies and metallicities,
and high cold gas content, reproducing the observed scaling relations of dwarfs
in the Local Volume. Bursty star formation histories and superbubble-driven
outflows lead to the formation of kpc-size DM cores when stellar masses reaches
$M_{*} > 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, similar to previous findings. However, the
superbubble model appears more effective in destroying DM cusps than the
previously adopted ""blastwave"" model, reflecting a higher coupling efficiency
of SN energy with the ISM. On larger scale, superbubble-driven outflows have a
more moderate impact: galaxies have higher gas content, more extended stellar
disks, and a smaller metal-enriched region in the CGM. The two halos with
$M_{vir} \sim 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$, which formed ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in
Shen et al. (2014), remain dark due to the different impact of metal-enriched
galactic winds from two nearby luminous galaxies. The column density
distributions of H I, Si II, C IV and O VI are in agreement with recent
observations of CGM around isolated dwarfs. While H I is ubiquitous with a
covering fraction of unity within the CGM, Si II and C IV are less extended. O
VI is more extended, but its mass is only 11% of the total CGM oxygen budget,
as the diffuse CGM is highly ionised by the UVB. Superbubble feedback produces
C IV and O VI an order of magnitude higher column densities than those with
blastwave feedback. The CGM and DM cores are most sensitive probes of feedback
mechanisms.

star-forming galaxies $0.44\pm0.04$ dex below the local correlation for both
normal star-forming galaxies and local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
(ULIRGs). Both the lack of redshift-evolution and the offset from the local
correlation are likely the result of the different physical conditions in
high-redshift starburst galaxies, compared to local star-forming sources. We
explain the offset through a combination of strong magnetic fields
($B\gtrsim0.2$mG), high interstellar medium (ISM) densities and additional
radio emission generated by secondary cosmic rays. While local ULIRGs are
likely to have similar magnetic field strengths, we find that their
compactness, in combination with a higher ISM density compared to SMGs,
naturally explains why local and high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies
follow a different far-infrared/radio correlation. Overall, our findings paint
SMGs as a homogeneous population of galaxies, as illustrated by their tight and
non-evolving far-infrared/radio correlation.

notoriously complex and difficult to simulate. A new theory, generalized
hydrodynamics (GHD), promises to efficiently accomplish such simulations for
nearly-integrable systems. It predicts the evolution of the distribution of
rapidities, which are the momenta of the quasiparticles in integrable systems.
GHD was recently tested experimentally for weakly interacting atoms, but its
applicability to strongly interacting systems has not been experimentally
established. Here we test GHD with bundles of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases
by performing large trap quenches in both the strong and intermediate coupling
regimes. We measure the evolving distribution of rapidities, and find that
theory and experiment agree well over dozens of trap oscillations, for average
dimensionless coupling strengths that range from 0.3 to 9.3. By also measuring
momentum distributions, we gain experimental access to the interaction energy
and thus to how the quasiparticles themselves evolve. The accuracy of GHD
demonstrated here confirms its wide applicability to the simulation of
nearly-integrable quantum dynamical systems. Future experimental studies are
needed to explore GHD in spin chains, as well as the crossover between GHD and
regular hydrodynamics in the presence of stronger integrability breaking

early (Haardt & Madau 2012) or by redshift z~6 (Puchwein et al. 2019).
Comparing with observations of the large- and small-scale Lyman-alpha

agreement of the models depends on scale, with the self-consistent Puchwein et
al. (2019) IGM photoheating and photoionization model in good agreement with
the flux P(k) at k >~ 0.01 s/km at redshifts 2 <~ z <~ 3.5. On larger scales
the P(k) measurements increase in amplitude from z~4.6 to z~2.2 faster than the
models, and lie in between the model predictions at 2.2 <~ z <~ 4.6 for k~=
0.002-0.01 s/km. We argue the models could improve by changing the HeII
photoheating rate associated with active galactic nuclei to reduce the IGM
temperature at z~3. At higher redshifts z>~4.5 the observed flux P(k) amplitude
increases at a rate intermediate between the models, and we argue that for

Localized ""hot spots"" that form due to scattering enable two types of strongly

retroreflection, despite strong dissipation. This leads to frequency doubling

mass range from $\sim 2-5 M_{\odot}$. The existence of this (first mass) gap
has been used to discriminate between proposed engines behind core-collapse
supernovae. From LIGO/Virgo observations of binary compact remnant masses,
several candidate first mass gap objects (either neutron stars (NSs) or black
holes (BHs)) were identified during the O3 science run. Motivated by these new
observations, we study the formation of BH-NS mergers in the framework of
isolated classical binary evolution, using population synthesis methods to
evolve large populations of binary stars (Population I and II) across cosmic
time. We present results on the NS to BH mass ratios ($q=M_{\rm NS}/M_{\rm
BH}$) in merging systems, showing that although systems with a mass ratio as
low as $q=0.02$ can exist, typically BH-NS systems form with moderate mass
ratios $q=0.1-0.2$. If we adopt a delayed supernova engine, we conclude that
$\sim 30\%$ of BH-NS mergers may host at least one compact object in the first
mass gap (FMG$^\circ$). Even allowing for uncertainties in the processes behind
compact object formation, we expect the fraction of BH-NS systems ejecting mass
during the merger to be small (from $\sim 0.6-9\%$). In our reference model, we
assume: (i) the formation of compact objects within the FMG, (ii) natal NS/BH
kicks decreased by fallback, (iii) low BH spins due to Tayler-Spruit angular
momentum transport in massive stars. We find that $\lesssim 1\%$ of BH-NS
mergers will have any mass ejection and about the same percentage will produce
kilonova bright enough to have a chance of being detected with a large
(Subaru-class) $8$m telescope. Interestingly, all these mergers will have both
a BH and an NS in the FMG.

kpc in diameter) H$\alpha$ blob, Totoro, about 8 kpc away from a pair of

group-group merger. Here, we combine interferometric $^{12}$CO(1--0) molecular
gas data, new wide-field H$\alpha$, $u$-band data, and published X-ray data to
determine the origin of the blob. Several scenarios are discussed to account
for its multi-wavelength properties, including (1) H$\alpha$ gas being stripped
from galaxy Satsuki by ram-pressure; (2) a separated low-surface-brightness
galaxy; (3) gas being ejected or ionized by an active galactic nucleus (AGN);
and (4) a cooling intra-group medium (IGM). Scenarios (1) and (2) are less
favored by the present data. Scenario (3) is also less likely as there is no
evidence for an active ongoing AGN in the host galaxy. We find that the CO
(cold) and H$\alpha$ (warm) gas coexist with X-ray (hot) structures; moreover,
the derived cooling time is within the regime where molecular and H$\alpha$ gas
are expected. The coexistence of gas with different temperatures also agrees
with that of cooling gas in other systems. Our multi-wavelength results
strongly suggest that the CO and H$\alpha$ gas are the product of cooling from
the IGM at its current location, i.e., cooling has occurred, and may be
ongoing, well outside the host-galaxy core.

infinitesimal Markovian divisible qubit channels, no necessary or sufficient
criteria are known for higher dimensions, except for necessity of

  We describe how to extend the notion of infinitesimal Markovian divsibility

general approach towards proving necessary criteria for (infinitesimal)
Markovian divisibility that involve singular values of the linear map. With
this approach, we prove two necessary criteria for infinitesimal divisibility

the determinant in terms of a $\Theta(d)$-power of the smallest singular value,
and in terms of a product of $\Theta(d)$ smallest singular values. Our criteria
allow us to analytically construct, in any given dimension, a set of channels
that contains provably non infinitesimal Markovian divisible ones.
  We also discuss the classical counterpart of this scenario, i.e., stochastic
matrices with the generators given by transition rate matrices. Here, we show
that no necessary criteria for infinitesimal Markovian divisibility of the form

unclear aspects of the problem is the turbulent magnetic field amplification,

than any reachable numerical resolution nowadays. Here we present numerical
simulations of the first ten milliseconds of a binary neutron star merger.
First, we confirm in detail how the simulated amplification depends on the
numerical resolution and is distributed on a broad range of scales, as expected
from turbulent MHD theory. We find that an initial large-scale magnetic field
of $10^{11}\,$G inside each star is amplified in the remnant to
root-mean-square values above $10^{16}\,$G within the first $5$ milliseconds
for our highest-resolution run. Then, we run large eddy simulations, exploring
the performance of the subgrid-scale gradient model, already tested
successfully in previous turbulent box simulations. We show that the addition
of this model is especially important in the induction equation, since it leads
to an amplification of the magnetic field comparable to a higher-resolution
run, but with a greatly reduced computational cost. In the first 10
milliseconds, there is no clear hint for an ordered, large-scale magnetic
field, which should indeed occur in longer timescales through magnetic winding
and the magneto-rotational instability.

properties of the conventional description reappear in leading order of the FMS
expansion. Going beyond leading order, we show that the pole structure of the
elementary and the bound-state propagator coincide to all orders in a
perturbative expansion. However, slight deviations of scattering amplitudes
containing off-shell Higgs contributions can be caused by the internal bound
state structure. We perform a consistent perturbative treatment to all orders
in the FMS expansion to quantify such deviations and demonstrate how
gauge-invariant expressions arrange in a natural way at the one-loop level.
This also provides a gauge-invariant Higgs spectral function which is not
plagued by positivity violations or unphysical thresholds. Furthermore, the
mass extracted from the gauge-invariant bound state is only logarithmically
sensitive to the scale of new physics at one-loop order in contrast to its
elementary counterpart.

by a factor of $\sim$2. Recently, \citet{Khatami2019} presented a new model
relating the peak time ($t_{\rm p}$) and luminosity ($L_{\rm p}$) of a
radioactive-powered SN to its $M_{\rm Ni}$ that addresses several limitations
of Arnett-like models, but depends on a dimensionless parameter, $\beta$. Using
observed $t_{\rm p}$, $L_{\rm p}$, and tail-measured $M_{\rm Ni}$ values for 27
SESN, we observationally calibrate $\beta$ for the first time. Despite scatter,
we demonstrate that the model of \citet{Khatami2019} with
empirically-calibrated $\beta$ values provides significantly improved
measurements of $M_{\rm Ni}$ when only photospheric data is available. However,
these observationally-constrained $\beta$ values are systematically lower than
those inferred from numerical simulations, primarily because the observed
sample has significantly higher (0.2-0.4 dex) $L_{\rm p}$ for a given $M_{\rm
Ni}$. While effects due to composition, mixing, and asymmetry can increase
$L_{\rm p}$ current models cannot explain the systematically low $\beta$
values. However, the discrepancy can be alleviated if $\sim$7--50\% of $L_{\rm
p}$ for the observed sample originates from sources other than $^{56}$Ni.
Either shock cooling or magnetar spin-down could provide the requisite
luminosity. Finally, we find that even with our improved measurements, the
$M_{\rm Ni}$ values of SESN are still a factor of $\sim$3 larger than those of
hydrogen-rich Type II SN, indicating that these supernovae are inherently
different in terms of their progenitor initial mass distributions or explosion
mechanisms.

stronger than those associated with longitudinal vibrations. For site-dependent
interactions transverse phonons form subohmic bath leading to the quantum phase
transition accompanied by full suppression of the transport at zero temperature
and fast decoherence characterized by temperature dependent rate of temperature
to the power of two thirds at low temperature while this rate rate ois
proportional to the squared temperature for site-independent interactions. The
latter dependence was used to interpret recent measurements of temperature
dependent vibrational energy transport in polyethylene glycol oligomers.

Several representation learning algorithms for graph data, such as DeepWalk,
node2vec, and GraphSAGE, sample the graph to produce mini-batches that are
suitable for training a DNN. However, sampling time can be a significant
fraction of training time, and existing systems do not efficiently parallelize
sampling.
  Sampling is an embarrassingly parallel problem and may appear to lend itself
to GPU acceleration, but the irregularity of graphs makes it hard to use GPU
resources effectively. This paper presents NextDoor, a system designed to
effectively perform graph sampling on GPUs. NextDoor employs a new approach to
graph sampling that we call transit-parallelism, which allows load balancing
and caching of edges. NextDoor provides end-users with a high-level abstraction
for writing a variety of graph sampling algorithms. We implement several graph
sampling applications, and show that NextDoor runs them orders of magnitude
faster than existing systems.

corresponding to the above effects can be incorporated into the effective field
theory as a combination of a background (or spurious) $\SO(3)$ gauge field and
a scalar field in the symmetric tensor representation, which are eventually
fixed at their physical values. We use the effective field theory to
investigate mode spectra of inhomogeneous ground states, with focusing on
one-dimensionally inhomogeneous states, such as helical and spiral states.
Although the helical and spiral ground states share a common feature of
supporting the gapless Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the translational
symmetry breaking, they have qualitatively different dispersion relations:
isotropic in the helical phase while anisotropic in the spiral phase. We also
discuss the magnon production induced by an inhomogeneous magnetic field, and
find a formula akin to the Schwinger formula. Our formula for the magnon
production gives a finite rate for antiferromagnets, and a vanishing rate for
ferromagnets, whereas that for ferrimagnets interpolates between the two cases.

stellar parameters using both the EW analysis and the spectral fitting

n-capture elements using the EW measurement approach. We investigate the origin
of the correlation between metallicity and stellar parameters derived with the
EW method for the coolest stars of the sample (Teff < 4300 K). The correlation
is likely due to the challenging continuum setting and to a general inaccuracy
of model atmospheres used to reproduce the conditions of very cool giant stars.
We locate the properties of our clusters in the radial distributions of
metallicity and abundance ratios, comparing our results with clusters from the
Gaia-ESO and APOGEE surveys. We present the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [X/Fe]-Rgc trends
for elements in common between the two surveys and derive the C and Li

abundances for some chemical elements, which are comparable to those obtained
in two of the largest surveys combined. The metallicities and abundance ratios
of our clusters fit very well in the radial distributions defined by the recent
literature, reinforcing the importance of star clusters to outline the spatial
distribution of abundances in our Galaxy. Moreover, the abundances of C and Li
agree with evolutionary prescriptions for their masses and metallicities.

hazard ratio between treatment groups. Afterwards commonly a log-rank test is
performed in order to investigate whether there is a difference in survival,
or, depending on additional covariates, a Cox proportional hazard model is
used. However, in numerous trials these approaches fail due to the presence of
non-proportional hazards, resulting in difficulties of interpreting the hazard
ratio and a loss of power. When considering equivalence or non-inferiority
trials, the commonly performed log-rank based tests are similarly affected by a
violation of this assumption. Here we propose a parametric framework to assess
equivalence or non-inferiority for survival data. We derive pointwise
confidence bands for both, the hazard ratio and the difference of the survival
curves. Further we propose a test procedure addressing non-inferiority and
equivalence by directly comparing the survival functions at certain time points

systematically generate the attack, we adopt an optimization-based approach and
overcome domain-specific design challenges such as camera frame
inter-dependencies due to attack-influenced vehicle control, and the lack of
objective function design for lane detection models.
  We evaluate our attack on a production ALC using 80 scenarios from real-world
driving traces. The results show that our attack is highly effective with over
97.5% success rates and less than 0.903 sec average success time, which is
substantially lower than the average driver reaction time. This attack is also
found (1) robust to various real-world factors such as lighting conditions and
view angles, (2) general to different model designs, and (3) stealthy from the
driver's view. To understand the safety impacts, we conduct experiments using
software-in-the-loop simulation and attack trace injection in a real vehicle.
The results show that our attack can cause a 100% collision rate in different
scenarios, including when tested with common safety features such as automatic
emergency braking. We also evaluate and discuss defenses.

theoretical model is based on perturbative strong-field approximation (SFA),
where the sub-barrier bound-continuum-bound pathway is described in the

Goode Solar Telescope, we jointly analyze vector magnetic fields, continuum

goal of understanding the signatures of small-scale flux emergence, as well as
their atmospheric responses as they emerge through multiple heights in
photosphere and chromosphere. Under such a high resolution of 0.1"" to 0.2"", our
results confirm two kinds of small-scale flux emergence: magnetic flux sheet
emergence associated with the newly forming granules, and the traditional
magnetic flux loop emergence. With direct imaging in the broadband TiO, we
observe that both types of flux emergence are associated with darkening of
granular boundaries, while only flux sheets elongate granules along the
direction of emerging magnetic fields and expand laterally. With a life span of
10--15 minutes, the total emerged vertical flux is in order of 10$^{18}$ Mx for
both types of emergence. The magnitudes of the vertical and horizontal fields
are comparable in the flux sheets, while the former is stronger in flux loops.
H{\alpha} observations reveal transient brightenings in the wings in the events
of magnetic loop emergence, which are most probably the signatures of Ellerman

activation functions for GNNs that not only adapt to the graph into the

coupling into all GNN components, nodal features are nonlinearized and combined
with a set of trainable parameters in a form akin to graph convolutions. The

the class of functions to represent the network data. Whether in the direct or

The projective connection, due to Thomas and later Whitehead, admits a
component that in one dimension is in one-to-one correspondence with the
coadjoint elements of the Virasoro algebra. This component is called the
diffeomorphism field $\mathcal{D}_{ab }$ in the literature. It also has been
shown that in four dimensions, the TW\ action collapses to the Einstein-Hilbert
action with cosmological constant when $\mathcal{D}_{ab}$ is proportional to
the Einstein metric. These previous results have been restricted to either
particular metrics, such as the Polyakov 2D\ metric, or were restricted to
coordinates that were volume preserving. In this paper, we review TW gravity
and derive the gauge invariant TW action that is explicitly projectively
invariant and general coordinate invariant. We derive the covariant field
equations for the TW action and show how fermionic fields couple to the gauge
invariant theory. The independent fields are the metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the
fundamental projective invariant $\Pi^{a}_{\,\,\,bc}$, and the diffeomorphism

approaches. Connectionist models known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs)
can potentially bridge this gap. However, classical VSAs and neural networks
are still considered incompatible. VSAs encode symbols by dense pseudo-random
vectors, where information is distributed throughout the entire neuron
population. Neural networks encode features locally, often forming sparse
vectors of neural activation. Following Rachkovskij (2001); Laiho et al.
(2015), we explore symbolic reasoning with sparse distributed representations.
The core operations in VSAs are dyadic operations between vectors to express
variable binding and the representation of sets. Thus, algebraic manipulations
enable VSAs to represent and process data structures in a vector space of fixed
dimensionality. Using techniques from compressed sensing, we first show that
variable binding between dense vectors in VSAs is mathematically equivalent to
tensor product binding between sparse vectors, an operation which increases
dimensionality. This result implies that dimensionality-preserving binding for
general sparse vectors must include a reduction of the tensor matrix into a
single sparse vector. Two options for sparsity-preserving variable binding are
investigated. One binding method for general sparse vectors extends earlier
proposals to reduce the tensor product into a vector, such as circular
convolution. The other method is only defined for sparse block-codes,
block-wise circular convolution. Our experiments reveal that variable binding
for block-codes has ideal properties, whereas binding for general sparse
vectors also works, but is lossy, similar to previous proposals. We demonstrate
a VSA with sparse block-codes in example applications, cognitive reasoning and
classification, and discuss its relevance for neuroscience and neural networks.

after the Big Bang. A large fraction of GRB lightcurves (LCs) shows X-ray
plateaus. We perform the most comprehensive analysis of all GRBs (with known
and unknown redshifts) with plateau emission observed by The Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory from its launch until August 2019. We fit 455 LCs showing a plateau
and explore whether these LCs follow closure relations, relations between the
temporal and spectral indices of the afterglow, corresponding to 2 distinct
astrophysical environments and cooling regimes within the external forward
shock (ES) model, and find that the ES model works for the majority of cases.
The most favored environments are a constant density interstellar or wind
medium with slow cooling. We also confirm the existence of the fundamental
plane relation between the rest-frame time and luminosity at the end of the
plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity for this enlarged sample, and
test this relation on groups corresponding to the astrophysical environments of
our known redshift sample. The plane becomes a crucial discriminant
corresponding to these environments in terms of the best fitting parameters and
dispersions. Most GRBs for which the closure relations are fulfilled with
respect to astrophysical environments have an intrinsic scatter sigma
compatible within 1 sigma of that of the Gold GRBs, a subset of long GRBs with
relatively flat plateaus. We also find that GRBs satisfying closure relations
indicating a fast cooling regime have a lower sigma than ever previously found
in literature.

  in Internet-of-Things",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergent ecosystems of intelligent edge devices in diverse Internet of
Things (IoT) applications, from automatic surveillance to precision
agriculture, increasingly rely on recording and processing variety of image
data. Due to resource constraints, e.g., energy and communication bandwidth
requirements, these applications require compressing the recorded images before
transmission. For these applications, image compression commonly requires: (1)
maintaining features for coarse-grain pattern recognition instead of the
high-level details for human perception due to machine-to-machine
communications; (2) high compression ratio that leads to improved energy and
transmission efficiency; (3) large dynamic range of compression and an easy
trade-off between compression factor and quality of reconstruction to
accommodate a wide diversity of IoT applications as well as their time-varying
energy/performance needs. To address these requirements, we propose, MAGIC, a
novel machine learning (ML) guided image compression framework that judiciously
sacrifices visual quality to achieve much higher compression when compared to
traditional techniques, while maintaining accuracy for coarse-grained vision
tasks. The central idea is to capture application-specific domain knowledge and
efficiently utilize it in achieving high compression. We demonstrate that the
MAGIC framework is configurable across a wide range of compression/quality and
is capable of compressing beyond the standard quality factor limits of both
JPEG 2000 and WebP. We perform experiments on representative IoT applications
using two vision datasets and show up to 42.65x compression at similar accuracy
with respect to the source. We highlight low variance in compression rate
across images using our technique as compared to JPEG 2000 and WebP.

of the first pair, (258656) 2002~ES$_{76}$ and 2013~CC$_{41}$, in the Jovian

motion estimation/correction steps, causing inferior image quality. To tackle
these issues, we first propose a Siamese adversarial network (SAN) that can
efficiently recover high dose gated image volume from low dose gated image
volume. To ensure the appearance consistency between the recovered gated
volumes, we then utilize a pre-trained motion estimation network incorporated
into SAN that enables the constraint of gate-to-gate (G2G) consistency. With
high-quality recovered gated volumes, gate-to-gate motion vectors can be
simultaneously outputted from the motion estimation network. Comprehensive
evaluations on a low dose gated PET dataset of 29 subjects demonstrate that our

Bayesian full waveform point source inversion of microseismic events. Inferring
the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and
source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the
inference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each
set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference
very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this
process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source
location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a
fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace
the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process.
We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on
Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. We show that all of our
models provide more accurate predictions and $\sim 100$ times faster
predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a
$\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform
generation. For example, a 2-s long synthetic trace can be generated in $\sim
10$ ms on a common laptop processor, instead of $\sim$ 1 hr using a
pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile Graphics Processing Units card. We
also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those
obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The
speed, accuracy and scalability of our open source deep learning models pave
the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and
application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source

all six ""coronal"" AIA channels. We also identify an inverse relationship,

parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time scales, and offer the
opportunity to discover even more extreme examples of unexpected phenomena. We
investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them
within large time-series data sets in order to facilitate the discovery of new
classes of objects, as well as the physical interpretation of their anomalous
nature. We develop a method that combines tree-based and manifold-learning
algorithms for anomaly detection in order to perform two tasks: 1) identify and
rank anomalous objects in a time-domain dataset; and 2) group those anomalies
according to their similarity in order to identify analogs. We achieve the
latter by combining an anomaly score from a tree-based method with a
dimensionality manifold-learning reduction strategy. Clustering in the reduced
space allows for the successful identification of anomalies and analogs. We
also assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and
investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as
anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with Gaia color and luminosity
information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising
strategy to identify novel light curves and light curve families.

superconducting films is a consequence of the disorder-induced enhancement of
Coulomb repulsion. We demonstrate that for the majority of thin films studied
now this effect cannot be completely explained in the assumption of
two-dimensional diffusive nature of electrons motion. The main contribution to
the $T_c$ suppression arises from the correction to the electron-electron
interaction constant coming from small scales of the order of the Fermi
wavelength that leads to the critical temperature shift $\delta T_c/T_{c0} \sim
- 1/k_Fl$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum and $l$ is the mean free path.
Thus almost for all superconducting films that follow the fermionic scenario of
$T_c$ suppression with decreasing the film thickness, this effect is caused by
the proximity to the three-dimensional Anderson localization threshold and is
controlled by the parameter $k_F l$ rather than the sheet resistance of the
film.

dielectric spectrum, the plasmonic dispersion, the static screening and the
optical conductivity. The valley-dependent splitting of the Fermi velocities
due to the kekul\'e distortion leads to a similar splitting in the dielectric
spectrum of graphene, introducing new characteristic frequencies, which are
given in terms of the valley-coupling amplitude. The valley coupling also
splits the plasmonic dispersion, introducing a second branch in the Landau
damping region. Finally, the signatures of the broken valley degeneracy in the
optical conductivity are studied. The characteristic step-like spectrum of
graphene is split into two half steps due to the onset of absorption in each
valley occurring at different characteristic frequencies. Also, it was found an
absorption phenomenon where a resonance peak related to intervalley transport
emerges at a ""beat frequency"", determined by the difference between the
characteristic frequencies of each valley. Some of these mechanisms are
expected to be present in other space-modulated 2D materials and suggest how
optical or electrical response measurements can be suitable to detect spatial

their position encoding leads them to convey data values precisely. Yet
reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased.
Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an
overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an
underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for
these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing
aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar
mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an
overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars
with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of
the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3
confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions
from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across
sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that
might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and
treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases
toward prototypical values.

is uncorrelated with Galactocentric distance, |Z|, age, and metallicity.
However, velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for cluster mass, is positively
correlated with intrinsic scatter at relatively high levels of significance for
[Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe]. We also see a possible positive correlation at a low level
of significance for [Ni/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Fe/H], while [Cr/Fe] and
[Mn/Fe] are uncorrelated. The elements that show a correlation with velocity
dispersion are those that are predominantly produced by core-collapse

$b$-quark induced contribution to the $h\to\gamma\gamma$ decay amplitude based
on soft-collinear effective theory, we derive the first renormalized
factorization theorem for a process described at subleading power in scale
ratios, where $\lambda=m_b/M_h\ll 1$ in our case. We prove two refactorization
conditions for a matching coefficient and an operator matrix element in the
endpoint region, where they exhibit singularities giving rise to divergent
convolution integrals. The refactorization conditions ensure that the
dependence of the decay amplitude on the rapidity regulator, which regularizes
the endpoint singularities, cancels out to all orders of perturbation theory.
We establish the renormalized form of the factorization formula, proving that
extra contributions arising from the fact that ""endpoint regularization"" does
not commute with renormalization can be absorbed, to all orders, by a
redefinition of one of the matching coefficients. We derive the
renormalization-group evolution equation satisfied by all quantities in the
factorization formula and use them to predict the large logarithms of order
$\alpha{\hspace{0.3mm}}\alpha_s^2{\hspace{0.3mm}} L^k$ in the three-loop decay
amplitude, where $L=\ln(-M_h^2/m_b^2)$ and $k=6,5,4,3$. We find perfect
agreement with existing numerical results for the amplitude and analytical
results for the three-loop contributions involving a massless quark loop. On
the other hand, we disagree with the results of previous attempts to predict
the series of subleading logarithms
$\sim\alpha{\hspace{0.3mm}}\alpha_s^n{\hspace{0.3mm}} L^{2n+1}$.

data for predicting their healthcare cost. To achieve this goal, we first used
patients' temporal data in their fine-grain form as opposed to coarse-grain
form. Second, we devised novel spike detection features to extract temporal
patterns that improve the performance of cost prediction. Third, we evaluated
the effectiveness of different types of temporal features based on cost
information, visit information and medical information for the prediction task.
  Materials and methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims
data from 2013 to 2016 from a healthcare insurer, where the first two years
were used to build the model to predict the costs in the third year. To prepare
the data for modeling and prediction, the time series data of cost, visit and
medical information were extracted in the form of fine-grain features (i.e.,
segmenting each time series into a sequence of consecutive windows and
representing each window by various statistics such as sum). Then, temporal
patterns of the time series were extracted and added to fine-grain features
using a novel set of spike detection features (i.e., the fluctuation of data
points). Gradient Boosting was applied on the final set of extracted features.
Moreover, the contribution of each type of data (i.e., cost, visit and medical)
was assessed.
  Conclusions: Leveraging fine-grain temporal patterns for healthcare cost
prediction significantly improves prediction performance. Enhancing fine-grain
features with extraction of temporal cost and visit patterns significantly
improved the performance. However, medical features did not have a significant
effect on prediction performance. Gradient Boosting outperformed all other
prediction models.

spatio-temporal model to analyze the RACH success probability, where both the
preamble transmission outage and the collision events of each CE group jointly
determine the traffic evolution and the RACH success probability. Based on this
analytical model, we derive the analytical expression for the RACH success

  Methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to

to build the model to predict costs in the third year. The data consisted of
the multivariate time series of cost, visit and medical features that were
shaped as images of patients' health status (i.e., matrices with time windows
on one dimension and the medical, visit and cost features on the other
dimension). Patients' multivariate time series images were given to a CNN
method with a proposed architecture. After hyper-parameter tuning, the proposed
architecture consisted of three building blocks of convolution and pooling
layers with an LReLU activation function and a customized kernel size at each
layer for healthcare data. The proposed CNN learned temporal patterns became
inputs to a fully connected layer.
  Conclusions: Feature learning through the proposed CNN configuration
significantly improved individual-level healthcare cost prediction. The
proposed CNN was able to outperform temporal pattern detection methods that
look for a pre-defined set of pattern shapes, since it is capable of extracting
a variable number of patterns with various shapes. Temporal patterns learned
from medical, visit and cost data made significant contributions to the
prediction performance. Hyper-parameter tuning showed that considering
three-month data patterns has the highest prediction accuracy. Our results
showed that patients' images extracted from multivariate time series data are
different from regular images, and hence require unique designs of CNN
architectures.

parameters of a linearly parametrized controller are estimated by solving a
least squares (LS) problem, which in the presence of noise leads to a biased

significantly. With large memory workloads, virtualized environments, data

degrade performance and increase power usage. We therefore explore the

hardware support for address translation. Primarily, we investigate the
implications of removing the abstraction of large contiguous memory segments.
Our experiments show that the overhead to remove this reliance is surprisingly
small for real programs. We expect this small overhead to be worth the benefit

$\beta$-VAE, should be larger than $1$ in order to effectively disentangle
latent factors. We demonstrate that $\beta$-VAE, with $\beta < 1$, can not only
attain good disentanglement but also significantly improve reconstruction
accuracy via dynamic control. The paper removes the inherent trade-off between
reconstruction accuracy and disentanglement for $\beta$-VAE. Existing methods,
such as $\beta$-VAE and FactorVAE, assign a large weight to the KL-divergence
term in the objective function, leading to high reconstruction errors for the
sake of better disentanglement. To mitigate this problem, a ControlVAE has
recently been developed that dynamically tunes the KL-divergence weight in an
attempt to control the trade-off to more a favorable point. However, ControlVAE
fails to eliminate the conflict between the need for a large $\beta$ (for
disentanglement) and the need for a small $\beta$. Instead, we propose
DynamicVAE that maintains a different $\beta$ at different stages of training,
thereby decoupling disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy. In order to
evolve the weight, $\beta$, along a trajectory that enables such decoupling,
DynamicVAE leverages a modified incremental PI (proportional-integral)
controller, and employs a moving average as well as a hybrid annealing method
to evolve the value of KL-divergence smoothly in a tightly controlled fashion.
We theoretically prove the stability of the proposed approach. Evaluation
results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DynamicVAE significantly
improves the reconstruction accuracy while achieving disentanglement comparable
to the best of existing methods. The results verify that our method can
separate disentangled representation learning and reconstruction, removing the
inherent tension between the two.

As ML becomes more ubiquitous, it is often deployed by companies to compete
over customers. For example, digital platforms like Yelp use ML to predict user
preference and make recommendations. A service that is more often queried by
users, perhaps because it more accurately anticipates user preferences, is also
more likely to obtain additional user data (e.g. in the form of a Yelp review).
Thus, competing predictors cause feedback loops whereby a predictor's
performance impacts what training data it receives and biases its predictions
over time. We introduce a flexible model of competing ML predictors that
enables both rapid experimentation and theoretical tractability. We show with
empirical and mathematical analysis that competition causes predictors to
specialize for specific sub-populations at the cost of worse performance over
the general population. We further analyze the impact of predictor
specialization on the overall prediction quality experienced by users. We show
that having too few or too many competing predictors in a market can hurt the
overall prediction quality. Our theory is complemented by experiments on
several real datasets using popular learning algorithms, such as neural
networks and nearest neighbor methods.

optimization algorithms. Our core contribution is a unified conceptual and
mathematical framework for the study of algorithms in this regime. This
analysis reveals that for naive approaches, the possibility of erroneous value
overestimation leads to a difficult-to-satisfy requirement: in order to
guarantee that we select a policy which is near-optimal, we may need the
dataset to be informative of the value of every policy. To avoid this,
algorithms can follow the pessimism principle, which states that we should
choose the policy which acts optimally in the worst possible world. We show why
pessimistic algorithms can achieve good performance even when the dataset is
not informative of every policy, and derive families of algorithms which follow
this principle. These theoretical findings are validated by experiments on a
tabular gridworld, and deep learning experiments on four MinAtar environments.

Continuum robot kinematics models are the basis for further perception,

based on the assumption of piecewise constant curvature (PCC). However, due to
the influence of friction, etc., the actual motion of the continuum robot is
approximate piecewise constant curvature (APCC). To address this, we present a
kinematic equivalent model for continuum robots, i.e. APCC 2L-5R. Using
classical rigid linkages to replace the original model in kinematic, the APCC
2L-5R model effectively reduces complexity and improves numerical stability.
Furthermore, based on the model, the configuration self-estimation of the
continuum robot is realized by monocular cameras installed at the end of each
approximate constant curvature segment. The potential of APCC 2L-5R in
perception, planning, and control of continuum robots remains to be explored.

In our algorithm, quantum circuits can be used not only for the energy
evaluation by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) but also for chemical
reaction path generation. The chemical reaction path is obtained by encoding
the initial reaction path to the circuit, operating parameterized gates, and
extracting the path information by measurement. The nudged elastic band method
was used for optimizing a reaction path, and the ground-state calculation for
each state on the path was performed by the VQE or the exact diagonalization
(ED). The proposed algorithm was applied to $\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{H}

obtained numerical results that the entanglement between the images accelerates

the vast majority of studies on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) systems, mobility
resource pricing is based on segmented travel modes, e.g. private vehicle,
public transit and shared mobility services. This study attempts to address
this research gap by introducing innovative auction-based online MaaS
mechanisms where users can bid for any amount of mode-agnostic mobility
resources based on their willingness to pay and preferences. We take the
perspective of a MaaS regulator which aims to maximize social welfare by
allocating mobility resources to users. We propose two mechanisms which allow
users to either pay for the immediate use of mobility service (pay-as-you-go),
or to subscribe to mobility service packages (pay-as-a-package). We cast the
proposed auction-based mechanisms as online resource allocation problems where
users compete for MaaS resources and bid for travel time per trip. We propose
(integer-) linear programming formulations to accommodate user bids based on
available mobility resources in an online optimization approach. We show that
the proposed MaaS mechanisms are incentive-compatible, develop customized
online algorithms and derive performance bounds based on competitive analysis.
Extensive numerical simulations are conducted on large scale instances
generated from realistic mobility data, which highlight the benefits of the
proposed MaaS mechanisms and the effectiveness of the proposed online

the Bayes-optimal prediction and inference of randomly but continuously

spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a hallmark of biological synapses. Further,
this dynamic Bayesian inference through plasticity enables circuits of the
cerebral cortex in simulations to recognize previously unseen, highly distorted
dynamic stimuli. Strikingly, this also introduces a biologically-modelled AI,
the first to overcome multiple limitations of deep learning and outperform
artificial neural networks in a visual task. The cortical-like network is
spiking and event-based, trained only with unsupervised and local plasticity,
on a small, narrow, and static training dataset, but achieves recognition of

Knife (GK) radiosurgery is very complicated and cumbersome. The resulting plan
quality heavily depends on planners skills, experiences and devoted efforts,
and varies significantly among cases, planners, and institutions. Quality
control for GK planning is desired to consistently provide high-quality plan to
each patient. In this study, we proposed a quality control method for GK
planning by building a database of high-quality GK plans. Patient anatomy was
described by target volume, target shape complexity, and spatial relationship
between target and nearby organs, which determine GK planning difficulty level.
Plan quality was evaluated using target coverage, selectivity, intermediate
dose spillage, maximum dose to 0.1 cc of brainstem, mean dose of ipsilateral
cochlea, and beam-on time. When a new plan is created, a high-quality plan that
has the most similar target volume size and shape complexity will be identified
from the database. A model has also been built to predict the dose to brainstem
and cochlea based on their overlap volume histograms. The identified reference
plan and the predicted organ dose will help planners to make quality control
decisions accordingly. To validate this method, we have built a database for
vestibular schwannoma, which are considered to be challenging for GK planning
due to the irregularly-shaped target and its proximity to brainstem and
cochlea. Five cases were tested, among which one case was considered to be of
high quality and four cases had a lower plan quality than prediction. These
four cases were replanned and got substantially improved. Our results have
demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed quality control method. This method
may also be used as a plan quality prediction method to facilitate the
development of automatic treatment planning for GK radiosurgery.

planning, the quality of the resulting treatment plans heavily depends on the

development. Hence, GK plan quality may vary significantly among institutions
and planners, and even for a same planner at different cases. This is
particularly a concern for challenging cases with complicated geometry, such as
vestibular schwannoma cases. The purpose of this retrospective study is to
investigate the plan quality and variation in the manually forward planned,
clinically acceptable GK treatment plans of 22 previous vestibular schwannoma
cases. Considering the impacts of different patient geometry and different
trade-offs among the planning objectives in GK planning, it is difficult to
objectively assess the plan quality across different cases. To reduce these
confounding factors on plan quality assessment, we employed our recently
developed multiresolution-level inverse planning algorithm to generate a golden
plan for each case, which is expected to be on or close to the pareto surface
with a similar trade-off as used in the manual plan. The plan quality of the
manual plan is then quantified in terms of its deviation from the golden plan.
A scoring criterion between 0-100 was designed to calculate a final score for
each manual plan to simplify our analysis. Large quality variation was observed
in these 22 cases, with two cases having a score lower than 75, three cases
scoring between 80 and 85, two cases between 85 and 90, eight cases between 90
and 95, and seven cases higher than 95. Inter- and intra- planner variability
was also observed in our study. This large variation in GK manual planning
deserves high attention, and merits further investigation on how to reduce the
variation in GK treatment plan quality.

means to test the masslessness of graviton. In this contribution, I overview
three methods in probing the mass of graviton from precision timing of binary
pulsars via the modified gravitational radiation (hence, the observed damping
rate of the orbital period), as well as from the pulsar-timing-array (PTA)
experiments via the modified Hellings-Downs angular-correlation curve. These
tests probe different aspects of gravitation in its kinematics and dynamics,
complementing tests of other kinds and providing valuable information to the
fundamental theory of gravity.

emerged in recent years, which incrementally train recommendation models on

should be well tackled for higher accuracy of streaming recommendations. To
address these problems, we propose a Stratified and Time-aware Sampling based
Adaptive Ensemble Learning framework, called STS-AEL, to improve the accuracy

time-aware sampling to extract representative data from both new data and
historical data to address concept drift while capturing long-term user

idle resources in the underload scenario more effectively. After that, we
propose adaptive ensemble learning to efficiently process the overloaded data
in parallel with multiple individual recommendation models, and then
effectively fuse the results of these models with a sequential adaptive
mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that STS-AEL, in all the cases, significantly outperforms the

substantial suppression of the weak antilocalization effect for Co$_7$Se$_8$ at

Bi$_{2-x}$Co$_x$Se$_3$ films, where Co is in a non-magnetic $3^+$ state, show
weak antilocalization that survives to $x = 0.5$, which, in comparison with the
heterostructures, suggests the unordered moments of the Co$^{2+}$ act as a far
stronger dephasing element. This work highlights several important points

(CHs), and multiple UAVs are used to collect data from the CHs. The formulated
problem is solved through a two-step approach. In the first step, an efficient
method is proposed to determine the minimal number of CHs and their best
locations. Subsequently, the minimal number of UAVs and their trajectories are
obtained by solving the associated capacitated vehicle routing problem. Results
show the efficiency of our proposed CHs placement method compared to baseline
approaches, where bringing the CHs closer to the dockstation allows significant
energy savings. Moreover, among different UAV trajectory planning algorithms,
Tabu search achieves the best energy consumption. Finally, the impact of the
battery capacity and time deadline are investigated in terms of consumed
energy, number of visited CHs, and number of deployed UAVs.

magnetic flux ($\Phi_H$) using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data, analyze how
susceptible this is to overestimation compared to the true open flux
($\Phi_{open}$), assess its dependence on time and space, and compare it to
simple estimates from Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models. Methods: We
compare different methods of computation using data from PSP, STEREO A and
Wind. The effects of fluctuations and large scale structure on the estimate are
probed by using measured radial trends to produce synthetic data. Best
estimates are computed as a function of time and space, and compared to
estimates from PFSS models. Results: Radially-varying fluctuations of the HMF
vector and variation of the Parker spiral angle cause the standard metrics of
the mean and mode to evolve with radius independent of the central value about
which the vector fluctuates. This is best mitigated by projecting the vector
into the background Parker spiral direction. Nevertheless, we find a small
enhancement in flux close to 1AU. The fraction of locally inverted field lines
grows with radial distance from the Sun which remains a possible physical
reason for this excess, but is negligible at PSP`s perihelia. Similarly, the
impact of fluctuations in general is much reduced at PSP`s perihelia. The
overall best estimate is ~2.5 nT AU2 . No strong dependence on latitude or
longitude is apparent. The PFSS models predict lower values from 1.2 to 1.8 nT
AU2. Conclusions: The heliospheric flux is robustly estimated relative to a
mean Parker spiral direction at PSP`s perihelia where the decay of fluctuations
and weakening importance of local flux inversions means $\Phi_H$ ~
$\Phi_{open}$. Despite this, the estimate remains too high to be explained by
PFSS models, supporting the idea that coronal models underestimate the open
magnetic flux.

features for the subsurface velocity model estimation. The DL feature is a
low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional seismic data, which is
automatically generated by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and preserved in
the latent space. The low-dimensional DL feature contains the key information
of the input seismic data. Therefore, instead of directly comparing the
waveform differences between the observed and predicted data, such as
full-waveform inversion (FWI). We measure their DL feature differences in the
latent space of a CAE. The advantage of this low-dimensional comparison is that
it is less prone to the cycle-skipping problem compared to FWI. The reason is
that the DL features mainly contain the kinematic information, such as
traveltime, of the input seismic data when the latent space dimension is small.
However, more dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, can be
preserved in the DL feature when the latent space dimension becomes larger.
Therefore we propose a multiscale inversion approach that starts with inverting
the low-dimensional DL features for the low-wavenumber information of the
subsurface model. Then recover its high-wavenumber details through inverting
the high-dimensional DL features. However, there is no governing equation that
contains both the velocity and DL feature terms in the same equation. Therefore
we use the automatic differentiation (AD) to numerically connect the
perturbation of DL features to the velocity perturbation. In another word, we
connect a deep learning network with the wave-equation inversion by using the
AD. We denote this hybrid connection as hybrid machine learning (HML)
inversion. Here, the AD replaces the complex math derivations of the gradient
with a black box so anyone can do HML without having a deep geophysical

attributed to processes that tilt the planetary orbits, it is also possible
that they reflect misalignments between protoplanetary disks and stellar spins.
This latter hypothesis predicts the presence of co-planar multi-planetary
systems misaligned with their central stars. Here we re-evaluate the evidence
of such an architecture that has been claimed for the KOI-89 system. KOI-89 is
an early-type star with one validated transiting planet KOI-89.01/Kepler-462b
(period 84.7 days, radius $3.0\,R_\oplus$) and one transiting planet candidate
KOI-89.02 (period 207.6 days, radius $4.0\,R_\oplus$), where the latter
exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs). A previous modeling of the stellar
gravity-darkening effect in the transit light curves inferred a high stellar
obliquity of $\approx70^\circ$. We perform a photodynamical modeling of the
Kepler transit light curves, and use the resulting constraints on the orbital
configuration and transit times to update the gravity-darkened transit model.
As a result, we find no firm evidence for gravity darkening effect in the
transit shapes and conclude that stellar obliquity is not constrained by the
data. Given evidence for low orbital eccentricities from the dynamical
analysis, the system architecture can thus be consistent with many other
multi-transiting systems with flat, near-circular orbits aligned with the
stellar spin. We find that the TTVs imparted on its neighbor imply that
KOI-89.01 has a mass $\gtrsim20\,M_\oplus$. This would render it one of the
densest known sub-Neptunes, mostly composed of a solid core. Lower masses are
possible if the TTVs are instead due to an unseen third planet.

summarization, a dialogue summarization method should consider the
multi-speaker scenario where the speakers have different roles, goals, and
language styles. In a tete-a-tete, such as a customer-agent conversation, SuTaT
aims to summarize for each speaker by modeling the customer utterances and the
agent utterances separately while retaining their correlations. SuTaT consists
of a conditional generative module and two unsupervised summarization modules.
The conditional generative module contains two encoders and two decoders in a
variational autoencoder framework where the dependencies between two latent

involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization
design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating
experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms,
adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science
research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the
advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design
space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of
design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of
collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and
advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on
and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and
vision.

strategic properties - we show that it is strategy-proof under a natural model

and the true preference of the voter), and ""partially"" strategy-proof under
general additive utilities. We extend Knapsack Voting to more general settings
with revenues, deficits or surpluses, and prove a similar strategy-proofness
result. To further demonstrate the applicability of our scheme, we discuss its
implementation on the digital voting platform that we have deployed in

Based on this principle, in this paper, we soften the proximal policy
optimization by introducing the entropy and dynamically setting the temperature
coefficient to balance the opportunity of exploration and exploitation. While
maximizing the expected reward, the agent will also seek other trajectories to
avoid the local optimal policy. Nevertheless, the increase of randomness
induced by entropy will reduce the train speed in the early stage. Integrating
the temporal-difference (TD) method and the general advantage estimator (GAE),
we propose the dual-track advantage estimator (DTAE) to accelerate the
convergence of value functions and further enhance the performance of the

  Guarantees for Constrained Systems under Disturbances","13 pages, 8 figures, under review",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a safe robust policy iteration (SR-PI) algorithm to
design controllers with satisficing (good enough) performance and safety
guarantee. This is in contrast to standard PI-based control design methods with
no safety certification. It also moves away from existing safe control design
approaches that perform pointwise optimization and are thus myopic. Safety
assurance requires satisfying a control barrier function (CBF), which might be
in conflict with the performance-driven Lyapunov solution to the Bellman
equation arising in each iteration of the PI. Therefore, a new development is
required to robustly certify the safety of an improved policy at each iteration
of the PI. The proposed SR-PI algorithm unifies performance guarantee (provided
by a Bellman inequality) with safety guarantee (provided by a robust CBF) at
each iteration. The Bellman inequality resembles the satisficing decision
making framework and parameterizes the sacrifice on the performance with an
aspiration level when there is a conflict with safety. This aspiration level is
optimized at each iteration to minimize the sacrifice on the performance. It is
shown that the presented satisficing control policies obtained at each
iteration of the SR-PI guarantees robust safety and performance. Robust
stability is also guaranteed when there is no conflict with safety. Sum of
squares (SOS) program is employed to implement the proposed SR-PI algorithm
iteratively. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the
proposed satisficing control framework.

speaker is called voice disguise, among which automatic voice disguise (AVD) by
modifying the spectral and temporal characteristics of voices with
miscellaneous algorithms are easily conducted with softwares accessible to the
public. AVD has posed great threat to both human listening and automatic
speaker verification (ASV). In this paper, we have found that ASV is not only a
victim of AVD but could be a tool to beat some simple types of AVD. Firstly,
three types of AVD, pitch scaling, vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and
voice conversion (VC), are introduced as representative methods.
State-of-the-art ASV methods are subsequently utilized to objectively evaluate
the impact of AVD on ASV by equal error rates (EER). Moreover, an approach to
restore disguised voice to its original version is proposed by minimizing a
function of ASV scores w.r.t. restoration parameters. Experiments are then
conducted on disguised voices from Voxceleb, a dataset recorded in real-world
noisy scenario. The results have shown that, for the voice disguise by pitch
scaling, the proposed approach obtains an EER around 7% comparing to the 30%
EER of a recently proposed baseline using the ratio of fundamental frequencies.
The proposed approach generalizes well to restore the disguise with nonlinear
frequency warping in VTLN by reducing its EER from 34.3% to 18.5%. However, it
is difficult to restore the source speakers in VC by our approach, where more
complex forms of restoration functions or other paralinguistic cues might be
necessary to restore the nonlinear transform in VC. Finally, contrastive
visualization on ASV features with and without restoration illustrate the role
of the proposed approach in an intuitive way.

properties of different FGM materials. This paper aims at establishing a method

mechanical properties. In this study, the mechanical characteristics of Cu-Ni
FGM nanowires (NW) under uniaxial loading have been investigated using the
proposed method through MD simulations. In order to describe the inter-atomic
forces and hence predict the properties properly, EAM (Embedded atom model)
potential has been used. The nanowire is composed of an alloying constituent in
the core and the other constituent graded functionally along the outward radial
direction. Simple Linear and Exponential functions have been considered as the
functions which defines the grading pattern. The alloying percentage on the
surface has been varied from 0% to 50% for both Cu-cored and Ni-cored
nanowires. All the simulations have been carried out at 300 K. The L/D ratios
are 10.56 and 10.67 for Cu-cored and Ni-cored NWs, respectively. This study
suggests that Ultimate Tensile Stress and Young's modulus increase with
increasing surface Ni percentage in Cu-cored NWs. However, in Ni-cored NWs
these values decrease with the increase of surface Cu percentage. Also, for the
same surface percentage of Ni in Cu-cored NW, the values are higher in linearly
graded FGMs than that in exponentially graded FGMs. While in Ni-cored NWs,
exponentially graded FGM shows higher values of UTS and E than those in
linearly graded FGM. Thus, grading functions and surface percentages can be

distribution exhibits $\mu \approx 3$, which is referred to as ""the inverse
cubic law."" On the other hand, that of the Bitcoin return is claimed to be $\mu
\approx 2$, which is known as ""the inverse square law."" We investigate the
scaling properties using recent Bitcoin data and find that the tail index
changes to $\mu \approx 3$, which is consistent with the inverse cubic law.
This suggests that some properties of the Bitcoin market could vary over time.
We also investigate the autocorrelation of absolute returns and find that it is
described by a power-law with two scaling exponents. By analyzing the absolute
returns standardized by the realized volatility, we verify that the Bitcoin
return time series is consistent with normal random variables with time-varying
volatility.

barriers in reusing existing labels from similar application domains. Transfer
Learning is intended to relax this assumption by modeling relationships between

deep learning models with visual analytics tools, little work has explored the
issue of explaining and diagnosing the knowledge transfer process between deep

multi-level exploration of the transfer learning processes when training deep
neural networks. Our framework establishes a multi-aspect design to explain how
the learned knowledge from the existing model is transferred into the new
learning task when training deep neural networks. Based on a comprehensive

performance measures and detailed inspections of model behaviors from the

derived for conservative systems by combining an explicit high-order

proposed approach is shown to have the same order as the underlying RK method,
while the error of invariants is analyzed in the order of
$\mathcal{O}\left(h^{2(p+1)}\right),$ where $h$ is the time step and $p$
represents the order of the method. When $p$ is appropriately large, the EIP
method is practically invariants-conserving because the error of invariants can
reach the machine accuracy. The method is illustrated for the cases of single

Extensive numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical results
and demonstrate the superior behaviors of the proposed method in a long time

However, the techniques suffer from inconsistent performance due to lack of
nanoscale control of tip apex structure, which often leads to irreproducible
spectral, spatial, and polarization resolved imaging. Instead of refining
tip-fabrication to resolve this problem, we pursue the inverse approach of
optimizing the nano-optical vector-field at the tip apex via adaptive optics.
Specifically, we demonstrate dynamic wavefront shaping of the excitation field
to effectively couple light to the tip and adaptively control for enhanced
sensitivity and polarization-controlled TEPL and TERS, with performance
exceeding what can be achieved by conventional tip-fabrication and optimal
excitation polarization. Employing a sequence feedback algorithm, we achieve
4.4$\times$10$^4$-fold TEPL enhancement of a WSe$_2$ monolayer which is
>2$\times$ larger than the normal TEPL intensity without wavefront shaping, as
well as the largest plasmon-enhanced PL intensity of a transition metal

near-field polarization control in TERS, we demonstrate the investigation of
conformational heterogeneity of brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) molecules as well

central primary galaxies as small as $8.5<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<9.2$ and
$9.2<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<9.9$, implying there are on average 3--8
satellites with $M_V<-10$ around LMC-mass ICGs. The bright end cutoff of
satellite LFs and the satellite abundance are both sensitive to the magnitude
gap between the primary and its companions, indicating galaxy systems with
larger magnitude gaps are on average hosted by less massive dark matter haloes.
By selecting primaries with stellar mass similar to our MW, we discovered that
i) the averaged satellite LFs of ICGs with different magnitude gaps to their
companions and of galaxy pairs with different colour or colour combinations all
show steeper slopes than the MW satellite LF; ii) there are on average more

1.5 to 2.5 satellites with $M_V<-16$ around ICGs, consistent with our MW; iv)
even after accounting for the large scatter predicted by numerical simulations,
the MW satellite LF is uncommon at $M_V>-12$. Hence the MW and its satellite
system are statistically atypical of our sample of MW-mass systems. In
consequence, our MW is not a good representative of other MW-mass galaxies.
Strong cosmological implications based on only MW satellites await additional
discoveries of fainter satellites in extra-galactic systems. Interestingly, the
MW satellite LF is typical among other MW-mass systems within 40~Mpc in the
local Universe, perhaps implying the Local Volume is an under-dense region.

recommender systems. This paper focuses on a popular scenario for CDR where
different domains share the same set of users but no overlapping items. The
majority of recent methods have explored the shared-user representation to
transfer knowledge across domains. However, the idea of shared-user
representation resorts to learn the overlapped features of user preferences and
suppresses the domain-specific features. Other works try to capture the
domain-specific features by an MLP mapping but require heuristic human
knowledge of choosing samples to train the mapping. In this paper, we attempt
to learn both features of user preferences in a more principled way. We assume
that each user's preferences in one domain can be expressed by the other one,
and these preferences can be mutually converted to each other with the
so-called equivalent transformation. Based on this assumption, we propose an
equivalent transformation learner (ETL) which models the joint distribution of
user behaviors across domains. The equivalent transformation in ETL relaxes the
idea of shared-user representation and allows the learned preferences in
different domains to preserve the domain-specific features as well as the
overlapped features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ETL compared with recent state-of-the-art

equal importance during the optimization process. However, the salient feature
points in scenes have more significant influence during the human navigation
process. Therefore, we first propose a visual saliency model called SalVavNet

the saliency maps generated by SalNavNet to pay more attention to the same

In particular, a Patch Unification (\textbf{PU}) module is first introduced to
normalize the input patch, and also create a standard local coordinate frame on
it to generate a reliable vote. We then devise a Weight-guided Neighboring
Feature Fusion (\textbf{WNFF}) module in the network, which fuses the
neighboring features to yield a semi-global feature for the center patch. WNFF
module mines the neighboring information of a local patch, such that the
representation capability to local geometric characteristics is significantly
enhanced, making the method robust to a certain level of noise. Moreover, we
present a Patch-level Voting (\textbf{PV}) module to regress transformations
and generates pose votes. After the aggregation of all votes from patches and a
refinement step, the final pose of the object can be obtained. Compared to
recent voting-based methods, 3DPVNet is patch-level, and directly carried out
on point clouds. Therefore, 3DPVNet achieves less computation than
point/pixel-level voting scheme, and has robustness to partial data.

balance between security and retrieval ability. However, compared to the
advanced technologies in CBIR like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the
existing PPCBIR schemes are far deficient in both accuracy and efficiency. With
more cloud service providers, the collaborative secure image retrieval service
provided by multiple cloud servers becomes possible. In this paper, inspired by
additive secret sharing technology, we propose a series of additive secure
computing protocols on numbers and matrices with better efficiency, and then
show their application in PPCBIR. Specifically, we extract CNN features,
decrease the dimension of features and build the index securely with the help
of our protocols, which include the full process of image retrieval in the
plaintext domain. The experiments and security analysis demonstrate the
efficiency, accuracy, and security of our scheme.

`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such
lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study
examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact
through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an
agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in
Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the
interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by
decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We
find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier
substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the
economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region
lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on
whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked
through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy
coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.

stellar mass $M_* \approx 10^{10.6}\, M_\odot$ are barred, and the relation
between bar size and total stellar mass is similar to that found in
near-infrared surveys. However, the formation of bars is suppressed in galaxies
with $M_* < 10^{10.6}\, M_\odot$, which may result from the difficulty TNG100
has in resolving short bars with radius <1.4 kpc. In contrast, up to 75% of
massive disk galaxies with $M_* > 10^{10.6}\, M_\odot$ have bars, ~10%-20%
higher than observed. TNG100 overproduces relatively short bars (radius ~1.4-3

The discovery of 2D conductivity at the $LaAlO_3/SrTiO_3$ interface has been

Science: correlated transition-metal-oxide systems and low-dimensional systems.
A full merging of these two fields requires nevertheless the realization of
$LaAlO_3/SrTiO_3$ heterostructures in the form of freestanding membranes. Here
we show a completely new method for obtaining oxide hetero-membranes with
micrometer lateral dimensions. Unlike traditional thin-film-based techniques
developed for semiconductors and recently extended to oxides, the concept we
demonstrate does not rely on any sacrificial layer and is based instead on pure
strain engineering. We monitor through both real-time and post-deposition
analyses, performed at different stages of growth, the strain relaxation
mechanism leading to the spontaneous formation of curved hetero-membranes.
Detailed transmission electron microscopy investigations show that the
membranes are fully epitaxial and that their curvature results in a huge strain
gradient, each of the layers showing a mixed compressive/tensile strain state.
Electronic devices are fabricated by realizing ad hoc circuits for individual
micro-membranes transferred on silicon chips. Our samples exhibit metallic
conductivity and electrostatic field effect similar to 2D-electron systems in
bulk heterostructures. Our results open a new path for adding oxide
functionality into semiconductor electronics, potentially allowing for
ultra-low voltage gating of a superconducting transistors, micromechanical

task with deep networks. However, most of current video networks require large
memory and computational resources, which hinders their applications in
practice. Existing knowledge distillation methods are limited to the
image-level spatial domain, ignoring the temporal and frequency information
which provide structural knowledge and are important for video analysis. This
paper explores how to train small and efficient networks for action
recognition. Specifically, we propose two distillation strategies in the
frequency domain, namely the feature spectrum and parameter distribution
distillations respectively. Our insight is that appealing performance of action
recognition requires \textit{explicitly} modeling the temporal frequency
spectrum of video features. Therefore, we introduce a spectrum loss that
enforces the student network to mimic the temporal frequency spectrum from the
teacher network, instead of \textit{implicitly} distilling features as many
previous works. Second, the parameter frequency distribution is further adopted
to guide the student network to learn the appearance modeling process from the
teacher. Besides, a collaborative learning strategy is presented to optimize
the training process from a probabilistic view. Extensive experiments are
conducted on several action recognition benchmarks, such as Kinetics,
Something-Something, and Jester, which consistently verify effectiveness of our
approach, and demonstrate that our method can achieve higher performance than
state-of-the-art methods with the same backbone.

achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, these methods lack rotation
robustness, and their performances degrade severely under random rotations,
failing to extend to real-world scenarios with varying orientations. To this
end, we propose a method named Self Contour-based Transformation (SCT), which
can be flexibly integrated into various existing point cloud recognition models
against arbitrary rotations. SCT provides efficient rotation and translation
invariance by introducing Contour-Aware Transformation (CAT), which linearly
transforms Cartesian coordinates of points to translation and
rotation-invariant representations. We prove that CAT is a rotation and
translation-invariant transformation based on the theoretical analysis.
Furthermore, the Frame Alignment module is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature extraction by capturing contours and transforming self contour-based
frames into intra-class frames. Extensive experimental results show that SCT
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under arbitrary rotations in
effectiveness and efficiency on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
Furthermore, the robustness and generality evaluations indicate that SCT is
robust and is applicable to various point cloud processing models, which
highlights the superiority of SCT in industrial applications.

been proposed over the past 25 years in a kind of arms-race, where each new
trading algorithm was compared to the previous best, thereby establishing a
""pecking order"", i.e. a partially-ordered dominance hierarchy from best to
worst of the various trading algorithms. Many of these algorithms were
developed and tested using simple minimal simulations of financial markets that
only weakly approximated the fact that real markets involve many different
trading systems operating asynchronously and in parallel. In this paper we use
BSE, a public-domain market simulator, to run a set of experiments generating
benchmark results from several well-known trading algorithms. BSE incorporates
a very simple time-sliced approach to simulating parallelism, which has obvious
known weaknesses. We then alter and extend BSE to make it threaded, so that
different trader algorithms operate asynchronously and in parallel: we call
this simulator Threaded-BSE (TBSE). We then re-run the trader experiments on
TBSE and compare the TBSE results to our earlier benchmark results from BSE.
Our comparison shows that the dominance hierarchy in our more realistic
experiments is different from the one given by the original simple simulator.
We conclude that simulated parallelism matters a lot, and that earlier results
from simple simulations comparing different trader algorithms are no longer to
be entirely trusted.

recent years. According to many, 3DCP is set to revolutionize the construction
industry: yielding unparalleled aesthetics, better quality control, lower cost,
and a reduction of the construction time. In this paper, two finite element
method (FEM) strategies are presented for simulating such 3D concrete printing
processes. The aim of these models is to predict the structural behaviour
during printing, while the concrete is still fresh, and estimate the optimal
print speed and maximum overhang angle to avoid print failures. Both FE
analyses involve solving multiple static implicit steps where sets of finite
elements are added stepwise until failure. The main difference between the two
methods is in the discretization of the 3D model. The first method uses
voxelization to approximate the 3D shape, while the second approach starts from
defining the toolpath and constructs finite elements by sweeping them along the
path. A case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of both
strategies. Both models are in good agreement with each other, and a comparable
structural response is obtained. The model's limitations and future challenges
are also discussed. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates how FEM-based models can
effectively simulate complex prints and could give recommendations with regards
to a better print strategy. These suggestions can be related to the maximum
printing speed and overhang angle, but also the optimal layer height and
thickness, the specific choice of the infill pattern, or by extension the
mixture design. When print failures can be avoided, this methodology could save
time, resources and overall cost. Future work will focus on the validation of
these numerical models and comparing them to experimental data.

financial institutions and the stability of the economy. One widely used
financial risk measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR estimates based on linear
and parametric models can lead to biased results or even underestimation of
risk due to time varying volatility, skewness and leptokurtosis of financial
return series. The paper proposes a nonlinear and nonparametric framework to
forecast VaR that is motivated by overcoming the disadvantages of parametric
models with a purely data driven approach. Mean and volatility are modeled via
support vector regression (SVR) where the volatility model is motivated by the
standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)
formulation. Based on this, VaR is derived by applying kernel density
estimation (KDE). This approach allows for flexible tail shapes of the profit
and loss distribution, adapts for a wide class of tail events and is able to
capture complex structures regarding mean and volatility.
  The SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid is compared to standard, exponential and threshold
GARCH models coupled with different error distributions. To examine the
performance in different markets, one-day-ahead and ten-days-ahead forecasts
are produced for different financial indices. Model evaluation using a
likelihood ratio based test framework for interval forecasts and a test for
superior predictive ability indicates that the SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid performs
competitive to benchmark models and reduces potential losses especially for
ten-days-ahead forecasts significantly. Especially models that are coupled with

The widely used encoder-decoder architecture extracts and uses several

these networks fail to map the long-range dependencies of local features, which
results in discriminative feature maps corresponding to each semantic class in
the resulting segmented image. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale
attention network for scene segmentation purposes by using the rich contextual
information from an image. Different from the original UNet architecture we
have used attention gates which take the features from the encoder and the
output of the pyramid pool as input and produced out-put is further
concatenated with the up-sampled output of the previous pyramid-pool layer and
mapped to the next subsequent layer. This network can map local features with
their global counterparts with improved accuracy and emphasize on
discriminative image regions by focusing on relevant local features only. We
also propose a compound loss function by optimizing the IoU loss and fusing
Dice Loss and Weighted Cross-entropy loss with it to achieve an optimal
solution at a faster convergence rate. We have evaluated our model on two

  Image Artifacts Removal","Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 29, pp.8842-8854, 2020","10.1109/TIP.2020.3020389",,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lossy compression brings artifacts into the compressed image and degrades the
visual quality. In recent years, many compression artifacts removal methods
based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have been developed with great
success. However, these methods usually train a model based on one specific
value or a small range of quality factors. Obviously, if the test image's
quality factor does not match to the assumed value range, then degraded
performance will be resulted. With this motivation and further consideration of
practical usage, a highly robust compression artifacts removal network is
proposed in this paper. Our proposed network is a single model approach that
can be trained for handling a wide range of quality factors while consistently
delivering superior or comparable image artifacts removal performance. To
demonstrate, we focus on the JPEG compression with quality factors, ranging
from 1 to 60. Note that a turnkey success of our proposed network lies in the
novel utilization of the quantization tables as part of the training data.
Furthermore, it has two branches in parallel---i.e., the restoration branch and
the global branch. The former effectively removes the local artifacts, such as
ringing artifacts removal. On the other hand, the latter extracts the global
features of the entire image that provides highly instrumental image quality
improvement, especially effective on dealing with the global artifacts, such as
blocking, color shifting. Extensive experimental results performed on color and
grayscale images have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness and efficacy of
our proposed single-model approach on the removal of compression artifacts from
the decoded image.

partition-of-unity enrichment in finite element analysis, the X-FEM permits use
of structured finite element meshes that do not conform to the geometry of
holes and inclusions. This eliminates the need for remeshing in phononic shape
optimization and topology optimization studies. In two dimensions, we adopt
rational B{\'e}zier representation of curved (circular) geometries, and
construct suitable material enrichment functions to model two-phase composites.
A Bloch-formulation of the elastodynamic phononic eigenproblem is adopted.
Efficient computation of weak form integrals with polynomial integrands is
realized via the homogeneous numerical integration scheme -- a method that uses
Euler's homogeneous function theorem and Stokes's theorem to reduce integration
to the boundary of the domain. Ghost penalty stabilization is used on finite
elements that are cut by a hole. Band structure calculations on perforated
(circular holes, elliptical holes, and holes defined as a level set) materials
as well as on two-phase phononic crystals are presented that affirm the sound
accuracy and optimal convergence of the method on structured, higher-order
spectral finite element meshes. Several numerical examples demonstrate the
advantages of $p$-refinement made possible by the spectral extended finite
element method. In these examples, fourth-order spectral extended finite
elements deliver $\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$ accuracy in frequency calculations with
more than thirty-fold fewer degrees-of-freedom when compared to quadratic
finite elements.

and engineering. A common challenge is to quantify uncertainties on model
inputs (parameters) that correspond to a quantitative characterization of
uncertainties on observable Quantities of Interest (QoI). To this end, we
consider a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) with a solution described by a
pullback probability measure. We call this an observation-consistent solution,
as its subsequent push-forward through the QoI map matches the observed
probability distribution on model outputs. A distinction is made between QoI
useful for solving the SIP and arbitrary model output data. In dynamical
systems, model output data are often given as a series of state variable
responses recorded over a particular time window. Consequently, the dimension
of output data can easily exceed $\mathcal{O}(1E4)$ or more due to the
frequency of observations, and the correct choice or construction of a QoI from
this data is not self-evident. We present a new framework, Learning Uncertain
Quantities (LUQ), that facilitates the tractable solution of SIPs for dynamical
systems. Given ensembles of predicted (simulated) time series and (noisy)
observed data, LUQ provides routines for filtering data, unsupervised learning
of the underlying dynamics, classifying observations, and feature extraction to
learn the QoI map. Subsequently, time series data are transformed into samples
of the underlying predicted and observed distributions associated with the QoI
so that solutions to the SIP are computable. Following the introduction and
demonstration of LUQ, numerical results from several SIPs are presented for a
variety of dynamical systems arising in the life and physical sciences. For

the microscopic dynamics into two basic processes, the aging process and the
contact process. A microscopic dynamical equation is derived to describe the
dynamics of individual nodes on the network. The hierarchy of a duration
coarse-grained (DCG) approach is obtained to study duration-dependent
processes, where the transition rates depend on the duration of an individual
node on a state. Applied to the epidemic spreading, such formalism is feasible
to reproduce different epidemic models, e.g., the
susceptible-infected-recovered and the susceptible-infected-susceptible models,
and to associate with the corresponding macroscopic spreading parameters with
the microscopic transition rate. The DCG approach enables us to obtain the
steady state of the general SIS model with arbitrary duration-dependent
recovery and infection rates. The current hierarchical formalism can also be
used to describe the spreading of information and public opinions, or to model
a reliability theory in networks.

the electricity grid, and the phase-out of fossil fuel based power plants,
there is an increased need for frequency regulation. On the demand side,
frequency regulation services can be offered by buildings or districts that are
equipped with electric heating or cooling systems, by exploiting their thermal
inertia. Existing approaches for tapping into this potential typically rely on
dynamic building models, which in practice can be challenging to obtain and
maintain. As a result, practical implementations of such systems are scarce.
Moreover, actively controlling buildings requires extensive control
infrastructure and may cause privacy concerns in district energy systems.
Motivated by this, we exploit the thermal inertia of buffer storage for
reserves, reducing the building models to demand forecasts here. By combining a
control scheme based on Robust Model Predictive Control, with affine policies,
and heating demand forecasting based on Artificial Neural Networks with online
correction methods, we offer frequency regulation reserves and maintain user
comfort with a system comprising a heat pump and buffer storage. While the
robust approach ensures occupant comfort, the use of affine policies reduces
the effect of disturbance uncertainty on the system state. In a
first-of-its-kind experiment with a real district-like building energy system,
we demonstrate that the scheme is able to offer reserves in a variety of
conditions and track a regulation signal while meeting the heating demand of
the connected buildings. 13.4% of the consumed electricity is flexible. In
additional numerical studies, we demonstrate that using affine policies
significantly decreases the cost function and increases the amount of offered
reserves and we investigate the suboptimality in comparison to an omniscient
control system.

provably optimal decision trees for nonlinear metrics. Our approach leads to a
trade-off when compared to optimising linear metrics: the resulting trees may
be more desirable according to the given nonlinear metric at the expense of
higher runtimes. Nevertheless, the experiments illustrate that runtimes are
reasonable for majority of the tested datasets.

estimate the gaze by aggregating from focused looks, each at a different
magnification level of the face area. The model avoids the need to extract
clear eye patches and at the same time addresses another important issue of
face-scale variation for gaze estimation in the wild. We further extend the

the upper lid. After a short transient of about 10 forcing periods, a
quasi-linear regime is established, with an axisymmetric inertial wave

The idea is to exploit the capability of TD-MCSCF to calculate the partial wave
amplitudes specified by the azimuthal and magnetic angular momenta (l,m) and
the m-resolved PAD. The phases of the ionization paths as well as the
amplitudes of the paths resulting in the same (l,m) are obtained through global
fitting of the expression of the asymmetry parameters to the calculated
m-resolved PAD, which depends on the relative phase of the bichromatic field.
We apply the present method to ionization of Ne by combined fundamental and
second-harmonic XUV pulses, demonstrating that the extracted amplitudes and
phases excellently reproduce the asymmetry parameters.

targets driven by an ultraintense femtosecond laser pulse. The target consists
of a near-critical-density hydrogen gas layer of a few tens of microns attached
to a solid carbon foil with a contaminant thin proton layer at its back side.
Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that, at optimal gas density,
the maximum energy of the contaminant protons is increased by a factor of $\sim
4$ compared to a single foil target. This improvement originates from the
near-complete laser absorption into relativistic electrons in the gas. Several
energetic electron populations are identified, and their respective effect on
the proton acceleration is quantified by computing the electrostatic fields
that they generate at the protons' positions. While each of those electron
groups is found to contribute substantially to the overall accelerating field,
the dominant one is the relativistic thermal bulk that results from the
nonlinear wakefield excited in the gas, as analyzed recently by Debayle et al.
[New J. Phys. 19, 123013 (2017)]. Our analysis also reveals the important role
of the neighboring ions in the acceleration of the fastest protons, and the
onset of multidimensional effects caused by the time-increasing curvature of
the proton layer.

divided into `star-forming' and `passive' populations. It is argued that the
former define a narrow `Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies' (MSSF) of the
form $\sSFR(\Mstar)$, whereas `passive' galaxies feature negligible levels of
star formation activity. Here we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and
the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey at $z<0.1$ to constrain the conditional
probability of the specific star formation rate at a given stellar mass. We
show that the whole population of galaxies in the local Universe is consistent
with a simple probability distribution with only one maximum (roughly
corresponding to the MSSF) and relatively shallow power-law tails that fully
account for the `passive' population. We compare the quality of the fits
provided by such unimodal ansatz against those coming from a double log-normal
fit (illustrating the bimodal paradigm), finding that both descriptions are
roughly equally compatible with the current data. In addition, we study the
physical interpretation of the bidimensional distribution across the
$M_*-\sSFR$ plane and discuss potential implications from a theoretical and
observational point of view. We also investigate correlations with metallicity,
morphology and environment, highlighting the need to consider at least an
additional parameter in order to fully specify the physical state of a galaxy.

We describe the associated graded of Bethe subalgebras as subalgebras in

Colliders study. It re-enables the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) as an
electron accelerator, and leverages the development invested in Compact Linear
Collider (CLIC) technology for its injector and as an accelerator research and
development infrastructure. The facility would be relevant for several of the
key priorities in the 2020 update of the European Strategy for Particle
Physics, such as an electron-positron Higgs factory, accelerator R\&D, dark
sector physics, and neutrino physics. In addition, it could serve experiments
in nuclear physics. The electron beam delivered by this facility would provide
access to light dark matter production significantly beyond the targets
predicted by a thermal dark matter origin, and for natures of dark matter
particles that are not accessible by direct detection experiments. It would
also enable electro-nuclear measurements crucial for precise modelling the
energy dependence of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which is needed to
precisely measure neutrino oscillations as a function of energy. The
implementation of the facility is the natural next step in the development of
X-band high-gradient acceleration technology, a key technology for compact and
cost-effective electron/positron linacs. It would also become the only facility
with multi-GeV drive bunches and truly independent electron witness bunches for
plasma wakefield acceleration. A second phase capable to deliver positron
witness bunches would make it a complete facility for plasma wakefield collider
studies. [...]

two-moment piece-wise power-law method, known also as Coarse Grained Momentum
Final Volume (CGMV), for solving the Fokker-Planck CR transport equation, with
a low number of momentum-bins extending over several decades of the momentum
coordinate. We propose an extension of the CGMV with a novel feature which
allows momentum boundaries to change in response to CR momentum gains or losses
near the extremes of the population distribution. Our extension involves a
special treatment of momentum bins containing spectral cutoff. Contrary to the
regular bins of fixed width, those bins have variable-width, and their outer
edges coincide with spectral cutoffs. The cutoff positions are estimated from
the particle number density and energy density in the outer bins for an assumed
small value of an additional parameter representing the smallest physically
significant level of CR spectral energy density. We performed a series of
elementary tests to validate the algorithm and demonstrated, whenever possible,
that results of the test simulations correspond, with a reasonable accuracy, to
the results of analogous analytical solutions. In a more complex test of

expectations regarding the effects of advection, diffusion, adiabatic, and
synchrotron cooling of a CR population.

The carbon monoxide (CO) molecular line at around 46655 A in solar
infrared spectra is often used to investigate the dynamic behavior of the cold
heart of the solar atmosphere, i.e., sunspot oscillation, especially at the
sunspot umbra. Aims. We investigated sunspot oscillation at Doppler velocities
of the CO 7-6 R67 and 3-2 R14 lines that were measured by the Cryogenic
Infrared Spectrograph (CYRA), as well as the line profile of Mg II k line that
was detected by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Methods. A
single Gaussian function is applied to each CO line profile to extract the line
shift, while the moment analysis method is used for the Mg II k line. Then the
sunspot oscillation can be found in the time-distance image of Doppler
velocities, and the quasi-periodicity at the sunspot umbra are determined from
the wavelet power spectrum. Finally, the cross-correlation method is used to
analyze the phase relation between different atmospheric levels. Results. At
the sunspot umbra, a periodicity of roughly 5 min is detected at the Doppler
velocity range of the CO 7-6 R67 line that formed in the photosphere, while a
periodicity of around 3 min is discovered at the Doppler velocities of CO 3-2
R14 and Mg II k lines that formed in the upper photosphere or the temperature
minimum region and the chromosphere. A time delay of about 2 min is measured
between the strong CO 3-2 R14 line and the Mg II k line. Conclusions. Based on
the spectroscopic observations from the CYRA and IRIS, the 3 min sunspot
oscillation can be spatially resolved in the Doppler shifts. It may come from
the upper photosphere or the temperature minimum region and then propagate to
the chromosphere, which might be regarded as a propagating slow magnetoacoustic
wave.

  unsupervised graph representation learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised (or self-supervised) graph representation learning is essential
to facilitate various graph data mining tasks when external supervision is
unavailable. The challenge is to encode the information about the graph
structure and the attributes associated with the nodes and edges into a low
dimensional space. Most existing unsupervised methods promote similar
representations across nodes that are topologically close. Recently, it was
shown that leveraging additional graph-level information, e.g., information
that is shared among all nodes, encourages the representations to be mindful of
the global properties of the graph, which greatly improves their quality.
However, in most graphs, there is significantly more structure that can be
captured, e.g., nodes tend to belong to (multiple) clusters that represent
structurally similar nodes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graph
representation learning method called Graph InfoClust (GIC), that seeks to
additionally capture cluster-level information content. These clusters are
computed by a differentiable K-means method and are jointly optimized by
maximizing the mutual information between nodes of the same clusters. This
optimization leads the node representations to capture richer information and
nodal interactions, which improves their quality. Experiments show that GIC
outperforms state-of-art methods in various downstream tasks (node
classification, link prediction, and node clustering) with a 0.9% to 6.1% gain
over the best competing approach, on average.

based on Spherical Elementary Convection Systems (SECS) that was presented in
our companion paper (Reistad et al., 2019,

reverse convection cells. We find that the dipole tilt angle has a linear
influence on the reverse cell potential. In the Northern Hemisphere the reverse
cell potential is typically two times higher in summer than in winter. This
change is interpreted as the change in interplanetary magnetic field-lobe
reconnection rate due to the orientation of the dipole tilt. Hence, the dipole
tilt influence on reverse ionospheric convection can be a significant
modification of the more known influence from v(O$_{sw}$)B(O$_{z}$). These
results could be adopted by the scientific community as key input parameters
for lobe reconnection coupling functions.

difference between carbon and fluorine atoms, which breaks the out of plane
charge symmetry even for a small strain gradient. The flexoelectric effect can
be further improved by co-functionalization with hydrogen and fluorine (CHF
Janus-type nanoribbon), where a spontaneous out of plane dipole moment is
formed even for flat nanoribbons. We also find that bending can control the

theories as a result of the change of variables in the action of General
Relativity. Embedding gravity, as well as mimetic gravity, can be used in
explaining the dark matter mystery since, in both cases, the modified theory
can be presented as General Relativity with additional fictitious matter

we construct a non-relativistic limit of these equations, in which the motion

sensitivity enhancement by monitoring the resonant frequency splitting caused

demonstrate that the resulting electronic structure exhibits an orbital
dependent magnetic anisotropy which affects the topological phase diagram and
the character of the Majorana bound states (MBSs). The inspection of the
electronic component of the MBSs reveals that the spin-orbital polarization
generally occurs along the direction of the applied Zeeeman magnetic field, and
transverse to the magnetic and orbital Rashba fields. The competition of
symmetric and antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling remarkably leads to a
misalignment of the spin and orbital moments transverse to the orbital Rashba
fields, whose manifestation is essentially orbital dependent. The behavior of
the spin-orbital polarization along the applied Zeeman field reflects the
presence of multiple Fermi points with inequivalent orbital character in the
normal state. Additionally, the response to variation of the electronic
parameters related with the degree of spin-orbital entanglement leads to
distinctive evolution of the spin-orbital polarization of the MBSs. These
findings unveil novel paths to single-out hallmarks relevant for the

usually show a steep rise toward far-ultraviolet (FUV) wavelengths and can be
described by the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)-like dust model. This feature
suggests the dominance of small dust grains of size $a \leq 0.1 \mu m$ in the
local environment of AGN, but the origin of such small grains is unclear. In
this paper, we aim to explain this observed feature by applying the RAdiative
Torque Disruption (RATD) to model the extinction of AGN radiation from FUV to
mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. We find that in the intense radiation field of
AGN, large composite grains of size $a \geq 0.1 \mu m$ are significantly
disrupted to smaller sizes by RATD up to $d_{\rm RATD} > 100$ pc in the polar
direction and $d_{\rm RATD} \sim 10$ pc in the torus region. Consequently,
optical-MIR extinction decreases, whereas FUV-near-ultraviolet (NUV) extinction
increases, producing a steep far-UV rise extinction curve. The resulting
total-to-selective visual extinction ratio thus significantly drops to $R_{\rm
V} < 3.1$ with decreasing distances to AGN center due to the enhancement of
small grains. The dependence of $R_{\rm V}$ with the efficiency of RATD will
help us to study the dust properties in the AGN environment via photometric
observations. In addition, we suggest that the combination of the strength
between RATD and other dust destruction mechanisms which are responsible for
destroying very small grains of $a \leq 0.05 \mu m$ is the key for explaining
the dichotomy observed 'SMC' and 'gray' extinction curve toward many AGN.

features from compressive samples have been recently proposed. However, these
techniques require a feature extraction procedure that reorders measurements
using the information embedded in the coded aperture patterns. In this paper, a
method that fuses features directly from dual-resolution compressive
measurements is proposed for spectral image classification. More precisely, the
fusion method is formulated as an inverse problem that estimates
high-spatial-resolution and low-dimensional feature bands from compressive
measurements. To this end, the decimation matrices that describe the
compressive measurements as degraded versions of the fused features are
mathematically modeled using the information embedded in the coded aperture
patterns. Furthermore, we include both a sparsity-promoting and a
total-variation (TV) regularization terms to the fusion problem in order to
consider the correlations between neighbor pixels, and therefore, improve the
accuracy of pixel-based classifiers. To solve the fusion problem, we describe
an algorithm based on the accelerated variant of the alternating direction
method of multipliers (accelerated-ADMM). Additionally, a classification
approach that includes the developed fusion method and a multilayer neural
network is introduced. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on three
remote sensing spectral images and a set of compressive measurements captured

be attended for further and more complex computations and reasoning. Its
computational description is challenging, especially if the temporal dynamics
of the process are taken into account. Numerous methods to estimate saliency
have been proposed in the last three decades. They achieve almost perfect
performance in estimating saliency at the pixel level, but the way they
generate shifts in visual attention fully depends on winner-take-all (WTA)
circuitry. WTA is implemented} by the biological hardware in order to select a
location with maximum saliency, towards which to direct overt attention. In
this paper we propose a gravitational model (GRAV) to describe the attentional
shifts. Every single feature acts as an attractor and {the shifts are the
result of the joint effects of the attractors. In the current framework, the
assumption of a single, centralized saliency map is no longer necessary, though
still plausible. Quantitative results on two large image datasets show that
this model predicts shifts more accurately than winner-take-all.

on valence quarks from highly overlapping nucleon wavefunctions. The most
energetically favorable diquark is a valence $u$ quark from one nucleon with a

that the stronger solar cycles produce bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) at

capture this effect in our three-dimensional Babcock--Leighton solar dynamo

BMRs at higher latitudes. The BMRs at higher latitudes generate a less poloidal
field, which consequently limits the overall growth of the magnetic field in
our model. Thus, our study suggests that the latitudinal variation of BMRs is a
potential mechanism for limiting the magnetic field growth in the Sun.

serves as a toy model for the spontaneous scalarization of charged (vacuum)
black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (generalized scalar-tensor) models. In
the Maxwell-scalar case, unlike the black hole cases, closed-form solutions
exist for the scalarized configurations. We compute these configurations for
three illustrations of nonminimal couplings: one that \textit{exactly}
linearizes the scalar field equation, and the remaining two that produce
nonlinear continuations of the first one. We show that the former model leads
to a runaway behaviour in regions of the parameter space and neither the
Coulomb nor the scalarized solutions are stable in the model; but the latter
models can heal this behaviour producing stable scalarized solutions that are
dynamically preferred over the Coulomb one. This parallels reports on black
hole scalarization in the extended-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet models. Moreover, we
analyse the impact of the choice of the boundary conditions on the
scalarization phenomenon. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions accommodate
both (linearly) stable and unstable parameter space regions, for the
scalar-free conducting sphere; but radiative boundary conditions always yield
an unstable scalar-free solution and preference for scalarization. Finally, we
perform numerical evolution of the full Maxwell-scalar system, following

undershooting, and microscopic diffusion processes, from which we determined

model predictive control (MPC), which require minimizing the (augmented)
Lagrangian at each iteration. We propose a novel first order primal-dual
method, termed \emph{proportional-integral projected gradient method}, for MPC
where the underlying finite horizon optimal control problem has both state and
input constraints. Instead of minimizing the (augmented) Lagrangian, each
iteration of our method only computes a single projection onto the state and
input constraint set. Our method ensures that, along a sequence of averaged
iterates, both the distance to optimum and the constraint violation converge to
zero at a rate of \(O(1/k)\) if the objective function is convex, where \(k\)
is the iteration number. If the objective function is strongly convex, this
rate can be improved to \(O(1/k^2)\) for the distance to optimum and
\(O(1/k^3)\) for the constraint violation. We compare our method against
existing methods via a trajectory-planning example with convexified
keep-out-zone constraints.

adaptive testing of student skills. Later, we have taken the advantage of
monotonicity restrictions in order to learn models fitting data better. This
article provides a synergy between these two phases as it evaluates Bayesian
network models used for computerized adaptive testing and learned with a
recently proposed monotonicity gradient algorithm. This learning method is
compared with another monotone method, the isotonic regression EM algorithm.
The quality of methods is empirically evaluated on a large data set of the
Czech National Mathematics Exam. Besides advantages of adaptive testing
approach we observed also advantageous behavior of monotonic methods,
especially for small learning data set sizes. Another novelty of this work is
the use of the reliability interval of the score distribution, which is used to
predict student's final score and grade. In the experiments we have clearly
shown we can shorten the test while keeping its reliability. We have also shown
that the monotonicity increases the prediction quality with limited training
data sets. The monotone model learned by the gradient method has a lower
question prediction quality than unrestricted models but it is better in the
main target of this application, which is the student score prediction. It is
an important observation that a mere optimization of the model likelihood or
the prediction accuracy do not necessarily lead to a model that describes best
the student.

is found that the decoherence of the QB is suppressed when two Floquet bound
states (FBSs) are formed in the quasienergy spectrum of the total system
consisting of the QB-charger setup and their respective environments. As long
as either the quasienergies of the two FBSs are degenerate or the QB-charger
coupling is large in the presence of two FBSs, the QB exposed to the
dissipative environments returns to its near-ideal cyclic stage. Our result
supplies an insightful guideline to realize the QB in practice using Floquet

the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The period (P) distributions, luminosity
amplitudes and population ratios of the three different sub-groups (BL
Herculis[BLH, P<5 days], W Virginis [WV, 5<P<20 days], RV Tauri [RVT, P>20
days]) are quite similar in different stellar systems, suggesting a common
evolutionary channel and a mild dependence on both metallicity and environment.
We present a homogeneous theoretical framework based on Horizontal Branch (HB)
evolutionary models, envisaging that TIICs are mainly old (t<10 Gyr), low-mass
stars. The BLHs are predicted to be post early asymptotic giant branch (PEAGB)
stars (double shell burning) on the verge of reaching their AGB track (first
crossing of the instability strip), while WVs are a mix of PEAGB and post-AGB
stars (hydrogen shell burning) moving from cool to hot (second crossing). Thus
suggesting that they are a single group of variable stars. RVTs are predicted
to be a mix of post-AGB stars along their second crossing (short-period tail)
and thermally pulsing AGB stars (long-period tail) evolving towards their white
dwarf cooling sequence.
  We also present several sets of synthetic HB models by assuming a bimodal
mass distribution along the HB. Theory suggests, in agreement with
observations, that TIIC pulsation properties marginally depend on metallicity.
Predicted period distributions and population ratios for BLHs agree quite well
with observations, while those for WVs and RVTs are almost a factor of two
smaller and larger than observed, respectively. Moreover, the predicted period
distributions for WVs peak at periods shorter than observed, while those for
RVTs display a long period tail not supported by observations.
  We investigate several avenues to explain these differences, but more
detailed calculations are required to address them.

is that the OS is removed from the critical path of communication. As a result,
some of the communication state itself resides in the NIC hardware and is no
more under the direct control of the OS. This control includes especially the
support for virtualisation of communication which is needed for live migration
of communication partners. In this paper, we propose the basic principles
required to implement a migration-capable RDMA-based network. We recommend some
changes at the software level and small changes at the hardware level. As a
proof of concept, we integrate the proposed changes into SoftRoCE, an

Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation for migrating

When the two baths have different temperatures, the steady BG exhibits a
rotating current, a clear signature of non equilibrium dynamics. Here, we
consider a time-dependent potential, and we apply a reverse-engineering
approach to derive exactly the required protocol to switch from an initial
steady state to a final steady state in a finite time $\tau$. The protocol can
be built by first choosing an arbitrary quasi-static counterpart - with few
constraints - and then adding a finite-time contribution which only depends
upon the chosen quasi-static form and which is of order $1/\tau$. We also get a
condition for transformations which - in finite time - conserve internal
energy, useful for applications such as the design of microscopic thermal
engines. Our study extends finite-time stochastic thermodynamics to
transformations connecting non-equilibrium steady states.

reconstructing horizontal and vertical urban form. This paper addresses the
challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30m spatial resolution, for
monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. We compare temporal and
spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully
convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map
urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open,
sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on
the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether
we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map other
European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and
the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the
classification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time.
DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN
when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can
be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth
compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the other European cities with
training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage
points over RF for both the dimensions. The resulting maps across the years
1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and
Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have
used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing
supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach
for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images.

confirmed by the observation of Aharonov--Bohm type oscillations for magnetic
fields applied along the nanowire axis. We interpret the occurrence of these
magnetic flux-periodic oscillations by the formation of a tubular hole
accumulation layer on the nanowire surface. In addition, for

critical current of about 0.2$\mu$A at 0.4K. By applying a magnetic field
perpendicular to the nanowire axis, the critical current decreases monotonously

critical current oscillates with a period of the magnetic flux quantum
indicating once again the presence of a tubular hole channel.

applications. However, they are also known to be susceptible to backdoor
attacks. When conducting backdoor attacks, most of the existing approaches
assume that the targeted DNN is always available, and an attacker can always
inject a specific pattern to the training data to further fine-tune the DNN
model. However, in practice, such attack may not be feasible as the DNN model
is encrypted and only available to the secure enclave.
  In this paper, we propose a novel black-box backdoor attack technique on face
recognition systems, which can be conducted without the knowledge of the
targeted DNN model. To be specific, we propose a backdoor attack with a novel
color stripe pattern trigger, which can be generated by modulating LED in a
specialized waveform. We also use an evolutionary computing strategy to
optimize the waveform for backdoor attack. Our backdoor attack can be conducted
in a very mild condition: 1) the adversary cannot manipulate the input in an
unnatural way (e.g., injecting adversarial noise); 2) the adversary cannot
access the training database; 3) the adversary has no knowledge of the training
model as well as the training set used by the victim party.
  We show that the backdoor trigger can be quite effective, where the attack
success rate can be up to $88\%$ based on our simulation study and up to $40\%$
based on our physical-domain study by considering the task of face recognition
and verification based on at most three-time attempts during authentication.
Finally, we evaluate several state-of-the-art potential defenses towards
backdoor attacks, and find that our attack can still be effective. We highlight
that our study revealed a new physical backdoor attack, which calls for the
attention of the security issue of the existing face recognition/verification

investigate the data for the periodicity analysis and reveal 70 variable stars
including 67 periodic variables in the target field, all of them are newly
discovered. The membership analysis of the periodic variables reveal that 30 of
them belong to the cluster and remaining 37 are identified as field variables.
Out of the 67 periodic variables, 48 are short-period (P<1 day) variables and
19 are long-period (P>1 day) variables. The variable stars have periodicity
between 3 hours to 41 days and their brightness ranges from V = 10.9 to 19.3
mag. The periodic variables belonging to the cluster are then classified into
different variability types on the basis of observational properties such as
shape of the light curves, periods, amplitudes, as well as their positions in
the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. As a result, we identify one Algol type
eclipsing binary, one possible blue straggler star, 3 slowly pulsating B type
stars, 5 rotational variables, 11 non-pulsating variables, 2 FKCOM variables
and remaining 7 are characterized as miscellaneous variables. We also identify
three Eclipsing Binary stars (EBs) belonging to the field star population. The
PHOEBE package is used to analyse the light curve of all four EBs in order to
determine the parameters of the binary systems such as masses, temperatures and
radii.

all the components of the covariance parameter can be estimated consistently by

linear coordinate transformations to design shrinking-shifting - and reshaping,

reshape the sizes and locations of the wrapped-objects inside the core-region.
The shrinking-shifting device shrinks the larger object into a smaller one and
shifts it to different location, whereas the shrinking-reshaping device can
generate a smaller-size image with different shape located at different
location. In contrast to previously designed shrinking devices, the real object
wrapped inside the proposed core-region and the transformed object contains the
same material properties, and the location-shifting is another feature. Here,
the shifting-region is located inside the physical-space boundaries to achieve
the non-negative, homogeneous, and anisotropic material properties of the
proposed device, which are easier for real implementations. Thus, we further
verified this concept with the amplifying-shifting and -reshaping devices for
visually transformation of smaller object into bigger one placed at different
location and position. We also applied active scatterer to further validate the
working functionality of proposed devices. In addition, the proposed devices
behave like the concentrator and or rotator effect in the absence of any
scatterer. Our findings highlight the role of TO, suggesting directions for
future research on bi-functional devices that will be useful for shrinking and

multi-planet configuration discovered via the direct imaging technique. Despite
over decade of research, the system's architecture remains not fully resolved.
The main difficulty comes from still narrow observing window of ~20 years that
covers small arcs of orbits with periods from roughly 50 to 500 years. Soon
after the discovery it became clear that unconstrained best-fitting astrometric
configurations self-disrupt rapidly, due to strong mutual gravitational
interactions between ~10-Jupiter-mass companions. Recently, we showed that the
HR 8799 system may be long term stable when locked in a generalized Laplace
8:4:2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) chain, and we constrained its orbits
through the planetary migration. Here we qualitatively improve this approach by
considering the MMR in terms of an exactly periodic configuration. This
assumption enables us to construct for the first time the self-consistent
$N$-body model of the long-term stable orbital architecture, using only
available astrometric positions of the planets relative to the star. We
independently determine planetary masses, which are consistent with
thermodynamic evolution, and the parallax overlapping to $1\sigma$ with the
most recent GAIA DR2 value. We also determine the global structure of the inner
and outer debris discs in the [8, 600] au range, consistent with the updated
orbital solution.

dedicated experiments have been carried out on different types of low-\b{eta}
superconducting accelerating cavities. Even under almost full trapping
conditions, we found that the measured magnetic sensitivities of these cavity
geometries were significantly lower than the theoretical values predicted by
commonly-used models based on local material properties. This must be resolved
by taking account of geometrical effects of flux trapping and flux oscillation
under RF surface current in such cavity shape. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to convolute the influence of geometries. We point out a puzzling
contradiction between sample measurements and recent cavity experiments, which
leads to two different hypotheses to simulate oscillating flux trapped in the
cavity surface. A critical reconsideration of flux oscillation by the RF
Lorentz force, compared with temperature mapping studies in elliptical
cavities, favoured the results of previous sample measurements, which suggested
preferential flux trapping of normal component to the cavity inner surface.
Based on this observation, we builded a new model to our experimental results
and the discrepancy between old theory and data were resolved.

and threatens model integrity by introducing poisoned data into the training

Therefore, in the present research, we aim to evaluate all aspects of data
poisoning attacks on regression learning, exceeding previous work both in terms
of breadth and depth. We present realistic scenarios in which data poisoning
attacks threaten production systems and introduce a novel black-box attack,
which is then applied to a real-word medical use-case. As a result, we observe
that the mean squared error (MSE) of the regressor increases to 150 percent due
to inserting only two percent of poison samples. Finally, we present a new

thoroughly on 26 datasets. As a result of the conducted experiments, we
conclude that the proposed defence strategy effectively mitigates the

interferometry to the point of big data revolution where the data is
represented in at least three dimensions with an axis for spectral windows,
baselines, sources, etc; where each axis has its own set of sub-dimensions. The
cost associated with storing and handling these data is very large, and
therefore several techniques to compress interferometric data and/or speed up
processing have been investigated. Unfortunately, averaging-based methods for
visibility data compression are detrimental to the data fidelity, since the
point spread function (PSF) is position-dependent, i.e. distorted and
attenuated as a function of distance from the phase centre. The position
dependence of the PSF becomes more severe, requiring more PSF computations for
wide-field imaging. Deconvolution algorithms must take the distortion into
account in the major and minor cycles to properly subtract the PSF and recover
the fidelity of the image. This approach is expensive in computation since at
each deconvolution iteration a distorted PSF must be computed. We present two
algorithms that approximate these position-dependent PSFs with fewer
computations. The first algorithm approximates the position-dependent PSFs in
the $uv$-plane and the second algorithm approximates the position-dependent
PSFs in the image-plane. The proposed algorithms are validated using simulated

we evaluate the loss in small image crops. We show, in experiments on two
standard road benchmarks and a new data set of irrigation canals, that convnets
trained with our loss function recover road connectivity so well, that it

aggregation. We construct the Smoluchowski ensemble as the set of discrete
finite distributions generated from the same initial state of all monomers upon
fixed number merging events and define a probability measure on this ensemble
such that the mean distribution in the mean-field approximation is governed by
the Smoluchowski equation. In the scaling limit this ensemble gives rise to a
set of relationships completely analogous to those of familiar statistical
thermodynamics. The central element of the thermodynamic treatment is the
selection functional, a functional of feasible distributions that connects the
probability of distribution to the specific details of the aggregation model.
We obtain scaling expressions for general kernels and closed-form results for
the special case of the constant, sum and product kernel. We study the
stability of the most probable distribution, provide criteria for the sol-gel
transition and obtain the distribution in the post-gel region by simple
thermodynamic arguments.

tool for observing low-energy Weyl fermions in candidate materials including
the chiral Landau level. However, previous theoretical results have been
restricted to the linearized regime around the Weyl node and are at odds with
experimental findings. Here, we derive a closed form expression for the
magneto-optical conductivity of generic Weyl semimetals in the presence of an
external magnetic field aligned with the tilt of the spectrum. The systems are
taken to have linear dispersion in two directions, while the tilting direction
can consist of any arbitrary continuously differentiable function. This general
calculation is then used to analytically evaluate the magneto-optical
conductivity of Weyl semimetals expanded to cubic order in momentum. In
particular, systems with arbitrary tilt, as well as systems hosting trivial
Fermi pockets are investigated. The higher-order terms in momentum close the
Fermi pockets in the type-II regime, removing the need for unphysical cutoffs
when evaluating the magneto-optical conductivity. Crucially, the ability to
take into account closed over-tilted and additional trivial Fermi pockets
allows us to treat model systems closer to actual materials and we propose a
simple explanation why the presence of parasitic trivial Fermi pockets can mask
the characteristic signature of Weyl fermions in magneto-optical conductivity
measurements.

network (H-CRAN) is envisioned as a new trend of 5G that uses the advantages of
heterogeneous and cloud radio access networks to enhance both the spectral and
energy efficiency. In this paper, building on the notion of effective capacity
(EC), we propose a framework in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based
H-CRAN to meet these demands simultaneously. Our proposed approach is to
maximize the effective energy efficiency (EEE) while considering spectrum and
power cooperation between macro base station (MBS) and radio remote heads
(RRHs). To solve the formulated problem and to make it more tractable, we
transform the original problem into an equivalent subtractive form via
Dinkelbach algorithm. Afterwards, the combinational framework of distributed
stable matching and successive convex algorithm (SCA) is then adopted to obtain
the solution of the equivalent problem. Hereby, we propose an efficient
resource allocation scheme to maximize energy efficiency while maintaining the
delay quality of service (QoS) requirements for the all users. The simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a non-trivial trade-off
between delay and energy efficiency in NOMA H-CRAN systems in terms of EC and
EEE and the spectrum and power cooperation improves EEE of the proposed
network. Moreover, our proposed solution complexity is much lower than the
optimal solution and it suffers a very limited gap compared to the optimal

we present a stochastic differential equation that describes fluctuations in
the mass growth of DM halos, as driven by a multiplicative white (Gaussian)
noise dependent on the spherical collapse threshold and on the power spectrum
of DM perturbations. We demonstrate that such a noise yields an average drift
of the halo population toward larger masses, that quantitatively renders the
standard hierarchical clustering. Then, we solve the Fokker-Planck equation
associated to the stochastic dynamics, and obtain the Press & Schechter mass
function as a (stationary) solution. Moreover, generalizing our treatment to a
mass-dependent collapse threshold, we obtain an exact analytic solution capable
of fitting remarkably well the N-body mass function over a wide range in mass

energy condition in quantum theories. Contrary to the classical energy
condition which are known to be violated in QFT, QNEC is a consequence of the
quantum focussing conjecture and has been proven for several special cases and
in general for QFTs in three or more spacetime dimensions. QNEC involves an
intrinsically quantum property of the theory under consideration, the
entanglement entropy (EE). While EE is notoriously hard to calculate in QFT,
the holographic principle provides a simple geometric description. In general
the holographic principle relates a gauge theory without gravity to a theory of
quantum gravity in one dimension higher. Holography provides a way to learn
about strongly coupled field theories as well as quantum gravity and
investigating QNEC in this context will undoubtedly lead to new insights. In
this thesis the focus is put on $2$- and $4$-dimensional field theories, where
we study systems of increasing complexity with numerical and analytical
methods. In vacuum, thermal states, globally quenched states and a toy model
for heavy ion collisions we find that QNEC is always satisfied and sometimes
saturated, while it can be a stronger or weaker condition than the classical
null energy condition. Interestingly in two dimensions QNEC$_2$ cannot be
saturated in the presence of bulk matter. The backreaction of a massive scalar
particle provides an example where the finite gap to saturation is precisely
known. Considering a massive self-interacting scalar field coupled to Einstein
gravity leads to phase transitions from small to large black holes. The dual
field theory provides a rich example to use QNEC$_2$ as a tool to learn about
strongly coupled dynamical systems. In particular knowing QNEC$_2$ in the
ground state allows us to make statements about the phase structure of the
thermal states.

forecasting complete probability density functions allows to investigate the

shape over a broad bandwidth, while nonlocal lattice modes extended over many
unit cells support high quality-factor resonances. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate nonlocal dielectric metasurfaces in the near-infrared that offer
both spatial and spectral control of light, realizing metalenses focusing light
exclusively over a narrowband resonance while leaving off-resonant frequencies
unaffected. Our devices attain this functionality by supporting a quasi-bound
state in the continuum encoded with a spatially varying geometric phase. We
leverage this capability to experimentally realize a versatile platform for
multispectral wavefront shaping where a stack of metasurfaces, each supporting
multiple independently controlled quasi-bound states in the continuum, molds
the optical wavefront distinctively at multiple wavelengths and yet stay
transparent over the rest of the spectrum. Such a platform is scalable to the
visible for applications in augmented reality and transparent displays.

economic and biomedical sciences. Under the unconfoundedness condition,
adjustment for confounders requires estimating the nuisance functions relating
outcome and/or treatment to confounders. This paper considers a generalized
optimization framework for efficient estimation of general treatment effects
using feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) when the number of
covariates is allowed to increase with the sample size. We estimate the
nuisance function by ANNs, and develop a new approximation error bound for the
ANNs approximators when the nuisance function belongs to a mixed Sobolev space.
We show that the ANNs can alleviate the curse of dimensionality under this
circumstance. We further establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of
the proposed treatment effects estimators, and apply a weighted bootstrap
procedure for conducting inference. The proposed methods are illustrated via
simulation studies and a real data application.

H-band data from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, TESS visible
photometric data, and X-ray observations with Chandra of HD94660. Using
PIONIER, we were able to detect the companion to HD94660, which is absent from
high quality spectra at visible wavelengths, with a magnitude difference of 1.8
in the H band at a separation of 18.72mas. The TESS light curve shows
variations with a period of 2.1d and also flaring. The Chandra spectrum is well
described by emission from hot thermal plasma, yet might include a non-thermal
component. The X-ray properties are compatible with a magnetically active
companion, while some magnetospheric contribution from the primary is also
possible. We can rule out that the companion to HD94660 is a compact source. It
is also very unlikely that this companion is a single star, as the estimated
mass of more than 2M_sun, the magnitude difference of 1.8 in the H band, and
its non-detection in visible spectra are difficult to realize in a single
object. One alternative could be a pair of late F stars, which would also be
responsible for the detected photometric variations. Interferometric
observations over the full binary orbit are necessary to determine the real
mass of the companion and to add constraints on the overall geometry of the

localization but also exploits the mature lidar mapping technique, thus
reducing the cost of radar mapping. We first embed both sensor modals into a

the map modal for exhaustive similarity evaluation against the current radar
modal, yielding the regression of the current pose. Finally, we apply this
differentiable measurement model to a Kalman Filter (KF) to learn the whole

  Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine",,"10.1016/j.artmed.2022.102364",,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Morphological and diagnostic evaluation of pediatric musculoskeletal system
is crucial in clinical practice. However, most segmentation models do not
perform well on scarce pediatric imaging data. We propose a new pre-trained
regularized convolutional encoder-decoder network for the challenging task of
segmenting heterogeneous pediatric magnetic resonance (MR) images. To this end,
we have conceived a novel optimization scheme for the segmentation network
which comprises additional regularization terms to the loss function. In order
to obtain globally consistent predictions, we incorporate a shape priors based
regularization, derived from a non-linear shape representation learnt by an
auto-encoder. Additionally, an adversarial regularization computed by a
discriminator is integrated to encourage precise delineations. The proposed
method is evaluated for the task of multi-bone segmentation on two scarce
pediatric imaging datasets from ankle and shoulder joints, comprising
pathological as well as healthy examinations. The proposed method performed
either better or at par with previously proposed approaches for Dice,
sensitivity, specificity, maximum symmetric surface distance, average symmetric
surface distance, and relative absolute volume difference metrics. We
illustrate that the proposed approach can be easily integrated into various
bone segmentation strategies and can improve the prediction accuracy of models
pre-trained on large non-medical images databases. The obtained results bring
new perspectives for the management of pediatric musculoskeletal disorders.

the analysis of exploratory visualizations. Unfortunately, these taxonomies
fail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often
resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency
perspective: ""can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?"" However,
designers are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went 'in one ear and out
the other.' The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to
design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we
address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe
their intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers
can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a
student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can
better define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate
how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide
array of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied

for a handful of numerical schemes and a contribution of this article is to
give the adjoint consistency conditions for the 2D Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel

studied here from a new heuristic point of view by discretizing the continuous
adjoint equation for the discrete flow and adjoint fields. Both points of view
prove to provide useful information. Besides, it has been often noted that
discrete or continuous inviscid lift and drag adjoint exhibit numerical
divergence close to the wall and stagnation streamline for a wide range of
subsonic and transonic flow conditions. This is analyzed here using the
physical source term perturbation method introduced in reference [Giles and
Pierce, AIAA Paper 97-1850, 1997]. With this point of view, the fourth physical
source term of appears to be the only one responsible for this behavior. It is
also demonstrated that the numerical divergence of the adjoint variables
corresponds to the response of the flow to the convected increment of
stagnation pressure and diminution of entropy created at the source and the
resulting change in lift and drag.

capacitively coupled radio frequency plasma discharge is investigated with
theory and Particle in cell/Monte Carlo Collision simulation. It is found that
the trap states of the wall material manipulated discharge properties mainly
through the varying ion induced secondary electron emission (SEE) coefficient
in response to dynamic surface charges accumulated within solid boundary. A
comprehensive SEE model considering surface charging is established first,
which incorporates the valence band electron distribution, electron trap
density, and charge trapping through Auger neutralization and de-excitation.
Theoretical analysis is carried out to reveal the effects of trap states on
sheath solution, stability, plasma density and temperature, particle and power
balance, etc. The theoretical work is supported by simulation results, showing
the reduction of the mean radio frequency sheath potential as
charging-dependent emission coefficient increases. As the gas pressure
increases, a shift of the maximum ionization rate from the bulk plasma center
to the plasma-sheath interface is observed, which is also influenced by the
trap states of the electrode material where the shift happens at a lower
pressure with traps considered. In addition, charge traps are proved helpful
for creating asymmetric plasma discharges with geometrically symmetric
structures, such effect is more pronounced in {\gamma} mode discharges.

Newton's method is well known, they are hardly used in practice for deep
learning because neither assembling the Hessian matrix nor calculating its
inverse is feasible for large-scale problems. Existing second-order methods
resort to various diagonal or low-rank approximations of the Hessian, which
often fail to capture necessary curvature information to generate a substantial
improvement. On the other hand, when training becomes batch-based (i.e.,
stochastic), noisy second-order information easily contaminates the training
procedure unless expensive safeguard is employed. In this paper, we adopt a
numerical algorithm for second-order neural network training. We tackle the
practical obstacle of Hessian calculation by using the complex-step finite
difference (CSFD) -- a numerical procedure adding an imaginary perturbation to
the function for derivative computation. CSFD is highly robust, efficient, and
accurate (as accurate as the analytic result). This method allows us to
literally apply any known second-order optimization methods for deep learning
training. Based on it, we design an effective Newton Krylov procedure. The key
mechanism is to terminate the stochastic Krylov iteration as soon as a
disturbing direction is found so that unnecessary computation can be avoided.
During the optimization, we monitor the approximation error in the Taylor
expansion to adjust the step size. This strategy combines advantages of line
search and trust region methods making our method preserves good local and
global convergency at the same time. We have tested our methods in various deep
learning tasks. The experiments show that our method outperforms exiting
methods, and it often converges one-order faster. We believe our method will
inspire a wide-range of new algorithms for deep learning and numerical
optimization.

Despite their success in capturing complex distributions, existing generative
models face three challenges when used for design problems: 1) generated

performance, and 3)~the new parameterization is unable to represent designs

one of the most popular graph-based SSL approaches, the recently proposed Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained remarkable progress by combining the
sound expressiveness of neural networks with graph structure. Nevertheless, the
existing graph-based methods do not directly address the core problem of SSL,
i.e., the shortage of supervision, and thus their performances are still very
limited. To accommodate this issue, a novel GCN-based SSL algorithm is
presented in this paper to enrich the supervision signals by utilizing both
data similarities and graph structure. Firstly, by designing a semi-supervised
contrastive loss, improved node representations can be generated via maximizing
the agreement between different views of the same data or the data from the
same class. Therefore, the rich unlabeled data and the scarce yet valuable
labeled data can jointly provide abundant supervision information for learning
discriminative node representations, which helps improve the subsequent
classification result. Secondly, the underlying determinative relationship
between the data features and input graph topology is extracted as
supplementary supervision signals for SSL via using a graph generative loss
related to the input features. Intensive experimental results on a variety of
real-world datasets firmly verify the effectiveness of our algorithm compared

perturbatively, in a generalization of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Using
this description, we compute the holomorphic and non-minimal twists at the
perturbative level. This calculation hinges on the existence of an $L_\infty$
action of the supersymmetry algebra on the abelian tensor multiplet, which we
describe in detail. Our formulation appears naturally in the pure spinor
superfield formalism, but understanding it requires developing a presymplectic
generalization of the BV formalism, inspired by Dirac's theory of constraints.
The holomorphic twist consists of symplectic-valued holomorphic bosons from the
$\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ hypermultiplet, together with a degenerate holomorphic
theory of holomorphic coclosed one-forms from the $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ tensor
multiplet, which can be interpreted as representing the intermediate Jacobian.
We check that our formulation and our results match with known ones under
various dimensional reductions, as well as comparing the holomorphic twist to
Kodaira-Spencer theory. Matching our formalism to five-dimensional Yang-Mills
theory after reduction leads to some issues related to electric-magnetic
duality; we offer some speculation on a nonperturbative resolution.

complexes does not attain the band edge. The complexes are bound states of

of Sirius A separated from the inclination effect (sin i), a detailed profile
analysis based on the Fourier transform technique was carried out for a large
number of spectral lines, while explicitly taking into account the line-by-line
differences in the centre-limb behaviours and the gravity darkening effect
(which depend on the physical properties of each line) based on model
calculations. The simulations showed that how the 1st-zero frequencies (q_1) of
Fourier transform amplitudes depends on v_e is essentially determined by the
temperature-sensitivity parameter (K) differing from line to line, and that Fe
I lines (especially those of very weak ones) are more sensitive to v_e than Fe
II lines. The following conclusions were drawn by comparing the theoretical and
observed q_1 values for many Fe I and Fe II lines: (1) The projected rotational
velocity (vsini) for Sirius A is fairly well established at 16.3 (+/-0.1) km/s
by requiring that both Fe I and Fe II lines yield consistent results. (2)
Although precise separation of v_e and i is difficult, v_e is concluded to be
in the range of 16 < v_e < 30-40 km/s, which corresponds to 25 < i(deg) < 90.
Accordingly, Sirius A is an intrinsically slow rotator for an A-type star,
being consistent with its surface chemical peculiarity.

Here, we are concerned with the linear response to small perturbations in the

therapies. Recently, deep learning approaches have gained substantial
popularity and success in DIR. Most deep learning approaches use the so-called
mono-stream ""high-to-low, low-to-high"" network structure, and can achieve
satisfactory overall registration results. However, accurate alignments for
some severely deformed local regions, which are crucial for pinpointing
surgical targets, are often overlooked. Consequently, these approaches are not
sensitive to some hard-to-align regions, e.g., intra-patient registration of
deformed liver lobes. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised
registration network, namely the Full-Resolution Residual Registration Network
(F3RNet), for deformable registration of severely deformed organs. The proposed
method combines two parallel processing streams in a residual learning fashion.
One stream takes advantage of the full-resolution information that facilitates
accurate voxel-level registration. The other stream learns the deep multi-scale
residual representations to obtain robust recognition. We also factorize the 3D
convolution to reduce the training parameters and enhance network efficiency.
We validate the proposed method on a clinically acquired intra-patient
abdominal CT-MRI dataset and a public inspiratory and expiratory thorax CT
dataset. Experiments on both multimodal and unimodal registration demonstrate
promising results compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

denotable as major whose subtended angle $\theta \in \left ( \pi, 2\pi \right

\left [0, \pi \right]$, it is impossible for two hard infinitesimally-thin
circular arcs with $\theta \in \left ( \pi, 2\pi \right ]$ to arbitrarily
closely approach once they are arranged in a configuration, e.g. on top of one
another, replicable ad infinitum without introducing any overlap. This makes
these hard concave particles, in spite of being infinitesimally thin, most
densely pack with a finite number density. This raises the question as to what
are these densest packings and what is the number density that they achieve.
Supported by Monte Carlo numerical simulations, this work shows that one can
analytically construct compact closed circular groups of hard major circular
arcs in which a specific, $\theta$-dependent, number of them (anti-)clockwise
intertwine. These compact closed circular groups then arrange on a triangular
lattice. These analytically constructed densest-known packings are compared to
corresponding results of Monte Carlo numerical simulations to assess whether

version of the split equation system with feedback is derived that conforms to
the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the subsonic flow regime, where the
feedback reduces to one additional term in the flow momentum equation. Subsonic
simulations are conducted for flow-acoustic feedback cases using a
scale-resolving run-time coupled hierarchical Cartesian mesh solver, which
operates with different explicit time step sizes for incompressible flow and
acoustics. The first simulation case focuses on the tone of a generic flute.
With the major flow-acoustic feedback term included, the simulation yields the
tone characteristics in agreement with reference results from K\""uhnelt based
on Lattice-Boltzmann simulation. On the contrary, the standard hybrid
hydrodynamic/acoustic method with the feedback-term switched off lacks the
proper tone. As the second simulation case, a thick plate in a duct is studied

highly desirable and will assist and speed up future research efforts in solar

serious bottleneck for machine learning, requiring powerful computational means
that are not at the disposal of many laboratories. Besides, the raw data
communication imposes restrictions on real time data observations and requires
considerable bandwidth and energy for the onboard solar observation systems. To
solve these issues, we propose a framework to classify solar activity on
compressed data. For this, we used a labeling scheme from a pre-existing vector
quantization technique in conjunction with different machine learning
algorithms to categorize spectra of singly-ionized magnesium Mg II measured by
NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph satellite (IRIS) into five types
of solar activity. Our training dataset is a human annotated list of 85 IRIS
observations containing 29097 frames. The annotated types of Solar activities
are active region, pre-flare activity, Solar flare, Sunspot, and quiet Sun. We
compress these data and reduce its complexity before training classifiers. We
found that the XGBoost classifier produces the most accurate results on the
compressed data, yielding over a 95\% prediction rate, and outperforming other
ML methods like convolution neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes
classifiers, and SVM. We find that the classification performance on compressed

uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When
studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically
vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented
using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical
machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term
future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum
gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of
quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant
quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the
study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum
capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with
asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits
are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are
threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum
channel $T$ and every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a threshold $p(\epsilon,T)$ for
the gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\epsilon$ are
fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where
$C$ denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in
communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a
quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than

in the real world, the attribute values of a product are usually incomplete and
vary over time, which greatly hinders the practical applications. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal method to jointly predict product attributes and
extract values from textual product descriptions with the help of the product
images. We argue that product attributes and values are highly correlated,
e.g., it will be easier to extract the values on condition that the product
attributes are given. Thus, we jointly model the attribute prediction and value
extraction tasks from multiple aspects towards the interactions between
attributes and values. Moreover, product images have distinct effects on our
tasks for different product attributes and values. Thus, we selectively draw
useful visual information from product images to enhance our model. We annotate
a multimodal product attribute value dataset that contains 87,194 instances,
and the experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that explicitly
modeling the relationship between attributes and values facilitates our method
to establish the correspondence between them, and selectively utilizing visual
product information is necessary for the task. Our code and dataset will be

crucial contributors to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and parallel imaging

self-decoupled 32-channel receive array for human brain imaging at 10.5T
(10.5T-32Rx), consisting of 31 loops and one cloverleaf element, was
co-designed and built in tandem with a 16-channel dual-row loop transmitter.
Novel receive array design and self-decoupling techniques were implemented.
Parallel imaging performance, in terms of SNR and noise amplification
(g-factor), of the 10.5T-32Rx was compared to the performance of an
industry-standard 32-channel receiver at 7T (7T-32Rx) via experimental phantom

times the central SNR and 2.08 times the peripheral SNR. Minimum inverse
g-factor value of the 10.5T-32Rx (min(1/g) = 0.56) was 51% higher than that of
the 7T-32Rx (min(1/g) = 0.37) with R=4x4 2D acceleration, resulting in
significantly enhanced parallel imaging performance at 10.5T compared to 7T.
The g-factor values of 10.5T-32Rx were on par with those of a 64-channel
receiver at 7T, e.g. 1.8 versus 1.9, respectively, with R=4x4 axial
acceleration. Conclusion: Experimental measurements demonstrated effective
self-decoupling of the receive array as well as substantial gains in SNR and

tools is important, it is even more critical to analyse and interpret a
predictive model, and vet it thoroughly to ensure that the recourses it offers
are meaningful and non-discriminatory before it is deployed in the real world.
To this end, we propose a novel model agnostic framework called Actionable
Recourse Summaries (AReS) to construct global counterfactual explanations which
provide an interpretable and accurate summary of recourses for the entire
population. We formulate a novel objective which simultaneously optimizes for
correctness of the recourses and interpretability of the explanations, while
minimizing overall recourse costs across the entire population. More
specifically, our objective enables us to learn, with optimality guarantees on
recourse correctness, a small number of compact rule sets each of which capture
recourses for well defined subpopulations within the data. We also demonstrate
theoretically that several of the prior approaches proposed to generate
recourses for individuals are special cases of our framework. Experimental
evaluation with real world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our
framework can provide decision makers with a comprehensive overview of
recourses corresponding to any black box model, and consequently help detect
undesirable model biases and discrimination.

cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system whereby a very
large number of access points (APs) simultaneously serve a group of users.
Specifically, four fundamental problems with increasing order of user fairness
are of interest: (i) to maximize the average spectral efficiency (SE), (ii) to
maximize the proportional fairness, (iii) to maximize the harmonic-rate of all
users, and lastly (iv) to maximize the minimum SE of all users, subject to a
sum power constraint at each AP. As the considered problems are non-convex,
existing solutions normally rely on successive convex approximation to find a
sub-optimal solution. More specifically, these known methods use off-the-shelf
convex solvers, which basically implement an interior-point algorithm, to solve
the derived convex problems. The main issue of such methods is that their
complexity does not scale favorably with the problem size, limiting previous
studies to cell-free massive MIMO of moderate scales. Thus the potential of
cell-free massive MIMO has not been fully understood. To address this issue, we
propose a unified framework based on an accelerated projected gradient method
to solve the considered problems. Particularly, the proposed solution is found
in closed-form expressions and only requires the first order oracle of the
objective, rather than the Hessian matrix as in known solutions, and thus is
much more memory efficient. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed
solution achieves the same utility performance but with far less run-time,
compared to other second-order methods. Simulation results for large-scale
cell-free massive MIMO show that the four utility functions can deliver nearly
uniformed services to all users. In other words, user fairness is not a great

images into serials subregions (chips) and detecting on them. However, some
problems such as scale variation, object sparsity, and class imbalance exist in
the process of training network with chips. In this work, three augmentation
methods are introduced to relieve these problems. Specifically, we propose a
scale adaptive module, which dynamically adjusts chip size to balance object
scale, narrowing scale variation in training. In addtion, we introduce mosaic

marginal log probability of the target sentence, using only the latent variable
as input. This allows us to use gradient-based optimization to find the target
sentence at inference time that approximately maximizes its marginal
probability. As each refinement step only involves computation in the latent
space of low dimensionality (we use 8 in our experiments), we avoid
computational overhead incurred by existing non-autoregressive inference
procedures that often refine in token space. We compare our approach to a
recently proposed EM-like inference procedure (Shu et al., 2020) that optimizes
in a hybrid space, consisting of both discrete and continuous variables. We
evaluate our approach on WMT'14 En-De, WMT'16 Ro-En and IWSLT'16 De-En, and
observe two advantages over the EM-like inference: (1) it is computationally
efficient, i.e. each refinement step is twice as fast, and (2) it is more
effective, resulting in higher marginal probabilities and BLEU scores with the

greatly improves the computational efficiency and enables the online
calibration by executing the calibration on a set of predefined inducing

  To demonstrate the procedure of the FIPO-BC algorithm, two tests are
performed, finding the optimal value and exploring the posterior distribution
of 1) the parameter in a simple function, and 2) the high-wave number damping
factor in a scale-resolving turbulence model (SAS-SST). The results (such as
the calibrated model parameter and its posterior distribution) of FIPO-BC with
different inducing points are compared to those of STD-BC. It is found that
FIPO-BC and STD-BC can provide very similar results, once the predefined set of
inducing point in FIPO-BC is sufficiently fine. But, the FIPO-BC algorithm is
at least ten times faster than the STD-BC algorithm. Meanwhile, the online
feature of the FIPO-BC allows continuous updating of the calibration outputs

alignment mechanism(s), we have gathered a dozen ALMA maps of
(sub)millimeter-wavelength polarized dust emission from Class 0 protostars, and
carried out a comprehensive statistical analysis of dust polarization
quantities. We analyze the statistical properties of the polarization fraction
P_frac and dispersion of polarization position angles S. More specifically, we
investigate the relationship between S and P_frac as well as the evolution of
the product S*P_frac as a function of the column density of the gas in the
protostellar envelopes. We find a significant correlation in the polarized dust
emission from protostellar envelopes seen with ALMA; the power-law index
differs significantly from the one observed by Planck in star-forming clouds.
The product S*P_frac, which is sensitive to the dust grain alignment
efficiency, is approximately constant across three orders of magnitude in
envelope column density. This suggests that the grain alignment mechanism
producing the bulk of the polarized dust emission in star-forming cores may not
depend systematically on the local conditions such as local gas density.
Ultimately, our results suggest dust alignment mechanism(s) are efficient at
producing dust polarized emission in the various local conditions typical of
Class 0 protostars. The grain alignment efficiency found in these objects seems
to be higher than the efficiency produced by the standard RAT alignment of
paramagnetic grains. Further study will be needed to understand how more
efficient grain alignment via, e.g., different irradiation conditions, dust
grain characteristics, or additional grain alignment mechanisms can reproduce

named SWITCH, which has a state-of-the-art performance in the score-based

gradient of a surrogate model $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ w.r.t. the input image, i.e.,
the transferable gradient. In each iteration, SWITCH first tries to update the
current sample along the direction of $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$, but considers
switching to its opposite direction $-\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ if our algorithm
detects that it does not increase the value of the attack objective function.
We justify the choice of switching to the opposite direction by a local
approximate linearity assumption. In SWITCH, only one or two queries are needed
per iteration, but it is still effective due to the rich information provided
by the transferable gradient, thereby resulting in unprecedented query
efficiency. To improve the robustness of SWITCH, we further propose
SWITCH$_\text{RGF}$ in which the update follows the direction of a random
gradient-free (RGF) estimate when neither $\hat{\mathbf{g}}$ nor its opposite
direction can increase the objective, while maintaining the advantage of SWITCH
in terms of query efficiency. Experimental results conducted on CIFAR-10,

achieves a satisfactory attack success rate using much fewer queries, and
SWITCH$_\text{RGF}$ achieves the state-of-the-art attack success rate with
fewer queries overall. Our approach can serve as a strong baseline for future
black-box attacks because of its simplicity. The PyTorch source code is

Aerodynamically small particles, called pebbles, are highly affected by the gas
flow. A growing planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk induces
three-dimensional (3D) gas flow. In our previous study, Paper I, we focused on
the shear regime of pebble accretion, and investigated the influence of
planet-induced gas flow on pebble accretion. In Paper I, we found that pebble
accretion is inefficient in the planet-induced gas flow compared to that in the
unperturbed flow, in particular when ${\rm St}\lesssim10^{-3}$, where St is the
Stokes number. Following Paper I, we investigate the influence of
planet-induced gas flow on pebble accretion. We consider the headwind of the
gas, which is not included in Paper I. We extend our study to the headwind
regime of pebble accretion in this study. Assuming a nonisothermal, inviscid
sub-Keplerian gas disk, we perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations on the
spherical polar grid which has a planet with the dimensionless mass, $m=R_{\rm
Bondi}/H$, located at its center, where $R_{\rm Bondi}$ and $H$ are the Bondi
radius and the disk scale height. We then numerically integrate the equation of
motion of pebbles in 3D using hydrodynamical simulation data. Combining our
results with the spacial variety of turbulence strength and pebble size in a
disk, we conclude that the planet-induced gas flow still allows for pebble
accretion in the early stage of planet formation. Suppression of pebble
accretion due to the planet-induced gas flow occurs only in the late stage of
planet formation, in particular in the inner region of the disk. This may be
helpful to explain the distribution of exoplanets and the architecture of the
Solar System, both of which have small inner and large outer planets.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2007.09883",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating human action proposals in untrimmed videos is an important yet
challenging task with wide applications. Current methods often suffer from the
noisy boundary locations and the inferior quality of confidence scores used for
proposal retrieving. In this paper, we present BSN++, a new framework which
exploits complementary boundary regressor and relation modeling for temporal
proposal generation. First, we propose a novel boundary regressor based on the
complementary characteristics of both starting and ending boundary classifiers.
Specifically, we utilize the U-shaped architecture with nested skip connections
to capture rich contexts and introduce bi-directional boundary matching
mechanism to improve boundary precision. Second, to account for the
proposal-proposal relations ignored in previous methods, we devise a proposal
relation block to which includes two self-attention modules from the aspects of
position and channel. Furthermore, we find that there inevitably exists data
imbalanced problems in the positive/negative proposals and temporal durations,
which harm the model performance on tail distributions. To relieve this issue,
we introduce the scale-balanced re-sampling strategy. Extensive experiments are
conducted on two popular benchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, which
demonstrate that BSN++ achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Not
surprisingly, the proposed BSN++ ranked 1st place in the CVPR19 - ActivityNet

graphs. An $n$ by $n$ bipartite graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ does not
contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but adding any missing edge to $G$ creates
a copy of $H$. More than half a century ago, Wessel and Bollob\'as
independently solved the problem of minimizing the number of edges in
$K_{(s,t)}$-saturated graphs, where $K_{(s,t)}$ is the `ordered' complete
bipartite graph with $s$ vertices from the first color class and $t$ from the
second. However, the very natural `unordered' analogue of this problem was
considered only half a decade ago by Moshkovitz and Shapira. When $s=t$, it can
be easily checked that the unordered variant is exactly the same as the ordered
case. Later, Gan, Kor\'andi, and Sudakov gave an asymptotically tight bound on
the minimum number of edges in $K_{s,t}$-saturated $n$ by $n$ bipartite graphs,
which is only smaller than the conjecture of Moshkovitz and Shapira by an
additive constant. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture for $s=t-1$ with
the classification of the extremal graphs. We also improve the estimates of
Gan, Kor\'andi, and Sudakov for general $s$ and $t$, and for all sufficiently
large $n$.

identification with CT image is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis
and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. To enlarge the
datasets for developing machine learning methods, it is essentially helpful to
aggregate the cases from different medical systems for learning robust and
generalizable models. This paper proposes a novel joint learning framework to
perform accurate COVID-19 identification by effectively learning with
heterogeneous datasets with distribution discrepancy. We build a powerful
backbone by redesigning the recently proposed COVID-Net in aspects of network
architecture and learning strategy to improve the prediction accuracy and
learning efficiency. On top of our improved backbone, we further explicitly
tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization
in latent space. Moreover, we propose to use a contrastive training objective
to enhance the domain invariance of semantic embeddings for boosting the
classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method
with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images.
Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently improves the
performances on both datasets, outperforming the original COVID-Net trained on
each dataset by 12.16% and 14.23% in AUC respectively, also exceeding existing
state-of-the-art multi-site learning methods.

by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. The chromatic polynomial of a graph is a notion
that has been extensively studied since the early 20th century. The chromatic
polynomial of graph $G$ is denoted $P(G,m)$, and it is equal to the number of
proper $m$-colorings of $G$. In 2019, Kaul and Mudrock introduced an analogue
of the chromatic polynomial for DP-coloring; specifically, the DP color
function of graph $G$ is denoted $P_{DP}(G,m)$. Two fundamental questions posed
by Kaul and Mudrock are: (1) For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, is it the
case that $P(G,m)-P_{DP}(G,m) = O(m^{n-3})$ as $m \rightarrow \infty$? and (2)
For every graph $G$, does there exist $p,N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$P_{DP}(K_p \vee G, m) = P(K_p \vee G, m)$ whenever $m \geq N$? We show that
the answer to both these questions is yes. In fact, we show the answer to (2)

on the recovered results of deconvolution algorithm is thoroughly analyzed. To
implement a reliable deconvolution process, differential pulse-width pair (DPP)
technique is utilized to effectively eliminate the systematic BFS distortion
stemming from the frequency dependency of temporal envelope. The width of the
pulse pairs should be larger than 40 ns as is analyzed theoretically and
verified experimentally. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method can
realize flexible adjustment of spatial resolution with enhanced signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) from an established measurement with long pump pulse. In the
experiment, the spatial resolution is increased to 0.5 m and 1 m with high
measurement accuracy by using the deconvolution algorithm from the measurement
of 60/40 ns DPP signals. Compared with the raw DPP results with the same
spatial resolution, 9.2 dB and 8.4 dB SNR improvements are obtained for 0.5 m
and 1 m spatial resolution respectively, thanks to the denoising capability of
the total variation deconvolution algorithm. The impact of sampling rate on the

distortion-free Brillouin distributed sensing with higher spatial resolution

  COVID-19 Using Chest X-Ray Images","9 Pages, 14 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case count exceeding 10 million
worldwide, there is an increased need for a diagnostic capability. The main
variables in increasing diagnostic capability are reduced cost, turnaround or
diagnosis time, and upfront equipment cost and accessibility. Two candidates
for machine learning COVID-19 diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) scans and
plain chest X-rays. While CT scans score higher in sensitivity, they have a
higher cost, maintenance requirement, and turnaround time as compared to plain
chest X-rays. The use of portable chest X-radiograph (CXR) is recommended by
the American College of Radiology (ACR) since using CT places a massive burden
on radiology services. Therefore, X-ray imagery paired with machine learning
techniques is proposed a first-line triage tool for COVID-19 diagnostics. In
this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to accurately classify
chest X-ray scans of COVID-19 and normal subjects by fine-tuning several neural
networks (ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet201) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
These neural networks are fused in a parallel architecture and the voting
criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate
object classes where the output of each neural network is representing a single
vote. Several experiments are conducted on the weakly labeled COVID-19-CT-CXR
dataset consisting of 263 COVID-19 CXR images extracted from PubMed Central
Open Access subsets combined with 25 normal classification CXR images. These
experiments show an optimistic result and a capability of the proposed model to
outperforming many state-of-the-art algorithms on several measures. Using
k-fold cross-validation and a bagging classifier ensemble, we achieve an
accuracy of 99.7% and a sensitivity of 100%.

off between containing the spread of COVID-19 and maximizing economic impact.
This is of current importance as many organizations, cities, and states are
formulating reopening strategies. Our mechanisms, referred to as group
scheduling, are based on partitioning the population into groups and scheduling
each group on appropriate days with possible gaps (when all are quarantined).
Each group interacts with no other group and, importantly, any person who is
symptomatic in a group is quarantined. Specifically, our mechanisms are
characterized by three parameters $(g,d,t)$, where $g$ is the number of groups,
$d$ is the number of days a group is continuously scheduled, and $t$ is the gap
between cycles. We show that our mechanisms effectively trade off economic
activity for more effective control of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, we
show that the $(2,5,0)$ mechanism, which partitions the population into two
groups that alternatively work for five days each, flat lines the number of
COVID-19 cases quite effectively, while still maintaining economic activity at
70% of pre-COVID-19 level. We also study mechanisms such as $(2,3,2)$ and
$(3,3,0)$ that achieve a somewhat lower economic output (about 50%) at the cost
of more aggressive control of the virus; these could be applicable in
situations when the disease spread is more rampant in the population. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanisms by theoretical analysis and
extensive experimental simulations on various epidemiological models. Our
mechanisms prove beneficial just by regulating human interactions. Moreover,
our results show that if the disease transmission (reproductive) rate is made
lower by following social distancing, mask wearing, and other public health
guidelines, it can further increase the efficacy of our mechanisms.

civilizations may construct large structures in order to capture, for use, the
energy of their local star, leading to an object with an unusual infrared
signature. Later it was noted that other objects may represent the signature of
very advanced instrumentalities, such as interstellar vehicles, beaming
stations for propulsion, unusual beacons not using radio or laser radiation but
emission of gamma rays, neutrinos or gravitational radiation. Signs may be
unintentional or may be directed. Among directed and undirected signs we

call parameterized field theories. We present sufficient conditions ensuring
the existence of such phenomena between two given Lagrangian theories. More
precisely, we prove that a Lagrangian field theory depending linearly on an
additional parameter emerges from every multivariate polynomial theory
evaluated at differential operators which have well-defined Green functions
(or, more generally, that has a right-inverse in some extended sense). As a
motivating example, we show that the phenomenon of gravity emerging from
noncommutativy, in the context of a real or complex scalar field theory, can be
recovered from our emergence theorem. We also show that, in the same context,
we could also expect the reciprocal, i.e., that noncommutativity could emerge
from gravity. Some other particular cases are analyzed.

  tipping cascades","50 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tipping elements in the climate system are large-scale subregions of the
Earth that might possess threshold behavior under global warming with large
potential impacts on human societies. Here, we study a subset of five tipping
elements and their interactions in a conceptual and easily extendable
framework: the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets, the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the
Amazon rainforest. In this nonlinear and multistable system, we perform a basin
stability analysis to detect its stable states and their associated Earth
system resilience. Using this approach, we perform a system-wide and
comprehensive robustness analysis with more than 3.5 billion ensemble members.
Further, we investigate dynamic regimes where some of the states lose stability
and oscillations appear using a newly developed basin bifurcation analysis
methodology. Our results reveal that the state of four or five tipped elements
has the largest basin volume for large levels of global warming beyond 4
{\deg}C above pre-industrial climate conditions. For lower levels of warming,
states including disintegrated ice sheets on West Antarctica and Greenland have
higher basin volume than other state configurations. Therefore in our model, we
find that the large ice sheets are of particular importance for Earth system
resilience. We also detect the emergence of limit cycles for 0.6% of all
ensemble members at rare parameter combinations. Such limit cycle oscillations
mainly occur between the Greenland Ice Sheet and AMOC (86%), due to their
negative feedback coupling. These limit cycles point to possibly dangerous
internal modes of variability in the climate system that could have played a
role in paleoclimatic dynamics such as those unfolding during the Pleistocene
ice age cycles.

comfort, preferences, and perception. However, acquiring long-term luminance
maps require labor-intensive and time-consuming simulations or impracticable
long-term field measurements. This paper presents a novel data-driven machine
learning approach that makes annual luminance-based evaluations more efficient
and accessible. The methodology is based on predicting the annual luminance
maps from a limited number of point-in-time high dynamic range imagery by
utilizing a deep neural network (DNN). Panoramic views are utilized, as they
can be post-processed to study multiple view directions. The proposed DNN model
can faithfully predict high-quality annual panoramic luminance maps from one of
the three options within 30 minutes training time: a) point-in-time luminance
imagery spanning 5% of the year, when evenly distributed during daylight hours,
b) one-month hourly imagery generated or collected continuously during daylight
hours around the equinoxes (8% of the year); or c) 9 days of hourly data
collected around the spring equinox, summer and winter solstices (2.5% of the
year) all suffice to predict the luminance maps for the rest of the year. The
DNN predicted high-quality panoramas are validated against Radiance (RPICT)
renderings using a series of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The most
efficient predictions are achieved with 9 days of hourly data collected around
the spring equinox, summer and winter solstices. The results clearly show that
practitioners and researchers can efficiently incorporate long-term
luminance-based metrics over multiple view directions into the design and
research processes using the proposed DNN workflow.

setup for various active perception tasks with human subjects (active
observers) in mind that is capable of tracking the head and gaze. While many
studies explore human performances, usually, they use line drawings portrayed
in 2D, and no active observer is involved. PESAO allows us to bring many
studies to the three-dimensional world, even involving active observers. In our

This is achieved by using the delay-induced resonance, in which the time delay
replaces one of the two periodic forcings present in the vibrational resonance.
