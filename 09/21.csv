  Tracking in Criminal Investigations","Accepted for the IEEE VIS 2020 conference",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The daily routine of criminal investigators consists of a thorough analysis
of highly complex and heterogeneous data of crime cases. Such data can consist
of case descriptions, testimonies, criminal networks, spatial and temporal
information, and virtually any other data that is relevant for the case.
Criminal investigators work under heavy time pressure to analyze the data for
relationships, propose and verify several hypotheses, and derive conclusions,
while the data can be incomplete or inconsistent and is changed and updated
throughout the investigation, as new findings are added to the case. Based on a
four-year intense collaboration with criminalists, we present a conceptual
design for a visual tool supporting the investigation workflow and Visilant, a
web-based tool for the exploration and analysis of criminal data guided by the
proposed design. Visilant aims to support namely the exploratory part of the
investigation pipeline, from case overview, through exploration and hypothesis
generation, to the case presentation. Visilant tracks the reasoning process and
as the data is changing, it informs investigators which hypotheses are affected
by the data change and should be revised. The tool was evaluated by senior
criminology experts within two sessions and their feedback is summarized in the
paper. Additional supplementary material contains the technical details and
exemplary case study.

  autoregression",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vector autoregression (VAR) models are widely used to analyze the
interrelationship between multiple variables over time. Estimation and
inference for the transition matrices of VAR models are crucial for
practitioners to make decisions in fields such as economics and finance.
However, when the number of variables is larger than the sample size, it
remains a challenge to perform statistical inference of the model parameters.
In this article, we propose the de-biased Lasso and two bootstrap de-biased
Lasso methods to construct confidence intervals for the elements of the
transition matrices of high-dimensional VAR models. We show that the proposed
methods are asymptotically valid under appropriate sparsity and other
regularity conditions. To implement our methods, we develop feasible and
parallelizable algorithms, which save a large amount of computation required by
the nodewise Lasso and bootstrap. A simulation study illustrates that our
methods perform well in finite samples. Finally, we apply our methods to
analyze the price data of stocks in the S&P 500 index in 2019. We find that
some stocks, such as the largest producer of gold in the world, Newmont
Corporation, have significant predictive power over the most stocks.

feature fusion and image reconstruction. Then, we leverage Markov discriminator
to enhance the ability of generator to reconstruct the fusion image, so that
the result image can retain more details. Finally, introducing Preconditioned

the generator network. Experiments on QuickBird and WorldView datasets show
that the model proposed in this paper can effectively fuse PAN and MS images,

suggested approach takes into account the probability of renewable resource

radiation variations are estimated based on past historical data and the impact
of the performance of renewable sources such as photovoltaic (PV) is determined

employed to shrink the scenarios set. At the final stage, an improved crow

selecting users to produce blocks (e.g., proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake) and
the method to establish consensus (e.g., longest chain rules vs. Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) inspired protocols). These fundamental differences have
hindered ""apples-to-apples"" comparisons between different categories of
blockchain protocols and, in turn, the development of theory to formally
discuss their relative merits.
  This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and
comparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols,
simultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work (PoW) and
proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type
protocols. Our framework blackboxes the precise mechanics of the user selection
process, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process that
are significant for protocol design.
  We demonstrate the utility of our general framework with several concrete
results:
  1. We prove a CAP-type impossibility theorem asserting that liveness with an
unknown level of participation rules out security in a partially synchronous
setting.
  2. Delving deeper into the partially synchronous setting, we prove that a
necessary and sufficient condition for security is the production of
""certificates,"" meaning stand-alone proofs of block confirmation.
  3. Restricting to synchronous settings, we prove that typical protocols with
a known level of participation (including longest chain-type PoS protocols) can
be adapted to provide certificates, but those with an unknown level of
participation cannot.
  4. Finally, we use our framework to articulate a modular two-step approach to
blockchain security analysis that effectively reduces the permissionless case
to the permissioned case.

and magnetic field strength ($eE\parallel eB$), on the chiral symmetry
breaking-restoration and confinement-deconfinement phase transitions. We also
sketch the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature
$T$ and in the presence of background fields. Our unified formalism for this
study is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equations, symmetry preserving
vector-vector contact interaction model of quarks, and the proper time
regularization scheme. At $T=0$, in the purely magnetic case ($eE\rightarrow
0$), we observe the well known magnetic catalysis effect. On the other hand, in
the pure electric field background ($eB\rightarrow 0$), the electric field
tends to restore the chiral symmetry and deconfinement above the
pseudo-critical electric field $eE^{\chi, C}_c$. In the presence of both $eE$
and $eB$: we find the magnetic catalysis effect in the particular region where
$eB$ dominates over $eE$, whereas, we observe the chiral inhibition (or
electric chiral rotation) effect, when $eE$ stand over $eB$. At finite $T$, in
the pure electric field case, the phenomenon of inverse electric catalysis
appears to exist in our model. On the other hand for pure magnetic field
background, we notice the magnetic catalysis effect in the mean-field
approximation and inverse magnetic catalysis with $eB$-dependent coupling. The
combined effect of both $eE$ and $eB$ on the pseudo-critical $T^{\chi, C}_c$
yields the inverse electromagnetic catalysis, with and without $eB-$dependent
effective coupling of the model. Our findings are satisfactory in agreement
with already predicted results by lattice simulations and other reliable

maintaining facial integrity. Our approach runs at interactive frame rates and

about probability distributions by Vorob'ev (1962) and about database relations

local consistency always implies global consistency. Towards a common
generalization of these results, we consider K-relations, that is, relations
over a set of attributes such that each tuple in the relation is associated
with an element from an arbitrary, but fixed, positive semiring K. We introduce
the notions of projection of a K-relation, consistency of two K-relations, and
global consistency of a collection of K-relations; these notions are natural
extensions of the corresponding notions about probability distributions and
database relations. We then show that a collection of sets of attributes has
the property that every pairwise consistent collection of K-relations over
those attributes is globally consistent if and only if the sets of attributes
form an acyclic hypergraph. This generalizes the aforementioned results by
Vorob'ev and by Beeri et al., and demonstrates that K-relations over positive
semirings constitute a natural framework for the study of the interplay between
local and global consistency. In the course of the proof, we introduce a notion
of join of two K-relations and argue that it is the ""right"" generalization of
the join of two database relations. Furthermore, to show that non-acyclic
hypergraphs yield pairwise consistent K-relations that are globally
inconsistent, we generalize a construction by Tseitin (1968) in his study of

systems if the process noise or measurement errors have uncertain time

modeled using Gauss-Markov processes (GMP). However, uncertainty in the GMP
parameters, particularly in the correlation time constant, can cause misleading
error estimation. In this paper, we develop new time-correlated models that
ensure tight upper bounds on the estimation error variance, assuming that the
actual error is a stationary GMP with a time constant that is only known to
reside within an interval. We first use frequency-domain analysis to derive a
stationary GMP model both in continuous and discrete time domain, which
outperforms models previously described in the literature. Then, we achieve an
even tighter estimation error bound using a non-stationary GMP model, for which
we determine the minimum initial variance that guarantees bounding conditions.
In both cases, the model can easily be implemented in a linear estimator like a

device-to-device (D2D) communications into massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink systems. Due to the nature of
cellular downlink and FD D2D transmission, the performances of cellular and D2D
services are severely impaired due to high interference caused by base-stations
(BSs) and D2D transceivers. As a consequence, integrating a large number of D2D
links into exiting cellular networks might degrade the system performances. To
overcome this challenge, utilizing the large uniform linear array (ULA)
equipped at BSs, we propose a joint beamforming and power allocation design for
average sum-rate maximization while considering the effects of interference to
both cellular and D2D transmission. The problem formulation leads to a
nonconvex vector-variable optimization problem, where we develop an efficient
solution using a fractional programming (FP) based approach. Numerical results
show that, at sufficiently high self-interference cancellation (SIC) levels and
numbers of active D2D links, the FD D2D transmission provides a significant
sum-rate improvement as compared to the half-duplex (HD) counterpart and pure
cellular systems in absence of D2D.

superfluid density. We elucidate the importance of the drag in determining the
long-range behavior of the correlation functions and the spin speed of sound.
In this way, we are able to provide an expression for the spin Luttinger

promising in view of implementing the system by using ultracold Bose mixtures
trapped in deep optical lattices, where the size of the sample is of the same

literature search, numerous approaches for automated knowledge extraction have
been proposed. Relation extraction is one such task where semantic relations
between the entities are identified from the free text. In the biomedical
domain, extraction of regulatory pathways, metabolic processes, adverse drug
reaction or disease models necessitates knowledge from the individual
relations, for example, physical or regulatory interactions between genes,
proteins, drugs, chemical, disease or phenotype. In this paper, we study the
relation extraction task from three major biomedical and clinical tasks, namely
drug-drug interaction, protein-protein interaction, and medical concept
relation extraction. Towards this, we model the relation extraction problem in
multi-task learning (MTL) framework and introduce for the first time the
concept of structured self-attentive network complemented with the adversarial
learning approach for the prediction of relationships from the biomedical and
clinical text. The fundamental notion of MTL is to simultaneously learn
multiple problems together by utilizing the concepts of the shared
representation. Additionally, we also generate the highly efficient single task
model which exploits the shortest dependency path embedding learned over the
attentive gated recurrent unit to compare our proposed MTL models. The
framework we propose significantly improves overall the baselines (deep
learning techniques) and single-task models for predicting the relationships,
without compromising on the performance of all the tasks.

the recurrence relation $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$, and whoever moves last wins. The
game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition; depending on the choice
of moves the length of the game and the winner can vary, though for $n\ge 2$

  Initially the lower bound of the length of a game was order $n$ (and known to
be sharp) while the upper bound was of size $n \log n$. Recent work decreased
the upper bound to of size $n$, but with a larger constant than was
conjectured. We improve the upper bound and obtain the sharp bound of

indicators of disease spread risk in cities during the initial stages of
outbreak based on patterns of human activities obtained from digital trace
data. In this study, the Venables distance (D_v), and the activity density
(D_a) are used to quantify and evaluate human activities for 193 US counties,
whose cumulative number of confirmed cases was greater than 100 as of March 31,
2020. Venables distance provides a measure of the agglomeration of the level of
human activities based on the average distance of human activities across a
city or a county (less distance could lead to a greater contact risk). Activity
density provides a measure of level of overall activity level in a county or a
city (more activity could lead to a greater risk). Accordingly, Pearson
correlation analysis is used to examine the relationship between the two human
activity indicators and the basic reproduction number in the following weeks.
The results show statistically significant correlations between the indicators
of human activities and the basic reproduction number in all counties, as well
as a significant leader-follower relationship (time lag) between them. The
results also show one to two weeks' lag between the change in activity
indicators and the decrease in the basic reproduction number. This result
implies that the human activity indicators provide effective early indicators
for the spread risk of the pandemic during the early stages of the outbreak.
Hence, the results could be used by the authorities to proactively assess the
risk of disease spread by monitoring the daily Venables distance and activity
density in a proactive manner.

been widely developed in recent years with the intention to generate and
analyze automata that produce space-moving patterns or gliders that interact in
a periodic background. Frequently, this type of automata has been found through
either an exhaustive search or a meticulous construction of the evolution rule.
In this study, the specification of cellular automata with complex behaviors
was obtained by utilizing randomly generated specimens. In particular, it
proposed that a cellular automaton of $n$ states should be specified at random
and then extended to another automaton with a higher number of states so that
the original automaton operates as a periodic background where the additional
states serve to define the gliders. Moreover, this study presented an
explanation of this method. Furthermore, the random way of defining complex
cellular automata was studied by using mean-field approximations for various
states and local entropy measures. This specification was refined with a
genetic algorithm to obtain specimens with a higher degree of complexity. With
this methodology, it was possible to generate complex automata with hundreds of
states, demonstrating that randomly defined local interactions with multiple
states can construct complexity.

increasingly being used to find optimal policies for a given control task.
Although policies represented using a black-box AI are capable of efficiently
executing the underlying control task and achieving optimal closed-loop
performance, the developed control rules are often complex and neither
interpretable nor explainable. In this paper, we use a recently proposed
nonlinear decision-tree (NLDT) approach to find a hierarchical set of control
rules in an attempt to maximize the open-loop performance for approximating and
explaining the pre-trained black-box DRL (oracle) agent using the labelled
state-action dataset. Recent advances in nonlinear optimization approaches
using evolutionary computation facilitates finding a hierarchical set of
nonlinear control rules as a function of state variables using a
computationally fast bilevel optimization procedure at each node of the
proposed NLDT. Additionally, we propose a re-optimization procedure for
enhancing closed-loop performance of an already derived NLDT. We evaluate our
proposed methodologies (open and closed-loop NLDTs) on different control
problems having multiple discrete actions. In all these problems our proposed
approach is able to find relatively simple and interpretable rules involving
one to four non-linear terms per rule, while simultaneously achieving on par
closed-loop performance when compared to a trained black-box DRL agent. A
post-processing approach for simplifying the NLDT is also suggested. The
obtained results are inspiring as they suggest the replacement of complicated
black-box DRL policies involving thousands of parameters (making them
non-interpretable) with relatively simple interpretable policies. Results are
encouraging and motivating to pursue further applications of proposed approach
in solving more complex control tasks.

couple the model with the underlying hardware. This coupling requires the user
to modify application logic in order to run the same job across a different set
of resources, thereby limiting the choice of hardware for a given workload and
potentially forcing the user to forgo more efficient hardware configurations.
  We propose VirtualFlow, a system leveraging a novel abstraction called
virtual node processing to decouple the model from the hardware. In each step
of training or inference, the batch of input data is split across virtual nodes
instead of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs and TPUs). Mapping multiple virtual
nodes to each accelerator and processing them sequentially effectively time
slices the batch, thereby allowing users to reduce the memory requirement of
their workloads and mimic large batch sizes on small clusters.
  Using this technique, VirtualFlow enables many new use cases, such as
reproducing training results across different hardware, resource elasticity,
and heterogeneous training. In our evaluation, our implementation of
VirtualFlow for TensorFlow achieved strong convergence guarantees across
different hardware with out-of-the-box hyperparameters, up to 48% lower job
completion times with resource elasticity, and up to 42% higher throughput with
heterogeneous training.

maximal price that they are willing to pay for a certain item, which a seller

benefits, the aim for the seller is to find the optimal sales price, which
every buyer whose bid is not lower will pay. For fairness and privacy purposes,
buyers may be concerned about protecting the confidentiality of their bids.
Secure Multi-Party Computation is a domain of Cryptography that would allow the
seller to compute the optimal sales price while guaranteeing that the bids

price inevitably reveals some private information. Generic frameworks and
entropy-based techniques based on Quantitative Information Flow have been
developed in order to quantify and restrict those leakages. Due to their
combinatorial nature, these techniques do not scale to large input spaces. In
this work, we aim at scaling those privacy analyses to large input spaces in
the particular case of digital goods auctions. We derive closed-form formulas
for the posterior min-entropy of private inputs in two and three-party

reformulation of AEs provides new insights into their mapping, reconstruction
guarantees, as well as an interpretation of commonly used regularization

enable AEs to capture the inherent symmetry in the data. Our regularizations
leverage recent advances in the group of transformation learning to enable AEs
to better approximate the data manifold without explicitly defining the group
underlying the manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetry of the data can
be explained by a Lie group, we prove that the regularizations ensure the

Price-based Path-specified Transport Protocol (PPT) for NDN, using blockchain

to incentivise packet forwarding. In PPTP, routers advertise their expected

problems assuming rewards are bounded. We propose a new algorithm, namely
EXP4.P, by modifying EXP4 and establish its upper bound of regret in both
bounded and unbounded sub-Gaussian contextual bandit settings. The unbounded
reward result also holds for a revised version of EXP3.P. Moreover, we provide
a lower bound on regret that suggests no sublinear regret can be achieved given
short time horizon. All the analyses do not require bounded rewards compared to
classical ones. We also extend EXP4.P from contextual bandit to reinforcement
learning to incentivize exploration by multiple agents given black-box rewards.
The resulting algorithm has been tested on hard-to-explore games and it shows
an improvement on exploration compared to state-of-the-art.

leveraging a computational scheme known as expectation propagation (EP). The
algorithm is used in order to train a continuous-weights perceptron learning a

variable selection properties, estimation accuracy and computational
complexity, especially when the student perceptron is trained from correlated
patterns that prevent other iterative methods from converging. Furthermore, our
numerical tests demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of learning online
the unknown values of prior parameters, such as the dilution level of the

stochastic systems subject to chance constraints to account for optimal risk
allocation. Previous works have assumed a uniform risk allocation to cast the
optimal control problem as a semi-definite program (SDP), which can be solved
efficiently using standard SDP solvers. We adopt an Iterative Risk Allocation
(IRA) formalism, which uses a two-stage approach to solve the optimal risk
allocation problem for covariance steering. The upper-stage of IRA optimizes
the risk, which is proved to be a convex problem, while the lower-stage
optimizes the controller with the new constraints. This is done iteratively so
as to find the optimal risk allocation that achieves the lowest total cost. The
proposed framework results in solutions that tend to maximize the terminal
covariance, while still satisfying the chance constraints, thus leading to less
conservative solutions than previous methodologies. We also introduce two novel

experimentally compared the second harmonic generation enhancement of monolayer
MoS2 induced by the optimal FEG and resonant modes in hyperbolic

codes (SWCCs) have recently attracted attention due to various applications in
communcation systems such as simultaneous energy and information transfer. In a
SECC, each codewod is divided into smaller non-overlapping windows, called
subblocks, and every subblock is constrained to carry sufficient energy. In a
SWCC, the energy constraint is enforced over every window. In this work, we
focus on the binary channel, where sufficient energy is achieved theoretically
by using relatively high weight codes, and study SECCs and SWCCs under more
general constraints, namely bounded SECCs and bounded SWCCs. We propose two
methods to construct such codes with low redundancy and linear-time complexity,
based on Knuth's balancing technique and sequence replacement technique. For
certain codes parameters, our methods incur only one redundant bit. We also
impose the minimum distance constraint for error correction capability of the
designed codes, which helps to reduce the error propagation during decoding as
well.

risk of HIV infection, compounded both by their lack of access to stable
housing and the disproportionate representation of youth of marginalized
racial, ethnic, and gender identity groups among YEH. A key goal for health
equity is to improve adoption of protective behaviors in this population. One
promising strategy for intervention is to recruit peer leaders from the
population of YEH to promote behaviors such as condom usage and regular HIV
testing to their social contacts. This raises a computational question: which
youth should be selected as peer leaders to maximize the overall impact of the
intervention? We developed an artificial intelligence system to optimize such
social network interventions in a community health setting. We conducted a
clinical trial enrolling 713 YEH at drop-in centers in a large US city. The
clinical trial compared interventions planned with the algorithm to those where
the highest-degree nodes in the youths' social network were recruited as peer
leaders (the standard method in public health) and to an observation-only
control group. Results from the clinical trial show that youth in the AI group
experience statistically significant reductions in key risk behaviors for HIV
transmission, while those in the other groups do not. This provides, to our
knowledge, the first empirical validation of the usage of AI methods to
optimize social network interventions for health. We conclude by discussing
lessons learned over the course of the project which may inform future attempts
to use AI in community-level interventions.

iteratively trains a substitute model and eventually achieves a functionally

of ES Attack: i) ES Attack successfully steals the victim model without data

the engineering time is shortened by three orders of magnitude as compared to
the improvement of PL intensity by continuous-wave laser irradiation. Based on
the evolution of PL spectra, we attribute the giant PL enhancement to the
conversion from trion emission to exciton, as well as the improvement of the QY

microstructures on the monolayer WS2 based on the enhancement of PL intensity,

generated random numbers in cryptographic applications; it measures the
difficulty of guessing the most likely output. An important min-entropy
estimator is the compression estimator of NIST Special Publication (SP)
800-90B, which relies on Maurer's universal test. In this paper, we propose two
kinds of min-entropy estimators to improve computational complexity and
estimation accuracy by leveraging two variations of Maurer's test: Coron's test
(for Shannon entropy) and Kim's test (for Renyi entropy). First, we propose a
min-entropy estimator based on Coron's test. It is computationally more
efficient than the compression estimator while maintaining the estimation
accuracy. The secondly proposed estimator relies on Kim's test that computes
the Renyi entropy. This estimator improves estimation accuracy as well as
computational complexity. We analytically characterize the bias-variance
tradeoff, which depends on the order of Renyi entropy. By taking into account
this tradeoff, we observe that the order of two is a proper assignment and
focus on the min-entropy estimation based on the collision entropy (i.e., Renyi
entropy of order two). The min-entropy estimation from the collision entropy
can be described by a closed-form solution, whereas both the compression
estimator and the proposed estimator based on Coron's test do not have
closed-form solutions. By leveraging the closed-form solution, we also propose
a lightweight estimator that processes data samples in an online manner.
Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the first proposed estimator achieves
the same accuracy as the compression estimator with much less computation. The
proposed estimator based on the collision entropy can even improve the accuracy
and reduce the computational complexity.

deep parabolic mirror with a clear identification of the few vectorial modes
involved. Out of the focus the enhancement vanishes gradually, but the number
of relevant modes remains small. Ultimately this represents a quantum

propose a new stereo utility definition that aims to address the bias in the
interpretation of expert demonstrations. We then propose a loss function for
the learning agent to learn reward and action policies concurrently such that
the learning agent can outperform expert demonstrations. The performance of the

in forming an incoherence cluster of this chimera state. They can also spread

the target wave chimera evolves to the regime of solitary states which are
randomly distributed in space. Growing the coupling strength leads to the
attraction of solitary states to a certain spatial region, while the

is necessary to give more attention to the EEG samples with strong
transferability rather than forcefully training a classification model by all
the samples. Furthermore, for an EEG sample, from the aspect of neuroscience,
not all the brain regions of an EEG sample contains emotional information that
can transferred to the test data effectively. Even some brain region data will
make strong negative effect for learning the emotional classification model.

representation $z$, and then map $z$ to the output label $y$, have achieved
remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
Despite their success, neural models lack for both robustness and generality:
small perturbations to inputs can result in absolutely different outputs; the
performance of a model trained on one domain drops drastically when tested on
another domain.
  In this paper, we present methods to improve robustness and generality of NLP
models from the standpoint of disentangled representation learning. Instead of
mapping $x$ to a single representation $z$, the proposed strategy maps $x$ to a
set of representations $\{z_1,z_2,...,z_K\}$ while forcing them to be
disentangled. These representations are then mapped to different logits $l$s,
the ensemble of which is used to make the final prediction $y$. We propose
different methods to incorporate this idea into currently widely-used models,
including adding an $L$2 regularizer on $z$s or adding Total Correlation (TC)
under the framework of variational information bottleneck (VIB). We show that
models trained with the proposed criteria provide better robustness and domain

described as agents exerting unidirectional influence on other agents. In both
cases, we characterize two collective phases on the space of parameters of the

and a disordered phase, where many small cultural groups coexist. In the case
of leaders, the homogeneous state corresponds to their state. We find that a
high enough density of obstacles contributes to cultural diversity in the
system. On the other hand, we find a nontrivial effect when opinion leaders are
distributed in the system: if their density is greater than some threshold
value, leaders are no longer efficient in imposing their state to the
population, but they actually promote multiculturality. In this situation, we
uncover that leaders, as well as obstacles, serve as locations for the
formation of boundaries and segregation between different cultural groups.
Moreover, a lower density of leaders than obstacles is needed to induce

compressible flow solver rhoCentralFoam in OpenFOAM: (1) multi-component
species transport, (2) detailed fuel chemistry for gas phase combustion, and
(3) Lagrangian solver for gas-droplet two-phase flows and sub-models for liquid
droplets. To extensively verify and validate the developments and
implementations of the solver and models, a series of benchmark cases are
studied, including non-reacting multi-component gaseous flows, purely gaseous
detonations, and two-phase gas-droplet mixtures. The results show that the
RYrhoCentralFoam solver can accurately predict the flow discontinuities (e.g.
shock wave and expansion wave), molecular diffusion, auto-ignition and
shock-induced ignition. Also, the RYrhoCentralFoam solver can accurately
simulate gaseous detonation propagation for different fuels (e.g. hydrogen and
methane), about propagation speed, detonation frontal structures and cell size.
Sub-models related to the droplet phase are verified and/or validated against
analytical and experimental data. It is also found that the RYrhoCentralFoam
solver is able to capture the main quantities and features of the gas-droplet
two-phase detonations, including detonation propagation speed, interphase
interactions and detonation frontal structures. As our future work,
RYrhoCentralFoam solver can also be extended for simulating two-phase
detonations in dense droplet sprays.

  gradient","16 pages, 9 figures, 1 appendix",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Velocity gradient is the basis of many vortex recognition methods, such as Q
criterion, $\Delta$ criterion, $\lambda_{2}$ criterion, $\lambda_{ci}$
criterion and $\Omega$ criterion, etc.. Except the $\lambda_{ci}$ criterion,
all these criterions recognize vortices by designing various invariants, based
on the Helmholtz decomposition that decomposes velocity gradient into strain
rate and spin. In recent years, the intuition of 'no vortex in straight flows'
has promoted people to analyze the vortex state directly from the velocity
gradient, in which vortex can be distinguished from the situation that the
velocity gradient has couple complex eigenvalues. A specious viewpoint to adopt
the simple shear as an independent flow mode was emphasized by many authors,
among them, Kolar proposed the triple decomposition of motion by extracting a
so-called effective pure shearing motion; Li et al. introduced the so-called
quaternion decomposition of velocity gradient and proposed the concept of eigen
rotation; Liu et al. further mined the characteristic information of velocity
gradient and put forward an effective algorithm of Liutex, and then developed
the vortex recognition method. However, there is another explanation for the
increasingly clear representation of velocity gradient, that is the local
streamline pattern based on critical-point theory. In this paper, the tensorial
expressions of the right/left real Schur forms of velocity gradient are
clarified from the characteristic problem of velocity gradient. The relations
between the involved parameters are derived and numerically verified. Comparing
with the geometrical features of local streamline pattern, we confirm that the
parameters in the right eigen-representation based on the right real Schur form
of velocity gradient have good meanings to reveal the local streamline pattern.
Some illustrative examples from the DNS data are presented.

optical properties of X at high power, as well as limiting the ultimate exciton

uncover an efficient inter-state conversion between X to D excitons through the

  - In the single-message shuffle setting, we prove a lower bound of

short-range correlated (SRC) pairing of nucleons within nuclei, much of it
coming from electron scattering experiments leading to the break-up of an SRC
pair. The interpretation of these experiments rests on assumptions about the
mechanism of the reaction. These assumptions can be directly tested by studying
SRC pairs using alternate probes, such as real photons. We propose a 30-day
experiment using the Hall D photon beam, nuclear targets, and the GlueX
detector in its standard configuration to study short-range correlations with
photon-induced reactions. Several different reaction channels are possible, and
we project sensitivity in most channels to equal or exceed the 6 GeV-era SRC
experiments from Halls A and B. The proposed experiment will therefore
decisively test the phenomena of np dominance, the short-distance NN
interaction, and reaction theory, while also providing new insight into bound
nucleon structure and the onset of color transparency.

exploratory data analysis. However, existing one-size-fits-all hierarchical
clustering methods often fail to meet the diverse needs of different users. To
address this challenge, we present an interactive steering method to visually
supervise constrained hierarchical clustering by utilizing both public
knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) and private knowledge from users. The novelty of
our approach includes 1) automatically constructing constraints for
hierarchical clustering using knowledge (knowledge-driven) and intrinsic data
distribution (data-driven), and 2) enabling the interactive steering of
clustering through a visual interface (user-driven). Our method first maps each
data item to the most relevant items in a knowledge base. An initial constraint
tree is then extracted using the ant colony optimization algorithm. The
algorithm balances the tree width and depth and covers the data items with high
confidence. Given the constraint tree, the data items are hierarchically
clustered using evolutionary Bayesian rose tree. To clearly convey the
hierarchical clustering results, an uncertainty-aware tree visualization has
been developed to enable users to quickly locate the most uncertain
sub-hierarchies and interactively improve them. The quantitative evaluation and
case study demonstrate that the proposed approach facilitates the building of
customized clustering trees in an efficient and effective manner.

become an important issue. In the case of ferromagnetic insulators, it is well
known that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction can induce magnon thermal
Hall effect. Specifically, the DM vector parallel to the magnetization
direction induces complex magnon hopping amplitudes, so that magnons act as if
they feel Lorentz force. However, the DM vector which is orthogonal to the
magnetization direction has hitherto been neglected as a possible source of
magnon thermal Hall effect. This is because they play no role in the linear
spin wave theory, an often invoked approximation when computing the magnon
thermal Hall effect. Here, we challenge this expectation by presenting the
self-consistent Schwinger-boson mean field study of two-dimensional magnets
with ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction and in-plane DM interaction. We find
that the relevant Schwinger-boson mean field Hamiltonian takes the form of
two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is known
to show anomalous Hall effect, spin Hall effect, and Rashba-Edelstein effect,
whose thermal counterparts also appear in our system. Importantly, the thermal
Hall effect can be induced when out-of-plane magnetic field is applied, and
persists even when the magnetic field is large, so that the spins are
significantly polarized, and the linear spin wave theory is expected to be a
reasonable approximation. Since the linear spin wave theory predicts vanishing
thermal Hall effect, our result implies that linear spin wave is not a
sufficient approximation, and that magnon-magnon interaction must be taken into
account to predict the correct thermal Hall conductivity.

of nonconvex-nonconcave objectives remains elusive. Not only are there no known
first-order methods converging even to approximate local min-max points, but
the computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In
this paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity of
the problem, as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in
constrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives
and linear constraints.
  As a warm-up, we show that, even when the objective is a Lipschitz and smooth
differentiable function, deciding whether a min-max point exists, in fact even
deciding whether an approximate min-max point exists, is NP-hard. More
importantly, we show that an approximate local min-max point of large enough
approximation is guaranteed to exist, but finding one such point is
PPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of
Gradient Descent/Ascent.
  An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness
result in the Nemirovsky-Yudin model. We show that, given oracle access to some
function $f : P \to [-1, 1]$ and its gradient $\nabla f$, where $P \subseteq
[0, 1]^d$ is a known convex polytope, every algorithm that finds a
$\varepsilon$-approximate local min-max point needs to make a number of queries
that is exponential in at least one of $1/\varepsilon$, $L$, $G$, or $d$, where
$L$ and $G$ are respectively the smoothness and Lipschitzness of $f$ and $d$ is
the dimension. This comes in sharp contrast to minimization problems, where
finding approximate local minima in the same setting can be done with Projected
Gradient Descent using $O(L/\varepsilon)$ many queries. Our result is the first
to show an exponential separation between these two fundamental optimization
problems.

topological insulator is a natural hybrid system, with the surface states
hosting high-mobility Dirac fermions and the small-bandgap semiconducting bulk
state strongly absorbing light. In this work, we show a large photocurrent
response from a field effect transistor device based on intrinsic topological
insulator Sn-Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S. The photocurrent response is non-volatile and
sensitively depends on the initial Fermi energy of the surface state, and it
can be erased by controlling the gate voltage. Our observations can be
explained with a remote photo-doping mechanism, in which the light excites the
defects in the bulk and frees the localized carriers to the surface state. This
photodoping modulates the surface state conductivity without compromising the
mobility, and it also significantly modify the quantum Hall effect of the
surface state. Our work thus illustrates a route to reversibly manipulate the
surface states through optical excitation, shedding light into utilizing

enhancements hitherto unexplained. The same is true for the Cd isotopes.
[Purpose] Describe the electromagnetic properties of the Sn and Cd isotopes
[Method] Shell model calculations with a minimally renormalized realistic
interaction, supplemented by Quasi and Pseudo-SU3 symmetries and Nilsson-SU3
selfconsistent calculations. [Results for $N\le 64$] Shell model calculations
with the neutron effective charge as single free parameter describe well the
BE2(2>0) and BE2(4>2) rates for $N\le 64$ in the Cd and Sn isotopes. The former
exhibit weak permanent deformation corroborating the prediction of a Pseudo-SU3
symmetry, which remains of heuristic value in the latter, where the pairing
force erodes the quadrupole dominance. Calculations in $10^7$ and
$10^{10}$-dimensional spaces exhibit almost identical patterns: A vindication
of the shell model. [Results for $N\ge 64$] Nilsson-SU3 calculations describe
BE2 patterns in [112-120]Cd and [116-118]Sn isotopes having sizable quadrupole
moment of non-rotational origin denoted as q-vibrations. No calculations are
proposed for the heavier species, for which the conventional seniority
dscription is assumed for Sn, while in Cd the quadrupole moments change sign.
[Conclusion] A radical reexamination of traditional interpretations in the
region has been shown to be necessary, in which quadrupole dominance plays a
major role. What emerges is a bumpy but coherent view.

safeguard ASV systems from unauthorized access. Most of the existing spoofing
countermeasures perform well when the nature of the attacks is made known to
the system during training. However, their performance degrades in face of
unseen nature of attacks. In comparison to the synthetic speech created by a
wide range of TTS and VC methods, genuine speech has a more consistent
distribution. We believe that the difference between the distribution of
synthetic and genuine speech is an important discriminative feature between the
two classes. In this regard, we propose a novel method referred to as feature
genuinization that learns a transformer with convolutional neural network (CNN)
using the characteristics of only genuine speech. We then use this
genuinization transformer with a light CNN classifier. The ASVspoof 2019
logical access corpus is used to evaluate the proposed method. The studies show
that the proposed feature genuinization based LCNN system outperforms other

particular system is one of a class of equations derived recently and can be
used in practical simulations to describe the propagation of weakly nonlinear

small-amplitude long waves usually require long-time simulations in order to
investigate scenarios such as the overtaking collision of two solitary waves or
the propagation of transoceanic tsunamis. For long-time simulations of
non-dissipative waves such as solitary waves, the preservation of the total

approximation. The new conservative fully-discrete method consists of a
Galerkin finite element method for spatial semidiscretisation and an explicit
relaxation Runge--Kutta scheme for integration in time. The Galerkin method is
expressed and implemented in the framework of mixed finite element methods. The
paper provides an extended experimental study of the accuracy and convergence

In neuroevolution, where evolutionary algorithms are applied to neural

different times: when initial genomes (ANN architectures) are created at the
beginning of the search, when offspring genomes are generated by crossover, and
when new nodes or edges are created during mutation. This work explores the

locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems in the LOCAL model of distributed
computing. For example, the deterministic round complexity of any LCL problem
on bounded-degree graphs is either $O(\log^\ast n)$ or $\Omega(\log n)$ [Chang,
Kopelowitz, and Pettie, FOCS 2016]. The complexity landscape of LCL problems is
now quite well-understood, but a few questions remain open.
  For bounded-degree trees, there is an LCL problem with round complexity
$\Theta(n^{1/k})$ for each positive integer $k$ [Chang and Pettie, FOCS 2017].
It is conjectured that no LCL problem has round complexity $o(n^{1/(k-1)})$ and
$\omega(n^{1/k})$ on bounded-degree trees. As of now, only the case of $k = 2$
has been proved [Balliu et al., DISC 2018].
  In this paper, we show that for LCL problems on bounded-degree trees, there
is indeed a gap between $\Theta(n^{1/(k-1)})$ and $\Theta(n^{1/k})$ for each $k
\geq 2$. Our proof is constructive in the sense that it offers a sequential
algorithm that decides which side of the gap a given LCL problem belongs to. We
also show that it is EXPTIME-hard to distinguish between $\Theta(1)$-round and
$\Theta(n)$-round LCL problems on bounded-degree trees. This improves upon a
previous PSPACE-hardness result [Balliu et al., PODC 2019].

molecular biology due to its potential applications to drug design. One
approach is inverse quantitative structure activity/property relationship
(inverse QSAR/QSPR) analysis, which is to infer chemical structures from given
chemical activities/properties. Recently, a framework has been proposed for
inverse QSAR/QSPR using artificial neural networks (ANN) and mixed integer
linear programming (MILP). This method consists of a prediction phase and an
inverse prediction phase. In the first phase, a feature vector $f(G)$ of a
chemical graph $G$ is introduced and a prediction function $\psi$ on a chemical
property $\pi$ is constructed with an ANN. In the second phase, given a target
value $y^*$ of property $\pi$, a feature vector $x^*$ is inferred by solving an
MILP formulated from the trained ANN so that $\psi(x^*)$ is close to $y^*$ and
then a set of chemical structures $G^*$ such that $f(G^*)= x^*$ is enumerated
by a graph search algorithm. The framework has been applied to the case of
chemical compounds with cycle index up to 2. The computational results
conducted on instances with $n$ non-hydrogen atoms show that a feature vector
$x^*$ can be inferred for up to around $n=40$ whereas graphs $G^*$ can be
enumerated for up to $n=15$. When applied to the case of chemical acyclic
graphs, the maximum computable diameter of $G^*$ was around up to around 8. We
introduce a new characterization of graph structure, ""branch-height,"" based on
which an MILP formulation and a graph search algorithm are designed for
chemical acyclic graphs. The results of computational experiments using
properties such as octanol/water partition coefficient, boiling point and heat
of combustion suggest that the proposed method can infer chemical acyclic
graphs $G^*$ with $n=50$ and diameter 30.

The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong
reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of
COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in
the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is
essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility
data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we investigate the
proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of
transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate
(gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best
fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to
impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple,
Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)),
declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of
businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using
cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and
public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as
border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The
implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the
greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to
quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which enables
us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner and therefore
facilitate well-informed and cost-effective interventions.

a source language, whether depicting the visual scene helps translation into a
target language? Existing multimodal neural machine translation methods (MNMT)
require triplets of bilingual sentence - image for training and tuples of
source sentence - image for inference. In this paper, we propose ImagiT, a
novel machine translation method via visual imagination. ImagiT first learns to
generate visual representation from the source sentence, and then utilizes both
source sentence and the ""imagined representation"" to produce a target
translation. Unlike previous methods, it only needs the source sentence at the
inference time. Experiments demonstrate that ImagiT benefits from visual
imagination and significantly outperforms the text-only neural machine
translation baselines. Further analysis reveals that the imagination process in
ImagiT helps fill in missing information when performing the degradation
strategy.

To address these issues, much effort has been made on segmentation-based
tracking, which learns a pixel-wise object-aware template and can achieve
higher accuracy than bounding-box template based tracking. However, existing
segmentation-based trackers are ineffective in learning the spatio-temporal
correspondence across frames due to no use of the rich temporal information. To
overcome this issue, this paper presents a novel segmentation-based tracking
architecture, which is equipped with a spatio-appearance memory network to
learn accurate spatio-temporal correspondence. Among it, an appearance memory
network explores spatio-temporal non-local similarity to learn the dense
correspondence between the segmentation mask and the current frame. Meanwhile,
a spatial memory network is modeled as discriminative correlation filter to
learn the mapping between feature map and spatial map. The appearance memory
network helps to filter out the noisy samples in the spatial memory network
while the latter provides the former with more accurate target geometrical
center. This mutual promotion greatly boosts the tracking performance. Without
bells and whistles, our simple-yet-effective tracking architecture sets new

fast and continuously (data streams). They are usually affected by changes in
the data distribution, giving rise to a phenomenon referred to as concept
drift. Thus, learning models must detect and adapt to such changes, so as to
exhibit a good predictive performance after a drift has occurred. In this
regard, the development of effective drift detection algorithms becomes a key
factor in data stream mining. In this work we propose CU RIE, a drift detector
relying on cellular automata. Specifically, in CU RIE the distribution of the
data stream is represented in the grid of a cellular automata, whose
neighborhood rule can then be utilized to detect possible distribution changes
over the stream. Computer simulations are presented and discussed to show that
CU RIE, when hybridized with other base learners, renders a competitive
behavior in terms of detection metrics and classification accuracy. CU RIE is
compared with well-established drift detectors over synthetic datasets with
varying drift characteristics.

interactions with physically embodied social robots. The scope of the paper is
focused particularly on studies that include social physical robots and
real-world human-robot interactions with users. We present a thorough analysis
of reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. In addition to a
survey, we categorize existent reinforcement learning approaches based on the
used method and the design of the reward mechanisms. Moreover, since
communication capability is a prominent feature of social robots, we discuss
and group the papers based on the communication medium used for reward
formulation. Considering the importance of designing the reward function, we
also provide a categorization of the papers based on the nature of the reward.
This categorization includes three major themes: interactive reinforcement
learning, intrinsically motivated methods, and task performance-driven methods.
The benefits and challenges of reinforcement learning in social robotics,
evaluation methods of the papers regarding whether or not they use subjective
and algorithmic measures, a discussion in the view of real-world reinforcement
learning challenges and proposed solutions, the points that remain to be

bypasses body part detection during both the training and testing phases while
still learning semantically aligned part features. Our key observation is that
the statistics in a batch of images are stable, and therefore that batch-level
constraints are robust. First, we introduce a batch coherence-guided channel
attention (BCCA) module that highlights the relevant channels for each
respective part from the output of a deep backbone model. We investigate
channelpart correspondence using a batch of training images, then impose a
novel batch-level supervision signal that helps BCCA to identify part-relevant
channels. Second, the mean position of a body part is robust and consequently
coherent between batches throughout the training process. Accordingly, we
introduce a pair of regularization terms based on the semantic consistency
between batches. The first term regularizes the high responses of BCD-Net for
each part on one batch in order to constrain it within a predefined area, while
the second encourages the aggregate of BCD-Nets responses for all parts
covering the entire human body. The above constraints guide BCD-Net to learn
diverse, complementary, and semantically aligned part-level features. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that BCDNet consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on four large-scale ReID benchmarks.

reduce its uncertainty about one or more hidden variables. While partially
observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural model for such
problems, reward functions that directly penalize uncertainty in the agent's
belief can remove the piecewise-linear and convex property of the value
function required by most POMDP planners. Furthermore, as the number of sensors
available to the agent grows, the computational cost of POMDP planning grows
exponentially with it, making POMDP planning infeasible with traditional
methods. In this article, we address a twofold challenge of modeling and
planning for active perception tasks. We show the mathematical equivalence of
$\rho$POMDP and POMDP-IR, two frameworks for modeling active perception tasks,
that restore the PWLC property of the value function. To efficiently plan for
active perception tasks, we identify and exploit the independence properties of
POMDP-IR to reduce the computational cost of solving POMDP-IR (and
$\rho$POMDP). We propose greedy point-based value iteration (PBVI), a new POMDP
planning method that uses greedy maximization to greatly improve scalability in
the action space of an active perception POMDP. Furthermore, we show that,
under certain conditions, including submodularity, the value function computed
using greedy PBVI is guaranteed to have bounded error with respect to the
optimal value function. We establish the conditions under which the value
function of an active perception POMDP is guaranteed to be submodular. Finally,
we present a detailed empirical analysis on a dataset collected from a
multi-camera tracking system employed in a shopping mall. Our method achieves
similar performance to existing methods but at a fraction of the computational
cost leading to better scalability for solving active perception tasks.

length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA
genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a

the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we
have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length,

classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes
spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In
certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well

classification. We also observed that the fourth most frequent nucleotide
sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case
of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We
expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the

properties and in a second step to find a processing path to reach one of these

learning approach for the optimization of processing paths. The goal is to find
optimal processing paths in the material structure space that lead to
target-structures, which have been identified beforehand to result in desired
material properties. There exists a target set containing one or multiple
different structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a
start structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths
to one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the
algorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best
reachable target structure and the optimal path to it. The proposed methods
belong to the family of model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms. They
are guided by structure representations as features of the process state and by
a reward signal, which is formulated based on a distance function in the
structure space. Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms learn through
trial and error while interacting with the process. Thereby, they are not
restricted to information from a priori sampled processing data and are able to
adapt to the specific process. The optimization itself is model-free and does
not require any prior knowledge about the process itself. We instantiate and
evaluate the proposed methods by optimizing paths of a generic metal forming
process. We show the ability of both methods to find processing paths leading
close to target structures and the ability of the extended method to identify
target-structures that can be reached effectively and efficiently and to focus
on these targets for sample efficient processing path optimization.

In this paper, we analyze a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
mmWave communication system for enhancing the network reliability and
connectivity in the presence of random blockages. To enhance the robustness of
hybrid analog-digital beamforming in the presence of random blockages, we
formulate a stochastic optimization problem based on the minimization of the
sum outage probability. To tackle the proposed optimization problem, we
introduce a low-complexity algorithm based on the stochastic block gradient
descent method, which learns sensible blockage patterns without searching for
all combinations of potentially blocked links. Numerical results confirm the
performance benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of outage probability
and effective data rate.

defocus spread effect (DSE) around the focus/defocus boundary (FDB). In this
paper,we propose a network termed MFIF-GAN to attenuate the DSE by generating
focus maps in which the foreground region are correctly larger than the
corresponding objects. The Squeeze and Excitation Residual module is employed
in the network. By combining the prior knowledge of training condition, this
network is trained on a synthetic dataset based on an {\alpha}-matte model. In
addition, the reconstruction and gradient regularization terms are combined in
the loss functions to enhance the boundary details and improve the quality of
fused images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MFIF-GAN outperforms
several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in visual perception, quantitative

strategy in which a machine guides a human supervisor toward selecting
informative examples for a classifier. The guidance is provided by means of
global explanations, which summarize the classifier's behavior on different
regions of the instance space and expose its flaws. Compared to other
explanatory interactive learning strategies, which are machine-initiated and
rely on local explanations, XGL is designed to be robust against cases in which
the explanations supplied by the machine oversell the classifier's quality.
Moreover, XGL leverages global explanations to open up the black-box of
human-initiated interaction, enabling supervisors to select informative
examples that challenge the learned model. By drawing a link to interactive
machine teaching, we show theoretically that global explanations are a viable
approach for guiding supervisors. Our simulations show that explanatory guided
learning avoids overselling the model's quality and performs comparably or
better than machine- and human-initiated interactive learning strategies in
terms of model quality.

compact models. Recently, channel pruning has become one of the predominant
compression methods to deploy deep models on resource-constrained devices. Most
channel pruning methods often use a fixed compression rate for all the layers
of the model, which, however, may not be optimal. To address this issue, given
a target compression rate for the whole model, one can search for the optimal
compression rate for each layer. Nevertheless, these methods perform channel
pruning for a specific target compression rate. When we consider multiple
compression rates, they have to repeat the channel pruning process multiple
times, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. To address this issue, we
propose a Conditional Automated Channel Pruning(CACP) method to obtain the
compressed models with different compression rates through single channel
pruning process. To this end, we develop a conditional model that takes an
arbitrary compression rate as input and outputs the corresponding compressed
model. In the experiments, the resultant models with different compression
rates consistently outperform the models compressed by existing methods with a
channel pruning process for each target compression rate.

these might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a
variety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for
COVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a
3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the
network, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network
input, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN
with these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on
our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of
742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously
published 2D CNN. An ablation study demonstrated that in addition to using a 3D
CNN instead of a 2D CNN transfer learning contributed the most and continuous

the switch, NetReduce customizes the transport protocol only on the first
packet in a data message to comply with RoCE v2. The special status monitoring

with packet loss. A message-level credit-based flow control algorithm is also
proposed to fully utilize bandwidth and avoid buffer overflow. We study the
effects of intra bandwidth on the training performance in multi-machines

target translation text with a single decoder. It benefits the model training
so that additional large parallel text corpus can be fully exploited to enhance
the speech translation training. Our method is verified on three mainstream

gaseous planets and explore how various common model assumptions such as
different equations of state, opacities, and heavy-element distributions affect
the inferred radius and metallicity. We examine how the theoretical
uncertainties translate into uncertainties in the inferred planetary radius and
bulk metallicity.
  While we confirm the mass-metallicity trend previously reported in the
literature, this correlation disappears when removing a 20 $M_{\oplus}$
heavy-element core from all the planets. We also show that using an updated
hydrogen-helium equation of state leads to more compact planets. As a result,
we present six planets that should be classified as inflated warm Jupiters. We
next demonstrate that including the opacity-enhancement due to metal-rich
envelopes of irradiated planets changes the planetary radius significantly,
which can have large effects on the inferred metallicity.
  Even though there are other model assumptions that have not been considered
in this work, we could show that the calculated theoretical uncertainties can
already be comparable or even larger than the observational ones. Therefore,
theoretical uncertainties are likely to be even larger. We therefore conclude
that progress in theoretical models of giant planets is essential in order to
take full advantage of current and future exoplanetary data.

correlations typical of entangled bipartite quantum systems, Wood and Spekkens
argue that any causal model purporting to explain these correlations must be
fine tuned; that is, it must violate the assumption of faithfulness. The
faithfulness assumption is a principle of parsimony, and the intuition behind
it is basic and compelling: when no statistical correlation exists between the
occurrences of a pair of events, we have no reason for supposing there to be a
causal connection between them. This paper is an attempt to undermine the
reasonableness of the assumption of faithfulness in the quantum context.
Employing a symmetry relation between an entangled bipartite quantum system and
a `sideways' quantum system consisting of a single photon passing sequentially
through two polarisers, I argue that Wood and Spekkens' analysis applies
equally to this sideways system. If this is correct, then the consequence
endorsed by Wood and Spekkens for an ordinary entangled quantum system amounts
to a rejection of a causal explanation in the sideways, single photon system,
too. Unless rejecting this causal explanation can be sufficiently justified,
then it looks as though the sideways system is fine tuned, and so a violation
of faithfulness in the ordinary entangled system may be more tolerable than
first thought. Thus extending the classical `no fine-tuning' principle of
parsimony to the quantum realm may well be too hasty.

vorticity, of magnetic field fluctuations and of the different components of
the magnetic Poynting flux responsible for the transport of vertical or

diffusion produces a strong reduction of vorticity in the upper chromospheric
layers and that it dissipates the vortical perturbations converting them into
thermal energy. The Hall effect acts in the opposite way, strongly enhancing
the vorticity. When the Hall effect is included, the magnetic field in the
simulations becomes, on average, more vertical and long-lived flux tube-like
structures are produced. We trace a single magnetic structure to study its

geometric, topological, or analytical category, and an algebraic category. For
example, in smooth differential geometry, Gelfand duality refers to the
topological embedding of a smooth manifold in the topological dual of its
algebra of smooth functions. This is generalised here in two directions. First,
the topological embeddings for manifolds are generalised to the cases of real
analytic and Stein manifolds, using a unified cohomological argument. Second,
this type of duality is extended to vector bundles, affine bundles, and jet
bundles by using suitable classes of functions, the topological duals in which
the embeddings take their values.

variability in the target language, and cannot be inferred from the source
sentence alone. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model this one-to-many
mapping by conditioning the decoder of a NMT model on a latent variable that
represents the domain of target sentences. The domain is a discrete variable
generated by a target encoder that is jointly trained with the NMT model. The
predicted domain of target sentences are given as input to the decoder during
training. At inference, we can generate diverse translations by decoding with
different domains. Unlike our strongest baseline (Shen et al., 2019), our
method can scale to any number of domains without affecting the performance or
the training time. We assess the quality and diversity of translations
generated by our model with several metrics, on three different datasets.

study the Sun as well. The Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched on 22 July 2019,

in-flight observations, so far, have shown that its spectral performance has
been identical to that on the ground. Measurements of the effective area from
ground calibration were found to require some refinement, which has been
carried out using solar observations at different incident angles. It also has
been shown that the XSM is sensitive enough to detect solar activity well below
A-class. This makes the investigations of microflares and the quiet solar
corona feasible in addition to the study of the evolution of physical

(ISM), near-infrared observations have revealed the presence of sub-micron
sized dust grains covered by several layers of H\textsubscript{2}O-dominated
ices and dirtied by the presence of other volatile species. Whether a molecule
is in the gas or solid-phase depends on its binding energy (BE) on ice
surfaces. Thus, BEs are crucial parameters for the astrochemical models that
aim to reproduce the observed evolution of the ISM chemistry. In general, BEs
can be inferred either from experimental techniques or by theoretical
computations. In this work, we present a reliable computational methodology to
evaluate the BEs of a large set (21) of astrochemical relevant species. We
considered different periodic surface models of both crystalline and amorphous
nature to mimic the interstellar water ice mantles. Both models ensure that
hydrogen bond cooperativity is fully taken into account at variance with the
small ice cluster models. Density functional theory adopting both B3LYP-D3 and
M06-2X functionals was used to predict the species/ice structure and their BE.
As expected from the complexity of the ice surfaces, we found that each
molecule can experience multiple BE values, which depend on its structure and
position at the ice surface. A comparison of our computed data with literature
data shows agreement in some cases and (large) differences in others. We
discuss some astrophysical implications that show the importance of calculating
BEs using more realistic interstellar ice surfaces to have reliable values for
inclusion in the astrochemical models.

notion of structural diversity. We show that diversity is an underlying theme
of three principles of network evolution: the preferential attachment model,
connectivity and link prediction. We show that in all three cases, a dominant
trend towards shrinking diversity is apparent, both theoretically and
empirically. In previous work, many kinds of different data have been modeled
as networks: social structure, navigational structure, transport

static structures, but instead dynamic systems that change continuously. Thus,
an important question concerns the trends observable in these networks and
their interpretation in terms of existing network models. We show in this
article that most numerical network characteristics follow statistically
significant trends going either up or down, and that these trends can be
predicted by considering the notion of diversity. Our work extends previous
work observing a shrinking network diameter to measures such as the clustering
coefficient, power-law exponent and random walk return probability, and
justifies preferential attachment models and link prediction algorithms. We
evaluate our hypothesis experimentally using a diverse collection of

ancillary data at other wavelengths, to study the morphology of the MHONGOOSE
sample galaxy, ESO 302-G014, which is a nearby gas-rich dwarf galaxy. We find
that ESO 302-G014 has a lopsided, asymmetric outer disc with a low column
density. In addition, we find a tail or filament of HI clouds extending away
from the galaxy, as well as an isolated HI cloud some 20 kpc to the south of
the galaxy. We suggest that these features indicate a minor interaction with a
low-mass galaxy. Optical imaging shows a possible dwarf galaxy near the tail,
but based on the current data, we cannot confirm any association with ESO
302-G014. Nonetheless, an interaction scenario with some kind of low-mass
companion is still supported by the presence of a significant amount of
molecular gas, which is almost equal to the stellar mass, and a number of
prominent stellar clusters, which suggest recently triggered star formation.
These data show that MeerKAT produces exquisite imaging data. The forthcoming
full-depth survey observations of ESO 302-G014 and other sample galaxies will,
therefore, offer insights into the fate of neutral gas as it moves from the
intergalactic medium onto galaxies.

inconclusive. Aims. We aim to study the time evolution of the SiO maser lines
in Mira-type and semi-regular variables at short timescales. We also discuss
the origin of the observed fast variations. Methods. We observed the SiO maser
lines at 7 mm (28SiO v=1,2 J=1-0) and 3 mm (28SiO v=1 J=2-1) using the 40 m
Yebes antenna and the 30 m IRAM telescope, respectively, with a minimum spacing
of 1 day. We studied the semi-regular variables RX Boo and RT Vir and the
Mira-type variables U Her, R LMi, R Leo, and $\chi$ Cyg. We performed a
detailed statistical analysis of the variations on different timescales.
Results. RX Boo shows strong and fast variations in the intensity of the
different spectral features of the SiO lines at 7 mm and 3 mm. On a timescale
of one day, we find variations of >10% in 25% of the cases. Variations of
greater than $\sim$50% are often found when the observations are separated by 2
or 3 days. A similar variation rate of the SiO lines at 7 mm is found for RT
Vir, but the observations of this object are less complete. On the contrary,
the variations of the SiO maser line intensity in the Mira-type variables are
moderate, with typical variation rates around <10% in 7 days. This phenomenon
can be explained by the presence of particularly small maser-emitting clumps in
semi-regular variables, which would lead to a strong dependence of the
intensity on the density variations due to the passage of shocks.

around a time-independent conserved quantity that explains the probable orbits'
clustering in parameter space, known as the polar corridor. The Copernican
principle does not imply that unstable motion does not exist in the solar

Centaurs originating in the planetesimal disc are able to return to it in the
time-backward simulation. Our conclusions are supported by published
independent research that shows conventional disc relaxation models do not
explain the abundance of high inclination Centaurs and that enrichment from the

Invariant (RCI) set, along with an invariance-inducing control law, for Linear
Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems. As the real-time measurements of the
scheduling parameters are typically available, in the presented formulation, we
allow the RCI set description along with the invariance-inducing controller to
be scheduling parameter dependent. The considered formulation thus leads to
parameter-dependent conditions for the set invariance, which are replaced by
sufficient Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions via Polya's relaxation.
These LMI conditions are then combined with a novel volume maximization
approach in a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem, which aims at computing
the desirably large RCI set. In addition to ensuring invariance, it is also
possible to guarantee performance within the RCI set by imposing a chosen
quadratic performance level as an additional constraint in the SDP problem. The
reported numerical example shows that the presented iterative algorithm can
generate invariant sets which are larger than the maximal RCI sets computed
without exploiting scheduling parameter information.

based on reinforcement learning? We demonstrate how (1)~traditional supervised
learning together with (2)~a simulator-free adversarial learning method can be
used to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.
First, we introduce a simple dialogue action decoder to predict the appropriate
actions. Then, the traditional multi-label classification solution for dialogue
policy learning is extended by adding dense layers to improve the dialogue
agent performance. Finally, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax estimator to
alternatively train the dialogue agent and the dialogue reward model without
using reinforcement learning. Based on our extensive experimentation, we can
conclude the proposed methods can achieve more stable and higher performance
with fewer efforts, such as the domain knowledge required to design a user

main goal is not to beat reinforcement learning with supervised learning, but
to demonstrate the value of rethinking the role of reinforcement learning and

The shear wave energy is supposed to dissipate nearly instantaneously. This
statement originates from the difficulty to access static shear stress in
macroscopic liquids. In this paper, we take a different approach. We focus on
the stability of the thermal equilibrium while the liquid (glycerol) is
submitted to a sudden shear strain at sub-millimetre scale. A thermal response
of the deformed liquid is unveiled. The liquid exhibits simultaneous and
opposite bands of about +0.04 {\deg}C and -0.04 {\deg}C temperature variations.
The sudden thermal changes exclude the possibility of heat transfer and
highlight the ability of the liquid to store the shear energy in non-uniform
thermodynamic states. The thermal effects depend nearly linearly on the
amplitude of the deformation supporting the hypothesis of a shear wave
propagation (elastic correlations) extending up to several hundreds microns.
This new physical effect can be explained in terms of the underlying phonon
physics of confined liquids, which unveils a hidden solid-like response with
many similarities to glassy systems.

flaring state of blazar TXS 0506+056 in 2017, the mechanisms leading to
astrophysical particle acceleration and neutrino production are still
uncertain. Recent studies found that when transparent to $\gamma$-rays,
$\gamma$-flaring blazars do not have the opacity for protons to produce
neutrinos. Here we present observational evidence for an alternative
explanation, in which $\gamma$-ray emission is suppressed during efficient
neutrino production. A large proton and target photon density help produce
neutrinos while temporarily suppress the observable $\gamma$-emission due to a
large $\gamma \gamma$ opacity. We show that the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-flux of
blazar PKS 1502+106 was at a local minimum when IceCube recorded the coincident
high-energy neutrino IC-190730A. Using data from the OVRO 40-meter Telescope,
we find that radio emission from PKS 1502+106 at the time period of the
coincident neutrino IC-190730A was in a high state, in contrast to earlier time
periods when radio and $\gamma$ fluxes are correlated for both low and high
states. This points to an active outflow that is $\gamma$-suppressed at the
time of neutrino production. We find similar local $\gamma$-suppression in
other blazars, including in MAGIC's TeV flux of TXS\,0506+056 and Fermi-LAT's
flux of blazar PKS B1424-418 at the time of coincident IceCube neutrino

Cloud market revenue growth was selected as an indicator of cloud market

stakeholder of our experiments. Three machine learning models were selected:
linear regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. These
models were compared with a time series prediction model. We found that the set

scientific experiment, with first observations dating back to Galileo and the
invention of the telescope around 1610. Today the sunspot number (SN) time
series acts as a benchmark of solar activity in a large range of physical
models. An appropriate statistical modelling, adapted to the time series'
complex nature, is however still lacking. In this work, we provide the first
comprehensive uncertainty quantification analysis of sunspot counts. Our
interest lies in the following three components: the number of spots ($N_s$),
the number of sunspot groups ($N_g$), and the composite $N_c$, defined as
$N_c:=N_s+10N_g$. Those are reported by a network of observatories around the
world, and are corrupted by errors of various types. We use a multiplicative
framework to provide, for each of the three components, an estimation of their
error distribution in various regimes (short-term, long-term, minima of solar
activity). We also propose a robust estimator for the underlying solar signal
and fit a density distribution that takes into account intrinsic
characteristics such as over-dispersion, excess of zeros, and multiple modes.
The estimation of the solar signal underlying the composite $N_c$ may be seen
as a robust version of the International Sunspot Number (ISN), a quantity
widely used as a proxy of solar activity. Therefore our results on $N_c$ may
serve to characterize the uncertainty on ISN as well. Our results paves the way
for a future monitoring of the observatories in quasi-real time, with the aim
to alert the observers when they start deviating from the network and prevent
large drifts from occurring in the network.

Furthermore, we probe the relation between the minimal timescale and the break

internal structure, as well as on the structure of the effective Lagrangian
describing their underlying field theory. One of the cleanest observable of
such kind is the electric dipole moment (EDM), since Standard Model estimates
would imply very small, much less then 10^-30 ecm value for that quantity,
whereas several Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories happen to predict of the
order of 10^-28 ecm EDM for elementary or hadronic particles. So far, precision
EDM upper bounds are mainly available for neutrons via cold neutron
experiments, and indirect measurements for electrons. Therefore, in the recent
year there has been a growing interest for direct measurement of EDM for
charged particles, such as electrons, protons, muons or light nuclei. Such
measurements become possible in relativistic storage rings, called frozen spin
storage rings. Many environmental factors give systematic backgrounds to the
EDM signal, including General Relativity (GR), due to the gravitational field
of the Earth. It turns out that, depending of the experimental scenario, the GR
effect can be well above the planned EDM sensitivity. Therefore, it is both of
concern as a source of systematics, as well as it can serve as a spin-off
experiment for an independent test of GR. There are a handful of theoretical
papers quantifying the GR systematics, delivering slightly different results.
The aim of this paper is to clarify these claims, eventually try to reconcile
these predictions, and to deduce their experimental implications. The closing
section of the paper quantifies the field imperfection systematic error
cancellation in the case of a so-called doubly-frozen spin storage ring
setting, in the idealized axial symmetric limit.

observational evidence of such variation. We report that, one feature of a
varying GWs speed is that the energy spectrum of GWs will present
resonantly-enhanced peaks if the GWs speed oscillates in time at high-energy
scales. Such oscillatory behaviour arises in a wide class of modified gravity
theories. The amplitude of these peaks can be at reach by current and
forthcoming GWs instruments, hence making the underlying theories falsifiable.
This mechanism reveals that probing the variation of GWs speed can be a
promising way to search for new physics beyond general relativity.

to predict ambient conditions; together with other control variables, they
served as the input features for a second stage modelling where an multivariate
ML model (XGBoost) was deployed. The models were trained with real world data
from building sensor network measurements, and used to predict future
temperature trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the modelling approach and control algorithm, and reveal the promising

density for a pulsation mode in the presence of stochastic noise is always well
approximated by a Lorentzian function. While in stars predominantly
stochastically driven the width of the Lorentzian is defined by the mode
lifetime, in stars where the driving is predominately coherent the width is
defined by the amplitude of the stochastic perturbations. In stars where both
drivings are comparable, the width is defined by both these parameters and is
smaller than that expected from pure stochastic driving. We illustrate our
model through numerical simulations and propose a well defined classification
of stars into predominantly stochastic (solar-like) and predominately coherent
(classic) pulsators. We apply the model to the study of the Mira variable U
Per, and the semiregular variable L2 Pup and, following our classification,
conclude that they are both classical pulsators. Our model provides a natural

galaxies is an important step for our understanding of cosmic reionization.
Although the z - 0.3-0.4 LyC emitters found recently show strong optical
emission lines, no consistent quantitative photoionization model taking into
account the escape of ionizing photons and inhomogenous interstellar medium
(ISM) geometry of these galaxies has yet been constructed. We hence construct
one- and two-zone photoionization models accounting for the observed LyC
escape, which we compare to the observed emission line measurements. We find
that one-zone density-bounded photoionization models cannot reproduce the
emission lines of the LyC leakers because they systematically underpredict the
lines of species of low ionization potential, as [OI] and [SII]. Introducing a
two-zone model, with differing ionization parameter and a variable covering
fraction and where one of the zones is density-bounded, we show that the
observed emission line ratios and escape fractions of the LyC emitters are well
reproduced. The [OI] excess, which is observed in some LyC leakers, can be
naturally explained in this model, e.g., by emission from low-ionization and
low-filling-factor gas. LyC emitters with a high escape fraction (fesc > 38%)
are deficient both in [OI]6300A and in [SII]6716,6731A. We also confirm that a
[SII] deficiency can be used to select LyC emitter candidates. Finally, we find
indications for a possible dichotomy in terms of escape mechanisms for LyC
photons between galaxies with relatively low (fesc < 10%) and higher escape
fractions. We conclude that two-zone photoionization models are sufficient and
required to explain the observed emission line properties of z - 0.3-0.4 LyC
emitters. These models provide a first step towards the use of optical emission
lines and their ratios as quantitative diagnostics of LyC escape from galaxies.

query execution plans. Selectivity estimates are known to be a crucial input to
the cost model. In practice, standard selectivity estimation procedures are
prone to large errors. This is mostly because they rely on the so-called
attribute value independence and join uniformity assumptions. Therefore,
multidimensional methods have been proposed to capture dependencies between two
or more attributes both within and across relations. However, these methods
require a large computational cost which makes them unusable in practice. We
propose a method based on Bayesian networks that is able to capture
cross-relation attribute value dependencies with little overhead. Our proposal
is based on the assumption that dependencies between attributes are preserved
when joins are involved. Furthermore, we introduce a parameter for trading
between estimation accuracy and computational cost. We validate our work by
comparing it with other relevant methods on a large workload derived from the
JOB and TPC-DS benchmarks. Our results show that our method is an order of

focus on securing a single legitimate link, or communications between a UAV and

secrecy analysis for hierarchical multi-UAV networks is underexplored. In this
paper, we investigate a general two-tier UAV network consisting of multiple UAV

UAV eavesdroppers (UEs). To protect all legitimate UT-UR links against UEs at

formulate the secure transmission problem into a many-to-one matching game
followed by an overlapping coalition formation (OCF) game, taking into account
the limited capabilities and the throughput requirements of URs, as well as the
transmission power constraints of UTs. A matching algorithm and an OCF

quantum mechanics: the consistent description of multiple nested observers.
Recently, a variation of Wigner's gedankenexperiment, introduced by Frauchiger
and Renner, has lead to new debates about the self-consistency of quantum
mechanics. At the core of the paradox lies the description of an observer and
the object it measures as a closed system obeying the Schr\""odinger equation.
We revisit this assumption to derive a necessary condition on a quantum system
to behave as an observer. We then propose a simple single-photon
interferometric setup implementing Frauchiger and Renner's scenario, and use
the derived condition to shed a new light on the assumptions leading to their
paradox. From our description, we argue that the three apparently incompatible
properties used to question the consistency of quantum mechanics correspond to
two logically distinct contexts: either one assumes that Wigner has full
control over his friends' lab, or conversely that some parts of the labs remain
unaffected by Wigner's subsequent measurements. The first context may be seen
as the quantum erasure of the memory of Wigner's friend. We further show these
properties are associated with observables which do not commute, and therefore
cannot take well-defined values simultaneously. Consequently, the three
contradictory properties never hold simultaneously.

such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker recognition. A basic
goal is to remove silent segments within an audio, while a more general VAD
system could remove all the irrelevant segments such as noise and even unwanted
speech from non-target speakers. We define the task, which only detects the
speech from the target speaker, as speaker-dependent voice activity detection
(SDVAD). This task is quite common in real applications and usually implemented
by performing speaker verification (SV) on audio segments extracted from VAD.
In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network based approach to
address this problem, which explicitly takes the speaker identity into the
modeling process. Moreover, inference can be performed in an online fashion,
which leads to low system latency. Experiments are carried out on a
conversational telephone dataset generated from the Switchboard corpus. Results
show that our proposed online approach achieves significantly better
performance than the usual VAD/SV system in terms of both frame accuracy and
F-score. We also used our previously proposed segment-level metric for a more
comprehensive analysis.

spectral energy distribution (SED) has been known to exhibit negligible
infrared excess at $\lambda \lesssim$10~$\mu$m due to the disk's cavity
structure. Analyses of the observed visibilities of dust continuum at 1.3~mm
and the SED indicate that the size of the cavity in the disk of large
(millimeter size) dust grains is 8~au in radius and that in the disk of small
(sub-micron size) dust grains is 60~au in radius. Furthermore, from the SED

$\lesssim$0.01~\% of the total (small~$+$~large) dust mass at $r<$60~au. These

dust grains efficiently grow with less efficient fragmentation in this region,
potentially due to weak turbulence and/or stickier dust grains. The balance of
grain growth and dust fragmentation is an important factor for determining the

rhythms (circadian rhythms). The frequency of these rhythms is more or less
similar across people, but its phase is different. In the chronobiology
literature, based on the propensity to sleep at different hours of the day,
people are categorized into morning-type, evening-type, and intermediate-type
groups called \textit{chronotypes}. This typology is typically based on
carefully designed questionnaires or manually crafted features drawing on data
on timings of people's activity. Here we develop a fully data-driven
(unsupervised) method to decompose individual temporal activity patterns into
components. This has the advantage of not including any predetermined
assumptions about sleep and activity hours, but the results are fully
context-dependent and determined by the most prominent features of the activity
data. Using a year-long dataset from mobile phone screen usage logs of 400
people, we find four emergent temporal components: morning activity, night
activity, evening activity and activity at noon. Individual behavior can be
reduced to weights on these four components. We do not observe any clear
emergent categories of people based on the weights, but individuals are rather
placed on a continuous spectrum according to the timings of their activities.
High loads on morning and night components highly correlate with going to bed
and waking up times. Our work points towards a data-driven way of categorizing
people based on their full daily and weekly rhythms of activity and behavior,
rather than focusing mainly on the timing of their sleeping periods.

Its novelty lies in two aspects: 1) the elliptic coordinates are used to

deduced from inter-agent distances, and 2) the regulation of the tracking
vehicle system obeys a binocular coordination principle, which simplifies the
design of the control law by leveraging rich physical meanings of elliptic

exponentially convergent when the target is stationary. When the target drifts

This threatens the user's privacy, since for many applications these templates
are expected to be solely used for recognition purposes. Knowing the encoded
information in face templates helps to develop bias-mitigating and
privacy-preserving face recognition technologies. This work aims to support the
development of these two branches by analysing face templates regarding 113
attributes. Experiments were conducted on two publicly available face
embeddings. For evaluating the predictability of the attributes, we trained a
massive attribute classifier that is additionally able to accurately state its

non-permanent attributes, such as age, hairstyles, haircolors, beards, and

enhance the model ability or reduce the model size. The corresponding ablation
experiments with the real data are also provided. Meanwhile, several
pre-trained models for the Chinese and English recognition are released,
including a text detector (97K images are used), a direction classifier (600K

effective in computing feasible and optimal plans for repetitive robotic tasks.
However, it is difficult to model the true dynamics of the real world before
execution, especially for tasks requiring interactions with objects whose
parameters are unknown. A recent planning approach, CMAX, tackles this problem
by adapting the planner online during execution to bias the resulting plans
away from inaccurately modeled regions. CMAX, while being provably guaranteed
to reach the goal, requires strong assumptions on the accuracy of the model
used for planning and fails to improve the quality of the solution over
repetitions of the same task. In this paper we propose CMAX++, an approach that
leverages real-world experience to improve the quality of resulting plans over
successive repetitions of a robotic task. CMAX++ achieves this by integrating
model-free learning using acquired experience with model-based planning using
the potentially inaccurate model. We provide provable guarantees on the
completeness and asymptotic convergence of CMAX++ to the optimal path cost as
the number of repetitions increases. CMAX++ is also shown to outperform
baselines in simulated robotic tasks including 3D mobile robot navigation where
the track friction is incorrectly modeled, and a 7D pick-and-place task where
the mass of the object is unknown leading to discrepancy between true and

misbehavior can lead to catastrophes, there is a growing interest in certifying
the equivalence of two structurally similar neural networks. For example,
compression techniques are often used in practice for deploying trained neural
networks on computationally- and energy-constrained devices, which raises the
question of how faithfully the compressed network mimics the original network.
Unfortunately, existing methods either focus on verifying a single network or
rely on loose approximations to prove the equivalence of two networks. Due to
overly conservative approximation, differential verification lacks scalability
in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. To overcome these problems,
we propose NeuroDiff, a symbolic and fine-grained approximation technique that
drastically increases the accuracy of differential verification while achieving
many orders-of-magnitude speedup. NeuroDiff has two key contributions. The
first one is new convex approximations that more accurately bound the
difference neurons of two networks under all possible inputs. The second one is
judicious use of symbolic variables to represent neurons whose difference
bounds have accumulated significant error. We also find that these two
techniques are complementary, i.e., when combined, the benefit is greater than
the sum of their individual benefits. We have evaluated NeuroDiff on a variety
of differential verification tasks. Our results show that NeuroDiff is up to
1000X faster and 5X more accurate than the state-of-the-art tool.

provide personalized suggestions to users, industry players embrace machine
learning, more specifically, building predictive models based on the click
behavior data. This is known as the Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which
has become the gold standard for building personalized recommendation service.
However, we argue that there is a significant gap between clicks and user
satisfaction -- it is common that a user is ""cheated"" to click an item by the
attractive title/cover of the item. This will severely hurt user's trust on the
system if the user finds the actual content of the clicked item disappointing.
What's even worse, optimizing CTR models on such flawed data will result in the
Matthew Effect, making the seemingly attractive but actually low-quality items
be more frequently recommended.
  In this paper, we formulate the recommendation models as a causal graph that
reflects the cause-effect factors in recommendation, and address the clickbait
issue by performing counterfactual inference on the causal graph. We imagine a
counterfactual world where each item has only exposure features (i.e., the
features that the user can see before making a click decision). By estimating
the click likelihood of a user in the counterfactual world, we are able to
reduce the direct effect of exposure features and eliminate the clickbait
issue. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the post-click satisfaction of CTR models.

contracts initially having a bouncing-like behavior, and accordingly after it
bounces off, it decelerates following a matter dominated like evolution and at
very large positive times it undergoes through an accelerating stage. Our aim
is to study such evolution in the context of $F(R)$ gravity theory, and
confront quantitatively the model with the recent observations. Using several
reconstruction techniques, we analytically obtain the form of $F(R)$ gravity in
two extreme stages of the universe, particularly near the bounce and at the
late time era respectively. With such analytic results and in addition by
employing appropriate boundary conditions, we numerically solve the $F(R)$
gravitational equation to determine the form of the $F(R)$ for a wide range of
values of the cosmic time. The numerically solved $F(R)$ gravity realizes an
unification of certain cosmological epochs of the universe, in particular, from
a non-singular bounce to a matter dominated epoch and from the matter dominated
to a late time dark energy epoch. Correspondingly, the Hubble parameter and the
effective equation of state parameter of the Universe are found and several
qualitative features of the model are discussed. The Hubble radius goes to zero
asymptotically in both sides of the bounce, which leads to the generation of
the primordial curvature perturbation modes near the bouncing point.
Correspondingly, we calculate the scalar and tensor perturbations power spectra
near the bouncing point, and accordingly we determine the observable quantities
like the spectral index of the scalar curvature perturbations, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, and as a result, we directly confront the present model
with the latest Planck observations. Furthermore the $F(R)$ gravity dark energy
epoch is confronted with the Sne-Ia+BAO+H(z)+CMB data.

spectrum well fitted by a power-law function ($S\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$), with
spectral index $\alpha=0.45\pm0.05$ for NGC 6992 and $\alpha=0.49\pm0.01$ for
the southern shell and without any indication of a spectral break. The spectra
are significantly flatter than the whole Cygnus Loop spectrum
($\alpha=0.54\pm0.01$), suggesting a departure from the plain shock
acceleration mechanisms, which for NGC 6992 could be related to the ongoing
transition towards a radiative shock. We model the integrated spectrum of the
whole SNR considering the evolution of the maximum energy and magnetic field
amplification. Through the radio spectral parameters, we infer a magnetic field
at the shock of 10 $\mu$G. This value is compatible with a pure adiabatic
compression of the interstellar magnetic field, suggesting that the
amplification process is currently inefficient.

the circumgalactic medium at large impact parameters from luminous galaxies.
Their origin and nature remains unclear. We hypothesize that undetected,
satellite dwarf galaxies are responsible for producing some of these weak MgII
absorbers. We test our hypothesis using gas dynamical simulations of galactic
outflows from a dwarf satellite galaxy with a halo mass of $5\times10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$, which could form in a larger $L^{*}$ halo at z=2, to study the gas
interaction in the halo. We find that thin, filamentary, weak MgII absorbers
are produced in two stages: 1) when shocked core collapse supernova (SNII)
enriched gas descending in a galactic fountain gets shock compressed by upward
flows driven by subsequent SNIIs and cools (phase 1), and later, 2) during an
outflow driven by Type Ia supernovae that shocks and sweeps up pervasive SNII
enriched gas, which then cools (phase 2). The width of the filaments and
fragments are $\lesssim~100$ pc, and the smallest ones cannot be resolved at
12.8 pc resolution. The MgII absorbers in our simulations are continuously
generated for >150 Myr by shocks and cooling, though each cloud survives for
only ~60 Myr. Their metallicity is 10-20% solar metallicity and column density
is $<10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. They are also surrounded by larger (0.5-1 kpc) CIV
absorbers that seem to survive longer. In addition, larger-scale (>1 kpc) CIV
and OVI clouds are produced in both expanding and shocked SNII enriched gas
which is photoionized by the UV metagalactic radiation at intermediate
redshift. Our simulation highlights the possibility of dwarf galactic outflows
producing highly enriched multiphase gas.

various methods. It reveals that the effect of interaction between dark matter

Recently, many different methods for adjusting for confounders have been
proposed, and we show that these existing methods disagree with one another on
two datasets inspired by previous social media studies. Evaluating causal
methods is challenging, as ground truth counterfactuals are almost never
available. Presently, no empirical evaluation framework for causal methods
using text exists, and as such, practitioners must select their methods without
guidance. We contribute the first such framework, which consists of five tasks
drawn from real world studies. Our framework enables the evaluation of any
casual inference method using text. Across 648 experiments and two datasets, we
evaluate every commonly used causal inference method and identify their
strengths and weaknesses to inform social media researchers seeking to use such
methods, and guide future improvements. We make all tasks, data, and models

disks are sometimes accompanied by similar substructures seen in molecular line
emission. One example is the outer gap at 100 au in AS 209, which shows that
the H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and C$_{18}$O emission intensities decrease along with the
continuum in the gap, while the DCO$^+$ emission increases inside the gap.
  We aim to study the behavior of DCO$^+$/H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$
ratios in protoplanetary disk gaps assuming the two scenarios: the gas
depletion follows the dust depletion and only the dust is depleted.
  We first modeled the physical disk structure using the thermo-chemical model
ANDES. This 1+1D steady-state disk model calculates the thermal balance of gas
and dust and includes the FUV, X-rays, cosmic rays, and other ionization
sources together with the reduced chemical network for molecular coolants.
Afterward, this physical structure was adopted for calculations of molecular
abundances with the extended gas-grain chemical network with deuterium
fractionation. Ideal synthetic spectra and 0th-moment maps were produced with
LIME.
  We are able to qualitatively reproduce the increase in the DCO$^+$ intensity
and the decrease in the H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and C$_{18}$O intensities inside the
disk gap, which is qualitatively similar to what is observed in the outer AS
209 gap. The corresponding disk model assumes that both the gas and dust are
depleted in the gap. The model with the gas-rich gap, where only the dust is
depleted, produces emission that is too bright in all HCO$^+$ isotopologues and
C$_{18}$O.
  The DCO$^+$/H$_{13}$CO$^+$ line ratio can be used to probe gas depletion in
dust continuum gaps outside of the CO snow line. The DCO$^+$/C$_{18}$O line
ratio shows a similar, albeit weaker, effect; however, these species can be
observed simultaneously with a single ALMA or NOEMA setup.

constant for any specific point in orbital phase, the projected distance can be
calculated rapidly and accurately in the vicinity of the transit by expanding
the planet's $x$ and $y$ positions in the sky plane into a Taylor series at
mid-transit. Calculating the projected distance for an elliptical orbit using
the four first time derivatives of the position vector (velocity, acceleration,
jerk, and snap) is $\sim100$ times faster than calculating it using the
Newton's method, and also significantly faster than calculating $z$ for a
circular orbit because the approach does not use numerically expensive
trigonometric functions. The speed gain in the projected distance calculation
leads to 2-25 times faster transit model evaluation speed, depending on the
transit model complexity and orbital eccentricity. Calculation of the four

this formalism have appeared in the physics literature, particularly in the
work of Bogoliubov-Shirkov, Steinmann, Ruelle, and Epstein-Glaser-Stora. In
this paper, we give a fully explicit account in terms of modern theory

decorated with local observables, into the Wick algebra of microcausal
polynomial observables. The operator-valued distributions called (generalized)
time-ordered products and (generalized) retarded products are obtained as
images of fundamental elements of this Hopf monoid under the curried

universal series, and the property of causal factorization is naturally
expressed in terms of the action of the Hopf monoid on itself by Hopf powers,
called the Tits product. Given a system of fully renormalized time-ordered

Focusing on the Giant Component (GC) formation process over many time-windows,

this phenomenon are indicative of emerging globalization in the applicants'
collaborations. The timeline appears to be divided into three regimes,
corresponding to three states of the network's evolution. In the early years
state, the GC takes long to form and the instant of its creation is easily
pinpointed, while it features geographically segregated groups of applicants
with technologically similar activities. In contrast, in the late years state,
the GC forms quickly, the exact point of its creation is harder to spot, the
applicants' activities are more disparate technologically, while their
inter-regional collaborations are significantly increased. The middle years are
an intermediate state between the two extreme of early and late years.
Moreover, we concluded that the critical patents, which induce the GC's
formation, are typically introduced by large-sized applicants and also that top
patent-producing applicants are likely to submit critical patents, albeit at a
lower rate than their overall patent submission. Lastly, we uncovered the
crucial role that Japan plays in the network's coherence, through its prominent

because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes'
attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk
associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in
some networks than in others. Various optimization algorithms have been
proposed to anonymize the network while keeping the number of changes minimal.
However, existing algorithms do not provide guarantees on where the changes
will be made, making it difficult to quantify their effect on various measures.
Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks
is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes'
neighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of
average degree values, either almost all nodes are re-identifiable or they are
all safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a
small number of network statistics which are available even before the data is
collected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree
is above 10. Guided by these results we propose a simple method based on edge
sampling to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. Our method can be
implemented already at the data collection phase. Its effect on various network
measures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory. These properties

abatement of pressure perturbations is realized. In the near-adiabatic HBL, the
wavepacket remains trapped within the boundary layer and attenuates outside the
region of linear instability. However, wavepackets in the cooled-wall HBLs
amplify and display nonlinear distortion, and transition more rapidly. The
structure of the wavepacket displays different behavior; moderately-cooled
walls show bifurcation into a leading turbulent head region and a trailing
harmonic region, while highly-cooled wall cases display lower convection speeds
and significant wavepacket elongation, with intermittent spurts of turbulence
in the wake of the head region. This elongation effect is associated with a
weakening of the lateral jet mechanism due to the breakdown of spanwise
coherent structures. In moderately cooled-walls, the spatially-localized wall
loading is due to coherent structures in the leading turbulent head region. In
highly-cooled walls, the elongated near-wall streaks in the wake region of the
wavepacket result in more than twice as large levels of skin friction and heat
transfer over a sustained period of time.

differentiation is presented as an efficient way for solving 2D density-based
topology optimization problem by calculating gradients through the fully
differentiable finite element solver. The optimization framework with the
differentiable physics solver is proposed and tested on several classical
topology optimization examples. The differentiable solver is implemented in
Julia programming language and can be automatically differentiated in reverse
mode to provide the pullback functions of every single operation. The entire
end-to-end gradient information can be then backed up by utilizing chain rule.
This framework incorporates a generator built from convolutional layers with a
set of learnable parameters to propose new designs for every iteration. Since
the whole process is differentiable, the parameters of the generator can be
updated using any optimization algorithm given the gradient information from
automatic differentiation. The proposed optimization framework is demonstrated
on designing a half MBB beam and compared to the results with the ones from the
efficient 88-line code. By only changing the objective function and the
boundary conditions, it can run an optimization for designing a compliant
mechanism, e.g. a force inverter where the output displacement is in the
opposite direction of the input.

We show limitations of static learner due to fixed context at a point of time

bandits, this algorithm maps the reward as a function of context vector but
uses an array of learners to capture variation between actions/arms. We develop
a bandit algorithm using an array of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

the prediction errors, but also on the predicted variation errors which is
important in glucose prediction. Moreover, it makes possible to adjust the
weighting of the different areas in the error space to better focus on
dangerous regions. In order to use the loss function in practice, we propose an
algorithm that progressively improves the clinical acceptability of the model,
so that we can achieve the best tradeoff possible between accuracy and given

having type-1 patients and the other type-2 patients. The results show that
using the gcMSE loss function, instead of a standard MSE loss function,
improves the clinical acceptability of the models. In particular, the
improvements are significant in the hypoglycemia region. We also show that this

accuracy of the model. Finally, we show that this tradeoff between accuracy and

because the sample complexity of training data is insufficient to generalize

from the lack of data is to use ensemble methods. However, adversarial training
multiple networks is extremely expensive. Moreover, we found that there is a
dilemma on choosing target model to generate adversarial examples. Optimizing
attack to the members of ensemble will be suboptimal attack to the ensemble and
incurs covariate shift, while attack to ensemble will weaken the members and
lose the benefit from ensembling. In this paper, we propose adversarial
training with Stochastic weight average (SWA); while performing adversarial
training, we aggregate the temporal weight states in the trajectory of
training. By adopting SWA, the benefit of ensemble can be gained without
tremendous computational increment and without facing the dilemma. Moreover, we
further improved SWA to be adequate to adversarial training. The empirical

increase or decrease the intensity of the electromagnetic flux radiation

is analyzed in detail as a typical example, but the theory can be applied to
all other low--dimensional piezoelectrics. Similar to three--dimensional
piezoelectrics with negative piezoelectric responses, the anomalous negative
piezoelectricity in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ results from its negative clamped--ion term,
which cannot be compensated by the positive internal strain part. Here, we
propose a more general rule that having a negative clamped--ion term should be
universal among piezoelectric materials, which is attributed to the ""lag of
Wannier center"" effect. The internal--strain term, which is the change in
polarization due to structural relaxation in response to strain, is mostly
determined by the spatial structure and chemical bonding of the material. In a
low--dimensional piezoelectric material as CuInP$_2$S$_6$, the internal--strain
term is approximately zero. This is because the internal structure of the
molecular layers, which are bonded by the weak van der Waals interaction,
responds little to the strain. As a result, the magnitude of the dipole, which
depends strongly on the dimension and structure of the molecular layer, also
has a small response with respect to strain. An equation bridging the internal
strain responses in low--dimensional and three--dimensional piezoelectrics is
also derived to analytically express this point. This work aims to deepen our
understanding about this anomalous piezoelectric effect, especially in
low--dimensional materials, and provide strategies for discovering materials
with novel electromechanical properties.

strategies are employed to produce smooth service composition resulting in a
mosaic of relevant images indexed by geolocation and time. The preliminary
analytical results prove the feasibility of the proposed composition model.

  Learning",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The recent advances in Gravitational-wave astronomy have greatly accelerated
the study of Multimessenger astrophysics. There is a need for the development
of fast and efficient algorithms to detect non-astrophysical transients and
noises due to the rate and scale at which the data is being provided by LIGO
and other gravitational wave observatories. These transients and noises can
interfere with the study of gravitational waves and binary mergers and induce
false positives. Here, we propose the use of deep learning algorithms to detect
and classify these transient signals. Traditional statistical methods are not
well designed for dealing with temporal signals but supervised deep learning
techniques such as RNN-LSTM and deep CNN have proven to be effective for
solving problems such as time-series forecasting and time-series
classification. We also use unsupervised models such as Total variation,
Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Wavelet decomposition or
Random Forests for feature extraction and noise reduction and then study the
results obtained by RNN-LSTM and deep CNN for classifying the transients in
low-SNR signals. We compare the results obtained by the combination of various
unsupervised models and supervised models. This method can be extended to
real-time detection of transients and merger signals using deep-learning
optimized GPU's for early prediction and study of various astronomical events.
We will also explore and compare other machine learning models such as MLP,
Stacked Autoencoder, Random forests, extreme learning machine, Support Vector
machine and logistic regression classifier.

occurring in the system and, therefore, deterministic mechanical systems cannot
be described within the framework of the thermodynamic approach. In this paper,
we show that thermodynamics (or, more precisely, a thermodynamically-like
description) can be constructed even for deterministic Hamiltonian systems, for
example, systems with only one degree of freedom. We show that for such systems
it is possible to introduce analogs of thermal energy, temperature, entropy,
Helmholtz free energy, etc., which are related to each other by the usual
thermodynamic relations. For the considered Hamiltonian systems, the first and
second laws of thermodynamics are rigorously derived, which have the same form
as in ordinary (molecular) thermodynamics. It is shown that for Hamiltonian
systems it is possible to introduce the concepts of a thermodynamic state, a
thermodynamic process, and thermodynamic cycles, in particular, the Carnot
cycle, which are described by the same relations as their usual thermodynamic
analogs.

for the proof relies on the explicit formula for the conservation laws with the
discontinuous flux and finer properties of the characteristics curves.

vacations since they have vast amount of choices available. Selecting when and
where to go from this large-scale options is getting harder. In addition,
sometimes consumers can miss the better options due to the wealth of
information to be found on the online reservation systems. In this sense,
personalized services such as recommender systems play a crucial role in
decision making. Two traditional recommendation techniques are content-based
and collaborative filtering. While both methods have their advantages, they
also have certain disadvantages, some of which can be solved by combining both
techniques to improve the quality of the recommendation. The resulting system
is known as a hybrid recommender system. This paper presents a new hybrid hotel

However, many
tracking systems struggle to perform in real-time due to the high computational
cost of detecting people, especially in ultra high resolution images. We
propose a new algorithm called \emph{PartiMax} that greatly reduces this cost
by applying the person detector only to the relevant parts of the image.
PartiMax exploits information in the particle filter to select $k$ of the $n$
candidate \emph{pixel boxes} in the image. We prove that PartiMax is guaranteed
to make a near-optimal selection with error bounds that are independent of the
problem size. Furthermore, empirical results on a real-life dataset show that
our system runs in real-time by processing only 10\% of the pixel boxes in the
image while still retaining 80\% of the original tracking performance achieved
when processing all pixel boxes.

Master's thesis",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Intelligence has looked into biological systems as a source of
inspiration. Although there are many aspects of the brain yet to be discovered,
neuroscience has found evidence that the connections between neurons
continuously grow and reshape as a part of the learning process. This differs
from the design of Artificial Neural Networks, that achieve learning by
evolving the weights in the synapses between them and their topology stays
unaltered through time.
  This project has explored rules for growing the connections between the
neurons in Spiking Neural Networks as a learning mechanism. These rules have
been implemented on a multi-agent system for creating simple logic functions,
that establish a base for building up more complex systems and architectures.
Results in a simulation environment showed that for a given set of parameters
it is possible to reach topologies that reproduce the tested functions.
  This project also opens the door to the usage of techniques like genetic
algorithms for obtaining the best suited values for the model parameters, and
hence creating neural networks that can adapt to different functions.

through sharp bends on a silicon chip has been recently reported over a
relatively narrow bandwidth. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of
topological terahertz planar air-channel metallic waveguides which can be
integrated into an on-chip interconnect. Our platform can be fabricated by a
simple, cost-effective technique combining 3D-printing and gold-sputtering. The
relative size of the measured topological bandgap is ~12.5%, which entails
significant improvement over all-silicon terahertz topological waveguides
