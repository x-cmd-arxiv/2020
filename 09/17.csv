measure the mass of the most distant blindly-selected sample of galaxy clusters
on which a lensing measurement has been performed to date. In CMB data from the
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Planck satellite, we detect the
stacked lensing effect from 677 near-infrared-selected galaxy clusters from the
Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS), which have a mean
redshift of $ \langle z \rangle = 1.08$. There are no current optical weak
lensing measurements of clusters that match the distance and average mass of
this sample. We detect the lensing signal with a significance of $4.2 \sigma$.
We model the signal with a halo model framework to find the mean mass of the
population from which these clusters are drawn. Assuming that the clusters
follow Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles, we infer a mean mass of $\langle
M_{500c}\rangle = \left(1.7 \pm 0.4 \right)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We
consider systematic uncertainties from cluster redshift errors, centering
errors, and the shape of the NFW profile. These are all smaller than 30% of our
reported uncertainty. This work highlights the potential of CMB lensing to
enable cosmological constraints from the abundance of distant clusters
populating ever larger volumes of the observable Universe, beyond the
capabilities of optical weak lensing measurements.

findings. However, there is no established standard how to assess replication
success and in practice many different approaches are used. The purpose of this
paper is to refine and extend a recently proposed reverse-Bayes approach for
the analysis of replication studies. We show how this method is directly
related to the relative effect size, the ratio of the replication to the
original effect estimate. This perspective leads to a new proposal to
recalibrate the assessment of replication success, the golden level. The
recalibration ensures that for borderline significant original studies
replication success can only be achieved if the replication effect estimate is
larger than the original one. Conditional power for replication success can
then take any desired value if the original study is significant and the
replication sample size is large enough. Compared to the standard approach to
require statistical significance of both the original and replication study,
replication success at the golden level offers uniform gains in project power
and controls the Type-I error rate if the replication sample size is not
smaller than the original one. An application to data from four large
replication projects shows that the new approach leads to more appropriate
inferences, as it penalizes shrinkage of the replication estimate compared to
the original one, while ensuring that both effect estimates are sufficiently
convincing on their own.

from Pan-STARRS1, UHS, and unWISE photometric data. Gemini/GNIRS spectroscopy
follow-up indicates a MgII-based black hole mass of
$M_\mathrm{BH}=\left(2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}\right)\times10^9~M_\odot$ and an
Eddington ratio of $L_\mathrm{bol}/L_\mathrm{Edd}=0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, in line
with actively accreting supermassive black hole (SMBH) at $z\gtrsim6$. HST
imaging sets strong constraint on lens-boosting, showing no relevant effect on
the apparent emission. The quasar is also observed as a pure point-source with
no additional emission component. The broad line region (BLR) emission is
intrinsically weak and not likely caused by an intervening absorber. We found
rest-frame equivalent widths of EW(Ly$\alpha$+NV) $=5.7\pm0.7$ Angstrom,
EW(CIV) $\leq5.8$ Angstrom (3-sigma upper limit), and EW(MgII) $=8.7\pm0.7$
Angstrom. A small proximity zone size ($R_\mathrm{p}=1.2\pm0.4$ pMpc) indicates
a lifetime of only $t_\mathrm{Q}=10^{3.4\pm0.7}$ years from the last quasar
phase ignition. ALMA shows extended [CII] emission with a mild velocity
gradient. The inferred far-infrared luminosity
($L_\mathrm{FIR}=(1.2\pm0.1)\times10^{13}\,L_\odot$) is one of the highest
among all known quasar hosts at $z\gtrsim6$. Dust and [CII] emissions put a
constraint on the star formation rate of SFR
$=900-4900~M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, similar to that of hyper-luminous
infrared galaxy. Considering the observed quasar lifetime and BLR formation
timescale, the weak-line profile in the quasar spectrum is most likely caused
by a BLR which is not yet fully formed rather than continuum boosting by
gravitational lensing or a soft continuum due to super-Eddington accretion.

which turns out to be a hybrid of the standard saddle-point method, and the
Donsker-Varadhan formalism which treats rare events of atypical averages over a
long time. It provides a detailed description of the statistics of histories
leading to the rare event. The framework applies to rare events in a broad
class of systems driven by non-Gaussian noise. Secondly, applying this
framework to the population-dynamics model, we find a novel phase transition in
its extinction behavior. Strikingly, a patch which is a sink (where individuals
die more than are born), can nonetheless reduce the probability of extinction,

algorithm for computing the Fr\'echet distance between two $c$-packed polygonal

  In this paper we consider the problem of computing the smallest $c$ for which
a given polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is $c$-packed. We present two
approximation algorithms. The first algorithm is a $2$-approximation algorithm
and runs in $O(dn^2 \log n)$ time. In the case $d=2$ we develop a faster
algorithm that returns a $(6+\varepsilon)$-approximation and runs in
$O((n/\varepsilon^3)^{4/3} polylog (n/\varepsilon)))$ time.

packedness-value for 16 sets of real-world trajectories. The experiments
indicate that the notion of $c$-packedness is a useful realistic input model

highly dependent on the cavity size, since their participation ratio scales

  Submitted for publication",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Situations involving cooperative behaviour are widespread among animals and
humans alike. Game theory and evolutionary dynamics have provided the
theoretical and computational grounds to understand what are the mechanisms
that allow for such cooperation. Studies in this area usually take into
consideration different behavioural strategies and investigate how they can be
fixed in the population under evolving rules. However, how those strategies
emerged from basic evolutionary mechanisms continues to be not fully
understood. To address this issue, here we study the emergence of cooperative
strategies through a model of heuristics selection based on evolutionary
algorithms. In the proposed model, agents interact with other players according
to a heuristic specified by their genetic code and reproduce -- at a longer
time scale -- proportionally to their fitness. We show that the system can
evolve to cooperative regimes for low mutation rates through heuristics
selection while increasing the mutation decreases the level of cooperation. Our
analysis of possible strategies shows that reciprocity and punishment are the
main ingredients for cooperation to emerge, being conditional cooperation the
more frequent strategy. Additionally, we show that if in addition to
behavioural rules, genetic relatedness is included, then kinship plays a
relevant role. Our results illustrate that our evolutionary heuristics model is
a generic and powerful tool to study the evolution of cooperative behaviour.

that has resolved to keep future infections low in anticipation of a vaccine.
The society can vary its amount of potentially-infection-spreading activity
over time, within a certain feasible range. Because the activity has social or
economic value, the society aims to maximize activity overall subject to
infection rate constraints. We find that consistent policies are the worst
possible in terms of activity, while the best policies alternate between high
and low activity. In a variant involving multiple subpopulations, we find that
the best policies are maximally coordinated (maintaining similar prevalence
among subpopulations) but oscillatory (having growth rates that vary in time).
It turns out that linearized SEIR is mathematically equivalent to an idealized
racecar model (with different subpopulations corresponding to different cars)
and the amount of fuel used corresponds to the amount of activity. Using this
analogy, steady V-shaped formations (in which one subpopulation ""leads the way""
with consistently higher prevalence and activity, while others follow behind
with lower prevalence and activity) are especially problematic. These
formations are very effective at minimizing fuel use, hence very ineffective at
boosting activity. In an appendix, we obtain analogous results for alternative
notions of activity, which incorporate crowding effects.

molecular cores, and could lead to a bimodal formation of rotationally
supported discs (RSDs) in the first core phase. However, how such Hall
dominated systems evolve in the protostellar accretion phase remains unclear.
We carry out 2D axisymmetric simulations including Hall effect and Ohmic
dissipation, with realistic magnetic diffusivities computed from our
equilibrium chemical network. We find that Hall effect only becomes efficient
when the large population of very small grains (VSGs: $\lesssim$10 nm) is
removed from the standard MRN size distribution. With such an enhanced Hall
effect, however, the bimodality of disc formation does not continue into the
main accretion phase. The outer part of the initial $\sim$40 AU disc formed in
the anti-aligned configuration (${\bf \Omega \cdot B}<0$) flattens into a thin
rotationally supported Hall current sheet as Hall effect moves the poloidal
magnetic field radially inward relative to matter, leaving only the inner
$\lesssim$10--20 AU RSD. In the aligned configuration (${\bf \Omega \cdot
B}>0$), disc formation is suppressed initially but a counter-rotating disc
forms subsequently due to efficient azimuthal Hall drift. The counter-rotating
disc first grows to $\sim$30 AU as Hall effect moves the magnetic field
radially outward, but only the inner $\lesssim$10 AU RSD is long-lived like in
the anti-aligned case. Besides removing VSGs, cosmic ray ionization rate should
be below a few 10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ for Hall effect to be efficient in disc
formation. We conclude that Hall effect produces small $\lesssim$10--20 AU
discs regardless of the polarity of the magnetic field, and that radially
outward diffusion of magnetic fields remains crucial for disc formation and
growth.

classification, where multiple labels can be active in an instance
simultaneously (e.g. in image tagging, multiple tags can be active in any
image). In particular, the F-measure explicitly balances recall (fraction of
active labels predicted to be active) and precision (fraction of labels
predicted to be active that are actually so), both of which are important in
evaluating the overall performance of a multi-label classifier. As with most
discrete prediction problems, however, directly optimizing the F-measure is
computationally hard. In this paper, we explore the question of designing
convex surrogate losses that are calibrated for the F-measure -- specifically,
that have the property that minimizing the surrogate loss yields (in the limit
of sufficient data) a Bayes optimal multi-label classifier for the F-measure.
We show that the F-measure for an $s$-label problem, when viewed as a $2^s
\times 2^s$ loss matrix, has rank at most $s^2+1$, and apply a result of
Ramaswamy et al. (2014) to design a family of convex calibrated surrogates for
the F-measure. The resulting surrogate risk minimization algorithms can be
viewed as decomposing the multi-label F-measure learning problem into $s^2+1$
binary class probability estimation problems. We also provide a quantitative
regret transfer bound for our surrogates, which allows any regret guarantees
for the binary problems to be transferred to regret guarantees for the overall
F-measure problem, and discuss a connection with the algorithm of Dembczynski

simplicity and wide applicability of linear regression, attention is almost
always quickly directed to the algorithmic or computational side of linear
regression. In particular, the underlying mathematics of stochastic linear
regression itself as an entity usually gets either a peripheral treatment or a
relatively in-depth but ad hoc treatment depending on the type of concerned
problems; in other words, compared to the extensiveness of the study of
mathematical properties of the ""derivatives"" of stochastic linear regression

regression itself seems to have not yet received a due intrinsic treatment.
Apart from the conceptual importance, a consequence of an insufficient or

mixture of experts, where the predictions of multiple domain expert classifiers

agnostic representation space. Inspired by this, we investigate how such
methods can be effectively applied to large pretrained transformer models. We
find that domain adversarial training has an effect on the learned
representations of these models while having little effect on their
performance, suggesting that large transformer-based models are already
relatively robust across domains. Additionally, we show that mixture of experts

demonstrate that the predictions of large pretrained transformer based domain

IllustrisTNG project, as well as the EAGLE simulation to show that observable
properties of CGM gas correlate with azimuthal angle, defined as the
galiocentric angle with respect to the central galaxy. Both simulations are in
remarkable agreement in predicting a strong modulation of flow rate direction
with azimuthal angle: inflow is more substantial along the galaxy major axis,
while outflow is strongest along the minor axis. The absolute rates are
noticeably larger for higher (log(M_* / M_sun) ~ 10.5) stellar mass galaxies,
up to an order of magnitude compared to M^dot < 1 M_sun/yr/sr for log(M_* /
M_sun) ~ 9.5 objects. Notwithstanding the different numerical and physical
models, both TNG50 and EAGLE predict that the average metallicity of the CGM is
higher along the minor versus major axes of galaxies. The angular signal is
robust across a wide range of galaxy stellar mass 8.5 < log(M_* / M_sun) < 10.5
at z<1. This azimuthal dependence is particularly clear at larger impact
parameters b > 100 kpc. Our results present a global picture whereby, despite
the numerous mixing processes, there is a clear angular dependence of the CGM
metallicity. We make forecasts for future large survey programs that will be
able to compare against these expectations. Indeed, characterising the
kinematics, spatial distribution and metal content of CGM gas is key to a full
understanding of the exchange of mass, metals, and energy between galaxies and

important applications of computing, such as embedded sensor systems, can
tolerate errors that are bounded in their distribution of deviation from
correctness (distortion). We present a channel adaptation technique which
modulates properties of I/O channels typical in embedded sensor systems, to
provide a tradeoff between I/O power dissipation and distortion of communicated

integer distortion accounting for the distribution of transmitted values. Using
this formulation we implement our value-deviation-bounded (VDB) channel

dissipation on a hardware prototype integrated with the required programmable
channel modulation circuitry. We augment these experimental measurements with
an analysis of the distributions of distortions. We show that our probabilistic

modern CMB polarisation experiments to rely on new technologies, necessary for

experimental design unavoidably introduces new instrumental and systematic
effects, which may impact performance of the new instruments. In this work we
extend the standard data analysis pipeline by including a (parametric) model of
instrumental effects directly in the data model. We then correct for them in
the analysis, accounting for the additional uncertainty in the final results.
We embed these techniques within a general, end-to-end formalism for estimating
the impact of the instrument and foreground models on constraints on the
amplitude of the primordial B-mode signal. We focus on the parametric component
separation approach which we generalize to allow for simultaneous estimation of
instrumental and foreground parameters.
  We demonstrate the framework by studying the effects induced by an achromatic
half-wave plate (HWP), which lead to a frequency-dependent variation of the
instrument polarisation angle, and experimental bandpasses which define
observational frequency bands. We assume a typical Stage-3 CMB polarisation
experiment, and show that maps recovered from raw data collected at each
frequency band will unavoidably be linear mixtures of the Q and U Stokes
parameters. We then derive a new generalized data model appropriate for such
cases, and extend the component separation approach to account for it. We find
that some of the instrumental parameters, in particularly those describing the

averting the magnetic braking ""catastrophe"" and promoting protostellar disc
formation. However, the magnetic diffusivities that determine the efficiency of
non-ideal MHD effects are highly sensitive to microphysics. We carry out
non-ideal MHD simulations to explore the role of microphysics on disc formation
and the interplay between ambipolar diffusion (AD) and Hall effect during the
protostellar collapse. We find that removing the smallest grain population
($\lesssim$10 nm) from the standard MRN size distribution is sufficient for
enabling disc formation. Further varying the grain sizes can result in either a
Hall-dominated or an AD-dominated collapse; both form discs of tens of AU in
size regardless of the magnetic field polarity. The direction of disc rotation
is bimodal in the Hall dominated collapse but unimodal in the AD-dominated
collapse. We also find that AD and Hall effect can operate either with or
against each other in both radial and azimuthal directions, yet the combined
effect of AD and Hall is to move the magnetic field radially outward relative
to the infalling envelope matter. In addition, microphysics and magnetic field
polarity can leave profound imprints both on observables (e.g., outflow
morphology, disc to stellar mass ratio) and on the magnetic field
characteristics of protoplanetary discs. Including Hall effect relaxes the
requirements on microphysics for disc formation, so that prestellar cores with
cosmic-ray ionization rate of $\lesssim$2--3$\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ can still
form small discs of $\lesssim$10 AU radius. We conclude that disc formation
should be relatively common for typical prestellar core conditions, and that
microphysics in the protostellar envelope is essential to not only disc
formation, but also protoplanetary disc evolution.

thereof. This, by itself, is an ill-posed problem, as the high-frequency
information is missing in the low-resolution input and needs to be
hallucinated, based on prior knowledge about the image content. Rather than
relying on a generic face prior, in this paper, we explore the use of a set of
exemplars, i.e. other high-resolution images of the same person. These guide
the neural network as we condition the output on them. Multiple exemplars work
better than a single one. To combine the information from multiple exemplars
effectively, we introduce a pixel-wise weight generation module. Besides
standard face super-resolution, our method allows to perform subtle face
editing simply by replacing the exemplars with another set with different
facial features. A user study is conducted and shows the super-resolved images
can hardly be distinguished from real images on the CelebA dataset. A
qualitative comparison indicates our model outperforms methods proposed in the
literature on the CelebA and WebFace dataset.

Please cite the EPJ version",,,,"cs.SI cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Body measurements, including weight and height, are key indicators of health.
Being able to visually assess body measurements reliably is a step towards
increased awareness of overweight and obesity and is thus important for public
health. Nevertheless it is currently not well understood how accurately humans
can assess weight and height from images, and when and how they fail. To bridge
this gap, we start from 1,682 images of persons collected from the Web, each
annotated with the true weight and height, and ask crowd workers to estimate
the weight and height for each image. We conduct a faceted analysis taking into
account characteristics of the images as well as the crowd workers assessing
the images, revealing several novel findings: (1) Even after aggregation, the
crowd's accuracy is overall low. (2) We find strong evidence of contraction
bias toward a reference value, such that the weight (height) of light (short)
people is overestimated, whereas that of heavy (tall) people is underestimated.
(3) We estimate workers' individual reference values using a Bayesian model,
finding that reference values strongly correlate with workers' own height and
weight, indicating that workers are better at estimating people similar to
themselves. (4) The weight of tall people is underestimated more than that of
short people; yet, knowing the height decreases the weight error only mildly.
(5) Accuracy is higher on images of females than of males, but female and male
workers are no different in terms of accuracy. (6) Crowd workers improve over
time if given feedback on previous guesses. Finally, we explore various bias
correction models for improving the crowd's accuracy, but find that this only
leads to modest gains. Overall, this work provides important insights on biases
in body measurement estimation as obesity related conditions are on the rise.

blockchain to provide a tamper-resistance platform for log storage.
Additionally, we propose a hierarchical structure to address blockchains'

Ethereum and IBM Blockchain. We show that the solution is scalable and perform
the analysis of the cost of ownership to help a reader select an implementation
that would address their needs.
  The Logchain's scalability improvement on a blockchain is achieved without
any alteration of blockchains' fundamental architecture. As shown in this work,
it can function on private and public blockchains and, therefore, can be a
suitable alternative for organizations that need a secure, immutable log

implies that both pebbles and pebble fragments are strongly affected by the
convective gas motion and will be transported by large-scale convection cells

scheme for evolving the characteristic size of the pebbles, taking into account
the effects of erosion, mass transfer and fragmentation. Including the
downwards motion of convective cells for the transport of pebbles with an
initial radius of 1 millimeter, we find pebble sizes between 100 microns and 1
millimeter near the surface of the protoplanet. These sizes are generally
amenable to accretion at the base of the convection flow. Small protoplanets
far from the star (>30 AU) nevertheless erode their pebbles to sizes below 10
microns; future hydrodynamical simulations will be needed to determine whether
such small fragments can detach from the convection flow and become accreted by

optimal policy for any given Markov Decision Problem (MDP). The basic idea in
PI is to begin with some initial policy and to repeatedly update the policy to
one from an improving set, until an optimal policy is reached. Different
variants of PI result from the (switching) rule used for improvement. An
important theoretical question is how many iterations a specified PI variant
will take to terminate as a function of the number of states $n$ and the number
of actions $k$ in the input MDP. While there has been considerable progress
towards upper-bounding this number, there are fewer results on lower bounds. In
particular, existing lower bounds primarily focus on the special case of $k =
2$ actions. We devise lower bounds for $k \geq 3$. Our main result is that a
particular variant of PI can take $\Omega(k^{n/2})$ iterations to terminate. We
also generalise existing constructions on $2$-action MDPs to scale lower bounds
by a factor of $k$ for some common deterministic variants of PI, and by

description of this method, known as isothermal Jeans modelling, and then test
it with a large ensemble of haloes taken from cosmological simulations. Our
simulations were run with cold and collisionless dark matter (CDM) as well as
two different SIDM models, all with dark matter only variants as well as
versions including baryons and relevant galaxy formation physics. Using a mix
of different box sizes and resolutions, we study haloes with masses ranging
from 3e10 to 3e15 Msun. Overall, we find that the isothermal Jeans model
provides as accurate a description of simulated SIDM density profiles as the
Navarro-Frenk-White profile does of CDM halos. We can use the model
predictions, compared with the simulated density profiles, to determine the
input DM-DM scattering cross-sections used to run the simulations. This works
especially well for large cross-sections, while with CDM our results tend to
favour non-zero (albeit fairly small) cross-sections, driven by a bias against
small cross-sections inherent to our adopted method of sampling the model
parameter space. The model works across the whole halo mass range we study,
although including baryons leads to DM profiles of intermediate-mass (10^12 -
10^13 Msun) haloes that do not depend strongly on the SIDM cross-section. The
tightest constraints will therefore come from lower and higher mass haloes:
dwarf galaxies and galaxy clusters.

diagram, we find that the planet has an orbital period of $8.3\,{\rm d}$ and is
slightly smaller than Jupiter ($R_{\rm p} = 0.77^{+0.09}_{-0.07} \,R_{\rm
Jup}$). From radial velocity monitoring, we limit $M_{\rm p}\sin i$ to less
than 1.20 $M_{\rm Jup}$ (3-$\sigma$). The transits either graze or nearly graze
the stellar limb. Grazing transits are a cause for concern, as they are often
indicative of astrophysical false positive scenarios. Our follow-up data show
that such scenarios are unlikely. Our combined multi-color photometry,
high-resolution imaging, and radial velocities rule out hierarchical eclipsing
binary scenarios. Background eclipsing binary scenarios, though limited by
speckle imaging, remain a 0.2% possibility. TOI 837b is therefore a validated
adolescent exoplanet. The planetary nature of the system can be confirmed or
refuted through observations of the stellar obliquity and the planetary mass.
Such observations may also improve our understanding of how the physical and
orbital properties of exoplanets change in time.

understanding their origin presents a major challenge. Previous X-ray studies
demonstrated that the bulk of UDGs lack substantial X-ray emission, implying
that they reside in low-mass dark matter halos. This result, in concert with
other observational and theoretical studies, pointed out that most UDGs belong
to the class of dwarf galaxies. However, a subset of UDGs is believed to host a
large population of globular clusters (GCs), which is indicative of massive
dark matter halos. This, in turn, hints that some UDGs may be failed
$L_{\star}$ galaxies. In this work, I present Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations of two archetypal UDGs, Dragonfly 44 and DF X1, and I constrain
their dark matter halo mass based on the X-ray emission originating from hot
gaseous emission and from the population of low-mass X-ray binaries residing in
GCs. Both Dragonfly 44 and DF X1 remain undetected in X-rays. The upper limits
on the X-ray emission exclude the possibility that these galaxies reside in
massive ($M_{\rm vir} \gtrsim 5\times10^{11} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$) dark matter
halos, suggesting that they are not failed $L_{\star}$ galaxies. These results
demonstrate that even these iconic UDGs resemble to dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm

approximation to tidal stretching. We show that the amount of stretching is
proportional to the incident energy, and that it robs the probe of the kinetic

is effectively trapped far down the throat and, through repeated return passes,
scrambles into the ensemble of nearby microstates. We propose that this tidal

non-Gaussianity encoding information on the orbital composition of a galaxy and
the underlying potential. The standard solution for measuring non-Gaussianity
involves constructing a series expansion (e.g. the Gauss-Hermite series) which
can produce regions of negative probability density. This is a significant
issue for the modelling of discrete data with heteroskedastic uncertainties.
Here, we introduce a method to construct positive-definite probability
distributions by the convolution of a given kernel with a Gaussian
distribution. Further convolutions by observational uncertainties are trivial.
The statistics (moments and cumulants) of the resulting distributions are
governed by the kernel distribution. Two kernels (uniform and Laplace) offer
simple drop-in replacements for a Gauss-Hermite series for negative and
positive excess kurtosis distributions with the option of skewness. We
demonstrate the power of our method by an application to real and mock
line-of-sight velocity datasets on dwarf spheroidal galaxies, where kurtosis is
indicative of orbital anisotropy and hence a route to breaking the
mass-anisotropy degeneracy for the identification of cusped versus cored dark
matter profiles. Data on the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy indicate positive
excess kurtosis and hence favour a cored dark matter profile. Although designed
for discrete data, the analytic Fourier transforms of the new models also make
them appropriate for spectral fitting, which could improve the fits of high

determine the stellar populations and star formation histories of 245 barred

morphology-matched comparison sample of unbarred galaxies. At fixed stellar
mass and morphology, barred galaxies are optically redder than their unbarred
counterparts. From stellar population analysis using the full spectral fitting
code Starlight, we attribute this difference to both older and more metal-rich
stellar populations. Dust attenuation however, is lower in the barred sample.
The star formation histories of barred galaxies peak earlier than their
non-barred counterparts, and the galaxies build up their mass at earlier times.
We can detect no significant differences in the local environment of barred and
un-barred galaxies in this sample, but find that the HI gas mass fraction is
significantly lower in high-mass ($\rm{M}_{\star} > 10^{10}~\rm{M}_{\odot}$)
barred galaxies than their non-barred counterparts. We speculate on the
mechanisms that have allowed barred galaxies to be older, more metal-rich and
more gas-poor today, including the efficient redistribution of galactic
fountain byproducts, and a runaway bar formation scenario in gas-poor disks.
While it is not possible to fully determine the effect of the bar on galaxy
quenching, we conclude that the presence of a bar and the early cessation of

radiation pressure and winds) on the evolution of a Giant Molecular Cloud
(GMC), by means of a 3D radiative transfer, hydro-simulation implementing a
complex chemical network featuring ${\rm H}_2$ formation and destruction. We
track the formation of individual stars with mass $M>1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ with a
stochastic recipe. Each star emits radiation according to its spectrum, sampled
with 10 photon bins from near-infrared to extreme ultra-violet bands; winds are
implemented by energy injection in the neighbouring cells. We run a simulation
of a GMC with mass $M=10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$, following the evolution of
different gas phases. Thanks to the simultaneous inclusion of different stellar
feedback mechanisms, we identify two stages in the cloud evolution: (1)
radiation and winds carve ionized, low-density bubbles around massive stars,
while FUV radiation dissociates most ${\rm H}_2$ in the cloud, apart from
dense, self-shielded clumps; (2) rapid star formation (SFR$\simeq 0.1\,{\rm
M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) consumes molecular gas in the dense clumps, so that
UV radiation escapes and ionizes the remaining HI gas in the GMC. ${\rm H}_2$
is exhausted in $1.6$ Myr, yielding a final star formation efficiency of 36 per
cent. The average intensity of FUV and ionizing fields increases almost
steadily with time; by the end of the simulation ($t=2.5$ Myr) we find $\langle
G_0 \rangle \simeq 10^3$ (in Habing units), and a ionization parameter $\langle
U_{\rm ion} \rangle \simeq 10^2$, respectively. The ionization field has also a
more patchy distribution than the FUV one within the GMC. Throughout the

because molecules in the planetary atmosphere such as oxygen and ozone have

manipulation of the Schrodinger equation, we write down simple ""equations of

specify a particular interaction Hamiltonian, we assume only very basic
properties (unitarity, de Sitter invariance and locality) to derive general

deriving constraints from the de Sitter isometries and show that these reduce

enhance the nearest neighbor entanglement and its robustness to the thermal
dissipative decay effect in the completely anisotropic (Ising) system, whereas
all the beyond nearest neighbor entanglements vanish entirely. Applying the
same field to a partially anisotropic (XYZ) system, does not only enhance the
nearest neighbor entanglements and their robustness but also all the beyond

inhomogeneous field exhibits the most influential impact, compared with the

distinguished spin states depending on their positions in the lattice. However,
in the XYZ system, though the anisotropy is lower, the spin states become even

composed within and across multiple modalities based on time-cue co-exist with
the IoT streaming data. In an audiovisual learning example, because consecutive
visual frames usually comprise the same object, this approach provides a unique
way to organize features from the same object together. The same method can
also organize visual object features with the object's spoken-name features
together if the spoken name is presented with the object at about the same
time. This cross-modality feature organization may further help the
organization of visual features that belong to similar objects but acquired at
different location and time. Promising results are achieved through
evaluations.

Schnakenberg reaction-diffusion model in a 2-D domain. Two distinct types of
localized heterogeneities are considered: a strong localized perturbation of a
spatially uniform feed rate and the effect of removing a small hole in the
domain, through which the chemical species can leak out. Our hybrid theory
reveals a wide range of novel phenomena such as, saddle-node bifurcations for
quasi-equilibrium spot patterns that otherwise would not occur for a
homogeneous medium, a new type of spot solution pinned at the concentration
point of the feed rate, spot self-replication behavior leading to the creation
of more than two new spots, and the existence of a creation-annihilation
attractor with at most three spots. Depending on the type of localized
heterogeneity introduced, localized spots are either repelled or attracted
towards the localized defect on asymptotically long time scales. Results for
slow spot dynamics and detailed predictions of various instabilities of
quasi-equilibrium spot patterns, all based on our hybrid asymptotic-numerical
theory, are illustrated and confirmed through extensive full PDE numerical

revealing hidden information invisible to the naked eye. In this paper, we deal
with the problem of separating mixed X-ray images originating from the
radiography of double-sided paintings. Using the visible color images (RGB
images) from each side of the painting, we propose a new Neural Network
architecture, based upon 'connected' auto-encoders, designed to separate the
mixed X-ray image into two simulated X-ray images corresponding to each side.
In this proposed architecture, the convolutional auto encoders extract features
from the RGB images. These features are then used to (1) reproduce both of the
original RGB images, (2) reconstruct the hypothetical separated X-ray images,
and (3) regenerate the mixed X-ray image. The algorithm operates in a totally
self-supervised fashion without requiring a sample set that contains both the
mixed X-ray images and the separated ones. The methodology was tested on images
from the double-sided wing panels of the \textsl{Ghent Altarpiece}, painted in
1432 by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck. These tests show that the
proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art X-ray image separation

generators (DFIGs) for enhanced primary frequency regulation. WTs are urged to
participate on frequency regulation, specially if wind power penetration keeps
increasing. WTs control support is possible, but it is transient due to the WTs
lack of energy storage. This drawback can result in either a further delayed
response from the governors of SGs or further frequency decay when WTs support
is over. The proposed coordination attempt to tackle this issue. An artificial
neural network (ANN) is used to obtain an optimal coordination signal to
improve frequency response. As a proof of concept, the proposed coordination is
tested on a 9-bus test system that includes a wind farm with 5 WTs. Simulation
results show that frequency nadir is reduced in about 22\% and rates of change
of the system frequency (RoCoF) in about 29.5\%. Further work is needed to
validate this concept in large-scale systems, but the development and results
obtained so far are promising to strengthen power systems.

non-negative integer coefficients. In this and the preceding paper we provide
two approaches to investigate linear recurrences with leading coefficient zero,

the uncertainty in position and velocity by formulating the collision
constraints as chance constraints, which describe a set of velocities that
avoid collisions with a specified confidence level. We present two different

assumes a Gaussian noise distribution. Our second method is its extension to
the non-Gaussian case by using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We reformulate
the linear chance constraints into equivalent deterministic constraints, which
are used with an MPC framework to compute a local collision-free trajectory for
each quadrotor. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in simulations on benchmark
scenarios and highlight its benefits over prior methods. We observe that both
the Gaussian and non-Gaussian methods provide improved collision avoidance
performance over the deterministic method. On average, the Gaussian method
requires ~5ms to compute a local collision-free trajectory, while our
non-Gaussian method is computationally more expensive and requires ~9ms on

in the test with the advertiser's goals from testing. Second, by adapting
experimental design to information acquired during the test, it reduces
substantially the cost of experimentation to the advertiser. Since launch in
May 2019, Comparison Lift has been utilized in over 1,500 experiments. We
estimate that utilization of the product has helped increase click-through

that the adaptive design in the product has generated 27% more clicks on
average during testing compared to a fixed sample A/B design. Both suggest
significant value generation and cost savings to advertisers from the product.

form instead of contact discontinuities. In the context of the Whitham
Modulation equations, this paper demonstrate that a loss of genuine
nonlinearity leads to the appearance of a dispersive set of dynamics in the

(RF), following an orientation field (OF), which usually features some
singularities. Additionally at some points, called minutiae, ridge lines end or
fork and this point pattern is usually used for fingerprint identification and
authentication. Whenever the OF features divergent ridge lines (e.g. near
singularities), a nearly constant RF necessitates the generation of more ridge
lines, originating at minutiae. We call these the necessary minutiae. It turns
out that fingerprints feature additional minutiae which occur at rather
arbitrary locations. We call these the random minutiae or, since they may
convey fingerprint individuality beyond the OF, the characteristic minutiae. In
consequence, the minutiae point pattern is assumed to be a realization of the
superposition of two stochastic point processes: a Strauss point process (whose
activity function is given by the divergence field) with an additional hard
core, and a homogeneous Poisson point process, modelling the necessary and the
characteristic minutiae, respectively. We perform Bayesian inference using an
MCMC-based minutiae separating algorithm (MiSeal). In simulations, it provides
good mixing and good estimation of underlying parameters. In application to
fingerprints, we can separate the two minutiae patterns and verify by example
of two different prints with similar OF that characteristic minutiae convey

on how fast the pair potential decays at large distances. In particular, if the
pair potential $v(x-y)$ is of Lennard-Jones type, i.e. it decays as
$C/\|x-y\|^{d+p}$ (with $p>0$) where $\|x-y\|$ is the Euclidean distance
between $x$ and $y$, then the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the
pressure is guaranteed in presence of boundary conditions generated by external
particles which may be distributed with a density increasing with the distance
$r$ from the origin as $\rho(1+ r^q)$, where $\rho$ is any positive constant
(even arbitrarily larger than the density $\rho_0(\beta,\lambda)$ of the system
evaluated with free boundary conditions) and $q\le {1\over 2}\min\{1, p\}$.

analytically for the structural distortion and displacement fields that satisfy
the topological constraints, and which minimize the total energy. The total
energy is described by both the strain energy of each individual distorted
layer, and a Peierls-Nabarro like interfacial contribution arising from
stacking disregistry. The dislocation core emerges naturally within the

approach presented here captures the structure and energetics of twist and
stretch moire superlattices of dislocations with arbitrary direction and
character, without assuming an analytical solution a priori, with no adjustable
parameters, while accounting naturally for dislocation-dislocation image
interactions. In comparisons to atomistic simulations using classical

items, parcels) with different origin and destination pairs travel in one
resource. In recent years, online multi-capacity ridesharing services (i.e.,
where assignments are made online) like Uber-pool, foodpanda, and on-demand
shuttles have become hugely popular in transportation, food delivery, logistics
and other domains. This is because multi-capacity ridesharing services benefit
all parties involved { the customers (due to lower costs), the drivers (due to
higher revenues) and the matching platforms (due to higher revenues per
vehicle/resource). Most importantly these services can also help reduce carbon
emissions (due to fewer vehicles on roads).
  Online multi-capacity ridesharing is extremely challenging as the underlying
matching graph is no longer bipartite (as in the unit-capacity case) but a
tripartite graph with resources (e.g., taxis, cars), requests and request
groups (combinations of requests that can travel together). The desired
matching between resources and request groups is constrained by the edges
between requests and request groups in this tripartite graph (i.e., a request
can be part of at most one request group in the final assignment). While there
have been myopic heuristic approaches employed for solving the online
multi-capacity ridesharing problem, they do not provide any guarantees on the
solution quality. To that end, this paper presents the first approach with
bounds on the competitive ratio for online multi-capacity ridesharing (when
resources rejoin the system at their initial location/depot after serving a
group of requests).

microlensing Einstein radius crossing time distribution ($t_E$). However,
systematics in individual light curves as well as over-simplistic modeling can
lead to biased results. To address this, we developed a model to simultaneously
handle the microlensing parallax due to Earth's motion, systematic instrumental
effects, and unlensed stellar variability with a Gaussian Process model. We
used light curves for nearly 10,000 OGLE-III and IV Milky Way bulge
microlensing events and fit each with our model. We also developed a forward
model approach to infer the timescale distribution by forward modeling from the
data rather than using point estimates from individual events. We find that
modeling the variability in the baseline removes a source of significant bias
in individual events, and previous analyses over-estimated the number of long
timescale ($t_E>100$ days) events due to their over simplistic models ignoring
parallax effects and stellar variability. We use our fits to identify hundreds
of events that are likely black holes.

extension of list coloring on graphs [JGT 19']. In this new setting, each
vertex $v$ in some subset of $V(G)$ has a request for a certain color $r(v)$ in
its list of colors $L(v)$. The goal is to find an $L$ coloring satisfying many,
but not necessarily all, of the requests.
  The main studied question is whether there exists a universal constant
$\epsilon >0$ such that any graph $G$ in some graph class $\mathcal{C}$
satisfies at least $\epsilon$ proportion of the requests. More formally, for $k
> 0$ the goal is to prove that for any graph $G \in \mathcal{C}$ on vertex set
$V$, with any list assignment $L$ of size $k$ for each vertex, and for every $R
\subseteq V$ and a request vector $(r(v): v\in R, ~r(v) \in L(v))$, there
exists an $L$-coloring of $G$ satisfying at least $\epsilon|R|$ requests. If
this is true, then $\mathcal{C}$ is called $\epsilon$-flexible for lists of
size $k$.
  Choi et al. [arXiv 20'] introduced the notion of weak flexibility, where $R =
V$. We further develop this direction by introducing a tool to handle weak
flexibility. We demonstrate this new tool by showing that for every positive
integer $b$ there exists $\epsilon(b)>0$ so that the class of planar graphs
without $K_4, C_5 , C_6 , C_7, B_b$ is weakly $\epsilon(b)$-flexible for lists

book on $n$ vertices, respectively). We also show that the class of planar
graphs without $K_4, C_5 , C_6 , C_7, B_5$ is $\epsilon$-flexible for lists of
size $4$. The results are tight as these graph classes are not even
3-colorable.

quantification, these models are extremely computationally efficient as they do

applications, but they generally suffer from incomplete information in the form
of missing relations between entities. Knowledge graph completion (also known
as relation prediction) is the task of inferring missing facts given existing
ones. Most of the existing work is proposed by maximizing the likelihood of
observed instance-level triples. Not much attention, however, is paid to the
ontological information, such as type information of entities and relations. In
this work, we propose a type-augmented relation prediction (TaRP) method, where
we apply both the type information and instance-level information for relation
prediction. In particular, type information and instance-level information are
encoded as prior probabilities and likelihoods of relations respectively, and
are combined by following Bayes' rule. Our proposed TaRP method achieves
significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four
benchmark datasets: FB15K, FB15K-237, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174. In addition,
we show that TaRP achieves significantly improved data efficiency. More
importantly, the type information extracted from a specific dataset can
generalize well to other datasets through the proposed TaRP model.

increasing the bandwidth from 100 -- 200 MHz to 50 -- 250 MHz, optimising the

$\gamma$-ray sources in the Universe. These objects possess the highest jet
powers and luminosities and have black hole masses often in excess of $10^9$
solar masses. In addition, high-$z$ blazars are important cosmological probes
and serve as test objects for blazar evolution models. Due to their large
distance, their high-energy emission typically peaks below the GeV range, which
makes them difficult to study with Fermi/LAT. Therefore, only the very
brightest objects are detectable and, to date, only a small number of high-z
blazars have been detected with Fermi/LAT. In this work, we studied the monthly
binned long-term $\gamma$-ray emission of a sample of 176 radio and optically
detected blazars that have not been reported as known $\gamma$-ray sources in
the 3FGL catalog. In order to account for false-positive detections, we
calculated monthly Fermi/LAT light curves for a large sample of blank sky
positions and derived the number of random fluctuations that we expect at
various test statistic (TS) levels. For a given blazar, a detection of TS > 9
in at least one month is expected $\sim 15\%$ of the time. Although this rate
is too high to secure detection of an individual source, half of our sample
shows such single-month $\gamma$-ray activity, indicating a population of
high-energy blazars at distances of up to z=5.2. Multiple TS > 9 monthly
detections are unlikely to happen by chance, and we have detected several
individual new sources in this way, including the most distant $\gamma$-ray
blazar, BZQ J1430+4204 (z = 4.72). Finally, two new $\gamma$-ray blazars at
redshifts of z = 3.63 and z = 3.11 are unambiguously detected via very
significant (TS > 25) flares in individual monthly time bins.

markets has been a popular topic in recent years. Many financial variables such

the prediction of an asset's market implied volatility within this context.
This forward-looking measure gauges the sentiment on the future volatility of
an asset, and is deemed one of the most important parameters in the world of
derivatives. The ability to predict this statistic may therefore provide a
competitive edge to practitioners of market making and asset management alike.
Consequently, in this paper we investigate Google News statistics and Wikipedia
site traffic as alternative data sources to quantitative market data and
consider Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and AdaBoost as machine
learning models. We show that movements in market implied volatility can indeed
be predicted through the help of machine learning techniques. Although the
employed alternative data appears to not enhance predictive accuracy, we reveal
preliminary evidence of non-linear relationships between features obtained from
Wikipedia page traffic and movements in market implied volatility.

driving significantly when the driving frequency matches the normal mode

rarely considered because of the difficulty to realize strong coupling between

magnetic system to squeezed light and surprisingly find that the magnons are
maximally excited when the effective driving frequency is several orders of
magnitude larger than the resonant frequency. The generated magnons are
squeezed which brings the advantage of tunable squeezing through an external
magnetic field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such off-resonant
quasi-particle excitation is universal in all the hybrid systems in which the
coherent and parametric interaction of bosons exists and that it is purely a
quantum effect, which is rooted in the quantum fluctuations of particles in the
squeezed vacuum. Our findings may provide an unconventional route to study
off-resonant phenomena and may further benefit the use of hybrid matter-light

understood. It has many contributory factors, driving its outset, duration, and
severity, including land surface, anthropogenic activities, and, most
importantly, meteorological anomalies. Prediction plays a crucial role in
drought preparedness and risk mitigation. However, this is a challenging task
at socio-economically critical lead times (1-2 years), because meteorological
anomalies operate at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Among them,
past studies have shown a correlation between the Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
anomaly and the amount of precipitation in various locations in Africa. In its
Eastern part, the cooling phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and SST
anomaly in the Indian ocean are correlated with the lack of rainfall. Given the
intrinsic shortcomings of correlation coefficients, we investigate the
association among SST modes of variability and the monthly fraction of grid
points in Ethiopia, which are in drought conditions in terms of causality.
Using the empirical extreme quantiles of precipitation distribution as a proxy
for drought, We show that the level of SST second mode of variability in the
prior year influences the occurrence of drought in Ethiopia. The causal link
between these two variables has a negative coefficient that verifies the
conclusion of past studies that rainfall deficiency in the Horn of Africa is
associated with ENSO's cooling phase.

application, we consider a system where low energy electrons can be described
as Dirac particles, which is the case for most two-dimensional materials, such
as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. However the method is easily
adapted for other cases such as electrons in few layer black phosphorus, or any
Schr\""odinger quasi-particles within the effective mass approximation in
semiconductors. We employ the method to revisit Andreev reflection in graphene,
where specular and retro reflection cases are observed for electrons scattered
by a step-like superconducting region. The effect of opening a zero-gap channel
across the superconducting region on the electron and hole scattering is also
addressed, as an example of the versatility of the technique proposed here.

experiments of spatially-extended neurobiological networks. They are important
for the brain's navigational system and specific memory tasks. A bump attractor
is characterised by a core in which neurons fire frequently, while those away
from the core do not fire. We uncover a relationship between bump attractors
and travelling waves in a classical network of excitable, leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. This relationship bears strong similarities to the
one between complex spatiotemporal patterns and waves at the onset of pipe
turbulence. Waves in the spiking network are determined by a firing set, that
is, the collection of times at which neurons reach a threshold and fire as the
wave propagates. We define and study analytical properties of the voltage
mapping, an operator transforming a solution's firing set into its
spatiotemporal profile. This operator allows us to construct localised
travelling waves with an arbitrary number of spikes at the core, and to study
their linear stability. A homogeneous ""laminar"" state exists in the network,
and it is linearly stable for all values of the principal control parameter.
Sufficiently wide disturbances to the homogeneous state elicit the bump
attractor. We show that one can construct waves with a seemingly arbitrary
number of spikes at the core; the higher the number of spikes, the slower the
wave, and the more its profile resembles a stationary bump. As in the
fluid-dynamical analogy, such waves coexist with the homogeneous state, are
unstable, and the solution branches to which they belong are disconnected from
the laminar state; we provide evidence that the dynamics of the bump attractor
displays echoes of the unstable waves, which form its building blocks.

the global problem by a family of small interface systems associated with

of the extended ThingTalk language is demonstrated with a fully operational

close to the surface. TEM results after initial RCF cycling showed that
additional damage was mainly confined to deformation bands that propagated
several microns into the sample. These bands formed via localized dislocation
slip, possibly on multiple slip systems, within the B2 matrix and/or within
transformed B19 prime martensite phase under repeated applied contact stress.
Further cycling of Ni55Ti45 and Ni54Ti45Hf1 led to shearing and dissolution of
the strengthening precipitates within the deformation bands, followed by
formation of nanocrystalline grains and finally amorphization of the remaining
matrix material within the bands. The Ni56Ti36Hf8 alloy exhibited a notable
increase in RCF performance and a smaller damage zone (1.5 microns) compared to
the Ni55Ti45 and Ni54Ti45Hf1 alloys (over 6 microns). This was attributed to
the low fraction of B2 matrix phase (less than or equal to 13 %) in the
Ni56Ti36Hf8 alloy, leading to formation of narrow deformation bands (less than
11 nm) that were incapable of dissolving the much larger precipitates. Instead,
the deformation bands were restricted to narrow channels between the dense

accompanied by shearing and eventual dissolution of the Ni4Ti3 precipitates

changes from delocalized to localized around the mode-coupling temperature. We
find that the displacement amplitudes of the delocalized modes have a slowly
decaying far field, whereas the localized modes consist of a core with large
displacements and a rapidly decaying far field. The fractal dimension of
unstable modes around the mobility edge is equal to 1, consistent with the
scaling of the participation ratio. Finally, we find that around and below the
mode-coupling temperature the unstable modes are localized around structural
defects, characterized by a disordered local structure markedly different from
the liquid's locally favored structure. These defects are similar to those
associated to quasi-localized vibrations in local minima and are good
candidates to predict the emergence of localized excitations at low

expanded/contracted and shifted with the plasma's evolving temperature and
drift velocity. The mesh motion is dealt with by transforming the underlying
VFP equations into a computational (logical) coordinate, with the resulting
inertial terms carefully discretized to ensure conservation. To deal with the
spatial and temporally varying dynamics in a spherically imploding system, we
have developed a novel nonlinear stabilization strategy for MMPDE in the

that optimizes between mesh quality and the volumetric rate change of the mesh
to ensure both accuracy and stability of the solution. Implosions of ICF
capsules are driven by several boundary conditions: 1) an elastic moving wall
boundary; 2) a time-dependent Maxwellian Dirichlet boundary; and 3) a
pressure-driven Lagrangian boundary. Of these, the pressure-driven Lagrangian
boundary driver is new to our knowledge. The implementation of our strategy is

to do this is through the use of magnetorquers, which can be integrated into
PCBs. This technique saves considerable space and capital when compared with
more common torque-rod magnetorquer systems. Here we derive a method of
analyzing different PCB-integrated magnetorquer geometries, parametrizing them
such that the magnetic moment and efficiency are optimized. Furthermore, by
modulating the trace width, the trace number, and other electrical
characteristics of the magnetorquer coil, this paper optimizes the generated
magnetic moment. Both constant voltage and constant current sources are
analyzed as inputs. These optimizations are then simulated in COMSOL for
multiple geometries, and it is found that there exists an optimal geometry,
given a specified power dissipation. Simulations verify the general trend and
maxima of these derivations, barring small, consistent re-scaling in the
magnitude of the coil resistance. It is also found that these PCB-integrated
magnetorquers provide a sufficient alternative to commercial coil magnetorquers
- particularly in volume-restricted configurations. This study extends such
analysis to larger CubeSat configurations, and finds that these larger
implementations increase magnetorquer efficiency. Optimizations for common
PCB-implementable geometries on small satellites are tabulated in the Appendix.

Why is there such a simple law in many complex social systems is an interesting
question. Although scientists from fields of statistical physics, complex
systems, economics and transportation science have explained the social gravity
law, a theoretical explanation including two dominant mechanisms, namely
individual interaction and bounded rationality, is still lacking. Here we
present a free utility model, whose objective function is mathematically
consistent with the Helmholtz free energy in physics, from the perspective of
individual choice behavior to explain the social gravity law. The basic
assumption is that bounded rational individuals interacting with each other
will trade off the expected utility and information-processing cost to maximize
their own utility. The previous explanations of the social gravity law
including the maximum entropy model, the free cost model, the Logit model and
the destination choice game model are all special cases under our model.
Further, we extend the free utility model to the network. This model not only
helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of spatial interaction
patterns in complex social systems, but also provides a new perspective for
understanding the potential function in game theory and the user equilibrium
model in transportation science.

  Exploiting DRAM Data Retention Characteristics","To appear in the MICRO 2020 conference proceedings",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Increasing single-cell DRAM error rates have pushed DRAM manufacturers to
adopt on-die error-correction coding (ECC), which operates entirely within a
DRAM chip to improve factory yield. The on-die ECC function and its effects on
DRAM reliability are considered trade secrets, so only the manufacturer knows
precisely how on-die ECC alters the externally-visible reliability
characteristics. Consequently, on-die ECC obstructs third-party DRAM customers
(e.g., test engineers, experimental researchers), who typically design, test,
and validate systems based on these characteristics.
  To give third parties insight into precisely how on-die ECC transforms DRAM
error patterns during error correction, we introduce Bit-Exact ECC Recovery
(BEER), a new methodology for determining the full DRAM on-die ECC function
(i.e., its parity-check matrix) without hardware tools, prerequisite knowledge
about the DRAM chip or on-die ECC mechanism, or access to ECC metadata (e.g.,
error syndromes, parity information). BEER exploits the key insight that
non-intrusively inducing data-retention errors with carefully-crafted test
patterns reveals behavior that is unique to a specific ECC function.
  We use BEER to identify the ECC functions of 80 real LPDDR4 DRAM chips with
on-die ECC from three major DRAM manufacturers. We evaluate BEER's correctness
in simulation and performance on a real system to show that BEER is effective
and practical across a wide range of on-die ECC functions. To demonstrate
BEER's value, we propose and discuss several ways that third parties can use
BEER to improve their design and testing practices. As a concrete example, we
introduce and evaluate BEEP, the first error profiling methodology that uses
the known on-die ECC function to recover the number and bit-exact locations of
unobservable raw bit errors responsible for observable post-correction errors.

suffer from the annotation unscalability of supervised learning, nor the
computation unscalability of self-supervised learning. Most existing works on
webly-supervised representation learning adopt a vanilla supervised learning
method without accounting for the prevalent noise in the training data, whereas
most prior methods in learning with label noise are less effective for
real-world large-scale noisy data. We propose momentum prototypes (MoPro), a
simple contrastive learning method that achieves online label noise correction,
out-of-distribution sample removal, and representation learning. MoPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WebVision, a weakly-labeled noisy dataset.
MoPro also shows superior performance when the pretrained model is transferred
to down-stream image classification and detection tasks. It outperforms the
ImageNet supervised pretrained model by +10.5 on 1-shot classification on VOC,
and outperforms the best self-supervised pretrained model by +17.3 when
finetuned on 1\% of ImageNet labeled samples. Furthermore, MoPro is more robust
to distribution shifts. Code and pretrained models are available at

The focus of pancreas SBRT planning is finding a balance between organs-at-risk

distributions and make planning adjustments to optimize PTV coverage while
adhering to OAR dose constraints. We have formulated such interactions between
the planner and the TPS into a finite-horizon RL model. First, planning status
features are evaluated based on human planner experience and defined as
planning states. Second, planning actions are defined to represent steps that
planners would commonly implement to address different planning needs. Finally,
we have derived a reward system based on an objective function guided by
physician-assigned constraints. The planning bot trained itself with 48 plans
augmented from 16 previously treated patients and generated plans for 24 cases
in a separate validation set. All 24 bot-generated plans achieve similar PTV
coverages compared to clinical plans while satisfying all clinical planning
constraints. Moreover, the knowledge learned by the bot can be visualized and
interpreted as consistent with human planning knowledge, and the knowledge maps
learned in separate training sessions are consistent, indicating
reproducibility of the learning process.

We show that a missing security dependency is equivalent to a race condition
between authorization and access, which is a root cause of speculative

(DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving
comparable performance. In just one round, each client distills their private

collectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are
only useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model

Afterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to
finetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local

communication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with
different models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an

interest has led to the introduction of the shuffle model (Cheu et al.,
EUROCRYPT 2019; Erlingsson et al., SODA 2019) and revisiting the pan-private

a variety of low-dimensional problems -- such as counts, means, and histograms
-- these intermediate models offer nearly as much power as central differential
privacy. However, there has been considerably less success using these models
for high-dimensional learning and estimation problems. In this work, we show
that, for a variety of high-dimensional learning and estimation problems, both
the shuffle model and the pan-private model inherently incur an exponential
price in sample complexity relative to the central model. For example, we show
that, private agnostic learning of parity functions over $d$ bits requires
$\Omega(2^{d/2})$ samples in these models, and privately selecting the most
common attribute from a set of $d$ choices requires $\Omega(d^{1/2})$ samples,
both of which are exponential separations from the central model. Our work
gives the first non-trivial lower bounds for these problems for both the

space of style and content domain where it learns to rearrange and fuse style
features based on their similarity with content features. The outputs generated
by MCC are features containing the desired style patterns which can further be
decoded into images with vivid style textures. Moreover, MCCNet is also
designed to explicitly align the features to input which ensures the output
maintains the content structures as well as the temporal continuity. To further
improve the performance of MCCNet under complex light conditions, we also
introduce the illumination loss during training. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that MCCNet performs well in both arbitrary video and

exposure to ambient conditions was computationally quantified in subjects of
50-60 years of age in tropical and temperate areas, accounting for differences
in thermoregulation. A thermoregulatory response model was extended to consider
elderly people in tropical areas. The time course of lens temperature for
different weather conditions in five cities in Asia was computed. The
temperature was higher around the mid and posterior part of the lens, which
coincides with the position of the nuclear cataract. The duration of higher

comparable. A strong correlation (adjusted R2 > 0.85) was observed between the
prevalence of nuclear cataract and the computed cumulative thermal dose in the

theoretic and practical importance. As a classic CO problem, deep hashing aims
to find an optimal code for each data from finite discrete possibilities, while
the discrete nature brings a big challenge to the optimization process.
Previous methods usually mitigate this challenge by binary approximation,
substituting binary codes for real-values via activation functions or
regularizations. However, such approximation leads to uncertainty between
real-values and binary ones, degrading retrieval performance. In this paper, we
propose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH). It explicitly
estimates the uncertainty during training and leverages the uncertainty
information to guide the approximation process. Specifically, we model
bit-level uncertainty via measuring the discrepancy between the output of a
hashing network and that of a momentum-updated network. The discrepancy of each
bit indicates the uncertainty of the hashing network to the approximate output
of that bit. Meanwhile, the mean discrepancy of all bits in a hashing code can
be regarded as image-level uncertainty. It embodies the uncertainty of the
hashing network to the corresponding input image. The hashing bit and image
with higher uncertainty are paid more attention during optimization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the uncertainty in
hashing bits. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to verify

terrain creating floods by forming channels and filling depressions. In this
paper we study a number of \emph{flow-query} related problems: Given a terrain
$\Sigma$, represented as a triangulated $xy$-monotone surface with $n$
vertices, a rain distribution $R$ which may vary over time, determine how much
water is flowing over a given edge as a function of time. We develop
internal-memory as well as I/O-efficient algorithms for flow queries.
  This paper contains four main results:
  (i) We present an internal-memory algorithm that preprocesses $\Sigma$ into a
linear-size data structure that for a (possibly time varying) rain distribution
$R$ can return the flow-rate functions of all edges of $\Sigma$ in $O(\rho
k+|\phi| \log n)$ time, where $\rho$ is the number of sinks in $\Sigma$, $k$ is
the number of times the rain distribution changes, and $|\phi|$ is the total
complexity of the flow-rate functions that have non-zero values;
  (ii) We also present an I/O-efficient algorithm for preprocessing $\Sigma$
into a linear-size data structure so that for a rain distribution $R$, it can
compute the flow-rate function of all edges using $O(\text{Sort}(|\phi|))$ I/Os
and $O(|\phi| \log |\phi|)$ internal computation time.
  (iii) $\Sigma$ can be preprocessed into a linear-size data structure so that
for a given rain distribution $R$, the flow-rate function of an edge $(q,r) \in
\Sigma$ under the single-flow direction (SFD) model can be computed more
efficiently.
  (iv) We present an algorithm for computing the two-dimensional channel along
which water flows using Manning's equation; a widely used empirical equation
that relates the flow-rate of water in an open channel to the geometry of the
channel along with the height of water in the channel.

Traditional lane detection methods incorporate handcrafted or deep
learning-based features followed by postprocessing techniques for lane
extraction using frame-based RGB cameras. The utilization of frame-based RGB
cameras for lane detection tasks is prone to illumination variations, sun
glare, and motion blur, which limits the performance of lane detection methods.
Incorporating an event camera for lane detection tasks in the perception stack
of autonomous driving is one of the most promising solutions for mitigating
challenges encountered by frame-based RGB cameras. The main contribution of
this work is the design of the lane marking detection model, which employs the
dynamic vision sensor. This paper explores the novel application of lane
marking detection using an event camera by designing a convolutional encoder
followed by the attention-guided decoder. The spatial resolution of the encoded
features is retained by a dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) block.
The additive attention mechanism in the decoder improves performance for high
dimensional input encoded features that promote lane localization and relieve
postprocessing computation. The efficacy of the proposed work is evaluated
using the DVS dataset for lane extraction (DET). The experimental results show
a significant improvement of $5.54\%$ and $5.03\%$ in $F1$ scores in multiclass

rise to a holographic three-dimensional conformal fluid having constant
vorticity. We then study the holographic relevance of the Misner string by
considering bulk scalar fluctuations. The scalar fluctuations organize
naturally into representations of the $SU(2)\times \mathbb{R}$ isometry
algebra. If we require the string's invisibility we obtain a Dirac-like
quantization relating the frequency of the scalar field modes to the NUT
charge. As the latter quantity determines the total vorticity flux of the
boundary fluid, we argue that such an assumption allows for a holographic
interpretation of TNAdS$_4$ as a {\it non-dissipative} superfluid whose
excitations are quantized vortices. Alternatively, if we regard the Misner
string as a physical object, as has recently been advocated for
thermodynamically, the aforementioned quantization conditions are removed, and
we find that TNAdS$_4$ corresponds to a holographic fluid whose dissipative
properties are probed as usual by the complex quasinormal modes of the bulk
fluctuations. We show that such quasinormal modes are, perhaps surprisingly,
organized into infinite-dimensional non-unitary representations of the isometry
algebra.

identification is a central problem in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Over
the past two decades, target decoy approaches (TDAs) and decoy-free approaches
(DFAs), have been widely used to estimate FDR. TDAs use a database of decoy
species to faithfully model score distributions of incorrect peptide-spectrum
matches (PSMs). DFAs, on the other hand, fit two-component mixture models to
learn the parameters of correct and incorrect PSM score distributions. While
conceptually straightforward, both approaches lead to problems in practice,
particularly in experiments that push instrumentation to the limit and generate
low fragmentation-efficiency and low signal-to-noise-ratio spectra. Results: We
introduce a new decoy-free framework for FDR estimation that generalizes
present DFAs while exploiting more search data in a manner similar to TDAs. Our
approach relies on multi-component mixtures, in which score distributions
corresponding to the correct PSMs, best incorrect PSMs, and second-best
incorrect PSMs are modeled by the skew normal family. We derive EM algorithms
to estimate parameters of these distributions from the scores of best and
second-best PSMs associated with each experimental spectrum. We evaluate our
models on multiple proteomics datasets and a HeLa cell digest case study
consisting of more than a million spectra in total. We provide evidence of
improved performance over existing DFAs and improved stability and speed over
TDAs without any performance degradation. We propose that the new strategy has
the potential to extend beyond peptide identification and reduce the need for
TDA on all analytical platforms.

models of 3D shapes offer compelling alternatives. Procedural representations
are one such possibility: they offer high-quality and editable results but are
difficult to author and often produce outputs with limited diversity. On the
other extreme are deep generative models: given enough data, they can learn to
generate any class of shape but their outputs have artifacts and the
representation is not editable. In this paper, we take a step towards achieving
the best of both worlds for novel 3D shape synthesis. We propose ShapeAssembly,
a domain-specific ""assembly-language"" for 3D shape structures. ShapeAssembly
programs construct shapes by declaring cuboid part proxies and attaching them
to one another, in a hierarchical and symmetrical fashion. Its functions are
parameterized with free variables, so that one program structure is able to
capture a family of related shapes. We show how to extract ShapeAssembly
programs from existing shape structures in the PartNet dataset. Then we train a
deep generative model, a hierarchical sequence VAE, that learns to write novel
ShapeAssembly programs. The program captures the subset of variability that is
interpretable and editable. The deep model captures correlations across shape
collections that are hard to express procedurally. We evaluate our approach by
comparing shapes output by our generated programs to those from other recent
shape structure synthesis models. We find that our generated shapes are more
plausible and physically-valid than those of other methods. Additionally, we
assess the latent spaces of these models, and find that ours is better
structured and produces smoother interpolations. As an application, we use our
generative model and differentiable program interpreter to infer and fit shape
programs to unstructured geometry, such as point clouds.

The proposed system consists of three modules. To explore the relationship
between music and dance movements, we propose a cross-modal alignment module
that focuses on dancing video clips, accompanied on pre-designed music, to
learn a system that can judge the consistency between the visual features of
pose sequences and the acoustic features of music. The learned model is then
used in the imagination module to select a pose sequence for the given music.
Such pose sequence selected from the music, however, is usually discontinuous.
To solve this problem, in the spatial-temporal alignment module we develop a
spatial alignment algorithm based on the tendency and periodicity of dance
movements to predict dance movements between discontinuous fragments. In
addition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.
To solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to
align the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is
used to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module. The
generated dancing videos match the content and rhythm of the music.
Experimental results and subjective evaluations show that the proposed approach

  One of our key insights is to identify a simple combinatorial property of
random XOR instances that makes spectral refutation work. Our approach involves
taking an instance that does not satisfy this property (i.e., is \emph{not}
pseudorandom) and reducing it to a partitioned collection of $2$-XOR instances.
We analyze these subinstances using a carefully chosen quadratic form as a
proxy, which in turn is bounded via a combination of spectral methods and
semidefinite programming. The analysis of our spectral bounds relies only on an
off-the-shelf matrix Bernstein inequality. Even for the purely random case,
this leads to a shorter proof compared to the ones in the literature that rely
on problem-specific trace-moment computations.

method (FDM), have been developed based on Fourier theory. However, the EWT can
suffer from a mode mixing problem for signals with closely-spaced modes and
decomposition results by FDM can suffer from an inconsistency problem. An
accurate adaptive signal decomposition method, called the empirical Fourier

proposed EFD combines the uses of an improved Fourier spectrum segmentation
technique and an ideal filter bank. The segmentation technique can solve the
inconsistency problem by predefining the number of modes in a signal to be
decomposed and filter functions in the ideal filter bank have no transition
phases, which can solve the mode mixing problem. Numerical investigations are
conducted to study the accuracy of the EFD. It is shown that the EFD can yield
accurate and consistent decomposition results for signals with multiple
non-stationary modes and those with closely-spaced modes, compared with
decomposition results by the EWT, FDM, variational mode decomposition and

key descriptor in high-throughput screening protocols, and prove its
effectiveness. For the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis as our demo catalytic
reaction, the present study focuses on discovering bimetallic catalysts that
can replace the prototypic palladium (Pd) one. Through a series of screening
processes based on DOS pattern similarities (evaluated using first-principles
calculations) and synthetic feasibility, 9 candidates are finally proposed out
of 4,350 bimetallic alloy, which then are expected to have a catalytic
performance comparable to that of Pd. The subsequent experimental tests
demonstrate that 4 bimetallic catalysts (Ni61Pt39, Au51Pd49, Pt52Pd48,
Pd52Ni48) indeed exhibit the catalytic properties comparable to those of Pd.
Moreover, we discovered a novel bimetallic (Ni-Pt) catalyst, which has not yet
been reported for H2O2 direct synthesis. In particular, Ni61Pt39 outperforms
the prototypical Pd catalyst for the chemical reaction and exhibits a 9.5-fold
enhancement in cost-normalized productivity. This protocol provides a new
opportunity for the catalyst discovery for the replacement or reduction in use

analysis of the magnetic entropy and magnetization indicates that the weak
magnetic anisotropy in ErBi possibly derives from the mixing effect, namely the
anisotropic ground state of Er3+ (4f11) mingles with the isotropic excited
state through exchange interaction. At low temperature, an extremely large
magnetoresistance (~104%) with a parabolic magnetic-field dependence is
observed, which can be ascribed to the nearly perfect electron-hole
compensation and ultrahigh carrier mobility. When the magnetic field is rotated
in the ab (ac) plane and the current flows in the b axis, the angular
magnetoresistance in ErBi shows a twofold (fourfold) symmetry. Similar case has
been observed in LaBi where the anisotropic Fermi surface dominates the
low-temperature transport. Our theoretical calculation suggests that near the
Fermi level ErBi shares similarity with LaBi in the electronic band structures.
These findings indicate that the angular magnetoresistance of ErBi could be
mainly determined by its anisotropic Fermi surface topology. Besides,
contributions from several other possibilities, including the spin-dependent
scattering, spin-orbit scattering, and demagnetization correlation to the
angular magnetoresistance of ErBi are also discussed.

dust destroyed in a single gas particle surrounding supernova) and C_s (the
probability that a metal atom or ion sticks to the dust grain after colliding,
i.e., the sticking coefficient) in regulating the amount and distribution of
dust, cold gas and metals in galaxies. We find that simulated galaxies with low
f_des and/or high C_s values produce not only more dust, but they also have a
shallower correlation between dust surface density and total gas surface
density, and a steeper correlation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity.
Only for values of f_des between 0.01 and 0.02, and of C_s between 0.5 and 1
our simulations produce an average slope of the dust-to-gas ratio versus
metallicity relation consistent with observations. f_des values correspond to a
range of a total fraction of dust destroyed by a single supernova between 0.42

worked out which also includes a few representative uniform strain cases. The
tensor components are observed to display insignificant discrepancies even for
the highly anisotropic shapes. The family of $g$-factor curves associated with
these parameter combinations coalesces to a single universal one when plotted
as a function of the gap energy, thus confirming a recent assertion reached
under much restrictive conditions. Our work extends its validity to alloy QDs
with various shapes and finite confinement that allows for penetration to the
host matrix, placing it on a more realistic basis. Accordingly, the electrons
in InGaAs QDs having $s$-shell transition energies close to 1.13 eV will be
least susceptible to magnetic field. We also show that low indium concentration
offer limited $g$-factor tunability under shape or confinement variations.
These findings can be taken into consideration in the fabrication and the use
of InGaAs QDs with $g$-near-zero or other targeted $g$ values for spintronic or

that experimental tools used for jet-related experiments so far, are typically

guarantees for high-dimensional classification problems. It uses the
probabilities of predicting the top two most-likely classes around an input
point under a smoothing distribution to generate a certified radius for a
classifier's prediction. However, most smoothing methods do not give us any
information about the confidence with which the underlying classifier (e.g.,
deep neural network) makes a prediction. In this work, we propose a method to
generate certified radii for the prediction confidence of the smoothed

prediction score of a class and the margin by which the average prediction
score of one class exceeds that of another. We modify the Neyman-Pearson lemma
(a key theorem in randomized smoothing) to design a procedure for computing the
certified radius where the confidence is guaranteed to stay above a certain
threshold. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that
using information about the distribution of the confidence scores allows us to
achieve a significantly better certified radius than ignoring it. Thus, we
demonstrate that extra information about the base classifier at the input point

the analyzer to train a model without collecting users' raw data. To ensure
users' privacy, differentially private federated learning has been intensively
studied. The existing works are mainly based on the \textit{curator model} or
\textit{local model} of differential privacy. However, both of them have pros
and cons. The curator model allows greater accuracy but requires a trusted
analyzer. In the local model where users randomize local data before sending
them to the analyzer, a trusted analyzer is not required but the accuracy is
limited. In this work, by leveraging the \textit{privacy amplification} effect
in the recently proposed shuffle model of differential privacy, we achieve the
best of two worlds, i.e., accuracy in the curator model and strong privacy
without relying on any trusted party. We first propose an FL framework in the
shuffle model and a simple protocol (SS-Simple) extended from existing work. We
find that SS-Simple only provides an insufficient privacy amplification effect
in FL since the dimension of the model parameter is quite large. To solve this
challenge, we propose an enhanced protocol (SS-Double) to increase the privacy
amplification effect by subsampling. Furthermore, for boosting the utility when
the model size is greater than the user population, we propose an advanced
protocol (SS-Topk) with gradient sparsification techniques. We also provide
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations of the privacy amplification of
the proposed protocols. Experiments on real-world dataset validate that SS-Topk
improves the testing accuracy by 60.7\% than the local model based FL.

high-density regions of scales $10-15$ cMpc. Interestingly, the HAE density
maps reveal that BOSS1244 contains a dominant structure, while BOSS1542
manifests as a giant filamentary structure. We measure the H$\alpha$ luminosity
functions (HLF), finding that BOSS1244's HLF is nearly identical to that of the
general field at the same epoch, while BOSS1542 shows an excess of HAEs with
high H$\alpha$ luminosity, indicating the presence of enhanced star formation

attend to spurious, non-generalizable cues in the training data). We discover a
perplexing invariance of MPPIs to random training seed, model architecture,
pretraining, and training domain. MPPIs demonstrate remarkable transferability
across domains achieving significantly higher performance than comparably short
queries. Additionally, penalizing over-confidence on MPPIs fails to improve
either generalization or adversarial robustness. These results suggest the
interpretability of MPPIs is insufficient to characterize generalization
capacity of these models. We hope this focused investigation encourages more
systematic analysis of model behavior outside of the human interpretable
distribution of examples.

regression can not reveal a potential sparsity of parameters, and may also
introduce a large bias under the high-dimensional setting. Nevertheless, recent
work on the Lasso involves debiasing and thresholding, the latter in order to
further enhance the model selection. As a consequence, ridge regression may be
worth another look since -- after debiasing and thresholding -- it may offer
some advantages over the Lasso, e.g., it can be easily computed using a
closed-form expression. % and it has similar performance to threshold Lasso. In
this paper, we define a debiased and thresholded ridge regression method, and
prove a consistency result and a Gaussian approximation theorem. We further
introduce a wild bootstrap algorithm to construct confidence regions and
perform hypothesis testing for a linear combination of parameters. In addition
to estimation, we consider the problem of prediction, and present a novel,
hybrid bootstrap algorithm tailored for prediction intervals. Extensive
numerical simulations further show that the debiased and thresholded ridge

entities of different types interacting in various ways. Such heterogeneity
brings rich semantic information but presents nontrivial challenges in
aggregating the heterogeneous relationships between objects - especially those

representation learning on heterogeneous networks typically employ the
attention mechanism, which is often only optimized for predictions based on
direct links. Furthermore, even though most deep learning methods can aggregate
higher-order information by building deeper models, such a scheme can diminish
the degree of interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we explore an
architecture - Layer-stacked ATTention Embedding (LATTE) - that automatically
decomposes higher-order meta relations at each layer to extract the relevant
heterogeneous neighborhood structures for each node. Additionally, by
successively stacking layer representations, the learned node embedding offers
a more interpretable aggregation scheme for nodes of different types at
different neighborhood ranges. We conducted experiments on several benchmark
heterogeneous network datasets. In both transductive and inductive node
classification tasks, LATTE can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared
to existing approaches, all while offering a lightweight model. With extensive
experimental analyses and visualizations, the framework can demonstrate the

Boundary value problems are proposed to locate bifurcation points and predict
the local bifurcation diagram near bifurcation points on the $S$-shaped curves.
Numerical approaches for linear stability analysis are developed to understand
the stability of the steady-state solutions that are only numerically
available. Finite difference schemes are proposed to solve a derived eigenvalue
problem involving differential operators. The linear stability analysis reveals
that the $S$-shaped curves have two linearly stable branches of different

classical bistable hysteresis. As predicted in the linear stability analysis,
transition dynamics, from a steady-state solution on the unstable branch to a

the dominant eigenvalue. Further numerical tests demonstrate that the finite

structure of the PNP model, we make use of the Energetic Variational Approach
(EnVarA), so that the PNP system could be reformulated as a non-constant
mobility $H^{-1}$ gradient flow, with singular logarithmic energy potentials
involved. To ensure the unique solvability and energy stability, the mobility
function is explicitly treated, while both the logarithmic and the electric
potential diffusion terms are treated implicitly, due to the convex nature of
these two energy functional parts. The positivity-preserving property for both
concentrations, $n$ and $p$, is established at a theoretical level. This is
based on the subtle fact that the singular nature of the logarithmic term
around the value of $0$ prevents the numerical solution reaching the singular
value, so that the numerical scheme is always well-defined. In addition, an
optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this work, in which many
highly non-standard estimates have to be involved, due to the nonlinear
parabolic coefficients. The higher order asymptotic expansion (up to third
order temporal accuracy and fourth order spatial accuracy), the rough error
estimate (to establish the $\ell^\infty$ bound for $n$ and $p$), and the
refined error estimate have to be carried out to accomplish such a convergence

In this work, we explore the use of polynomial chaos based approaches for

the optimization variables using orthogonal polynomials, the stochastic

all moments of the output distribution. Thus, this approach enables one to
avoid computationally expensive random sampling based approaches such as Monte

PEH effects in Milky Way-like galaxies using smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) code which self-consistently implements the evolution of the gas, dust,
and interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Dust evolution includes dust formation
by stars, destruction by SNe, and growth in dense media. We find that PEH
suppresses star formation due to the excess heating that reduces the ISM
density. This suppression is seen across the entire range of gas fractions,
star formation recipes, dust models, and PEH efficiencies investigated by our
code. The suppression ranges from negligible values to approximately a factor
of five depending on the specific implementation. Galaxy models having higher
gas fraction experience higher star formation suppression. The adopted dust
model also alters the extent of star formation suppression. Moreover, when PEH
is switched on, galaxy models show higher gas outflow rates and have higher
loading factors indicative of enhanced SNe feedback. In gas-rich models (i.e. a
gas fraction of 0.5), we also find that PEH suppresses the formation of disk

gain, in this work we consider systems with mixed-resolution, 1-bit quantized
and continuous-valued, data. First, we describe the linear minimum mean-squared
error (LMMSE) estimator and its associated mean-squared error (MSE) for the
general mixed-resolution model. However, the MSE of the LMMSE requires matrix
inversion in which the number of measurements defines the matrix dimensions and
thus, is not a tractable tool for optimization and system design. Therefore, we
present the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) measurement model and derive a
closed-form analytic expression for the MSE of the LMMSE estimator under this
model. In addition, we present two common special cases of the LGO model: 1)
scalar parameter estimation and 2) channel estimation in mixed-ADC
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. We then solve the
resource allocation optimization problem of the LGO model with the proposed
tractable form of the MSE as an objective function and under a power constraint

resource allocation optimization problem for two dithering schemes: 1) adding
noise only to the quantized measurements and 2) adding noise to both

plunging mass under the purely outgoing boundary condition at infinity and a
hypothetical reflection boundary condition near the horizon. We find that the
low frequency component below the threshold of the super-radiant instability is

the previous analysis. We also find that the high frequency mode excitation is
significantly larger than the one used in the previous analysis, if we adopt

takes the code-mixed sentence as input, and its decoder predicts the replaced

relevant to the logic and should be preserved, and which can be safely
discarded? This question is relevant whenever signals are filtered or
compressed before being monitored, which is almost always the case for analog
signals. To answer this question, we focus on monitors that measure the
robustness of a signal relative to a specification in Signal Temporal Logic. We
prove that robustness monitors can be modeled using Volterra series. We then
study the Fourier transforms of these Volterra representations, and provide a
method to derive the Fourier transforms of entire formulas. We also make
explicit the measurement process in temporal logic and re-define it on the
basis of distributions to make it compatible with measurements in signal
processing. Experiments illustrate these results. Beyond compression, this work
enables the integration of temporal logic monitoring into common signal
processing toolchains as just another signal processing operation, and enables
a common formalism to study both logical and non-logical operations in the
frequency domain, which we refer to as Logical Signal Processing.

focusing in chiral ferromagnets.A lens is constructed to focus spin waves by a
curved interface between two ferromagnetic thin films with different
perpendicular magnetic anisotropies. Based on the principle of identical
magnonic path length, we derive the lens contour that can be either elliptical
or hyperbolical depending on the magnon refractive index. Micromagnetic
simulations are performed to verify the theoretical design. It is found that
under proper condition magnetic skyrmions emerge near the focus point of the
lens where the spin-wave intensity has been significantly enhanced. A close
investigation shows that a magnetic droplet first forms and then converts to
the skyrmion accompanying with a change of topological charge. Phase diagram
about the amplitude and duration-time of the exciting field for skyrmion
generation is obtained. Our findings would be helpful for designing novel
spintronic devices combining the advantages of skyrmionics and magnonics.

V2: Intro shortened; no new results",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new notion of generalization -- Distributional Generalization
-- which roughly states that outputs of a classifier at train and test time are
close *as distributions*, as opposed to close in just their average error. For
example, if we mislabel 30% of dogs as cats in the train set of CIFAR-10, then
a ResNet trained to interpolation will in fact mislabel roughly 30% of dogs as
cats on the *test set* as well, while leaving other classes unaffected. This
behavior is not captured by classical generalization, which would only consider
the average error and not the distribution of errors over the input domain. Our
formal conjectures, which are much more general than this example, characterize
the form of distributional generalization that can be expected in terms of
problem parameters: model architecture, training procedure, number of samples,
and data distribution. We give empirical evidence for these conjectures across
a variety of domains in machine learning, including neural networks, kernel
machines, and decision trees. Our results thus advance our empirical
understanding of interpolating classifiers.

forecast for the next time steps without any human intervention. Gaussian
Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for modeling time series, but so far there
are no competitive approaches for automatic forecasting based on GPs. We
propose practical solutions to two problems: automatic selection of the optimal
kernel and reliable estimation of the hyperparameters. We propose a fixed
composition of kernels, which contains the components needed to model most time
series: linear trend, periodic patterns, and other flexible kernel for modeling
the non-linear trend. Not all components are necessary to model each time
series; during training the unnecessary components are automatically made
irrelevant via automatic relevance determination (ARD). We moreover assign
priors to the hyperparameters, in order to keep the inference within a
plausible range; we design such priors through an empirical Bayes approach. We
present results on many time series of different types; our GP model is more
accurate than state-of-the-art time series models. Thanks to the priors, a

simultaneously alleviates catastrophic forgetting and favors the generalization

meta-optimization, we exploit a single inner loop taking advantage of an
aggregated representation achieved through the use of a self-attention

competitive performance even compared to the supervised case. Additionally, we
empirically observe that in an unsupervised scenario, the small tasks and the
variability in the clusters pooling play a crucial role in the generalization
capability of the network. Further, on complex datasets, the exploitation of
more clusters than the true number of classes leads to higher results, even
compared to the ones obtained with full supervision, suggesting that a
predefined partitioning into classes can miss relevant structural information.

maximisation and active inference by demonstrating how and when active
inference agents perform actions that are optimal for maximising reward.
Precisely, we show the conditions under which active inference produces the
optimal solution to the Bellman equation--a formulation that underlies several
approaches to model-based reinforcement learning and control. On partially
observed Markov decision processes, the standard active inference scheme can
produce Bellman optimal actions for planning horizons of 1, but not beyond. In
contrast, a recently developed recursive active inference scheme (sophisticated
inference) can produce Bellman optimal actions on any finite temporal horizon.

effect has been a paradigm of quantum mechanics throughout the last century,
but there has been surprisingly little evidence that the original scheme, with
freely propagating atoms exposed to gradients from macroscopic magnets, is a
fully coherent quantum process. Specifically, no full-loop SG interferometer
(SGI) has been realized with the scheme as envisioned decades ago. Furthermore,
several theoretical studies have explained why it is a formidable challenge.
Here we provide a review of our SG experiments over the last decade. We
describe several novel configurations such as that giving rise to the first SG
spatial interference fringes, and the first full-loop SGI realization. These
devices are based on highly accurate magnetic fields, originating from an atom
chip, that ensure coherent operation within strict constraints described by
previous theoretical analyses. Achieving this high level of control over
magnetic gradients is expected to facilitate technological applications such as
probing of surfaces and currents, as well as metrology. Fundamental
applications include the probing of the foundations of quantum theory, gravity,
and the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity. We end with an outlook

can be used to bend trajectories of gravitational waves, which might reach the
detector at the same time. Once this happens, a beat pattern may form, and can
be used to obtain the luminosity distance of the source, the lens mass, and
cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant. Crucial question is how
many such kind of events could be detected. In this work, we study this issue
for the future space-borne detectors: DECIGO and its downscale version,
B-DECIGO. It is found out that there can be a few tens to a few hundreds of
lensed gravitational wave events with the beat pattern observed by DECIGO and
B-DECIGO per year, depending on the evolution scenario leading to the formation
of double compact objects. In particular, black hole-black hole binaries are

However, DECIGO could also register a considerable amount of lensed signals

inclined slippery wall is analyzed under an influence of external shear which
is imposed on the top surface of the flow. The free surface of the flow as well
as the interface among the fluids are contaminated by insoluble surfactants.
Dynamics of both the layers are governed by the Navier--Stokes equations, and
the surfactant transport equation regulates the motion of the insoluble
surfactants at the interface and free surface. Instability mechanisms are
compared by imposing the external shear along and opposite to the flow
direction. A coupled Orr--Sommerfeld system of equations for the considered
problem is derived using the perturbation technique and normal mode analysis.
The eigenmodes corresponding to the Orr--Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem are
obtained by employing the spectral collocation method. The numerical results
imply that the stronger external shear destabilizes the interface mode
instability. However, a stabilizing impact of the external shear on the surface
mode is noticed if the shear is imposed in the flow direction, which is in
contrast to the role of imposed external shear on the surface mode for a
surfactant laden single layer falling film. Moreover, the impression of shear
mode on the primary instability is analyzed in the high Reynolds number regime
with sufficiently low inclination angle. Under such configuration, dominance of
the shear mode over the surface mode is observed due to the weaker impact of
the gravitation force on the surface instability. The shear mode can also be
stabilized by applying the external shear in the counter direction of the
streamwise flow. Conclusively, the extra imposed shear on the stratified
two-layer falling film plays an active role to control the attitude of the
instabilities.

Faster RCNN) demonstrate significantly different transferability when facing
large domain gap. The region classifier shows preferable performance but is
limited without RPN's high-quality proposals while simple alignment in the
backbone network is not effective enough for RPN adaptation. We delve into the
consistency and the difference of RPN and RPC, treat them individually and
leverage high-confidence output of one as mutual guidance to train the other.
Moreover, the samples with low-confidence are used for discrepancy calculation
between RPN and RPC and minimax optimization. Extensive experimental results on

significant relationship between hemispheric asymmetry in solar coronal
rotation rate and solar activity. Our approach is based on cross correlation of
hemispheric asymmetry index (AI) in rotation rate with annual solar activity
indicators. To obtain hemispheric asymmetry in solar rotation rate, we use
solar full disc (SFD) images at 30.4 nm, 19.5 nm, and 28.4 nm wavelengths for
24th Solar Cycle i.e., for the period from 2008 to 2018, as recorded by the
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) space mission. Our analysis
shows that hemispheric asymmetry in rotation rate is high during the solar
maxima from 2011 to 2014. On the other hand, hemispheric asymmetry drops
gradually on both sides (i.e., from 2008 to 2011 and from 2014 to 2018). The
results show that asymmetry index (AI) leads sunspot numbers by ~1.56 years.
This gives a clear indication that hemispheric asymmetry triggers the formation
of sunspots working together with the differential rotation of the Sun.

properties and fracture mechanisms of two stable phases of monolayer antimonene

(${\beta}$-Sb), through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our simulations
reveal that stronger chiral effect results in a greater anisotropic elastic
behavior in ${\beta}$-antimonene than in ${\alpha}$-antimonene. In this paper
we focus on crack-tip stress distribution using local volume averaged virial
stress definition and derive the fracture toughness from the crack-line stress.
Our calculated crack tip stress distribution ensures the applicability of
linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) for cracked antimonene allotropes with
considerable accuracy up to a pristine structure. We evaluate the effect of
temperature, strain rate, crack-length and point-defect concentration on the
strength and elastic properties. Tensile strength goes through significant
degradation with the increment of temperature, crack length and defect
percentage. Elastic modulus is less susceptible to temperature variation but is
largely affected by the defect concentration. Strain rate induces a power law
relation between strength and fracture strain. Finally, we discuss the fracture
mechanisms in the light of crack propagation and establish the links between
the fracture mechanism and the observed anisotropic properties.

(CDWs) that exhibit paramagnetic limiting behavior, similarly to the well known
case of superconductors. Here we study how CDWs in two-dimensional systems can
survive beyond the Pauli limit when they are subjected to a strong magnetic
field by developing a generalized mean-field theory of CDWs under Zeeman fields
that includes incommensurability, imperfect nesting and temperature effects and
the possibility of a competing or coexisting Spin density wave (SDW) order. Our
numerical calculations yield rich phase diagrams with distinct high-field
phases above the Pauli limiting field. For perfectly nested commensurate CDWs,
a $q$-modulated CDW phase that is completely analogous to the superconducting
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase appears at high-fields. In the
more common case of imperfect nesting, the commensurate CDW groundstate
undergoes a series of magnetic-field-induced phase transitions first into a
phase where commensurate CDW and SDW coexist and subsequently into another
phase where CDW and SDW acquire a $q$-modulation that is however distinct from
the pure FFLO CDW phase. The commensurate CDW+SDW phase occurs for fields
comparable to but less than the Pauli limit and survives above it. Thus this
phase provides a plausible mechanism for the CDW to survive at high fields
without the need of forming the more fragile FFLO phase. We suggest that the
recently discovered 2D materials like the transition metal dichalcogenides
offer a promising platform for observing such exotic field induced CDW
phenomena.

two-dimensional photonic moire lattices, which, unlike their material

explore transitions between structures with fundamentally different geometries:
periodic, general aperiodic and quasi-crystal ones. Equipped with such

Such localization is based on at band physics, in contrast to previous schemes
based on light difusion in optical quasicrystals,where disorder is required for
the onset of Anderson localization. Using commensurable and incommensurable
moire patterns, we report the first experimental demonstration of
two-dimensional localization-delocalization-transition (LDT) of light. Moire
lattices may feature almost arbitrary geometry that is consistent with the
crystallographic symmetry groups of the sublattices, and therefore afford a
powerful tool to control the properties of light patterns, to explore the
physics of transitions between periodic and aperiodic phases, and
two-dimensional wavepacket phenomena relevant to several areas of science.

effective Hamiltonian indicates that doublons behave as well-defined
quasi-particles, which acquire itinerancy through the hopping induced by
interactions. When we focus on a two-particle system, from the effective
Hamiltonian, an effective subspace spanned only by doublon bases emerges. The
effective subspace induces spreading of a single doublon and we find an
interesting property: The dynamics of a single doublon keeps short-range
density-density correlation in sharp contrast to a conventional two-particle
spreading. Furthermore, when introducing a modulated weak interaction, we find
an interaction induced topological subspace embedded in the full Hilbert space.
We elucidate the embedded topological subspace by observing the dynamics of a
single doublon, and show that the embedded topological subspace possesses a
bulk topological invariant. We further expect that for the system with open

Active Visual Search (AVS) of objects in known indoor environments with an
online setup. Our POMP method uses as input the current pose of an agent (e.g.
a robot) and a RGB-D frame. The task is to plan the next move that brings the
agent closer to the target object. We model this problem as a Partially
Observable Markov Decision Process solved by a Monte-Carlo planning approach.
This allows us to make decisions on the next moves by iterating over the known
scenario at hand, exploring the environment and searching for the object at the
same time. Differently from the current state of the art in Reinforcement
Learning, POMP does not require extensive and expensive (in time and
computation) labelled data so being very agile in solving AVS in small and
medium real scenarios. We only require the information of the floormap of the
environment, an information usually available or that can be easily extracted
from an a priori single exploration run. We validate our method on the publicly
available AVD benchmark, achieving an average success rate of 0.76 with an
average path length of 17.1, performing close to the state of the art but
without any training needed. Additionally, we show experimentally the
robustness of our method when the quality of the object detection goes from
ideal to faulty.

finite bandwidth availability and server restrictions limit how frequently

problem: maximize the freshness of the local cache subject to the crawling

to solve this problem, these either assume the knowledge of exact page change
rates or use inefficient methods such as MLE for estimating the same. We
address this issue here.
  We provide three novel schemes for online estimation of page change rates,
all of which have extremely low running times per iteration. The first is based
on the law of large numbers and the second on stochastic approximation. The
third is an extension of the second and includes a heavy-ball momentum term.
All these schemes only need partial information about the page change process,
i.e., they only need to know if the page has changed or not since the last
crawled instance. Our main theoretical results concern asymptotic convergence
and convergence rates of these three schemes. In fact, our work is the first to
show convergence of the original stochastic heavy-ball method when neither the
gradient nor the noise variance is uniformly bounded. We also provide some
numerical experiments (based on real and synthetic data) to demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed estimators over existing ones such as MLE. We
emphasize that our algorithms are also readily applicable to the

two alternative descriptions to Roe's original definition of coarse

$X$ which tells when two subsets closure meet on the boundary. A set of axioms
characterizes when this relation defines a coarse compactification. Such a
relation is called large-scale proximity. Based on this foundational work we
study examples for coarse compactifications Higson compactification,
Freudenthal compactification and Gromov compactification. For each example we
characterize the bounded functions which can be extended to the coarse
compactification and the corresponding large-scale proximity relation. We
provide an alternative proof for the property that the Higson compactification
is universal among coarse compactifications. Furthermore the Freudenthal
compactification is universal among coarse compactifications with totally

the huge spatial variation in the vorticity component parallel to the magnetic

Here we present a new analysis on the Kepler field, using the APOGEE
spectroscopic survey to build a metallicity calibration based on Gaia, 2MASS
and Stromgren photometry. This calibration, along with masses and radii derived
from a Bayesian isochrone fitting algorithm, is used to test a number of these

planetary frequencies are $0.88\pm0.12$ percent for [Fe/H]<0 and $1.37\pm0.16$
percent for [Fe/H]$\geq$0 but at two sigma we find that the size of exoplanets
influences the strength of this trend. We also recover the planet radius gap,
along with a slight positive correlation with stellar mass. We conclude that
this method shows promise to derive robust statistics of exoplanets. We also
remark that spectrophotometry from Gaia DR3 will have an effective resolution

problem (where $p \geq 2$ is a fixed integer). Like Connected VC, both new VC
problems are FPT, but do not admit a polynomial kernel unless $NP \subseteq
coNP/poly$, which is highly unlikely. We prove however that both problems admit
time efficient polynomial sized approximate kernelization schemes. We obtain an
$O(2^{O(pk)}n^{O(1)})$-time algorithm for the $p$-Edge-Connected VC and an
$O(2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)})$-time algorithm for the $p$-Vertex-Connected VC.
Finally, we describe a $2(p+1)$-approximation algorithm for the
$p$-Edge-Connected VC. The proofs for the new VC problems require more
sophisticated arguments than for Connected VC. In particular, for the
approximation algorithm we use Gomory-Hu trees and for the approximate kernels

$p$-vertex/edge-connected graph obtained independently by Nishizeki and Poljak
(1994) and Nagamochi and Ibaraki (1992).

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). During the learning process,
an unknown number of Byzantine workers may send malicious messages to the
central node, leading to remarkable learning error. Most of the
Byzantine-robust methods address this issue by using robust aggregation rules
to aggregate the received messages, but rely on the assumption that all the
regular workers have i.i.d. data, which is not the case in many federated
learning applications. In light of the significance of reducing stochastic
gradient noise for mitigating the effect of Byzantine attacks, we use a
resampling strategy to reduce the impact of both inner variation (that
describes the sample heterogeneity on every regular worker) and outer variation
(that describes the sample heterogeneity among the regular workers), along with
a stochastic average gradient algorithm to gradually eliminate the inner
variation. The variance-reduced messages are then aggregated with a robust
geometric median operator. We prove that the proposed method reaches a
neighborhood of the optimal solution at a linear convergence rate and the
learning error is determined by the number of Byzantine workers. Numerical
experiments corroborate the theoretical results and show that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-arts in the non-i.i.d. setting.

Hermitian eigenproblems $({Ku=\lambda Mu})$. The rIGA framework conserves the
desirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA)
discretizations while reducing the computation cost of the solution through
partitioning the computational domain by adding zero-continuity basis
functions. As a result, rIGA enriches the approximation space and decreases the
interconnection between degrees of freedom. We compare computational costs of
rIGA versus those of IGA when employing a Lanczos eigensolver with a
shift-and-invert spectral transformation. When all eigenpairs within a given
interval ${[\lambda_s,\lambda_e]}$ are of interest, we select several shifts
${\sigma_k\in[\lambda_s,\lambda_e]}$ using a spectrum slicing technique. For
each shift $\sigma_k$, the cost of factorization of the spectral transformation
matrix ${K-\sigma_k M}$ drives the total computational cost of the
eigensolution. Several multiplications of the operator matrices ${(K-\sigma_k
M)^{-1} M}$ by vectors follow this factorization. Let $p$ be the polynomial
degree of basis functions and assume that IGA has maximum continuity of
${p-1}$, while rIGA introduces $C^0$ separators to minimize the factorization
cost. For this setup, our theoretical estimates predict computational savings
to compute a fixed number of eigenpairs of up to ${O(p^2)}$ in the asymptotic
regime, that is, large problem sizes. Yet, our numerical tests show that for
moderately-sized eigenproblems, the total computational cost reduction is
$O(p)$. Nevertheless, rIGA improves the accuracy of every eigenpair of the
first $N_0$ eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Here, we allow $N_0$ to be as large
as the total number of eigenmodes of the original maximum-continuity IGA
discretization.

likelihood of getting adequate initial weights by random initialization.
Consequently, trained DNNs have many redundancies which can be pruned from the
model to reduce complexity and improve the ability to generalize. Structural
sparsity, as achieved by filter pruning, directly reduces the tensor sizes of
weights and activations and is thus particularly effective for reducing
complexity. We propose ""Holistic Filter Pruning"" (HFP), a novel approach for
common DNN training that is easy to implement and enables to specify accurate
pruning rates for the number of both parameters and multiplications. After each
forward pass, the current model complexity is calculated and compared to the
desired target size. By gradient descent, a global solution can be found that
allocates the pruning budget over the individual layers such that the desired
target size is fulfilled. In various experiments, we give insights into the
training and achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (HFP
prunes 60% of the multiplications of ResNet-50 on ImageNet with no significant

procedure that transforms a grammar of order n to a grammar of order n-1,

repeating the procedure n times, we obtain a grammar of order 0, whose
nonemptiness can be easily checked. Since the size grows exponentially at each
step, the overall complexity is n-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More
precisely, the transformation (and hence the whole algorithm) is linear in the
size of the grammar, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals is
bounded by a constant. The same algorithm allows to check whether an infinite
tree generated by a higher-order recursion scheme is accepted by an alternating
safety (or reachability) automaton, because this question can be reduced to the
nonemptiness problem by taking a product of the recursion scheme with the
automaton.

a proper understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis

review of existing databases, this work is proposed to survey, study and

consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases are examined and compared
in terms of several features, such as the geographical location, period of
collection, number of monitored households, sampling rate of collected data,
number of sub-metered appliances, extracted features and release date.
Furthermore, data collection platforms and related modules for data
transmission, data storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are
also analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset has
been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an annotated power
consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will be very useful for
testing and training anomaly detection algorithms, and hence reducing wasted
energy. Moving forward, a set of recommendations is derived to improve datasets
collection, such as the adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet

field state properties, where exceedingly long time scales have been
established. In this study we report a detailed investigation of static and
dynamic properties of Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ across the magnetic field induced
transition around 3.5 T. This region has so far been practically neglected
while we argue that in some aspects it represents a simpler version of the
transition across the $B = 0$ state. Investigating the frequency dependence of
the ac susceptibility we reveal that on the high field side ($B > 3.5$ T) the
response corresponds to a relatively narrow distribution of magnetic clusters.
The distribution appears very weakly dependent on magnetic field, with an
associated energy barrier of around 200 K. Below 3.5 T a second contribution
arises, with much smaller characteristic frequencies and a strong temperature

horizon, limiting their flexibility and engineering applications. In this work,
a micropolar peridynamics approach with non-unified horizon (NHPD) is proposed.
This approach is implemented in a conventional finite element framework, using
element-based discretization. By modifying the dual horizon approach into the
pre-processing part, point dependent horizon and non-unified beam-like bonds
are built. By implementing a domain correction strategy, the equivalence of
strain energy density is assured. Then, a novel energy density-based failure
criterion is presented which directly bridges the critical stretch to the
mechanical strength. The numerical results indicate the weak mesh dependency of
NHPD and the effectiveness of the new failure criterion. Moreover, it is proven
that damage of solid with different non-local effects can lead to similar
results by only adjusting the mechanical strength.

propagating lattice waves, are the main heat carriers in perfect crystals. As a
result, in many crystals, e.g., bulk silicon, the temperature-dependent thermal
conductivity shows the classical 1/T relationship because of the dominant
Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering in the systems. However, the thermal
conductivity of many crystalline metal-organic frameworks is very low and shows
no, a weakly negative and even a weakly positive temperature dependence
(glass-like thermal conductivity). It has been in debate whether the thermal
transport can be still described by phonons in metal-organic frameworks. Here,
by studying two typical systems, i.e., crystal zeolitic imidazolate framework-4
(cZIF-4) and crystal zeolitic imidazolate framework-62 (c-ZIF62), we prove that
the ultralow thermal conductivity in metal-organic frameworks is resulting from
the strong phonon intrinsic structure scattering due to the large mass
difference and the large cavity between Zn and N atoms. Our mean free path
spectrum analysis shows that both propagating and non-propagating anharmonic
vibrational modes exist in the systems, and contribute largely to the thermal
conductivity. The corresponding weakly negative or positive temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity is stemming from the competition between
the propagating and non-propagating anharmonic vibrational modes. Our study
here provides a fundamental understanding of thermal transport in metal-organic
frameworks and will guide the design of the thermal-related applications using
metal-organic frameworks, e.g., inflammable gas storage, chemical catalysis,
solar thermal conversion and so on.

from the NV center's low probability of coherent photon emission and
collection. Integration into a cavity can boost both values via the Purcell
effect, but poor optical coherence of near-surface NV centers has so far
prevented their resonant optical control, as would be required for entanglement
generation. Here, we overcome this challenge, and demonstrate resonant
addressing of individual, fiber-cavity-coupled NV centers, and collection of
their Purcell-enhanced coherent photon emission. Utilizing off-resonant and
resonant addressing protocols, we extract Purcell factors of up to 4,
consistent with a detailed theoretical model. This model predicts that the
probability of coherent photon detection per optical excitation can be
increased to 10% for realistic parameters - an improvement over state-of-the

resonant operation of an improved optical interface for single coherent quantum
emitters in a closed-cycle cryogenic system at T $\sim$ 4 K is an important

models. One potent type of attack are universal adversarial triggers, which are
individual n-grams that, when appended to instances of a class under attack,
can trick a model into predicting a target class. However, for inference tasks
such as fact checking, these triggers often inadvertently invert the meaning of
instances they are inserted in. In addition, such attacks produce semantically
nonsensical inputs, as they simply concatenate triggers to existing samples.
Here, we investigate how to generate adversarial attacks against fact checking
systems that preserve the ground truth meaning and are semantically valid. We
extend the HotFlip attack algorithm used for universal trigger generation by
jointly minimising the target class loss of a fact checking model and the
entailment class loss of an auxiliary natural language inference model. We then
train a conditional language model to generate semantically valid statements,
which include the found universal triggers. We find that the generated attacks
maintain the directionality and semantic validity of the claim better than

$k$-clique membership listing (for any $k\geq 3$), 4-cycle listing and 5-cycle
listing can be deterministically solved in $O(1)$-amortized round complexity,
even with limited logarithmic-sized messages.
  To achieve $k$-clique membership listing we introduce a very useful
combinatorial structure which we name the robust $2$-hop neighborhood. This is
a subset of the 2-hop neighborhood of a node, and we prove that it can be
maintained in highly dynamic networks in $O(1)$-amortized rounds. We also show
that maintaining the actual 2-hop neighborhood of a node requires near linear
amortized time, showing the necessity of our definition. For $4$-cycle and
$5$-cycle listing, we need edges within hop distance 3, for which we similarly
define the robust $3$-hop neighborhood and prove it can be maintained in highly
dynamic networks in $O(1)$-amortized rounds.
  We complement the above with several impossibility results. We show that
membership listing of any other graph on $k\geq 3$ nodes except $k$-clique
requires an almost linear number of amortized communication rounds. We also
show that $k$-cycle listing for $k\geq 6$ requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n} / \log n)$

matter halo? Using the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) group catalogue, we
address this question by exploring the dependence on host halo mass of the
luminosity function (LF) and stellar mass function (SMF) for grouped galaxies
subdivided by colour, morphology and central/satellite. We find that spheroidal
galaxies in particular dominate the bright and massive ends of the LF and SMF,
respectively. More massive haloes host more massive and more luminous central
galaxies. The satellite LF and SMF respectively show a systematic brightening
of characteristic magnitude, and increase in characteristic mass, with
increasing halo mass. In contrast to some previous results, the faint-end and
low-mass slopes show little systematic dependence on halo mass. Semi-analytic
models and simulations show similar or enhanced dependence of central mass and
luminosity on halo mass. Faint and low-mass simulated satellite galaxies are
remarkably independent of halo mass, but the most massive satellites are more
common in more massive groups. In the first investigation of low-redshift LF
and SMF evolution in group environments, we find that the red/blue ratio of
galaxies in groups has increased since redshift $z \approx 0.3$ relative to the
field population. This observation strongly suggests that quenching of star
formation in galaxies as they are accreted into galaxy groups is a significant
and ongoing process.

selection where a tracking-error penalization is added to the mean-variance
criterion. The tracking error term penalizes the distance between the
allocation controls and a reference portfolio with same wealth and fixed
weights. Such consideration is motivated as follows: (i) On the one hand, it is
a way to robustify the mean-variance allocation in case of misspecified
parameters, by ""fitting"" it to a reference portfolio that can be agnostic to
market parameters; (ii) On the other hand, it is a procedure to track a
benchmark and improve the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio by
considering a mean-variance criterion in the objective function. This problem
is formulated as a McKean-Vlasov control problem. We provide explicit solutions
for the optimal portfolio strategy and asymptotic expansions of the portfolio
strategy and efficient frontier for small values of the tracking error
parameter. Finally, we compare the Sharpe ratios obtained by the standard
mean-variance allocation and the penalized one for four different reference
portfolios: equal-weights, minimum-variance, equal risk contributions and
shrinking portfolio. This comparison is done on a simulated misspecified model,

corresponding auxiliary vector of it, respectively), the first one leads to
Navier-Stokes like equation. Here we devote our investigation on the other two
members. We find that $R_{ab}l^al^b$, which yields the evolution equation for
expansion parameter corresponding to $l^a$ along itself, can be interpreted as
a thermodynamic relation when integrated on the two dimensional transverse
subspace of the null hypersurface along with a virtual displacement in the
direction of $l^a$. Moreover for a stationary background the integrated version
of it yields the general form of Smarr formula. Although this is more or less
known in literature, but a similar argument for the evolution equation of the
expansion parameter corresponding to $k^a$ along $l^a$, provided by
$R_{ab}l^ak^b$, leads to a more convenient form of thermodynamic relation. In
this analysis, contrary to earlier approaches, the identified thermodynamic
entities come out to be in covariant forms and also are foliation independent.
Hence these can be applied to any coordinate system adapted to the null
hypersurface. Moreover, these results are not restricted to any specific
parametrisation of $k^a$ and also $k^a$ need not be hypersurface orthogonal. In
addition, here any particular dynamical equation for metric is not being
explicitly used and therefore we feel that our results are solely based on the
properties of the null surface.

on density functional theory, we found that the concentration as well as
coordination of surface oxygen vacancies with respect to each other were
critical for direct water-splitting reaction on the (001) surfaces of PbTiO$_3$
and TiO$_2$. For the water-splitting reaction to happen on TiO$_2$-terminated
surfaces, it is necessary to have two neighboring O-vacancies acting as active
sites that host two adsorbing water molecules. However, eventual dissociation
of O-H bonds is possible only in the presence of an additional nearest-neighbor
O-vacancy. Unfortunately, this necessary third vacancy inhibits the formation
of molecular hydrogen by trapping the dissociated H atoms over
TiO$_2$-teminated surfaces. Formation of up to 3 O-vacancies, is energetically
less costly on both terminations of PbTiO$_3$ (001) surfaces compared with that
of TiO$_2$, the presence of Pb leads to weaker O bonds over these surfaces.
Molecular hydrogen formation is more favorable over the PbO-terminated surface
of PbTiO$_3$, requiring only two neighboring oxygen vacancies. However,
hydrogen molecule is retained near the surface by weak van der Waals forces.
Our study indicates two barriers leading to low productivity of direct water
splitting processes. First and foremost, there is an entropic barrier imposed
by the requirement of at least two nearest-neighbor O-vacancies, sterically
hindering the process. Furthermore, there are also enthalpic barriers of
formation over TiO$_2$-terminated surfaces, or removal of H$_2$ molecules from
the PbO-terminated surface.

observations, to define the knowledge base. We performed various tests to
quantify how well CNNs can identify cluster members on the basis of imaging
information only. We investigated the CNN capability to predict source
memberships outside the training coverage, by identifying CLMs at the faint end
of the magnitude distributions. We find that the CNNs achieve a
purity-completeness rate ~90%, demonstrating stable behaviour, along with a
remarkable generalisation capability with respect to cluster redshifts. We
concluded that if extensive spectroscopic information is available as a
training base, the proposed approach is a valid alternative to catalogue-based
methods because it has the advantage of avoiding photometric measurements,
which are particularly challenging and time-consuming in crowded cluster cores.
As a byproduct, we identified 372 photometric CLMs, with mag(F814)<25, to

cached in at least one of the caches connected to the user. Our objective is to

$\texttt{LeadCache}$ is regret-optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}(n^{3/8}),$

show that the total number of file fetches under $\texttt{LeadCache}$ remains
almost surely finite over an infinite horizon. Finally, we derive an
approximately tight regret lower bound using results from graph coloring. We
conclude that the learning-based $\texttt{LeadCache}$ policy decisively

electromechanical devices, specifically as part of workflows that check
electromagnetic compatibility. A novel scheme to extract impedances from CAD
device models, suitable for a finite element implementation, is derived from
Maxwell's equations in differential form. It provides a foundation for
parasitic extraction across a broad frequency range and is able to handle
inhomogeneous permittivities and permeabilities, making it more flexible than
existing integral equation approaches. The approach allows for the automatic
treatment of multi-port models of arbitrary conductor geometry without
requiring any significant manual user interaction. This is achieved by
computing a connecting source current density that supplies current to the
model's terminals, whatever their location in the model, subsequently using
this current density to compute the electric field, and finally calculating the
impedance via a scalar potential. A mandatory low-frequency stabilization
scheme is outlined, ensuring a stable evaluation of the model at low
frequencies as well. Two quasistatic approximations and the special case of
perfect electric conductors are treated theoretically. The magnetoquasistatic
approximation is validated against an analytical model in a numerical
experiment. Moreover, the intrinsic capability of the method to treat
inhomogeneous permittivities and permeabilities is demonstrated with a simple
capacitor-coil model including dielectric insulation and magnetic core
materials.

a low dimensional part-based representation of data. On the other hand, the
inherent structure of the each data cluster can be described by the
distribution of the intraclass samples. Then one hopes to learn a new low
dimensional representation which can preserve the intrinsic structure embedded
in the original high dimensional data space perfectly. In this paper, by
preserving the data distribution, a deep part-based representation can be
learned, and the novel algorithm is called Distribution Preserving Network
Embedding (DPNE). In DPNE, we first need to estimate the distribution of the
original high dimensional data using the $k$-nearest neighbor kernel density
estimation, and then we seek a part-based representation which respects the
above distribution. The experimental results on the real-world data sets show
that the proposed algorithm has good performance in terms of cluster accuracy

preserved in the low dimensional feature space.

GNN, apart from the linear transformation which maps the per node input
features to the corresponding higher level features, a per node masked
attention by specifying different weights to different nodes in its first ring
neighborhood is also performed. The masked attention implicitly accounts for

popular sources of energy connected to LV distribution networks. With the
greater integration of solar PV into LV distribution networks, utility
providers impose caps to solar penetration in order to operate their network
safely and within acceptable norms. One parameter that restricts solar PV
penetration is unbalances created by loads and single-phase rooftop schemes
connected to LV distribution grids. In this paper, a novel method is proposed
to mitigate voltage unbalance in LV distribution grids by optimally re-phasing
grid-connected rooftop PV systems. A modified version of the discrete bacterial

technique to minimize the overall voltage unbalance of the network as the
objective function, subjected to various network and operating parameters. The
impact of utilizing the proposed PV re-phasing technique as opposed to a fixed

observed hourly throughout the day. The case studies show that the proposed

which can be quantised \`a la Faddeev and Popov. We derive a compact expression
for the massive $p$-form effective action, $\Gamma^{(m)}_p$, in terms of the

coincide modulo a topological term. Finally, our analysis is extended to the
case of massive super $p$-forms coupled to background ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity

following massive super $p$-forms: (i) vector multiplet; (ii) tensor multiplet;
and (iii) three-form multiplet. It is demonstrated that the effective actions

solving the parameter inference problem for a single population using Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods. Here we extend SIP to address multiple related
populations simultaneously. Specifically, we simulate control and treatment

SIP is reformulated as the constrained-optimization problem of finding
distributions of model parameters. To minimize the divergence between
distributions of experimental observations and model outputs, we developed
novel deep learning models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)

The flexibility of GANs allowed us to build computationally scalable solutions

routinely in physics, biophysics, economics and other areas, and which can not

generating counterfactual examples for images is non-trivial due to the
underlying causal structure on the various features of an image. To be
meaningful, generated perturbations need to satisfy constraints implied by the
causal model. We present a method for generating counterfactuals by
incorporating a structural causal model (SCM) in an improved variant of
Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI), that generates counterfactuals in
accordance with the causal relationships between attributes of an image. Based
on the generated counterfactuals, we show how to explain a pre-trained machine
learning classifier, evaluate its bias, and mitigate the bias using a
counterfactual regularizer. On the Morpho-MNIST dataset, our method generates
counterfactuals comparable in quality to prior work on SCM-based
counterfactuals (DeepSCM), while on the more complex CelebA dataset our method
outperforms DeepSCM in generating high-quality valid counterfactuals. Moreover,
generated counterfactuals are indistinguishable from reconstructed images in a
human evaluation experiment and we subsequently use them to evaluate the
fairness of a standard classifier trained on CelebA data. We show that the
classifier is biased w.r.t. skin and hair color, and how counterfactual
regularization can remove those biases.

mechanistic computational modelling could yield a reliable infrastructure to
run probabilistic simulations where the entire organism is considered as a
whole. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced AI
approaches and integrates mathematical modelling in order to provide a
panoramic view over current and future physiological conditions. The proposed
architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNNs) forecasting clinically
relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial
network (GANs) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability.
Results: We show the results of the investigation of pathological effects of
overexpression of ACE2 across different signalling pathways in multiple tissues
on cardiovascular functions. We provide a proof of concept of integrating a
large set of composable clinical models using molecular data to drive local and
global clinical parameters and derive future trajectories representing the
evolution of the physiological state of the patient. Significance: We argue
that the graph representation of a computational patient has potential to solve
important technological challenges in integrating multiscale computational
modelling with AI. We believe that this work represents a step forward towards
a healthcare digital twin.

eccentricities while emitting gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO/VIRGO band.
We study tidal effects in such eccentric inspiralling NS binaries using a set
of hybrid equations. The NS is modelled as a compressible ellipsoid, which can
deform nonlinearly due to tidal forces, while the orbit evolution is treated
with the post-Newtonian (PN) theory up to 2.5-PN order. We find that in
general, the tidal interaction can accelerate the inspiral, and cause orbital
frequency and phase shifts. For circular inspirals, our calculations reproduce
previous linear result at large binary separations, but incorporate the
dynamical response of the NS at small separations. For eccentric inspirals, the
frequency and phase shifts oscillate considerably near pericenter passages, and
the oscillating amplitudes increase with eccentricities. As a result, the GW
phase is also significantly influenced by the tidal effect. At merger, the
cumulative GW phase shift can reach more than 10 radians (for typical NS mass
$1.4M_\odot$ and radius 11.6 km), much larger than the circular inspiral case.
Although the event rate of eccentric NS mergers is likely low, the detection of
such mergers could provide a useful constraint on the NS equation of state.

We investigate synthetic observational signatures generated from
numerical models of transverse waves propagating in braided magnetic fields.
Methods. We examine two simulations with different levels of magnetic field
braiding and impose a periodic, transverse wave driver at the lower boundary.
After waves reflect off the top boundary, a complex pattern of wave
interference forms. We analyse the synthetic emission produced by the forward
modelling code, FoMo. We examine line intensity, Doppler shifts and kinetic
energy along several line-of-sight (LOS) angles. Results. The Doppler shifts
showed the presence of transverse waves. However, when analysing the intensity,
waves are less easily observed for more complex magnetic fields and may be
mistaken for background noise. Depending on the LOS angle, the observable
signatures of waves reflect some of the magnetic field braiding, particularly
when multiple emission lines are available. In the more braided simulation,
signatures of phase mixing can be identified. We identify possible ambiguities
in the interpretation of wave modes based on the synthetic emission signatures.
Conclusions. Most of the observables within this article behave as expected,
given knowledge of the evolution of the parameters in 3D space. However, some
intriguing observational signatures are present. Detecting regions of magnetic
field complexity is somewhat possible when waves are present. However,
simultaneous spectroscopic imaging from different lines is important to
identify these locations. Care needs to be taken when interpreting intensity
and Doppler velocity signatures as torsional motions as, in our setup, such
signatures were a consequence of the magnetic field complexity and not
torsional waves. Finally, the kinetic energy, estimated with Doppler
velocities, is dependent on the polarisation of the wave, complexity of the
background field and the LOS.

Our model also uses deep reinforcement learning to evaluate threshold utility

relies on a stochastic search to find user model that best agrees with a given
partial preference profile. Multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria

Pareto-optimal outcomes thereby increasing the number of successful (win-win)

larger than previously estimated uncertainties and discuss shortcomings of the
original calculation. Specifically, through the use of a self-consistent
Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Slater calculation, we find that the atomic exchange effect
increases the predicted flux by $10(3)\%$ at 1 keV relative to previous
exchange calculations. Further, using a shell model calculation of the nuclear
structure contribution to the shape factor, we find a strong disagreement with
the allowed shape factor and discuss several sources of uncertainty. In the
1-200 keV window, the predicted flux is up to 20$\%$ lower. Finally, we discuss
omissions and detector effects in previously used QED radiative corrections,
and find small changes in the slope at the $\gtrsim 1\%$ MeV$^{-1}$ level, up
to $3\%$ in magnitude due to omissions in $\mathcal{O}(Z\alpha^2, Z^2\alpha^3)$
corrections and $3.5\%$ uncertainty from the neglect of as of yet unavailable

movement and users barred from other networks. It presents an interesting
opportunity for research because near-complete data is available from day one
of the network's creation. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the
user interaction graph, that is the graph where a link represents a user
interacting with another user at a given time. We view this graph both at
different times and at different timescales. The latter is achieved by using
sliding windows on the graph which gives a novel perspective on social network
data. The Gab network is relatively slowly growing over the period of months
but subject to large bursts of arrivals over hours and days. We identify
plausible events that are of interest to the Gab community associated with the
most obvious such bursts. The network is characterised by interactions between
`strangers' rather than by reinforcing links between `friends'. Gab usage
follows the diurnal cycle of the predominantly US and Europe based users. At
off-peak hours the Gab interaction network fragments into sub-networks with
absolutely no interaction between them. A small group of users are highly
influential across larger timescales, but a substantial number of users gain
influence for short periods of time. Temporal analysis at different timescales
gives new insights above and beyond what could be found on static graphs.

have been shown to memorize random labels which affect their generalization
performance. We consider learning in isolation, using one-hot encoded labels as
the sole source of supervision, and a lack of regularization to discourage
memorization as the major shortcomings of the standard training procedure.
Thus, we propose Noisy Concurrent Training (NCT) which leverages collaborative
learning to use the consensus between two models as an additional source of
supervision. Furthermore, inspired by trial-to-trial variability in the brain,
we propose a counter-intuitive regularization technique, target variability,
which entails randomly changing the labels of a percentage of training samples
in each batch as a deterrent to memorization and over-generalization in DNNs.
Target variability is applied independently to each model to keep them diverged
and avoid the confirmation bias. As DNNs tend to prioritize learning simple
patterns first before memorizing the noisy labels, we employ a dynamic learning
scheme whereby as the training progresses, the two models increasingly rely
more on their consensus. NCT also progressively increases the target
variability to avoid memorization in later stages. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world noisy benchmark

complicated models with large data sets is to deal with stragglers effect. As a
solution, coded computation has been recently proposed to efficiently add
redundancy to the computation tasks. In this technique, coding is used across
data sets, and computation is done over coded data, such that the results of an
arbitrary subset of worker nodes with a certain size are enough to recover the
final results. The major challenges with those approaches are (1) they are
limited to polynomial function computations, (2) the size of the subset of
servers that we need to wait for grows with the multiplication of the size of
the data set and the model complexity (the degree of the polynomial), which can
be prohibitively large, (3) they are not numerically stable for computation
over real numbers. In this paper, we propose Berrut Approximated Coded
Computing (BACC), as an alternative approach, which is not limited to
polynomial function computation. In addition, the master node can approximately
calculate the final results, using the outcomes of any arbitrary subset of
available worker nodes. The approximation approach is proven to be numerically
stable with low computational complexity. In addition, the accuracy of the
approximation is established theoretically and verified by simulation results
in different settings such as distributed learning problems. In particular,
BACC is used to train a deep neural network on a cluster of servers, which
outperforms repetitive computation (repetition coding) in terms of the rate of
convergence.

estimation and radar detection of multiple point-like targets. The first
strategy, which appears here for the first time, jointly exploits the maximum
likelihood approach and Bayesian learning to estimate targets' parameters
including their positions in terms of range bins. The second strategy relies on
the intuition that for high signal-to-interference plus-noise ratio values, the
energy of data containing target components projected onto the nominal steering
direction should be higher than the energy of data affected by interference
only. The adaptivity with respect to the interference covariance matrix is also
considered exploiting a training data set collected in the proximity of the
window under test. Finally, another important innovation aspect concerns the
adaptive estimation of the unknown number of targets by means of the model
order selection rules.

datasets and 8 languages to study the accuracy of sequence labeling with
various embedding concatenations and make three observations: (1) concatenating
more embedding variants leads to better accuracy in rich-resource and
cross-domain settings and some conditions of low-resource settings; (2)
concatenating additional contextual sub-word embeddings with contextual

many fields of science. The corrected Akaike and Bayesian information criteria
(AICc and BIC) are most frequently used to select the optimal number of fitting
parameters. In general, AICc modelling is thought to overfit (too many model
parameters) and BIC underfits. For spectroscopic modelling, both AICc and BIC
lack in two important respects: (a) no penalty distinction is made according to
line strength such that parameters of weak lines close to the detection
threshold are treated with equal importance as strong lines and (b) no account
is taken of the way in which spectral lines impact on narrow data regions. In
this paper we introduce a new information criterion that addresses these
shortcomings, the ""Spectral Information Criterion"" (SpIC). Spectral simulations
are used to compare performances. The main findings are (i) SpIC clearly
outperforms AICc for high signal to noise data, (ii) SpIC and AICc work equally
well for lower signal to noise data, although SpIC achieves this with fewer
parameters, and (iii) BIC does not perform well (for this application) and
should be avoided. The new method should be of broader applicability (beyond
spectroscopy), wherever different model parameters influence separated small
ranges within a larger dataset and/or have widely varying sensitivities.

as well as ground-based follow-up transit observations from MEarth and LCOGT

radius of 1.85+-0.13 Re, and a mass of 4.0+-0.9 Me; and for the outer planet,
TOI-776 c, a period of 15.66 d, a radius of 2.02+-0.14 Re, and a mass of
5.3+-1.8 Me. The Doppler data shows one additional signal, with a period of 34
d, associated with the rotational period of the star. The analysis of fifteen
years of ground-based photometric monitoring data and the inspection of
different spectral line indicators confirm this assumption. The bulk densities
of TOI-776 b and c allow for a wide range of possible interior and atmospheric
compositions. However, both planets have retained a significant atmosphere,
with slightly different envelope mass fractions. Thanks to their location near
the radius gap for M dwarfs, we can start to explore the mechanism(s)
responsible for the radius valley emergence around low-mass stars as compared
to solar-like stars. While a larger sample of well-characterized planets in
this parameter space is still needed to draw firm conclusions, we tentatively
estimate that the stellar mass below which thermally-driven mass loss is no
longer the main formation pathway for sculpting the radius valley is between
0.63 and 0.54 Msun. Due to the brightness of the star, the TOI-776 system is
also an excellent target for the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a
remarkable laboratory to break the degeneracy in planetary interior models and
to test formation and evolution theories of small planets around low-mass
stars.

field. Metastable lifetime or the reversal time of magnetisation for the system
having uniform anisotropy and in the presence of both graded and stepped field
has been studied. Also the same has been explored for a {\it graded and stepped

analyzed for the variation of reversal time with gradient of field ($G_h$) and
a scaling relation $\langle \tau \rangle \sim L^{-\beta} f(G_h L^\alpha)$ is
proposed. Spatial variation of density profile for the projection states (i.e.,
+1, 0 and -1) has also been studied at the moment of reversal of magnetisation.
The spatial variation of the number of spin flips per site is studied. Motion
of the interface (or domain wall) with the gradient of field and gradient of
anisotropy are investigated and are found to follow the hyperbolic tangent like
behaviours in both cases. Since, both the anisotropy and the applied field have

scenario is observed for a {\it graded anisotropic system in graded field} and
a {\it stepped anisotropic system in stepped field}. A line of marginal
competition has been found out for both the cases separating the regions of
field dominated reversal and anisotropy dominated reversal. The decay of the
metastable volume fraction was found to follow the Avrami's law. The mean
reversal time was observed to decrease monotonically across the phase boundary

inorganic nanostructures when infiltrating in patterned polymer films or in
selfassembled block copolymers. A SIS process consists in a controlled sequence
of metal organic precursor and co-reactant vapor exposure cycles of the polymer
films in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor. In this work, we present a
study of the SIS process of alumina using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O in
various polymer films using in situ dynamic spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). In
situ dynamic SE enables time-resolved monitoring of the swelling of the
polymer, which is relevant to the diffusion and retain of the metal precursor
into the polymer itself. Different swelling behaviour of
poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) was observed when exposed
to TMA vapor. PMMA films swell more significantly than PS films do, resulting
in very different infiltrated Al2O3 thickness after polymer removal in O2
plasma. PMMA films reach different swollen states upon TMA exposure and
reaction with H2O, depending on the TMA dose and on the purge duration after
TMA exposure, which correspond to different amounts of metal precursor retained
inside the polymer and converted to alumina. Diffusion coefficients of TMA in
PMMA were extracted investigating the swelling of pristine PMMA films during
TMA infiltration and shown to be dependent on polymer molecular weight. In situ
dynamic SE monitoring allows to control the SIS process tuning it from an
ALD-like process for long purge to a chemical vapour deposition - like process

communications are used to formulate a Markov decision process in DRL. To
reduce the convergence time and improve the QoS of each user, we design a
knowledge-assisted DDPG (K-DDPG) that exploits expert knowledge of the
scheduler design problem, such as the knowledge of the QoS, the target
scheduling policy, and the importance of each training sample, determined by
the approximation error of the value function and the number of packet losses.
Furthermore, we develop an architecture for online training and inference,
where K-DDPG initializes the scheduler off-line and then fine-tunes the
scheduler online to handle the mismatch between off-line simulations and
non-stationary real-world systems. Simulation results show that our approach
reduces the convergence time of DDPG significantly and achieves better QoS than
existing schedulers (reducing 30% ~ 50% packet losses). Experimental results
show that with off-line initialization, our approach achieves better initial
QoS than random initialization and the online fine-tuning converges in few
minutes.

The classical approach based on cross-correlations of binned light curves

full complexity of the problem.
  Aims. To present a statistically proper and robust GRB timing/triangulation
algorithm as a modern update to the original procedures used for the
Interplanetary Network (IPN).
  Methods. A hierarchical Bayesian forward model for the unknown temporal
signal evolution is learned via random Fourier features (RFF) and fitted to
each detector's time-series data with time-differences that correspond to GRB's
position on the sky via the appropriate Poisson likelihood.
  Results. Our novel method can robustly estimate the position of a GRB as
verified via simulations. The uncertainties generated by the method are robust

In this article the region of validity for a feedback law is extended. More
precisely, the optimal polytopes are extended to nonlinearly bounded regions of
validity resulting from the intersection of a feasibility and stability region.
As a result, fewer quadratic programs need to be solved compared to the optimal
approach. The new validity regions are still suitable for the evaluation on a
lean local node. Moreover, the regions can be adjusted for a desired

dissect a network motif between monomeric (m) and trimeric (t) GTPases
assembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms. To this
end, we develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two
classes of GTPases are interlinked conditional to their ON/OFF states within a
motif through feedforward and feedback loops. We provide formulas for the
steady states of the system and perform local stability analysis to investigate
the role of the different connections between the GTPase switches. A
feedforward from the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to
provide two locally stable states: one where both active/inactive forms of the
mGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where
both m- and tGTPase have high concentrations. When a feedback loop from the GEF
of the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the feedforward system,
two other locally stable states emerged, both having the tGTPase inactivated
and being interpreted as having low active tGTPase concentrations. Finally, the
addition of a second feedback loop, from the active tGTPase to the GAP of the
mGTPase, gives rise to a family of steady states parametrized by the inactive
tGTPase concentrations. Our findings reveal that the coupling of these two

unnecessarily deep hierarchy of AST, the property of which makes the model more
efficient. We develop GraphCodeBERT based on Transformer. In addition to using
the task of masked language modeling, we introduce two structure-aware
pre-training tasks. One is to predict code structure edges, and the other is to
align representations between source code and code structure. We implement the
model in an efficient way with a graph-guided masked attention function to
incorporate the code structure. We evaluate our model on four tasks, including
code search, clone detection, code translation, and code refinement. Results
show that code structure and newly introduced pre-training tasks can improve
GraphCodeBERT and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the four downstream
tasks. We further show that the model prefers structure-level attentions over
token-level attentions in the task of code search.

mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE).
A hallmark of turbulence is spontaneous generation of intense whirls, resulting
from amplification of the fluid rotation-rate (vorticity) by its
deformation-rate (strain). This interaction, encoded in the non-linearity of
INSE, is non-local, i.e., depends on the entire state of the flow, constituting
a serious hindrance in turbulence theory and in establishing regularity of
INSE. Here, we unveil a novel aspect of this interaction, by separating strain
into local and non-local contributions utilizing the Biot-Savart integral of
vorticity in a sphere of radius R. Analyzing highly-resolved numerical
turbulent solutions to INSE, we find that when vorticity becomes very large,
the local strain over small R surprisingly counteracts further amplification.
This uncovered self-attenuation mechanism is further shown to be connected to
local Beltramization of the flow, and could provide a direction in establishing
the regularity of INSE.

models have been useful to predict fixation locations in natural images, but
are static, i.e., they provide no information about the time-sequence of
fixations. Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges in the field is to go beyond
saliency maps to predict a sequence of fixations related to a visual task, such
as searching for a given target. Bayesian observer models have been proposed
for this task, as they represent visual search as an active sampling process.
Nevertheless, they were mostly evaluated on artificial images, and how they
adapt to natural images remains largely unexplored.
  Here, we propose a unified Bayesian model for visual search guided by
saliency maps as prior information. We validated our model with a visual search
experiment in natural scenes recording eye movements. We show that, although
state-of-the-art saliency models perform well in predicting the first two
fixations in a visual search task, their performance degrades to chance
afterward. This suggests that saliency maps alone are good to model bottom-up
first impressions, but are not enough to explain the scanpaths when top-down
task information is critical. Thus, we propose to use them as priors of
Bayesian searchers. This approach leads to a behavior very similar to humans
for the whole scanpath, both in the percentage of target found as a function of
the fixation rank and the scanpath similarity, reproducing the entire sequence
of eye movements.

challenge for galaxy evolution theories. This process of ""star formation
quenching"" has been related to various causes, including Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) activity, the influence of large-scale dynamics, and the environment in
which galaxies live. In this paper, we present the first results from a
follow-up of CALIFA survey galaxies with observations of molecular gas obtained
with the APEX telescope. Together with EDGE survey CARMA observations, we
collect $^{12}$CO observations that cover approximately one effective radius in
472 CALIFA galaxies. We observe that the deficit of galaxy star formation with
respect to the star formation main sequence (SFMS) increases with the absence
of molecular gas and with a reduced efficiency of conversion of molecular gas
into stars, in line with results of other integrated studies. However, by
dividing the sample into galaxies dominated by star formation and galaxies
quenched in their centres (as indicated by the average value of the H$\alpha$
equivalent width), we find that this deficit increases sharply once a certain
level of gas consumption is reached, indicating that different mechanisms drive
separation from the SFMS in star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our results
indicate that differences in the amount of molecular gas at a fixed stellar
mass are the primary driver for the dispersion in the SFMS, and the most likely
explanation for the start of star-formation quenching. However, once a galaxy
is quenched, changes in star formation efficiency drive how much a retired
galaxy separates in star formation rate from star-forming ones of similar
masses. In other words, once a paucity of molecular gas has significantly
reduced star formation, changes in the star formation efficiency are what
drives a galaxy deeper into the red cloud, retiring it.

healthcare applications because they allow researchers to test hypotheses
\textit{in silico} and predict the outcome of experiments and interactions that
are very hard to test in reality. Yet, what is meant by ""computational model""
is understood in many different ways by researchers in different fields of
neuroscience and psychology, hindering communication and collaboration. In this
review, we point out the state of the art of computational modeling in
Electroencephalography (EEG) and outline how these models can be used to
integrate findings from electrophysiology, network-level models, and behavior.
On the one hand, computational models serve to investigate the mechanisms that
generate brain activity, for example measured with EEG, such as the transient
emergence of oscillations at different frequency bands and/or with different
spatial topographies. On the other hand, computational models serve to design
experiments and test hypotheses \emph{in silico}. The final purpose of
computational models of EEG is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanisms that underlie the EEG signal. This is crucial for an accurate
interpretation of EEG measurements that may ultimately serve in the development
of novel clinical applications.

  Interval-Valued Survey Response Mode","59 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Behavior Research Methods",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Obtaining quantitative survey responses that are both accurate and
informative is crucial to a wide range of fields. Traditional and ubiquitous
response formats such as Likert and Visual Analogue Scales require condensation
of responses into discrete point values - but sometimes a range of options may
better represent the correct answer. In this paper, we propose an efficient
interval-valued response mode, whereby responses are made by marking an ellipse
along a continuous scale. We discuss its potential to capture and quantify
valuable information that would be lost using conventional approaches, while
preserving a high degree of response-efficiency. The information captured by
the response interval may represent a possible response range - i.e., a
conjunctive set, such as the real numbers between three and six. Alternatively,
it may reflect uncertainty in respect to a distinct response - i.e., a
disjunctive set, such as a confidence interval. We then report a validation
study, utilizing our recently introduced open-source software (DECSYS) to
explore how interval-valued survey responses reflect experimental manipulations
of several factors hypothesised to influence interval width, across multiple
contexts. Results consistently indicate that respondents used interval widths
effectively, and subjective participant feedback was also positive. We present
this as initial empirical evidence for the efficacy and value of
interval-valued response capture. Interestingly, our results also provide
insight into respondents' reasoning about the different aforementioned types of
intervals - we replicate a tendency towards overconfidence for those
representing epistemic uncertainty (i.e., disjunctive sets), but find intervals
representing inherent range (i.e., conjunctive sets) to be well-calibrated.

from a dynamic execution trace recorded while the system is under a benchmark
load. These locking rules can e.g. be used to locate synchronization bugs. For
high rule precision and thorough bug finding, the approach heavily depends on
the choice of benchmarks: They must trigger the execution of as much code as
possible in the kernel subsystem relevant for the targeted data structures.
However, existing test suites such as those provided by the Linux Test Project
(LTP) only achieve -- in the case of LTP -- about 35 percent basic-block
coverage for the VFS subsystem, which is the relevant subsystem when extracting
locking rules for filesystem-related data structures.
  In this article, we discuss how to complement the LTP suites to improve the
code coverage for our LockDoc scenario. We repurpose syzkaller -- a
coverage-guided fuzzer with the goal to validate the robustness of kernel APIs
-- to 1) not aim for kernel crashes, and to 2) maximize code coverage for a
specific kernel subsystem. Thereby, we generate new benchmark programs that can
be run in addition to the LTP, and increase VFS basic-block coverage by 26.1

means of structured arguments whose premises are pervaded with uncertainty. We
measure the strength of these arguments in order to determine the set of
compatible goals. We propose two novel ways for calculating the strength of
these arguments, depending on the kind of incompatibility that exists between
them. The first one is the logical strength value, it is denoted by a
three-dimensional vector, which is calculated from a probabilistic interval
associated with each argument. The vector represents the precision of the
interval, the location of it, and the combination of precision and location.
This type of representation and treatment of the strength of a structured

for calculating the strength of the argument is based on the cost of the plans
(regarding the necessary resources) and the preference of the goals associated
with the plans. Considering our novel approach for measuring the strength of
structured arguments, we propose a semantics for the selection of plans and
goals that is based on Dung's abstract argumentation theory. Finally, we make a

(MCMC) is a principled framework for large-scale uncertainty quantification,
though is limited in practice by computational cost when implemented in the

iteration of the MCMC. The delayed acceptance Metropolis--Hastings MCMC
leverages a reduced model for the forward map to lower the compute cost per
iteration, though necessarily reduces statistical efficiency that can, without
care, lead to no reduction in the computational cost of computing estimates to
a desired accuracy. Randomizing the reduced model for the forward map can
dramatically improve computational efficiency, by maintaining the low cost per
iteration but also avoiding appreciable loss of statistical efficiency.
Randomized maps are constructed by a posteriori adaptive tuning of a randomized
and locally-corrected deterministic reduced model. Equivalently, the
approximated posterior distribution may be viewed as induced by a modified
likelihood function for use with the reduced map, with parameters tuned to
optimize the quality of the approximation to the correct posterior
distribution. Conditions for adaptive MCMC algorithms allow practical
approximations and algorithms that have guaranteed ergodicity for the target
distribution. Good statistical and computational efficiencies are demonstrated
in examples of calibration of large-scale numerical models of geothermal

development of photovoltaics of the future. They are cheap and easy to
fabricate. However, up to now, they possess fundamental drawback: low
effectiveness. In the most popular BHJ (bulk heterojunction) architecture the
actual long-standing top efficiency is about 12\% (recent achievements about
15\%). One ask the question how fundamental this limitation is, as certain
theoretical considerations suggest that it should be about two times higher. In
our paper we analyze the `geometric factor' as one of possible explanation of
relatively low efficiency of BHJ architecture. More precisly, we calculate the
effective area of the donor-acceptor border in the random mixture of donor and
acceptor nanocrystals and further compare it with an ideal 'brush'
architecture. In our previous calculation for the two dimensional model, we
have found that the maximal value of geometric factor was about 40\%. In the
actual three dimensional model, it turned out that both architectures give very
close value of the effective area. So the geometric factor seems to be not
significant as a factor limiting efficiency. Implications of this fact are
discussed: we list two other factors (mentioned but not thoroughly discussed in
literature) which can be responsible for limitations of efficiency of BHJ
architecture. We estimate their scale, and suggest that these limitations are
inevitable, or at least very hard to overcome. We suggest that return to layer
architecture could radically improve efficiency limitations -- however, to make
breakthrough, materials with large exciton diffusion length have to be
invented.

of structures from correlation filtering, with a two regime power law decay in
the number of persistent simplicial complexes. Null models of the underlying
time series are tested to investigate properties of the generative process and
its evolutional constraints. Networks are generated with both TMFG filtering
technique and thresholding showing that embedding-based filtering methods
(TMFG) are able to identify higher order structures throughout the market

memory processes are used to characterise financial markets based on their
stage of development and liquidity. We find that more liquid markets tend to
have a slower persistence decay. This is in contrast with the common
understanding that developed markets are more random. We find that they are
indeed less predictable for what concerns the dynamics of each single variable
but they are more predictable for what concerns the collective evolution of the
variables. This could imply higher fragility to systemic shocks.

rehabilitation assessment methods (such as the popular clinical assessment) can
be subjective and expensive, and it is also less convenient for patients to
visit clinics in a high frequency. To address this issue, in this work based on
wearable sensing and machine learning techniques, we develop an automated
system that can predict the assessment score in an objective manner. With
wrist-worn sensors, accelerometer data is collected from 59 stroke survivors in
free-living environments for a duration of 8 weeks, and we map the week-wise
accelerometer data(3 days per week) to the assessment score by developing
signal processing and predictive model pipeline. To achieve this, we propose
two types of new features, which can encode the rehabilitation information from
both paralysed and non-paralysed sides while suppressing the high level noises
such as irrelevant daily activities. Based on the proposed features, we further
develop the longitudinal mixed-effects model with Gaussian process prior
(LMGP), which can model the random effects caused by different subjects and
time slots (during the 8 weeks). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to
evaluate our system on both acute and chronic patients, and the promising

societal concern and opposition, and health, safety, environmental and

advanced designs, both fission and fusion-based, to address both costs and
these risks. This Chapter complements these efforts by analyzing how nuclear
technologies can address societal concerns through the acquisition of a social
license, a nebulous concept that represents ""society's consent"" and that has
been used to facilitate and improve a wide range of publicly and privately
funded projects and activities subject to a range of regulatory oversight,
including large industrial facilities, controversial genetic engineering
research, and environmental management. Suggestions for public engagement and
consent-based siting, two aspects of a social license, have been made before.
This chapter modernizes these suggestions by briefly reviewing the social
license and engagement literature. The Chapter discusses, in the context of how
to acquire a social license, the role of government regulation, the role of
project proponents and government actors, and the role of four key principles,
including engendering trust, transparency, meaningful public engagement, and
protection of health, safety and the environment. Further, the Chapter uses the
social license concept to explain why some nuclear waste repositories have

  Forecasting in Telecommunication Networks",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Telecommunication networks play a critical role in modern society. With the
arrival of 5G networks, these systems are becoming even more diversified,
integrated, and intelligent. Traffic forecasting is one of the key components
in such a system, however, it is particularly challenging due to the complex
spatial-temporal dependency. In this work, we consider this problem from the
aspect of a cellular network and the interactions among its base stations. We
thoroughly investigate the characteristics of cellular network traffic and shed
light on the dependency complexities based on data collected from a densely
populated metropolis area. Specifically, we observe that the traffic shows both
dynamic and static spatial dependencies as well as diverse cyclic temporal
patterns. To address these complexities, we propose an effective
deep-learning-based approach, namely, Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Graph
Convolutional Network (STHGCN). It employs GRUs to model the temporal
dependency, while capturing the complex spatial dependency through a hybrid-GCN
from three perspectives: spatial proximity, functional similarity, and recent
trend similarity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world traffic
datasets collected from telecommunication networks. Our experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in that it consistently
outperforms both classical methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models,
while being more robust and stable.

tasks including Image to Text Alignment (ITA) task, Text to Image Alignment
(TIA) task and CVR prediction task. We use pre-trained BERT to generate the
text embedding and pre-trained InceptionV4 to generate image patch embedding
(each image is split into small patches with the same pixels and treat each
patch as an image token). Softmax gating networks follow to learn the weight of
each transformer expert output and choose only a subset of experts conditioned
on the input. Then transformer encoder is applied as the share-bottom layer to
learn all input features' shared interaction. Next, mixture of transformer
experts (MoE) layer is implemented to model different aspects of tasks. At top
of the MoE layer, we deploy a transformer layer for each task as task tower to
learn task-specific information. On the real word intra-city dataset,
experiments demonstrate CameNN outperform baselines and achieve significant
improvements on the image and text representation. In practice, we applied
CameNN on CVR prediction in our intra-city recommender system which is one of
the leading intra-city platforms operated in China.

clinical feedback that can extend to two to three weeks for standard
paraffin-embedded tissue preparation and interpretation. Here, we present a
label-free reflection-mode imaging modality that reveals cellular-scale
morphology by detecting intrinsic endogenous contrast. We accomplish this with
the novel photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) detection system that permits
non-contact optical absorption contrast to be extracted from thick and opaque
biological targets with optical resolution. PARS was examined both as a rapid
assessment tool that is capable of managing large samples (>1 cm2) in under 10
minutes, and as a high contrast imaging modality capable of extracting specific
biological contrast to simulate conventional histological stains such as
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The capabilities of the proposed method are
demonstrated in a variety of human tissue preparations including formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and unstained slides sectioned from these
blocks, including normal and neoplastic human brain, and breast epithelium
involved with breast cancer. Similarly, PARS images of human skin prepared by
frozen section clearly demonstrated basal cell carcinoma and normal human skin
tissue. Finally, we imaged unprocessed murine kidney and achieved
histologically relevant subcellular morphology in fresh tissue. This represents
a vital step towards an effective real-time clinical microscope that overcomes
the limitations of standard histopathologic tissue preparations and enables
real-time pathology assessment.

thermodynamical principles and employing the concept of continuum elastic
corrector rate. The proposed model is developed based on the principle of
maximum viscoplastic dissipation for determining the flow direction. The model
uses both the equivalent viscoplastic strain and its rate as state variables.
Power balance and energy balance give, respectively, separate evolution
equations for the equivalent viscoplastic strain rate and the viscoplastic
strain, the former written in terms of inviscid rates. Several key points
distinguish our formulation from other proposals. First, the viscoplastic
strain rate (instead of a yield function) consistently distinguishes
conservative from dissipative behaviours during reverse loading; and the
discrete implicit integration algorithm is an immediate implementation of the
continuum theory based on the mentioned principles. Second, the inviscid
solution is recovered in a well-conditioned manner by simply setting the
viscosity to zero. Indeed, inviscid plasticity, viscoelasticity and
viscoplasticity are particular cases of our formulation and integration
algorithm, and are recovered just by setting the corresponding parameters to
zero (viscosity or yield stress). Third, the linear viscoplasticity solution is
obtained in an exact manner for proportional loading cases, independently of
the time step employed. Four, general nonlinear models (Perzyna, Norton, etc)
may be immediately incorporated as particular cases both in the theory and the
computational implementation.

generation (6G) wireless communication networks. Due to its inherent
low-latency advantage, mobile edge computing (MEC) will be an indispensable
enabler for TSSs. The random characteristics of the delay experienced by users
are key metrics reflecting the quality of service (QoS) of TSSs. Most existing
studies on MEC have focused on the average delay. Only a few research efforts
have been devoted to other random delay characteristics, such as the delay
bound violation probability and the probability distribution of the delay, by
decoupling the transmission and computation processes of MEC. However, if these
two processes could not be decoupled, the coupling will bring new challenges to
analyzing the random delay characteristics. In this paper, an MEC system with a
limited computation buffer at the edge server is considered. In this system,
the transmission process and computation process form a feedback loop and could
not be decoupled. We formulate a discrete-time two-stage tandem queueing
system. Then, by using the matrix-geometric method, we obtain the estimation
methods for the random delay characteristics, including the probability
distribution of the delay, the delay bound violation probability, the average
delay and the delay standard deviation. The estimation methods are verified by
simulations. The random delay characteristics are analyzed by numerical
experiments, which unveil the coupling relationship between the transmission
process and computation process for MEC. These results will largely facilitate
elaborate allocation of communication and computation resources to improve the
QoS of TSSs.

geometries are considered: a brane parallel to the AdS boundary and a brane
intersecting the AdS boundary. For both these cases the contribution in the
vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor is separated
explicitly and its behavior in various asymptotic regions of the parameters is
studied. It is shown that the influence of the gravitational field on the local
properties of the quantum vacuum is essential at distance from the brane larger
than the AdS curvature radius. In the geometry with a brane parallel to the AdS
boundary the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is considered for scalar field
with the Robin boundary condition, for Dirac field with the bag boundary
condition and for the electromagnetic field. In the latter case two types of
boundary conditions are discussed. The first one is a generalization of the
perfect conductor boundary condition and the second one corresponds to the
confining boundary condition used in QCD for gluons. For the geometry of a
brane intersecting the AdS boundary, the case of a scalar field is considered.
The corresponding energy-momentum tensor, apart from the diagonal components,
has nonzero off-diagonal component. As a consequence of the latter, in addition
to the normal component, the Casimir force acquires a component parallel to the
brane.

discharge currents of a few tens of $\mu$A, the size-charge relations differs
from one charger to another due to different ion-aerosol mixing conditions and
subsequent ion density along particles trajectories. Discrepancies are even
more noticeable as the particle size increases. Discharge current, velocities
of ion and aerosol flows and electric field control post-discharge ion density
in each point of the charging volume. The control of particle trajectory in
expanding unipolar ion cloud, leads to tuneable size-charge relations. Aerosol
inertia and charging dynamics, that both depends on particle size, affects the
