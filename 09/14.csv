  Segmentation","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, 3D medical image reconstruction (MIR) and segmentation (MIS) based
on deep neural networks have been developed with promising results, and
attention mechanism has been further designed to capture global contextual
information for performance enhancement. However, the large size of 3D volume
images poses a great computational challenge to traditional attention methods.
In this paper, we propose a folded attention (FA) approach to improve the
computational efficiency of traditional attention methods on 3D medical images.
The main idea is that we apply tensor folding and unfolding operations with
four permutations to build four small sub-affinity matrices to approximate the
original affinity matrix. Through four consecutive sub-attention modules of FA,
each element in the feature tensor can aggregate spatial-channel information
from all other elements. Compared to traditional attention methods, with
moderate improvement of accuracy, FA can substantially reduce the computational
complexity and GPU memory consumption. We demonstrate the superiority of our
method on two challenging tasks for 3D MIR and MIS, which are quantitative
susceptibility mapping and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation.

issue, we propose transition-oriented programming (TOP), a novel programming
paradigm, to instruct developers to develop verifiable systems by thinking in a
formal way. TOP introduces the theories of the transition system as the joint
of the implementation and formal verification to promote formal thinking during

support the TOP features. We argue that TOP is useful and usable to develop
verifiable systems in a wide range of fields.

C-type asteroids. It is located in a dynamically stable zone of the inner
asteroid belt. In this work we determine the formation age of the Clarissa
family by modeling planetary perturbations as well as thermal drift of family
members due to the Yarkovsky effect. Simulations were carried out using the
Swift-rmvs4 integrator modified to account for the Yarkovsky and
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effects. We ran multiple
simulations starting with different ejection velocity fields of fragments,
varying proportion of initially retrograde spins, and also tested different
Yarkovsky/YORP models. Our goal was to match the observed orbital structure of
the Clarissa family which is notably asymmetrical in the proper semimajor axis.
The best fits were obtained with the initial ejection velocities < ~20 m/s of
diameter D=2 km fragments, 4:1 preference for spin-up by YORP, and assuming
that 80% of small family members initially had retrograde rotation. The age of
the Clarissa family was found to be 56+/-6 Myr for the assumed asteroid density
1.5 g/cm3. Small variation of density to smaller or larger value would lead to
slightly younger or older age estimates. This is the first case where the
Yarkovsky effect chronology has been successfully applied to an asteroid family
younger than 100 Myr.

depends linearly on the electric field strength, i.e. the linear Stark effect
is detected. It is found that with the external electric field increasing both

(bagging) ensembles typically rely on several (often inter-connected)
mechanisms and respective hyper-parameters, ultimately compromising ease of
use. In this paper, we provide experimental evidence that such complexity might
not be warranted. We show that minor changes to fitness evaluation and
selection are sufficient to make a simple and otherwise-traditional GP
algorithm evolve ensembles efficiently. The key to our proposal is to exploit
the way bagging works to compute, for each individual in the population,
multiple fitness values (instead of one) at a cost that is only marginally
higher than the one of a normal fitness evaluation. Experimental comparisons on
classification and regression tasks taken and reproduced from prior studies
show that our algorithm fares very well against state-of-the-art ensemble and
non-ensemble GP algorithms. We further provide insights into the proposed
approach by (i) scaling the ensemble size, (ii) ablating the changes to

Ricci and the scalar curvatures of $g$. For scalars $k<n$, the modified
Einstein tensors denoted $\Eink$ are defined as $\Eink :=\Scal \, g -k\Ric$.
Note that the usual Einstein tensor coincides with the half of $\Eint$ and
${\rm Ein}_0=\Scal.g$. It turns out that all these new modified tensors, for
$0<k<n$, are still gradients of the total scalar curvature functional but with
respect to modified integral scalar products. In this paper we study the
positivity properties of these tensors that generalize the positivity
properties of the scalar curvature ($k=0$) and positive Einstein curvature
($k=2$). The positivity of $\Eink$ for some positive $k$ implies the positivity
of all ${\rm Ein}_l$ with $0\leq l\leq k$ and so we define a smooth invariant
$\cEin(M)$ of $M$ to be the supremum of positive k's that renders $\Eink$
positive. By definition $\cEin(M)\in [0,n]$, it is zero if and only if $M$ has
no positive scalar curvature metrics and it is maximal equal to $n$ if $M$
possesses an Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature. In some sense,
$\cEin(M)$ measures how far is $M$ to admit an Einstein metric of positive
scalar curvature. In this paper we prove that $\cEin(M)\geq 2$ if $M$ admits an
effective action by a non abelian connected Lie group or if $M$ is simply
connected of positive scalar curvature and dimension $\geq 5$. We prove as well
that the invariant $\cEin$ increases after a surgery operation on the manifold
$M$ or by assuming that the manifold $M$ has higher connectivity. We prove that
the condition $\cEin(M)\leq n-2$ does not imply any restriction on the first
fundamental group of $M$. We define and prove similar properties for an
analogous invariant namely $\cein(M)$. The paper contains several open
questions.

The first step for intelligent response in visualizations is to enable
computers to infer user goals and strategies through observing their
interactions with a system. Researchers have proposed multiple techniques to
model users, however, their frameworks often depend on the visualization
design, interaction space, and dataset. Due to these dependencies, many
techniques do not provide a general algorithmic solution to user exploration
modeling. In this paper, we construct a series of models based on the dataset
and pose user exploration modeling as a Bayesian model selection problem where
we maintain a belief over numerous competing models that could explain user
interactions. Each of these competing models represent an exploration strategy
the user could adopt during a session. The goal of our technique is to make
high-level and in-depth inferences about the user by observing their low-level
interactions. Although our proposed idea is applicable to various probabilistic
model spaces, we demonstrate a specific instance of encoding exploration
patterns as competing models to infer information relevance. We validate our
technique's ability to infer exploration bias, predict future interactions, and
summarize an analytic session using user study datasets. Our results indicate
that depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines
for bias detection and future interaction prediction. Finally, we discuss
future research directions based on our proposed modeling paradigm and suggest
how practitioners can use this method to build intelligent visualization
systems that understand users' goals and adapt to improve the exploration

(PODC'19), and significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art $O(\log

  A remarkable property of our algorithm is its simplicity. Whereas the
state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this problem are based on the quite
involved local coloring algorithm of Chang et al. (STOC'18), our algorithm can
be described in just a few lines. At a high level, it applies a careful
derandomization of a recursive procedure which partitions the nodes and their
respective palettes into separate bins. We show that after $O(1)$ recursion
steps, the remaining uncolored subgraph within each bin has linear size, and
thus can be solved locally by collecting it to a single node. This algorithm
can also be implemented in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model
provided that each machine has linear (in $n$, the number of nodes in the input
graph) space.
  We also show an extension of our algorithm to the MPC regime in which
machines have sublinear space: we present the first deterministic

enables a complete time-frequency analysis of a system's response to
electromagnetic illumination. This provides access to dynamic information that
is not provided by absorption spectra alone, and has recently been shown
through measurements in the infrared that time-domain optical-field sampling
offers significant improvements with regard to molecular sensitivity and limits
of detection compared to traditional spectroscopic methods. Despite the many
scientific and technological motivations, time-domain, optical-field sampling
systems operating in the visible to near-infrared spectral regions are seldom
accessible, requiring large driving pulse energies, and large laser amplifier
systems, bulky apparatuses, and vacuum environments. Here, we demonstrate an
all-on-chip, optoelectronic device capable of sampling arbitrary, low-energy,
near-infrared waveforms under ambient conditions. Our solid-state integrated
detector uses optical-field-driven electron emission from resonant nanoantennas
to achieve petahertz-level switching speeds by generating on-chip attosecond
electron bursts. These bursts are used to probe the electric field of weak
optical transients. We demonstrated our devices by sampling the electric field
of a ~5 fJ, broadband near-infrared ultrafast laser pulse using a ~50 pJ
near-infrared driving pulse. Our sampling measurements recovered the weak
optical transient as well as localized plasmonic dynamics of the emitting
nanoantennas $in~situ$. This field-sampling device--with its compact footprint
and low pulse-energy requirements--offers opportunities in a variety of
applications, including: broadband time-domain spectroscopy in the molecular
fingerprint region, time-domain analysis of nonlinear phenomena, and detailed
studies of strong-field light-matter interactions.

  Ridesharing","48 pages, 22 figures",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-time ridesharing systems such as UberPool, Lyft Line, GrabShare have
become hugely popular as they reduce the costs for customers, improve per trip
revenue for drivers and reduce traffic on the roads by grouping customers with
similar itineraries. The key challenge in these systems is to group the ""right""
requests to travel together in the ""right"" available vehicles in real-time, so
that the objective (e.g., requests served, revenue or delay) is optimized. This
challenge has been addressed in existing work by: (i) generating as many
relevant feasible (with respect to the available delay for customers)
combinations of requests as possible in real-time; and then (ii) optimizing
assignment of the feasible request combinations to vehicles. Since the number
of request combinations increases exponentially with the increase in vehicle
capacity and number of requests, unfortunately, such approaches have to employ
ad hoc heuristics to identify a subset of request combinations for assignment.
Our key contribution is in developing approaches that employ zone (abstraction
of individual locations) paths instead of request combinations. Zone paths
allow for generation of significantly more ""relevant"" combinations (in
comparison to ad hoc heuristics) in real-time than competing approaches due to
two reasons: (i) Each zone path can typically represent multiple request
combinations; (ii) Zone paths are generated using a combination of offline and
online methods. Specifically, we contribute both myopic (ridesharing assignment
focussed on current requests only) and non-myopic (ridesharing assignment
considers impact on expected future requests) approaches that employ zone
paths. In our experimental results, we demonstrate that our myopic approach
outperforms (with respect to both objective and runtime) the current best
myopic approach for ridesharing on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

In the context of computer engineering, the
translation of legal text to algorithmic form is seemingly direct. In large
part, law may be a ripe field for expert systems and machine learning. For
engineers, existing law appears formulaic and logically reducible to ""if, then""
statements. The underlying assumption is that the legal language is both
self-referential and universal. Moreover, description is considered distinct
from interpretation; that in describing the law, the language is seen as
quantitative and objectifiable. Nevertheless, is descriptive formal language
purely dissociative? From the logic machine of the 1970s to the modern fervor
for artificial intelligence (AI), governance by numbers is making a persuasive
return. Could translation be possible? The project follows a fundamentally
semantic conundrum: what is the significance of ""meaning"" in legal language?
The project, therefore, tests translation by deconstructing sentences from
existing legal judgments to their constituent factors. Definitions are then
extracted in accordance with the interpretations of the judges. The intent is
to build an expert system predicated on alleged rules of legal reasoning. The
authors apply both linguistic modelling and natural language processing
technology to parse the legal judgments. The project extends beyond prior
research in the area, combining a broadly statistical model of context with the
relative precision of syntactic structure. The preliminary hypothesis is that,
by analyzing the components of legal language with a variety of techniques, we
can begin to translate law to numerical form.

networks. In this paper, we propose a new framework for constructing Gabor-type
frames for signals on graphs. Our approach uses general and flexible families
of linear operators acting as translations. Compared to previous work in the
literature, our methods yield the sharp bounds for the associated frames, in a
broad setting that generalizes several existing constructions. We also examine
how Gabor-type frames behave for signals defined on Cayley graphs by exploiting
the representation theory of the underlying group. We explore how natural
classes of translations can be constructed for Cayley graphs, and how the
choice of an eigenbasis can significantly impact the properties of the
resulting translation operators and frames on the graph.

goes beyond the NLS and derivative NLS equations, and it gives rise to

problems is a prominent area of research in computer science. Likewise, the
study of NP-Complete problems lies at the heart of computer science with
numerous results in algorithms and complexity. In this paper we raise the
question of computing fault tolerant solutions to NP-Complete problems; that is
computing a solution that can survive the ""failure"" of a few constituent
elements. This notion has appeared in a variety of theoretical and practical
settings such as estimating network reliability, kernelization (aka instance
compression), approximation algorithms and so on. In this paper, we seek to
highlight these questions for further research.
  As a concrete example, we study the fault-tolerant version of the classical
Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem, that we call Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex
Set (FT-FVS). Recall that, in FVS the input is a graph $G$ and the objective is
to compute a minimum subset of vertices $S$ such that $G-S$ is a forest. In
FT-FVS, the objective is to compute a minimum subset $S$ of vertices such that
$G - (S \setminus \{v\})$ is a forest for any $v \in V(G)$. Here the vertex $v$
denotes a single vertex fault. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, and
then present a constant factor approximation algorithm as well as an
FPT-algorithm parameterized by the solution size. We believe that the question
of computing fault tolerant solutions to various NP-Complete problems is an
interesting direction for future research.

variations of the spectra and emission intensities recorded in the H-alpha line
with the very high time resolution using the MSDP spectrograph at Bialkow
Observatory.
  The flare radiated hard X-rays (HXR) detectable up to a energy of 70 keV. A
numerical model of the flare used in the analysis assumes that the non-thermal
electrons (NTEs) carried the external energy to the flare. The NTEs energy flux
was derived from a non-thermal component seen in RHESSI spectra. The main
geometrical parameters of the flare were derived using restored RHESSI imaging
data.
  We found that the variations of the X-ray fluxes recorded in various energy
bands and the variations of the H-alpha intensities were well correlated in
time during the pre-impulsive and impulsive phases of the flare and they agreed
with the variations of the calculated position and vertical extent of the EDL.
The variations of the emission noticed in various parts of the H-alpha line
profile were caused by individual episodes of energy depositionby the beams of
NTEs of various energy spectra on various depths in the chromospheric plasma.

in detector materials introduces radon to the active detection volume of
low-background rare event search detectors. $^{222}$Rn produces a particularly
problematic background in the physics region of interest by the ``naked'' beta
decay of its $^{214}$Pb daughter nucleus. While charcoal-based adsorption traps
are expected to be effective for radon reduction in auxiliary circulation loops
that service the warm components of current {ton-scale} detectors at slow flow
rates $(0.5-2\;SLPM)$, radon reduction in the entire circulation loop at high
flow rates $\mathcal{O}({100s\;SLPM})$ is necessary to reach high sensitivity
in future generation experiments. In this article we explore radon dynamics
with a charcoal-based radon reduction system in the main circulation loop of
time projection chamber detectors. We find that even for perfect radon traps,
circulation speeds of $2,000\;SLPM$ are needed to reduce radon concentration in
a 10\,ton detector by 90\%. This is faster by a factor of four than the highest
circulation speeds currently achieved in dark matter detectors. We further find
that the effectiveness of vacuum swing adsorption systems, which have been
employed very successfully at reducing atmospheric radon levels in clean-rooms,
is limited by the intrinsic radon activity of the charcoal adsorbent in
ultra-low radon environments. Adsorbents with significantly lower intrinsic
radon activity than in currently available activated charcoals would be
necessary to build effective vacuum swing adsorption systems operated at room
temperature for rare event search experiments. If such VSA systems are cooled
to about $190\,K$, this requirement relaxes drastically.

describes the interactions between a passively diffusing molecular species and
an advecting species that switches between anterograde and retrograde
motor-driven transport (bidirectional transport). Within the context of
synaptogenesis, the diffusing molecules can be identified with the protein
kinase CaMKII and the advecting molecules as glutamate receptors. The
stochastic dynamics evolves according to an RDA master equation, in which
advection and diffusion are both modeled as hopping reactions along a
one-dimensional array of chemical compartments. Carrying out a linear noise
approximation of the RDA master equation leads to an effective Langevin
equation, whose power spectrum provides a means of extending the definition of
a Turing instability to stochastic systems, namely, in terms of the existence
of a peak in the power spectrum at a non-zero spatial frequency. We thus show
how noise can significantly extend the range over which spontaneous patterns
occur, which is consistent with previous studies of RD systems.

methods has proven to be worthwhile in many aspects. In this manuscript, we
propose and examine a novel random tree depth injection approach suitable for
sequential and parallel tree-based approaches including Boosting and Random
Forests. The resulting methods are called \emph{Random Boost} and
\emph{Random$^2$ Forest}. Both approaches serve as valuable extensions to the
existing literature on the gradient boosting framework and random forests. A
Monte Carlo simulation, in which tree-shaped data sets with different numbers
of final partitions are built, suggests that there are several scenarios where
\emph{Random Boost} and \emph{Random$^2$ Forest} can improve the prediction
performance of conventional hierarchical boosting and random forest approaches.
The new algorithms appear to be especially successful in cases where there are
merely a few high-order interactions in the generated data. In addition, our
simulations suggest that our random tree depth injection approach can improve
computation time by up to 40%, while at the same time the performance losses in
terms of prediction accuracy turn out to be minor or even negligible in most
cases.

improve the efficiency of clinical trials. One major challenge is how to
effectively borrow information from historical data while maintaining a
reasonable type I error. We propose the elastic prior approach to address this
challenge and achieve dynamic information borrowing. Unlike existing
approaches, this method proactively controls the behavior of dynamic
information borrowing and type I errors by incorporating a well-known concept
of clinically meaningful difference through an elastic function, defined as a
monotonic function of a congruence measure between historical data and trial
data. The elastic function is constructed to satisfy a set of
information-borrowing constraints prespecified by researchers or regulatory
agencies, such that the prior will borrow information when historical and trial
data are congruent, but refrain from information borrowing when historical and
trial data are incongruent. In doing so, the elastic prior improves power and
reduces the risk of data dredging and bias. The elastic prior is information
borrowing consistent, i.e. asymptotically controls type I and II errors at the
nominal values when historical data and trial data are not congruent, a unique
characteristics of the elastic prior approach. Our simulation study that
evaluates the finite sample characteristic confirms that, compared to existing
methods, the elastic prior has better type I error control and yields
competitive or higher power.

an estimate of the source redshift and the Hubble constant. The luminosity
distance is derived through standard measurement of the chirp mass, which for
the slowly evolving binary sources in the PTA band can be found by comparing
the frequency of GW-timing residuals at the Earth compared to those at distant
pulsars in the array. The comoving distance can be measured from GW-timing
parallax caused by the curvature of the GW wavefronts. This can be detected for
single sources at the high-frequency end of the PTA band out to Gpc distances
with a future PTA containing well-timed pulsars out to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ kpc,
when the pulsar distance is constrained to less than a GW wavelength. Such a
future PTA, with $\gtrsim 30$ pulsars with precise distance measurements
between 1 and 20~kpc, could measure the Hubble constant at the tens of percent
level for a single source at $0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$. At $z \lesssim
0.1$, the luminosity and comoving distances are too similar to disentangle,
unless the fractional error in the luminosity distance measurement is decreased
below 10%. At $z\gtrsim 1.5$, this measurement will likely be restricted by a
signal-to-noise ratio threshold. Generally, clarification of the different

control of the angular velocity. Using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (URANS) model at moderate Reynolds numbers, the kinematics and

angular velocity such that the peak torque generation aligns with the peak
angular velocity. With optimal kinematics in a confined flow there is minimal
flow separation during peak power generation, however there is a large trailing
edge vortex (TEV) shed as the torque decreases. The unconfined configuration
has more prominent flow separation and is more susceptible to Reynolds number,
resulting in a 41% increase in power generation under the same kinematic

Self-play, where the agents compete with themselves, is often used to generate
training data for iterative policy improvement. In previous work, heuristic
rules are designed to choose an opponent for the current learner. Typical rules
include choosing the latest agent, the best agent, or a random historical
agent. However, these rules may be inefficient in practice and sometimes do not
guarantee convergence even in the simplest matrix games. In this paper, we
propose a new algorithmic framework for competitive self-play reinforcement
learning in two-player zero-sum games. We recognize the fact that the Nash
equilibrium coincides with the saddle point of the stochastic payoff function,
which motivates us to borrow ideas from classical saddle point optimization
literature. Our method trains several agents simultaneously, and intelligently
takes each other as opponent based on simple adversarial rules derived from a
principled perturbation-based saddle optimization method. We prove
theoretically that our algorithm converges to an approximate equilibrium with
high probability in convex-concave games under standard assumptions. Beyond the
theory, we further show the empirical superiority of our method over baseline

graph, to quickly report a minimum-weight cut that separates a query pair of
nodes $s,t$. The best data structure known for this problem simply builds a
cut-equivalent tree, discovered 60 years ago by Gomory and Hu, who also showed
how to construct it using $n-1$ minimum $st$-cut computations. Using
state-of-the-art algorithms for minimum $st$-cut (Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014)
arXiv:1312.6713, one can construct the tree in time $\tilde{O}(mn^{3/2})$,
which is also the preprocessing time of the data structure. (Throughout, we
focus on polynomially-bounded edge weights, noting that faster algorithms are
known for small/unit edge weights.)
  Our main result shows the following equivalence: Cut-equivalent trees can be
constructed in near-linear time if and only if there is a data structure for
Min-Cut queries with near-linear preprocessing time and polylogarithmic
(amortized) query time, and even if the queries are restricted to a fixed
source. That is, equivalent trees are an essentially optimal solution for
Min-Cut queries. This equivalence holds even for every minor-closed family of
graphs, such as bounded-treewidth graphs, for which a two-decade old data
structure (Arikati et al., J.~Algorithms 1998) implies the first near-linear
time construction of cut-equivalent trees.
  Moreover, unlike all previous techniques for constructing cut-equivalent
trees, ours is robust to relying on approximation algorithms. In particular,
using the almost-linear time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum
$st$-cut (Kelner et al., SODA 2014), we can construct a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate flow-equivalent tree (which is a slightly weaker
notion) in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. This leads to the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for All-Pairs Max-Flow that runs in time
$n^{2+o(1)}$, and matches the output size almost-optimally.

elements are known for having less phase lag compared to their linear

elements with one resetting state and proposes an architecture and a method of
design which allows for band-passing the nonlinearity and its effects, namely,
higher-order harmonics and phase advantage. The nonlinearity of reset elements
is not entirely useful for all frequencies, e.g., they are useful for reducing
phase lag at cross-over frequency region; however, higher-order harmonics can
compromise tracking and disturbance rejection performance at lower frequencies.
Using proposed ""phase shaping"" method, one can selectively suppress
nonlinearity of a single-state reset element in a desired range of frequencies
and allow the nonlinearity to provide its phase benefit in a different desired
range of frequencies. This can be especially useful for the reset elements in
the framework of ""Constant in gain, Lead in phase"" (CgLp) filter, which is a

identify universal and previously unreported features of the mechanical
properties of active colloids. These features are codified by recognizing that
the characteristic length scale of an active particle's trajectory, the
run-length, introduces a new concentration scale $\phi^*$. Large-scale
simulations of repulsive active Brownian particles (ABPs) confirm that this new
run-length dependent concentration, which is the trajectory-space analogue of
the overlap concentration in polymer solutions, delineates distinct
concentration regimes in which interparticle collisions alter particle
trajectories. Using $\phi^*$ and concentration scales associated with colloidal
jamming, the mechanical equation-of-state for ABPs can be collapsed onto a set
of principal curves that contain a number of previously overlooked features.
The inclusion of these features qualitatively alters previous predictions of
the behavior for active colloids as we demonstrate by computing the spinodal
for a suspension of purely-repulsive ABPs. Our findings suggest that dynamic
overlap concentration scales should be of great utility in unraveling the
behavior of active and driven systems.

presence of mismeasured covariates. We use the mixture cure model to account
for the individuals that will never experience the event and at the same time
distinguish between the effect of the covariates on the cure probabilities and
on survival times. In particular, for practical applications, it seems of
interest to assume a logistic form of the incidence and a Cox proportional
hazards model for the latency. To correct the estimators for the bias
introduced by the measurement error, we use the simex algorithm, which is a
very general simulation based method. It essentially estimates this bias by
introducing additional error to the data and then recovers bias corrected
estimators through an extrapolation approach. The estimators are shown to be
consistent and asymptotically normally distributed when the true extrapolation
function is known. We investigate their finite sample performance through a
simulation study and apply the proposed method to analyse the effect of the
prostate specific antigen (PSA) on patients with prostate cancer.

cytoneme-based morphogenesis. We consider a single cytoneme nucleating from a
source cell and searching for a set of $N$ target cells $\Omega_k\subset \R^d$,
$k=1,\ldots,N$, with $d\geq 2$. We assume that each time the cytoneme
nucleates, it grows in a random direction so that the probability of being
oriented towards the $k$-th target is $p_k$ with $\sum_{k=1}^Np_k<1$. Hence,
there is a non-zero probability of failure to find a target unless there is
some mechanism for returning to the nucleation site and subsequently nucleating
in a new direction. We model the latter as a one-dimensional search process
with stochastic resetting, finite returns times and refractory periods. We use
a renewal method to calculate the splitting probabilities and conditional mean
first passage times (MFPTs) for the cytoneme to be captured by a given target
cell. We then determine the steady-state accumulation of morphogen over the set
of target cells following multiple rounds of search-and-capture events and
morphogen degradation. This then yields the corresponding morphogen gradient
across the set of target cells, whose steepness depends on the resetting rate.
We illustrate the theory by considering a single layer of target cells, and
discuss the extension to multiple cytonemes.

ingredients that destined its success is the self-attention mechanism, which

its effectiveness in modeling short sequences, self-attention suffers when
handling inputs with extreme long-range dependencies, as its complexity grows
quadratically with respect to the sequence length. Therefore, long sequences
are often encoded by Transformer in chunks using a sliding window. In this
paper, we propose Cluster-Former, a novel clustering-based sparse Transformer
to perform attention across chunked sequences. The proposed framework is
pivoted on two unique types of Transformer layer: Sliding-Window Layer and
Cluster-Former Layer, which encode local sequence information and global
context jointly and iteratively. This new design allows information integration
beyond local windows, which is especially beneficial for question answering
(QA) tasks that rely on long-range dependencies. Experiments show that
Cluster-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance on several major QA

artificial materials, where it sustains and optimizes many biological and
functional mechanisms. The theory of volume growth, starting from a stress-free
initial state, is widely used to explain the creation and evolution of
growth-induced residual stress and the resulting changes in shape, and to model
how growing bio-tissues such as arteries and solid tumors develop a strategy of
pattern creation according to geometrical and material parameters. This
modelling provides promising avenues for designing and directing some
appropriate morphology of a given tissue or organ and achieve some targeted
biomedical function. In this paper, we rely on a modified, augmented theory to
reveal how we can obtain growth-induced residual stress and pattern evolution
of a layered artery by starting from an existing, non-zero initial residual
stress state. We use experimentally determined residual stress distributions of
aged bi-layered human aortas and quantify their influence by a magnitude
factor. Our results show that initial residual stress has a more significant
impact on residual stress accumulation and the subsequent evolution of patterns
than geometry and material parameters. Additionally, we provide an essential
explanation for growth-induced patterns driven by differential growth coupled
to an initial residual stress. Finally, we show that initial residual stress is
a readily available way to control growth-induced pattern creation for tissues
and thus may provide a promising inspiration for biomedical engineering.

analysing a sample of CALIFA survey galaxies. The sample consists of tidally
and non-tidally perturbed galaxies, paired at the closest stellar mass
densities for the same galaxy type between subsamples. They are then compared,
both on the resolved Star Formation Main Sequence (SFMS) plane and in annular
property profiles. Star-forming regions in tidally perturbed galaxies exhibit
flatter SFMS slopes compared to star-forming regions in non-tidally perturbed
galaxies. Despite that the annular profiles show star-forming regions in
tidally perturbed galaxies as being mostly older, their SF properties are never
reduced against those ones proper of non-tidally perturbed galaxies.
Star-forming regions in non-tidally perturbed galaxies are better candidates
for SF suppression (quenching). The lowered SF with increasing stellar mass
density in tidally perturbed galaxies may suggest a lower dependence of SF on
stellar mass. Though the SFMS slopes, either flatter or steeper, are found
independent of stellar mass density, the effect of global stellar mass can not
be ignored when distinguishing among galaxy types. Since a phenomenon or
property other than local/global stellar mass may be taking part in the
modulation of SF, the integrated SF properties are related to the tidal
perturbation parameter. We find weak, but detectable, positive correlations for
perturbed galaxies suggesting that tidal perturbations induced by close
companions increase the gas accretion rates of these objects.

knowledge to evaluate different options. The choice overload issue may
negatively affect users' engagement in health management. In this study, we
take a design-science perspective to propose a recommendation framework that
helps users to select healthcare interventions. Taking into account that users'
health behaviors can be highly dynamic and diverse, we propose a multi-armed
bandit (MAB)-driven recommendation framework, which enables us to adaptively
learn users' preference variations while promoting recommendation diversity in
the meantime. To better adapt an MAB to the healthcare context, we synthesize
two innovative model components based on prominent health theories. The first
component is a deep-learning-based feature engineering procedure, which is
designed to learn crucial recommendation contexts in regard to users'
sequential health histories, health-management experiences, preferences, and
intrinsic attributes of healthcare interventions. The second component is a
diversity constraint, which structurally diversifies recommendations in
different dimensions to provide users with well-rounded support. We apply our
approach to an online weight management context and evaluate it rigorously
through a series of experiments. Our results demonstrate that each of the
design components is effective and that our recommendation design outperforms a
wide range of state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Our study contributes to

detection of other types of signals coming from the same event, multi-messenger

great importance in a gravitational wave experiment to have a rapid mechanism
of alerting about potential gravitational waves events other observatories
capable to detect other types of signals (e.g. in other wavelengths) that are

development of a neural network algorithm trained to recognize and characterize
gravitational wave patterns from signal plus noise data samples. We have
implemented two versions of the algorithm, one that classifies the
gravitational wave signals into 2 classes, and another one that classifies them

the performance obtained with this algorithm qualifies it as a fast method of

corrupts a statistician's covariates using a multiplicative nonparametric

is dropout noise, where nature independently deletes entries of the covariate
vector with some fixed probability $\delta$. This result implies that dropout
training indeed provides out-of-sample expected loss guarantees for
distributions that arise from multiplicative perturbations of in-sample data.
In addition to the decision-theoretic analysis, the paper makes two more

the in-sample loss after dropout training exceeds the true population loss with
some pre-specified probability. Second, the paper provides a novel,

for the non-Gaussianities of the models, since the constant-roll evolution is
known to enhance non-Gaussianities. As we show the non-Gaussianities are of the

the amount of the non-Gaussianities is smaller in the constant-roll case.

requesting the alignment of the network's decision with human perception. To
enable a general methodology for quantifying safety risks, we define a generic
safety property and instantiate it to express various safety risks. For the
quantification of risks, we take the maximum radius of safe norm balls, in
which no safety risk exists. The computation of the maximum safe radius is
reduced to the computation of their respective Lipschitz metrics - the
quantities to be computed. In addition to the known adversarial example,
reachability example, and invariant example, in this paper we identify a new
class of risk - uncertainty example - on which humans can tell easily but the
network is unsure. We develop an algorithm, inspired by derivative-free
optimization techniques and accelerated by tensor-based parallelization on
GPUs, to support efficient computation of the metrics. We perform evaluations
on several benchmark neural networks, including ACSC-Xu, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
ImageNet networks. The experiments show that, our method can achieve
competitive performance on safety quantification in terms of the tightness and
the efficiency of computation. Importantly, as a generic approach, our method
can work with a broad class of safety risks and without restrictions on the

whole tumor segmentation. It assists in quicker clinical assessment and early
detection of brain tumors, which is crucial for lifesaving treatment procedures
of patients. Because, brain tumors often can be malignant or benign, if they
are detected at an early stage. A brain tumor is a collection or a mass of
abnormal cells in the brain. The human skull encloses the brain very rigidly
and any growth inside this restricted place can cause severe health issues. The
detection of brain tumors requires careful and intricate analysis for surgical
planning and treatment. Most physicians employ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
to diagnose such tumors. A manual diagnosis of the tumors using MRI is known to
be time-consuming; approximately, it takes up to eighteen hours per sample.
Thus, the automatic segmentation of tumors has become an optimal solution for
this problem. Studies have shown that this technique provides better accuracy
and it is faster than manual analysis resulting in patients receiving the
treatment at the right time. Our research introduces an efficient strategy
called Multi-channel MRI embedding to improve the result of deep learning-based
tumor segmentation. The experimental analysis on the Brats-2019 dataset wrt the
U-Net encoder-decoder (EnDec) model shows significant improvement. The
embedding strategy surmounts the state-of-the-art approaches with an
improvement of 2% without any timing overheads.

designed to interact with users during a certain activity, such as browsing,

explored to our knowledge. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game
between a Designer and one or more Agents. We model an Agent as a Markov chain
whose states are activities; we assume that the Agent's utility is a linear
function of the steady-state distribution of this chain. The Designer may
design a platform for each of these activities/states; if a platform is adopted
by the Agent, the transition probabilities of the Markov chain are affected,
and so is the objective of the Agent. The Designer's utility is a linear
function of the steady state probabilities of the accessible states minus the
development cost of the platforms. The underlying optimization problem of the
Agent -- how to choose the states for which to adopt the platform -- is an MDP.
If this MDP has a simple yet plausible structure (the transition probabilities
from one state to another only depend on the target state and the recurrent

the Agent so as to optimize, through the Agent's optimum reaction, the
Designer's revenue), is NP-hard to approximate within any finite ratio;
however, the special case, while still NP-hard, has an FPTAS. These results

While many methods have been published that address beam broadening of

effective methods for beam broadening of contiguous uniform subarrayed arrays
where elements of the array are grouped together to have the same element
excitations. Particularly, this paper focuses on phase-only optimization to
preserve maximum power output. The high dimensionality of the solution space of
possible phase settings causes brute force techniques to be infeasible for

resource-wasting problem severe. In this paper, we design UltraFuzz, a fuzzer
for resource-saving in distributed fuzzing. Based on centralized dynamic
scheduling, UltraFuzz can dispatch tasks and schedule power globally and
reasonably to avoid resource-wasting. Besides, UltraFuzz can elastically
allocate computing power for fuzzing and seed evaluation, thereby avoiding the
potential bottleneck of seed evaluation that blocks the fuzzing process.
UltraFuzz was evaluated using real-world programs, and the results show that

selection, an intelligent agent generates a set of pursuable goals and then
selects which of them he commits to achieve. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems, including intelligent agents, must be able to
explain their internal decisions. In the context of goals selection, agents
should be able to explain the reasoning path that leads them to select (or not)
a certain goal. In this article, we use an argumentation-based approach for
generating explanations about that reasoning path. Besides, we aim to enrich
the explanations with information about emerging conflicts during the selection

explanations: the partial one and the complete one and a set of explanatory
schemes to generate pseudo-natural explanations. Finally, we apply our proposal

approximately reversible, whereas AKDK not. Therefore, it is possible to find a
combination of parameters where the energy drift is considerably milder for
HHS, resulting in a better performance. We conclude that HHS is an attractive
alternative to AKDK, and it is certainly advantageous for direct summation and

coarse-correlated equilibrium of the game. However, much less is known about
equilibrium selection in the case that multiple equilibria exist.
  In this work, we study the convergence of no-regret bidding algorithms in
auctions. Besides being of theoretical interest, bidding dynamics in auctions
is an important question from a practical viewpoint as well. We study repeated
game between bidders in which a single item is sold at each time step and the
bidder's value is drawn from an unknown distribution. We show that if the
bidders use any mean-based learning rule then the bidders converge with high
probability to the truthful pure Nash Equilibrium in a second price auction, in
VCG auction in the multi-slot setting and to the Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a
first price auction. We note mean-based algorithms cover a wide variety of
known no-regret algorithms such as Exp3, UCB, $\epsilon$-Greedy etc. Also, we
analyze the convergence of the individual iterates produced by such learning
algorithms, as opposed to the time-average of the sequence. Our experiments
corroborate our theoretical findings and also find a similar convergence when
we use other strategies such as Deep Q-Learning.

5-meter 34-American Wire Gauge (AWG) twin-axial cable, retimes the data with a
recovered clock, and drives an optical transmitter. In the downstream channel,
GBCR receives the data from an optical receiver and drives the same type of

26.5 ps and the jitter of the downstream channel after the cable is 33.5 ps.
Each upstream channel consumes 78 mW and each downstream channel consumes 27

be detectable at low radio frequencies (50-200 MHz), but is difficult to
measure due to bright foreground emission and difficulties in reaching the
required levels of instrumental-calibration precision. In this paper we outline
our progress toward using a novel new method to measure the global redshifted
21-cm signal. Motivated by the need to use alternative methods with very
different systematic errors to EDGES for an independent result, we employ an
array of closely-spaced antennas to measure the global sky signal
interferometrically, rather than using the conventional approach with a single
antenna. We use simulations to demonstrate our newly-developed methods and show
that, for an idealised instrument, a 21-cm signal could theoretically be
extracted from the visibilities of an array of closely-spaced dipoles. We
verify that our signal-extraction methods work on real data using observations
made with a Square Kilometre-Array-like prototype; the Engineering Development
Array-2. Finally, we use the lessons learned in both our simulations and
observations to lay out a clear plan for future work, which will ultimately

a single node, called the leader, must be specified. This task can be
formulated either in a weak way, where one node outputs 'leader' and all other
nodes output 'non-leader', or in a strong way, where all nodes must also learn
which node is the leader. If the nodes of the network have distinct
identifiers, then such an agreement means that all nodes have to output the
identifier of the elected leader. For anonymous networks, the strong version of
leader election requires that all nodes must be able to find a path to the
leader, as this is the only way to identify it. For any network in which leader
election (weak or strong) is possible knowing the map of the network, there is
a minimum time in which this can be done. We consider four formulations of
leader election discussed in the literature in the context of anonymous
networks : one is the weak formulation, and the three others specify three
different ways of finding the path to the leader in the strong formulation. Our
aim is to compare the amount of initial information needed to accomplish each
of these ""four shades"" of leader election in minimum time. We show that the
amount of information required to accomplish leader election in the weak
formulation in minimum time is exponentially smaller than that needed for any
of the strong formulations. Thus, if the required amount of advice is used as a
measure of the difficulty of the task, the weakest version of leader election
in minimum time is drastically easier than any version of the strong
formulation in minimum time.

(EIM) approaches have produced outstanding results in many disciplines. In
particular, in gravitational wave (GW) science these results range from
building non-intrusive surrogate models for GWs to fast parameter estimation
adding the use of Reduced Order Quadratures. These surrogates have the salient
feature of being essentially indistinguishable from or very close to
supercomputer simulations of the Einstein equations, but can be evaluated in
the order of a milisecond per multipole mode on a standard laptop. In this
article we clarify a common misperception of the EIM as originally introduced
and used in practice in GW science. Namely, we prove that the EIM at each
iteration chooses the interpolation nodes so as to make the related
Vandermonde-type matrix as invertible as possible; not necessarily optimizing
its conditioning or accuracy of the interpolant as is sometimes thought. In
fact, we introduce two new variations of the EIM, nested as well, which do
optimize with respect to conditioning and the Lebesgue constant, respectively,
and compare them through numerical experiments with the original EIM using GWs.
Our analyses and numerical results suggest a subtle relationship between
solving for the original EIM, conditioning, and the Lebesgue constant, in
consonance with active research in rigorous approximation theory and related
fields.

dependence of power and heat efficiencies on fuel cell output power. Therefore,
a linearization method is proposed to convexify the problem. Consequently, a
distributed ADMM approach is introduced to solve the convexified optimization
problem in parallel at each dwelling. A case study for a group of six dwellings
based on realistic electric consumption data is then presented to demonstrate
the proposed approach performance and positive impacts of the P2P energy

reasonably fast in convergence and is scalable well with system size. In

proposed in Paper I, we make a qualitative description about the evolution of
ejecta and light curves for merging double strangeon stars. In the hot
environment of the merger, the strangeon nuggets ejected by tidal disruption
and hydrodynamical squeezing would suffer from evaporation, in which process
particles, such as strangeons, neutrons and protons, are emitted. Taking into
account both the evaporation of strangeon nuggets and the decay of strangeons,
most of the strangeon nuggets would turn into neutrons and protons, within
dozens of milliseconds after being ejected. The evaporation rates of different
particles depend on temperature, and we find that the ejecta could end up with
two components, with high and low opacity respectively. The high opacity
component would be in the directions around the equatorial plane, and the low
opacity component would be in a broad range of angular directions. The
bolometric light curves show that even if the total ejected mass would be as
low as $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$, the spin-down power of the long-lived remnant
would account for the whole emission of kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW

local non-Hermitian impurity is applied to. The balance between dissipation of
single fermion and on-site pair fluctuation results in a highest-order
coalescing state with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Based on the

allows the generation of such a steady superconducting-like state through the

ranging from a fast, approximate linear bootstrap tailored to sparse, massive

smaller, denser graphs. For the fast, approximate linear bootstrap, we show
that $\sqrt{n}$-consistent inference of the count functional is attainable in
certain computational regimes that depend on the sparsity level of the graph.
Furthermore, even in more challenging regimes, we prove that our bootstrap
procedure offers valid coverage and vanishing confidence intervals. For the
quadratic bootstrap, we establish an Edgeworth expansion and show that this
procedure offers higher-order accuracy under appropriate sparsity conditions.
We complement our theoretical results with a simulation study and real data

an iterative support shrinking algorithm, with a global convergence guarantee

latter indicates that the generated approximate image (inhomogeneity-corrected

operation. In the second stage, the segmentation is done by applying a
widely-used simple thresholding technique to the piecewise constant

problem of treatment effect estimation would be to consider data as ""unlabeled""
if treatment assignment and covariates are observed but outcomes are

used to estimate a high dimensional propensity function and causal inference
using a much smaller labeled data set could proceed via weighted estimators
using the learned propensity scores. In the limiting case of infinite unlabeled

However, longstanding advice in the causal inference community suggests that
estimated propensity scores (from labeled data alone) are actually preferable
to true propensity scores, implying that the unlabeled data is actually useless
in this context. In this paper we examine this paradox and propose a simple
procedure that reconciles the strong intuition that a known propensity

literature suggesting otherwise. Further, simulation studies suggest that
direct regression may be preferable to inverse-propensity weight estimators in

that the regret of the simulated annealing algorithm, with either noisy or

exponent for some parameters is first proved, and there exists a curve that
separates them. The spectrum in the region of positive Lyapunov exponent is
purely pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions for
almost every frequency and almost every phase. From the research, we realize
that the infinite potential $v(\theta)=2\lambda tan^2(\pi\theta)$ has zero
Lyapunov exponent for some energies if $0<|\lambda|<1$.

most studies on fair learning focus on either supervised learning or
unsupervised learning. Very few consider semi-supervised settings. Yet, in
reality, most machine learning tasks rely on large datasets that contain both
labeled and unlabeled data. One of key issues with fair learning is the balance
between fairness and accuracy. Previous studies arguing that increasing the
size of the training set can have a better trade-off. We believe that
increasing the training set with unlabeled data may achieve the similar result.
Hence, we develop a framework for fair semi-supervised learning, which is
formulated as an optimization problem. This includes classifier loss to
optimize accuracy, label propagation loss to optimize unlabled data prediction,
and fairness constraints over labeled and unlabeled data to optimize the
fairness level. The framework is conducted in logistic regression and support
vector machines under the fairness metrics of disparate impact and disparate
mistreatment. We theoretically analyze the source of discrimination in
semi-supervised learning via bias, variance and noise decomposition. Extensive
experiments show that our method is able to achieve fair semi-supervised
learning, and reach a better trade-off between accuracy and fairness than fair
supervised learning.

models on decentralized data sources. In order to sustain long-term
participation of data owners, it is important to fairly appraise each data
source and compensate data owners for their contribution to the training
process. The Shapley value (SV) defines a unique payoff scheme that satisfies
many desiderata for a data value notion. It has been increasingly used for
valuing training data in centralized learning. However, computing the SV
requires exhaustively evaluating the model performance on every subset of data
sources, which incurs prohibitive communication cost in the federated setting.
Besides, the canonical SV ignores the order of data sources during training,
which conflicts with the sequential nature of FL. This paper proposes a variant
of the SV amenable to FL, which we call the federated Shapley value. The
federated SV preserves the desirable properties of the canonical SV while it
can be calculated without incurring extra communication cost and is also able
to capture the effect of participation order on data value. We conduct a
thorough empirical study of the federated SV on a range of tasks, including
noisy label detection, adversarial participant detection, and data
summarization on different benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that it can
reflect the real utility of data sources for FL and has the potential to
enhance system robustness, security, and efficiency. We also report and analyze

manner. Moreover, since RelativeNAS only requires low-fidelity performance
estimation to distinguish each pair of fast-learner and slow-learner, it saves
certain computation costs for training the candidate architectures. The
proposed RelativeNAS brings several unique advantages: (1) it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with top-1 error rate of 24.88%, i.e.
outperforming DARTS and AmoebaNet-B by 1.82% and 1.12% respectively; (2) it
spends only nine hours with a single 1080Ti GPU to obtain the discovered cells,
i.e. 3.75x and 7875x faster than DARTS and AmoebaNet respectively; (3) it
provides that the discovered cells obtained on CIFAR-10 can be directly

detector on the plant side. Conditions under which the proposed methodology can
detect deception attacks, such as covert attacks, zero dynamics attacks, and
replay attacks are characterized. An advantage of the proposed methodology is
that one does not require a fully secured communication link which implies that
the communication link can be compromised by the adversary while it is used to
transmit the C\&C side observer estimates. Also, it is assumed that adversaries
have access to parameters of the system, filters, and the UIO-based detector,
however, they do not have access to all the communication link channels.
Conditions under which, using the communication link cyber attacks, the
adversary cannot eliminate the impact of actuator and sensor cyber attacks are
investigated. To illustrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed
CAFDI methodologies, simulation case studies are provided and comparisons with
detection methods that are available in the literature are included to

field theory is a case in point. This theory however is based on the algorithm
of the scattering matrix where all participating particles are free in the

Lorentz-covariant theory of bound state which will address the question of how
the hydrogen atom would look to moving observers. The question is then whether
this Lorentz-covariant theory of bound states can be synthesized with the field

aperture radar (SAR), provide excellent means to monitor ever-growing urban
environments continuously. Notably, in the case of large-scale disasters (e.g.,
tsunamis and earthquakes), in which a response is highly time-critical, images
from both data modalities can complement each other to accurately convey the
full damage condition in the disaster's aftermath. However, due to several
factors, such as weather and satellite coverage, it is often uncertain which
data modality will be the first available for rapid disaster response efforts.
Hence, novel methodologies that can utilize all accessible EO datasets are
essential for disaster management. In this study, we have developed a global
multisensor and multitemporal dataset for building damage mapping. We included
building damage characteristics from three disaster types, namely, earthquakes,
tsunamis, and typhoons, and considered three building damage categories. The
global dataset contains high-resolution optical imagery and
high-to-moderate-resolution multiband SAR data acquired before and after each
disaster. Using this comprehensive dataset, we analyzed five data modality
scenarios for damage mapping: single-mode (optical and SAR datasets),
cross-modal (pre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR datasets), and mode
fusion scenarios. We defined a damage mapping framework for the semantic
segmentation of damaged buildings based on a deep convolutional neural network
algorithm. We compare our approach to another state-of-the-art baseline model
for damage mapping. The results indicated that our dataset, together with a
deep learning network, enabled acceptable predictions for all the data modality

difficult to change this order, because once the image is demosaicked, the
statistical properties of the noise will be changed dramatically. This is
extremely challenging for traditional denoising models that strongly rely on

first demosaicking and then denoising. In the first stage, we design a
demosaicking algorithm that combines traditional methods and a convolutional

improve the performance in image demosaicking, we modify an Inception

CNN to learn the demosaicking residual noise (including artifacts) of it, that
allows to obtain a restored full color image. Our proposed algorithm completely
avoids the checkerboard effect and retains more image detail. Furthermore, it
can process very high-level noise while the performances of other CNN based

of operational processes. Although sometimes the term ""workflow mining"" is
used, the application in the context of Workflow Management (WFM) and Business
Process Management (BPM) systems is limited. The main reason is that WFM/BPM
systems control the process, leaving less room for flexibility and the
corresponding deviations. However, as this paper shows, it is easy to extract
event data from systems like Camunda, one of the leading open-source WFM/BPM
systems. Moreover, although the respective process engines control the process
flow, process mining is still able to provide valuable insights, such as the
analysis of the performance of the paths and the mining of the decision rules.
This demo paper presents a process mining connector to Camunda that extracts
event logs and process models, allowing for the application of existing process
mining tools. We also analyzed the added value of different process mining
techniques in the context of Camunda. We discuss a subset of process mining
techniques that nicely complements the process intelligence capabilities of
Camunda. Through this demo paper, we hope to boost the use of process mining
among Camunda users.

distribution grids, especially the one with high-penetration renewables. The
uncertainties, initiated by the time-series behavior of renewables, will almost
certainly lead to bad TI results without a proper treatment. These
uncertainties are analytically intractable under conventional framework--they
are usually jointly spatial-temporal dependent, and hence cannot be simply
treated as white noise. For this purpose, a hybrid framework is suggested in
this paper to handle these uncertainties in a systematic and theoretical way;
in particular, big data analytics are studied to harness the jointly
spatial-temporal statistical properties of those uncertainties. With some prior
knowledge, a model bank is built first to store the countable typical models of
network configurations; therefore, the difference between the SE outputs of
each bank model and our observation is capable of being defined as a matrix
variate--the so-called random matrix. In order to gain insight into the random
matrix, a well-designed metric space is needed. Auto-regression (AR) model,
factor analysis (FA), and random matrix theory (RMT) are tied together for the
metric space design, followed by jointly temporal-spatial analysis of those
matrices which is conducted in a high-dimensional (vector) space. Under the
proposed framework, some big data analytics and theoretical results are
obtained to improve the TI performance. Our framework is validated using IEEE

for optimal control problems, called the penalty-barrier finite element method
(PBF). PBF converges under very weak assumptions on the problem instance. PBF
avoids the ringing between collocation points, for example, by avoiding
collocation entirely. Instead, equality path constraint residuals are forced to
zero everywhere by an integral quadratic penalty term. We highlight conceptual
differences between collocation- and penalty-type direct transcription methods.
Theoretical convergence results for both types of methods are reviewed and
compared. Formulas for implementing PBF are presented, with details on the
formulation as a nonlinear program (NLP), sparsity and solution. Numerical
experiments compare PBF against several collocation methods with regard to
robustness, accuracy, sparsity and computational cost. We show that the
computational cost, sparsity and construction of the NLP functions are roughly
the same as for orthogonal collocation methods of the same degree and mesh. As
an advantage, PBF converges in cases where collocation methods fail. PBF also
allows one to trade off computational cost, optimality and violation of
differential and other equality equations against each other.

series, and their most important application, namely, to the Dirichlet series
characterizing the (in)famous Riemann Hypothesis, revealed insights that are
not in support of the most celebrated conjecture for over 150 years.
  In contrast with deterministic series considered by Roy and Bhattacharya
(2020), in this article we take up random infinite series for our
investigation. Remarkably, our method does not require any simplifying
assumption. Albeit the Bayesian characterization theory for random series is no
different from that for the deterministic setup, construction of effective
upper bounds for partial sums, required for implementation, turns out to be a
challenging undertaking in the random setup. In this article, we construct
parametric and nonparametric upper bound forms for the partial sums of random
infinite series and demonstrate the generality of the latter in comparison to
the former. Simulation studies exhibit high accuracy and efficiency of the
nonparametric bound in all the setups that we consider.
  Finally, exploiting the property that the summands tend to zero in the case
of series convergence, we consider application of our nonparametric bound
driven Bayesian method to global climate change analysis. Specifically,
analyzing the global average temperature record over the years 1850--2016 and
Holocene global average temperature reconstruction data 12,000 years before
present, we conclude, in spite of the current global warming situation, that
global climate dynamics is subject to temporary variability only, the current
global warming being an instance, and long term global warming or cooling
either in the past or in the future, are highly unlikely.

charge-coupled device (CCD) developed for the soft X-ray imaging telescope,
Xtend, aboard the XRISM satellite. The CCD is equipped with a charge injection
(CI) capability, in which sacrificial charge is periodically injected to fill
the charge traps. By evaluating the re-emission of the trapped charge observed
behind the CI rows, we find that there are at least three trap populations with
different time constants. The traps with the shortest time constant, which is
equivalent to a transfer time of approximately one pixel, are mainly
responsible for the trailing charge of an X-ray event seen in the following
pixel. A comparison of the trailing charge in two clocking modes reveals that
the CTI depends not only on the transfer time but also on the area, namely the
imaging or storage area. We construct a new CTI model with taking into account
with both transfer-time and area dependence. This model reproduces the data
obtained in both clocking modes consistently. We also examine apparent flux
dependence of the CTI observed without the CI technique. The higher incident
X-ray flux is, the lower the CTI value becomes. It is due to a sacrificial

and, second, the use of guided mode resonance (GMR) within the subwavelength

field coupling. Calculations are performed using the finite difference time
domain (FDTD) technique. Excellent broadband absorption is observed for the

construction of the scheme is based on the direct modeling on the mesh size and
time step scales, and the local cell's Knudsen number determines the flow
physics. The proposed scheme has the multiscale and asymptotic complexity
diminishing properties. The multiscale property means that according to cell's
Knudsen number the scheme can capture the non-equilibrium flow physics in the
rarefied flow regime, and preserve the asymptotic Euler, Navier-Stokes, and
magnetohydrodynamics limit in the continuum regime. The asymptotic complexity
diminishing property means that the total degree of freedom of the scheme
automatically decreases as cell's Knudsen number decreases. In the continuum
regime, the scheme automatically degenerates from a kinetic solver to a
hydrodynamic solver. In UGKWP, the evolution of microscopic velocity
distribution is coupled with the evolution of macroscopic variables, and the
particle evolution as well as the macroscopic fluxes are modeled from the time
accumulating solution up to a time step scale from the kinetic model equation.
  For plasma transport, current scheme provides a smooth transition from
particle in cell (PIC) method in the rarefied regime to the magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) solver in the continuum regime. In the continuum limit, the cell size and
time step of the UGKWP method is not restricted to be less than the mean free
path and mean collision time. In the highly magnetized regime, the cell size

period. The multiscale and asymptotic complexity diminishing properties of the

corner of the wedge. In this paper, we give an exact construction of the
gravitational solutions for wedge holography from the ones in AdS/CFT. By
applying this construction, we prove the equivalence between wedge holography
and AdS/CFT for vacuum Einstein gravity, by showing that the classical
gravitational action and thus the CFT partition function in large N limit are
the same for the two theories. The equivalence to AdS/CFT can be regarded as a
""proof"" of wedge holography in a certain sense. As an application of this
powerful equivalence, we derive easily the holographic Weyl anomaly,
holographic Entanglement/R\'enyi entropy and correlation functions for wedge
holography. Besides, we discuss the general solutions of wedge holography and
argue that they correspond to the AdS/CFT with suitable matter fields.
Interestingly, we notice that the intrinsic Ricci scalar on the brane is always
a constant, which depends on the tension. Finally, we generalize the
discussions to dS/CFT and flat space holography. Remarkably, we find that
AdS/CFT, dS/CFT and flat space holography can be unified in the framework of
codimension two holography in asymptotically AdS. Different dualities are
distinguished by different types of spacetimes on the brane.

Existing studies focus on building a context-response matching model with
various neural architectures or PLMs and typically learning with a single
response prediction task. These approaches overlook many potential training
signals contained in dialogue data, which might be beneficial for context
understanding and produce better features for response prediction. Besides, the
response retrieved from existing dialogue systems supervised by the
conventional way still faces some critical challenges, including incoherence
and inconsistency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose learning
a context-response matching model with auxiliary self-supervised tasks designed
for the dialogue data based on pre-trained language models. Specifically, we
introduce four self-supervised tasks including next session prediction,
utterance restoration, incoherence detection and consistency discrimination,
and jointly train the PLM-based response selection model with these auxiliary
tasks in a multi-task manner. By this means, the auxiliary tasks can guide the
learning of the matching model to achieve a better local optimum and select a
more proper response. Experiment results on two benchmarks indicate that the
proposed auxiliary self-supervised tasks bring significant improvement for
multi-turn response selection in retrieval-based dialogues, and our model
achieves new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

dwarfs is usually interpreted as a sign of the presence of inhomogeneous cloud
covers in the atmosphere. This paper aims at exploring the role of temperature
fluctuations in these spectral modulations. These fluctuations could naturally
arise in a convective atmosphere impacted by diabatic processes such as complex
chemistry, i.e. the recently proposed mechanism to explain the L/T transition:
CO/CH4 radiative convection. We use the 1D radiative/convective code ATMO with
ad-hoc modifications of the temperature gradient to model the rotational
spectral modulation of 2MASS 1821, 2MASS 0136, and PSO 318.5-22.
  Modeling the spectral bright-to-faint ratio of the modulation of 2MASS 1821,
2MASS 0136, and PSO 318.5-22 shows that most spectral characteristics can be
reproduced by temperature variations alone. Furthermore, the approximately
anti-correlated variability between different wavelengths can be easily
interpreted as a change in the temperature gradient in the atmosphere which is
the consequence we expect from CO/CH4 radiative convection to explain the L/T
transition. The deviation from an exact anti-correlation could then be
interpreted as a phase shift similar to the hot-spot shift a different
bandpasses in the atmosphere of hot Jupiters. Our results suggest that the
rotational spectral modulation from cloud-opacity and temperature variations
are degenerate. The detection of direct cloud spectral signatures, e.g. the
silicate absorption feature at 10 um, would help to confirm the presence of
clouds and their contribution to spectral modulations. Future studies looking
at the differences in the spectral modulation of objects with and without the
silicate absorption feature may give us some insight on how to distinguish
cloud-opacity fluctuations from temperature fluctuations.

quantitative analyses. However, manual segmentation is a very time-consuming
task which is prone to error and must be completed by highly specialized
indi-viduals. Super-resolution reconstruction of fetal MRI has become standard
for processing such data as it improves image quality and resolution. However,
dif-ferent pipelines result in slightly different outputs, further complicating
the gen-eralization of segmentation methods aiming to segment super-resolution
data. Therefore, we propose using transfer learning with noisy multi-class
labels to automatically segment high resolution fetal brain MRIs using a single
set of seg-mentations created with one reconstruction method and tested for
generalizability across other reconstruction methods. Our results show that the
network can auto-matically segment fetal brain reconstructions into 7 different
tissue types, regard-less of reconstruction method used. Transfer learning
offers some advantages when compared to training without pre-initialized
weights, but the network trained on clean labels had more accurate
segmentations overall. No additional manual segmentations were required.
Therefore, the proposed network has the potential to eliminate the need for
manual segmentations needed in quantitative analyses of the fetal brain
independent of reconstruction method used, offering an unbiased way to quantify
normal and pathological neurodevelopment.

paper. Based on the geometrical information of defects and initial results by
the theoretical analysis of defect reconstructions, a deep learning neural
network model is built to reveal the physical relationship between defects and
the received signals. This data-driven model is then applied to quantitatively
assess and characterize defect profiles in structures, reduce the inaccuracy of
the theoretical modelling and eliminate the impact of noise pollution in the
process of inspection. To demonstrate advantages of the developed approach to
reconstructions of defects with complex profiles, numerical examples including
basic defect profiles and a defect with the noisy fringe have been examined.
Results show that this approach has greater accuracy for reconstruction of
defects in structures as compared with the analytical method and provides a
valuable insight into the development of artificial intelligence-assisted

ultraviolet (UV) and blue-optical are generally interpreted to be due to
Rayleigh scattering by high-altitude haze particles. However, the haze
composition and its production mechanisms are not fully understood, and
observational information is still limited. Aims: We aim to study the presence
of hazes in the atmospheres of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b with high spectral
resolution spectra by analysing the strength of water vapour cross-correlation
signals across the red optical and near-infrared wavelength ranges. Methods: A
total of seven transits of the two planets were observed with the CARMENES
spectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope. Their Doppler-shifted signals
were disentangled from the telluric and stellar contributions using the
detrending algorithm SYSREM. The residual spectra were subsequently
cross-correlated with water vapour templates at 0.70-0.96 $\mu$m to measure the
strength of the water vapour absorption bands. Results: The optical water
vapour bands were detected at $5.2 \sigma$ in HD 209458 b in one transit,
whereas no evidence of them was found in four transits of HD 189733 b.
Therefore, the relative strength of the optical water bands compared to those
in the near-infrared were found to be larger in HD 209458 b than in HD 189733
b. Conclusions: We interpret the non-detection of optical water bands in the
transmission spectra of HD 189733 b, compared to the detection in HD 209458 b,
to be due to the presence of high-altitude hazes in the former planet, which
are largely absent in the latter. This is consistent with previous measurements
with the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that currently available CARMENES
observations of hot Jupiters can be used to investigate the presence of haze
extinction in their atmospheres.

emergence is useful for space-weather forecasting. Evidence of any
pre-emergence signatures will also shed light on sub-surface processes

emerging ARs from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic Emerging Active

neural networks (CNN) to characterize pre-emergence surface magnetic-field

magnetograms and a control set of non-emergence (NE) magnetograms with a True
Skill Statistic (TSS) score of ~85%, 3h prior to emergence and ~40\%, 24h prior

obtained using discriminant analysis of only the unsigned magnetic flux. We
develop a network pruning algorithm to interpret the trained CNN and show that
the CNN incorporates filters that respond positively as well as negatively to
the unsigned magnetic flux of the magnetograms. Using synthetic magnetograms,
we demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the length-scale of the
magnetic regions with small-scale and intense fields producing maximum CNN
output and possibly a characteristic pre-emergence pattern. Given increasing
popularity of deep learning, techniques developed here for interpretation of

with the AIM 2020 workshop at ECCV 2020. Common scaling factors for learned
video super-resolution (VSR) do not go beyond factor 4. Missing information can
be restored well in this region, especially in HR videos, where the
high-frequency content mostly consists of texture details. The task in this
challenge is to upscale videos with an extreme factor of 16, which results in
more serious degradations that also affect the structural integrity of the
videos. A single pixel in the low-resolution (LR) domain corresponds to 256
pixels in the high-resolution (HR) domain. Due to this massive information
loss, it is hard to accurately restore the missing information. Track 1 is set
up to gauge the state-of-the-art for such a demanding task, where fidelity to
the ground truth is measured by PSNR and SSIM. Perceptually higher quality can
be achieved in trade-off for fidelity by generating plausible high-frequency
content. Track 2 therefore aims at generating visually pleasing results, which
are ranked according to human perception, evaluated by a user study. In
contrast to single image super-resolution (SISR), VSR can benefit from
additional information in the temporal domain. However, this also imposes an
additional requirement, as the generated frames need to be consistent along
time.

gives rise to lepton number violation and hence Majorana light neutrino masses

We show that for suitable parameter space, both the components with keV

undergo down-scattering with electrons. We check the parameter space of the

impurity spins are embedded in a host system which consists of a finite number
of classical spins localized on the sites of a lattice and interacting via a
nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange. An effective low-energy theory for the
slow impurity-spin dynamics is derived for the regime, where the local exchange
coupling between impurity and host spins is weak. To this end we apply the
recently developed adiabatic spin dynamics (ASD) theory. Besides the
Hamiltonian-like classical spin torques, the ASD additionally accounts for a
novel topological spin torque that originates as a holonomy effect in the
close-to-adiabatic-dynamics regime. It is shown that the effective low-energy
precession dynamics cannot be derived from an effective Hamilton function and
is characterized by a non-vanishing precession frequency even if the initial
state deviates only slightly from a ground state. The effective theory is
compared to the fully numerical solution of the equations of motion for the
whole system of impurity and host spins to identify the parameter regime where
the adiabatic effective theory applies. Effective theories beyond the adiabatic
approximation must necessarily include dynamic host degrees of freedom and go
beyond the idea of a simple indirect magnetic exchange. We discuss an example
of a generalized constrained spin dynamics which does improve the description

cyber-attacks targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). The conventional
approach to detection in literature is to learn the ""normal"" behaviour of the
system, to be then able to label noteworthy deviations from it as anomalies.
However, during operations, ICSs inevitably and continuously evolve their
behaviour, due to e.g., replacement of devices, workflow modifications, or
other reasons. As a consequence, the accuracy of the anomaly detection process
may be dramatically affected with a considerable amount of false alarms being
generated. This paper presents DAICS, a novel deep learning framework with a
modular design to fit in large ICSs. The key component of the framework is a
2-branch neural network that learns the changes in the ICS behaviour with a
small number of data samples and a few gradient updates. This is supported by
an automatic tuning mechanism of the detection threshold that takes into
account the changes in the prediction error under normal operating conditions.
In this regard, no specialised human intervention is needed to update the other
parameters of the system. DAICS has been evaluated using publicly available
datasets and shows an increased detection rate and accuracy compared to state
of the art approaches, as well as higher robustness to additive noise.

intrinsic dependency relationships among data exist and generally manifest at
multiple spatio-temporal scales. However, given a specific PSTA task and the

of a deep learning model, theoretically analyze the model's learning behavior,
and quantitatively characterize the model's learning capacity remains a
mystery. In order to demystify the power of deep learning for PSTA, in this
paper, we provide a comprehensive framework for deep learning model design and
information-theoretic analysis. First, we develop and demonstrate a novel
interactively- and integratively-connected deep recurrent neural network
(I$^2$DRNN) model. I$^2$DRNN consists of three modules: an Input module that
integrates data from heterogeneous sources; a Hidden module that captures the
information at different scales while allowing the information to flow
interactively between layers; and an Output module that models the integrative
effects of information from various hidden layers to generate the output
predictions. Second, to theoretically prove that our designed model can learn
multi-scale spatio-temporal dependency in PSTA tasks, we provide an
information-theoretic analysis to examine the information-based learning
capacity (i-CAP) of the proposed model. Third, to validate the I$^2$DRNN model
and confirm its i-CAP, we systematically conduct a series of experiments
involving both synthetic datasets and real-world PSTA tasks. The experimental
results show that the I$^2$DRNN model outperforms both classical and
state-of-the-art models, and is able to capture meaningful multi-scale
spatio-temporal dependency.

distributional characteristics of the aggregated data statistics may be derived
from distributional assumptions of the underlying individual data, but they are
often not made explicit in publications. This paper provides the distribution
of the aggregated data statistics that were derived from a heteroscedastic

DerSimonian and Laird's pooled estimate and the Trim & Fill and PET-PEESE

handwriting into short-time segments consisting of individual or multiple
concatenated strokes; and ii) the on-line synthesis of those short-time
handwriting segments, which is based on a sequence-to-sequence Variational
Autoencoder (VAE). The main advantages of the proposed approach are that the
synthesis is carried out in short-time segments (that can run from a character
fraction to full characters) and that the VAE can be trained on a configurable
handwriting dataset. These two properties give a lot of flexibility to our
synthesiser, e.g., as shown in our experiments, DeepWriteSYN can generate
realistic handwriting variations of a given handwritten structure corresponding
to the natural variation within a given population or a given subject. These
two cases are developed experimentally for individual digits and handwriting
signatures, respectively, achieving in both cases remarkable results.
  Also, we provide experimental results for the task of on-line signature
verification showing the high potential of DeepWriteSYN to improve
significantly one-shot learning scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first synthesis approach capable of generating realistic on-line

handwriting generation either completely synthetic or as natural variation of

The present article
aims at characterization of weighted networks based on sparsity, as a measure

index defined on ordered degree sequence of simple networks and derives further
properties of this index. The range of possible values of sparsity index of any
connected network, with edge-count in specific intervals, is worked out
analytically in terms of node-count; a pattern is uncovered in corresponding
degree sequences to produce highest sparsities. Given the edge-weight frequency
distribution of a network, we have formulated an expression of the sparsity
index of edge-weights. Its properties are analyzed under different
distributions of edge-weights. For example, the upper and lower bounds of
sparsity index of edge-weights of a network, having all distinct edge-weights,
is determined in terms of its node-count and edge density. The article
highlights that this summary index with low computational cost, computed on
different network parameters, is useful to reveal different structural and
organizational aspects of networks for performing analysis. An application of
this index has been demonstrated through overlapping community detection of
networks. The results validated on artificial and real-world networks show its

simplify the multisite phosphorylation mechanism by a stochastic Hill function

simulation results from the stochastic Hill function with the distributive

methods have been focusing on finding the best parameter vector, in most

stochastic Hill function based on a quasi-Newton stochastic optimization

characterizing different features of the simulation-based empirical data, among

$\rho(1450)$ controversy. The approach employs an improved parametrization in
terms of a manifestly unitary and analytic three-channel $S$-matrix with its
complex-energy pole positions. The included channels are $\pi\pi$, $\rho2\pi$,
and $\rho\rho$, the latter two being effective in the sense that they mimic
several experimentally observed decay modes with nearby thresholds. In an
alternative fit, the $\rho2\pi$ mode is replaced by $\omega\pi$, which is also
an experimentally relevant channel. The improvement with respect to prior work
amounts to the enforcement of maximum crossing symmetry through once-subtracted
dispersion relations called GKPY equations. A separate analysis concerns the
pion electromagnetic form factor, which again demonstrates the enormous
importance of guaranteeing unitarity and analyticity when dealing with very
broad and highly inelastic resonances. In the case of $\rho(1250)$ vs.
$\rho(1450)$, the failure to do so is shown to give rise to an error in the
predicted mass of about 170 MeV. A clear picture emerges from these analyses,
identifying five vector $\rho$ states below 2 GeV, viz. $\rho(770)$,
$\rho(1250)$, $\rho(1450)$, $\rho(1600)$, and $\rho(1800)$, with $\rho(1250)$
being indisputably the most important excited $\rho$ resonance. The stability
of the fits as well as the imposition of unitarity, analyticity, and
approximate crossing symmetry in the analyses lend very strong support to these
assignments. The possibly far-reaching consequences for meson spectroscopy are
discussed.

collective dynamics is a fundamental problem in network science. In order to
compute the various topological descriptors commonly used to characterize the
structure of a complex system (e.g. the degree, the clustering coefficient), it
is usually necessary to completely reconstruct the network of relations between
the subsystems. Several methods are available to detect the existence of
interactions between the nodes of a network. By observing some physical
quantities through time, the structural relationships are inferred using
various discriminating statistics (e.g. correlations, mutual information,
etc.). In this setting, the uncertainty about the existence of the edges is
reflected in the uncertainty about the topological descriptors. In this study,
we propose a novel methodological framework to evaluate this uncertainty,
replacing the topological descriptors, even at the level of a single node, with
appropriate probability distributions, eluding the reconstruction phase. Our
theoretical framework agrees with the numerical experiments performed on a
large set of synthetic and real-world networks. Our results provide a grounded
framework for the analysis and the interpretation of widely used topological
descriptors, such as degree centrality, clustering and clusters, in scenarios
where the existence of network connectivity is statistically inferred or when
the probabilities of existence $\pi_{ij}$ of the edges are known. To this
purpose we also provide a simple and mathematically grounded process to
transform the discriminating statistics into the probabilities $\pi_{ij}$ .

user preferences embedded in historical data. More importantly, the common
heterogeneity in data stream greatly reduces the accuracy of streaming
recommendations. The reason is that different preferences (or characteristics)
of different types of users (or items) cannot be well learned by a unified
model. To address these two issues, we propose a Variational and
Reservoir-enhanced Sampling based Double-Wing Mixture of Experts framework,
called VRS-DWMoE, to improve the accuracy of streaming recommendations. In
VRS-DWMoE, we first devise variational and reservoir-enhanced sampling to
wisely complement new data with historical data, and thus address the user
preference drift issue while capturing long-term user preferences. After that,
we propose a Double-Wing Mixture of Experts (DWMoE) model to first effectively
learn heterogeneous user preferences and item characteristics, and then make
recommendations based on them. Specifically, DWMoE contains two Mixture of
Experts (MoE, an effective ensemble learning model) to learn user preferences
and item characteristics, respectively. Moreover, the multiple experts in each
MoE learn the preferences (or characteristics) of different types of users (or
items) where each expert specializes in one underlying type. Extensive

shows single quantum emitting behaviors through radiative relaxation processes
providing a new class of optical sources for potential applications in quantum

crystal defects has mainly been observed in cryogenic conditions because of
their sub-wavelength emission region and low quantum yield at room temperature.
Furthermore, engineering the radiative relaxation properties, e.g., emission
region, intensity, and energy, remained challenging. Here, we present a
plasmonic antenna with a triple-sharp-tips geometry to induce and control the
X$_L$ emission of a WSe$_2$ monolayer (ML) at room temperature. By placing a ML
crystal on the two sharp Au tips in a bowtie antenna fabricated through cascade
domino lithography with a radius of curvature of <1 nm, we effectively induce
tensile strain in the nanoscale region to create robust X$_L$ states. An Au tip
with tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) spectroscopy is then added to the
strained region to probe and control the X$_L$ emission. With TEPL enhancement
of X$_L$ as high as ~10$^6$ in the triple-sharp-tips device, experimental
results demonstrate the controllable X$_L$ emission in <30 nm area with a PL
energy shift up to 40 meV, resolved by tip-enhanced PL and Raman imaging with
<15 nm spatial resolution. Our approach provides a systematic way to control
localized quantum light in 2D semiconductors offering new strategies for active

in nature and uses as a source of gravity the effective stress-energy tensor
(SET) corresponding to vacuum polarization of quantum fields, and a minimum
spherical radius is a few orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, so
that the effects of quantum gravity should be still negligible. We estimate the
other quantum contributions to the effective SET, caused by a nontrivial
topology of spatial sections and particle production from vacuum due to a
nonstationary gravitational field and show that these contributions are
negligibly small as compared to the SET due to vacuum polarization. The same is
shown for such classical phenomena as accretion of different kinds of matter to
the black hole and its further motion to the would-be singularity. Thus, in a
clear sense, our model of a semiclassical bounce instead of a Schwarzschild
singularity is stable under both quantum and classical perturbations.

of Compact Sources (PCCS2), produced using a new multi-band Bayesian Extraction
and Estimation Package (BeeP). BeeP assumes that the compact sources present in
PCCS2 at 857 GHz have a dust-like spectral energy distribution, which leads to
emission at both lower and higher frequencies, and adjusts the parameters of
the source and its SED to fit the emission observed in Planck's three highest
frequency channels at 353, 545, and 857 GHz, as well as the IRIS map at 3000
GHz. In order to reduce confusion regarding diffuse cirrus emission, BeeP's
data model includes a description of the background emission surrounding each
source, and it adjusts the confidence in the source parameter extraction based
on the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of the background
emission. BeeP produces the following three new sets of parameters for each
source: (a) fits to a modified blackbody (MBB) thermal emission model of the
source; (b) SED-independent source flux densities at each frequency considered;
and (c) fits to an MBB model of the background in which the source is embedded.
BeeP also calculates, for each source, a reliability parameter, which takes
into account confusion due to the surrounding cirrus. We define a
high-reliability subset (BeeP/base), containing 26 083 sources (54.1 per cent
of the total PCCS2 catalogue), the majority of which have no information on
reliability in the PCCS2. The results of the BeeP extension of PCCS2, which are
made publicly available via the PLA, will enable the study of the thermal
properties of well-defined samples of compact Galactic and extra-galactic dusty
sources.

optimality of the solution to a synthetic problem for the ability to have a

further demonstrate how local controls on the qubits can be used to control the

proof-of-concept evidence of how these algorithms could work.

exactly contained within the RZA when the latter is restricted to an
irrotational dust source with a flow-orthogonal foliation of spacetime. In such
a case, the solution is governed by the first principal scalar invariant of the
deformation field, proving a direct connection with a class of Newtonian
three-dimensional solutions without symmetry. For the second class, a necessary
and sufficient condition for the vanishing of cosmological backreaction on a
scale of homogeneity is expressed through integral constraints. Domains with no
backreaction can be smoothly matched, forming a lattice model, where exact
deviations average out at a given scale of homogeneity, and the homogeneous and
isotropic background is recovered as an average property of the model. Although
the connection with the first class of Szekeres solutions is not
straightforward, this class allows for the interpretation in terms of a spatial
superposition of nonintersecting fluid lines, where each world line evolves
independently and under the RZA model equations, but with different associated
`local backgrounds'. This points to the possibility of generalizing the
Lagrangian perturbation schemes to structure formation models on evolving

number of COVID-19 cases in Turkey. The COVID-19 data for 30 days, between
March 24 and April 23, 2020, are used to estimate the next fifteen days. The
mean absolute error of the LSTM Network for 15 days estimation is
1,69$\pm$1.35%. Whereas, for the same data, the error of the Box-Jenkins method
is 3.24$\pm$1.56%, Prophet method is 6.88$\pm$4.96% and Holt-Winters Additive
method with Damped Trend is 0.47$\pm$0.28%. Additionally, when the number of
deaths data is also provided with the number of total cases to the input of
LSTM Network, the mean error reduces to 0.99$\pm$0.51%. Consequently, addition
of the number of deaths data to the input, results a lower error in
forecasting, compared to using only the number of total cases as the input.
However, Holt-Winters Additive method with Damped Trend gives superior results
to LSTM Networks in forecasting the total number of COVID-19 cases.

strategies for energy efficiency in buildings, where various kinds of

strategy to design an efficient energy efficiency system is not
straightforward; it requires a priori knowledge of existing fusion strategies,
their applications and their properties. To this regard, seeking to provide the
energy research community with a better understanding of data fusion strategies
in building energy saving systems, their principles, advantages, and potential
applications, this paper proposes an extensive survey of existing data fusion
mechanisms deployed to reduce excessive consumption and promote sustainability.
We investigate their conceptualizations, advantages, challenges and drawbacks,
as well as performing a taxonomy of existing data fusion strategies and other
contributing factors. Following, a comprehensive comparison of the
state-of-the-art data fusion based energy efficiency frameworks is conducted
using various parameters, including data fusion level, data fusion techniques,
behavioral change influencer, behavioral change incentive, recorded data,
platform architecture, IoT technology and application scenario. Moreover, a
novel method for electrical appliance identification is proposed based on the
fusion of 2D local texture descriptors, where 1D power signals are transformed
into 2D space and treated as images. The empirical evaluation, conducted on
three real datasets, shows promising performance, in which up to 99.68%
accuracy and 99.52% F1 score have been attained. In addition, various open
research challenges and future orientations to improve data fusion based energy
efficiency ecosystems are explored.

memory serves as an inferred observable, conceptually on the same footing as
the mass and the spin of the final black hole. Given candidate waveforms for
any LIGO event, then, one can calculate the posterior probability distribution
functions for the total gravitational memory, and use them to compare and
contrast the waveforms. In this paper we present these posterior distributions
for the binary black hole merger events reported in the first Gravitational
Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-1), using the Phenomenological and
Effective-One-Body waveforms. On the whole, the two sets of posterior
distributions agree with each other quite well though we find larger
discrepancies for the $\ell=2, m=1$ mode of the memory. This signals a possible
source of systematic errors that was not captured by the posterior
distributions of other inferred observables. Thus, the posterior distributions
of various angular modes of total memory can serve as diagnostic tools to
further improve the waveforms. Analyses such as this would be valuable
especially for future events as the sensitivity of ground based detectors
improves, and for LISA which could measure the total gravitational memory
directly.

and misreporting of the response variable and from choice behaviour that is
inconsistent with modelling assumptions (e.g. random utility maximisation). In
the presence of outliers, standard discrete choice models produce biased
estimates and suffer from compromised predictive accuracy. Robust statistical
models are less sensitive to outliers than standard non-robust models. This
paper analyses two robust alternatives to the multinomial probit (MNP) model.
The two models are robit models whose kernel error distributions are
heavy-tailed t-distributions to moderate the influence of outliers. The first
model is the multinomial robit (MNR) model, in which a generic degrees of
freedom parameter controls the heavy-tailedness of the kernel error
distribution. The second model, the generalised multinomial robit (Gen-MNR)
model, is more flexible than MNR, as it allows for distinct heavy-tailedness in
each dimension of the kernel error distribution. For both models, we derive
Gibbs samplers for posterior inference. In a simulation study, we illustrate
the excellent finite sample properties of the proposed Bayes estimators and
show that MNR and Gen-MNR produce more accurate estimates if the choice data
contain outliers through the lens of the non-robust MNP model. In a case study

substantial margins in terms of in-sample fit and out-of-sample predictive

a few Myr, show low degrees of fractionation in the gas phase, in agreement
with earlier studies. However, during collapse, the differential rate of
adsorption of 14N- and 15N-containing species onto grains results in enhanced
15N:14N ratios, in better agreement with the observations. Furthermore, we find
differences in the behavior, with increasing density, of the isotopic ratio in
different species. We find that the collapse must take place on approximately
one free-fall timescale, based on the CO abundance profile in L183 [see the end

parameterization approach based on applying delay operators to a measurable

parameters, which depends on the signals frequencies. We propose to use Dynamic
Regressor Extension and Mixing method to replace nth order regression model
with n first-order regression models. Then the standard gradient descent method
is used to estimate separately for each the regression model parameter. On the
next step using algebraic equations finite-time frequency estimate is found.
The described method does not require measuring or calculating derivatives of
the input signal, and uses only the signal measurement. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is demonstrated through the set of numerical simulations.

the evolutionary channels and mechanisms governing the evolution of
stripped-envelope SN progenitors due to a variety of observational constraints
available. Comparison of these constraints with the full distribution of
theoretical properties not only help ascertain the prevalence of observed
properties in nature, but can also reveal currently unobserved populations. In
this follow-up paper, we use the large grid of models presented in Sravan et
al. 2019 to derive distributions of single and binary SNe IIb progenitor
properties and compare them to constraints from three independent observational
probes: multi-band SN light-curves, direct progenitor detections, and
X-ray/radio observations. Consistent with previous work, we find that while
current observations exclude single stars as SN IIb progenitors, SN IIb
progenitors in binaries can account for them. We also find that the
distributions indicate the existence of an unobserved dominant population of
binary SNe IIb at low metallicity that arise due to mass transfer initiated on
the Hertzsprung Gap. In particular, our models indicate the existence of a
group of highly stripped (envelope mass ~0.1-0.2 M_sun) progenitors that are
compact (<50 R_sun) and blue (T_eff <~ 10^5K) with ~10^4.5-10^5.5 L_sun and low
density circumstellar mediums. As discussed in Sravan et al. 2019, this group
is necessary to account for SN IIb fractions and likely exist regardless of
metallicity. The detection of the unobserved populations indicated by our
models would support weak stellar winds and inefficient mass transfer in SN IIb
progenitors.

attachment of additional functionality to an object. Decorators have been
proposed as flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
Still, the Decorator pattern has certain limitations, especially related to the
fact that in its classical form it is constrained to a single interface, which
is implicitly defined by the type of the concrete components that we intend to
decorate. Another problem associated to the Decorator pattern is related to the
linear composition of the decorations, which could lead to problems in
accessing the newly added responsibilities. In this context, the paper presents
variants of the Decorator pattern: MixDecorator and D2Decorator, and a variant
specific only to C++ language based on templates - HybridDecorator.
MixDecorator could be considered a new enhanced version of the Decorator
pattern that eliminates some constraints of the Decorator pattern, but also it
could be used as a base of a general extension mechanism. The main advantage of
using MixDecorator is that it allows direct access to all newly added
responsibilities, and so, we may combine different interface-responsibilities
(newly added public methods) and operate with them directly and in any order,
hiding the linear composition of the decorations. D2Decorator is a variant
based on a double-dispatch mechanism. The C++ metaprogramming mechanism based
on templates allows an interesting hybrid variant of the Decorator -
HybridDecorator, which mixes on-demand defined inheritance with composition.
Using these variants of the Decorator pattern we are not longer limited to one
single interface; the set of the messages that could be sent to an object could
be enlarged, and so, we may consider that using them, we can dynamically change
the type of objects.

participate simultaneously for the production of speech. Acoustic coupling of
oral and nasal tracts results in a complex production system, which is
subjected to a continuous changes owing to glottal activity. Identification of
the duration of nasalization in vowels, and the extent of coupling of oral and
nasal tracts, is a challenging task. The present research focuses on the
changes in instantaneous vocal tract system response to study the effects of
co--articulatory load of nasals on vowels. The dominant resonance frequency
(DRF) contour derived from the spectra illustrates the contribution of oral and
nasal resonances during nasalization. The extent of coupling determines the
dominance of these resonances during glottal open and closed phases. A higher
extent leads to more decay of energy for the oral resonances, and hence the
vowel spectra exhibits a dominant nasal resonance. A comparison of the proposed
parameters is made with the previously suggested measures. Several examples of
segments of vowels in the context of nasal consonants for English language for
both male and female speakers of English are used to illustrate different
aspects of the proposed analysis method.

Sinkhorn distance between the two. Experiments show that this results in
effective learning of crowd features and delivers significant counting
performance. Furthermore, we establish the superiority of our method in less

seismic records as input data. Such records must be representative of the
in-situ seismicity in terms of a wide range of intensity measures (IMs)
including peak ground acceleration (PGA), Arias intensity (AI), cumulative
absolute velocity (CAV), source-to-site distance, duration, among others. No
single IM is a sufficient descriptor of a given seismic demand (e.g. crest
settlement) because different records, all of them compliant with any IM, can
produce a very wide range of results from insignificant damage to global
failure. The use of brute force, where hundreds of seismic records compliant
with a set of IMs are employed, has proven to be a reasonable workaround of
this limitation, at least able to produce a probabilistic density function of
demand indicators. This procedure, however, requires a large number of runs,
and is therefore expensive and time-consuming. Analyses can be optimized if an
a priori simple tool is used to predict which seismic records would yield a
given demand, thus obtaining estimations with much fewer runs. In order to
perform a more precise selection, a semi-analytical screening procedure is
presented in this paper. The procedure makes use of the spectral properties of
the seismic record, considering only the intensity of the frequency content
which is not filtered by the dam to obtain an a priori estimate of demand,
expressed in this case in terms of displacements. The tool is validated using
analytical and numerical models that prove insensitivity to the constitutive
model used in the analysis, and is applied to a large tailings dam subjected to
strong earthquakes.

performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have proven to be
very good classifiers and generally localize objects well; however, the loss
functions typically used to train classification CNNs do not penalize inability
to localize an object, nor do they take into account an object's relative size
in the given image. During training on ImageNet-1K almost all approaches use
random crops on the images and this transformation sometimes provides the CNN
with background only samples. This causes the classifiers to depend on context.
Context dependence is harmful for safety-critical applications. We present a
novel approach to classification that combines the ideas of objectness and
label smoothing during training. Unlike previous methods, we compute a
smoothing factor that is \emph{adaptive} based on relative object size within
an image. This causes our approach to produce confidences that are grounded in
the size of the object being classified instead of relying on context to make
the correct predictions. We present extensive results using ImageNet to
demonstrate that CNNs trained using adaptive label smoothing are much less
likely to be overconfident in their predictions. We show qualitative results
using class activation maps and quantitative results using classification and
transfer learning tasks. Our approach is able to produce an order of magnitude
reduction in confidence when predicting on context only images when compared to
baselines. Using transfer learning, we gain 2.1mAP on MS COCO compared to the
hard label approach.

is favored by the elimination of water drops rolling over the cathode surface
and the onset of natural convection. As a consequence, oxygen transport is
improved in the vertical cell, that can be operated full passive for hours
under ambient conditions, providing steady peak power densities above 100
mW/cm2. Gravity and natural convection are less effective in horizontal
position, leading to a 17% decrease in peak power density due to oxygen
transport losses. The horizontal position is especially adverse if the upper
electrode is the cathode, because of anode flooding causing cell failure after
production of a small amount of water (5 mg/cm2). The combined information from
thermal neutron radiography and cell response characteristics explains the
important influence of cell orientation on the performance of a fully passive
air-breathing PEMFC for portable applications.

(sub)millimeter observations have detected tens of those with rich gas content.
The origin of the gas component remains unclear; namely, it can be
protoplanetary remnants and/or secondary products deriving from large bodies.
In order to be protoplanetary in origin, the gas component of the parental
protoplanetary disk is required to survive for $\gtrsim10{\,\rm Myr}$. However,
previous models predict $\lesssim 10{\,\rm Myr}$ lifetimes because of efficient
photoevaporation at the late stage of disk evolution. In the present study, we
investigate photoevaporation of gas-rich, optically-thin disks around
intermediate-mass stars at a late stage of the disk evolution. The evolved
system is modeled as those where radiation force is sufficiently strong to
continuously blow out small grains ($\lesssim 4 {\,\rm \mu m}$), which are an
essential component for driving photoevaporation via photoelectric heating
induced by stellar far-ultraviolet (FUV). We find that the grain depletion
reduces photoelectric heating, so that FUV photoevaporation is not excited.
Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photoevaporation is dominant and yields a mass-loss
rate of $2$--$5\times10^{-10}(\Phi_{\rm EUV}/10^{41}{\,\rm
s}^{-1})^{1/2}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, where $\Phi_{\rm EUV}$ is the EUV
emission rate. The estimated lifetimes of the gas component are $\sim 50
(M_{\rm disk}/10^{-2}\,M_\odot)(\Phi_{\rm EUV}/10^{41}\,{\rm
s}^{-1})^{1/2}\,{\rm Myr}$ and depend on the ``initial'' disk mass at the point
small grains have been depleted in the system. With an order estimation, we
show that the gas component can survive for a much longer time around A-type
stars than lower-mass stars. This trend is consistent with the higher frequency
of gas-rich debris disks around A-type stars, implying the possibility of the
gas component being protoplanetary remnants.

Large-scale
motions of protein tertiary-structure elements, i.e. domains, are particularly
intriguing as they are essential for the catalytic activity of many enzymes and
for the functional cycles of protein machines and motors. Theoretical estimates
suggest that domain motions should be very fast, occurring on the nanosecond or
microsecond time scales. Indeed, free-energy barriers for domain motions are
likely to involve salt bridges, which can break in microseconds. Experimental
methods that can directly probe domain motions on fast time scales have
appeared only in recent years. This Perspective discusses briefly some of these
techniques, including NMR and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopies. We
introduce a few recent studies that demonstrate ultrafast domain motions, and
discuss their potential roles. Particularly surprising is the observation of
tertiary-structure element dynamics that are much faster than the functional
cycles in some protein machines. These swift motions can be rationalized on a
case-by-case basis. For example, fast domain closure in multi-substrate enzymes
may be utilized to optimize relative substrate orientation. Whether a large
mismatch in time scales of conformational dynamics vs. functional cycles is a
general design principle in proteins remains to be determined.

predict the magnetocaloric performance. Moreover, the piezomagnetic and

revealed that there is not a strong correlation between the induced

element in our study is the recent Bayesian analysis of correlated EFT
truncation errors based on order-by-order calculations up to

bounds on the maximum mass imposed by causality at high densities, and provide

a $1.4\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ star, $R_{1.4}$, by $\sim3.5\, \text{km}$. If

the squared speed of sound $c^2_{s}>1/2$ for densities above $2\,n_{\rm sat}$,

inferred from GW170817 lends support for the relatively small pressure
predicted by $\chi$EFT for the baryon density $n_{\rm B}$ in the range

any given roughness geometry to its fluid dynamic behaviour has been hampered
by the lack of accurate and direct measurements of skin-friction drag. Here the
Taylor-Couette (TC) system provides an opportunity as it is a closed system and
allows to directly and reliably measure the skin-friction. However, the
wall-curvature potentially complicates the connection between the wall friction
and the wall roughness characteristics. Here we investigate the effects of a
hydrodynamically fully rough surface on highly turbulent, inner cylinder
rotating, TC flow. We find that the effects of a hydrodynamically fully rough
surface on TC turbulence, where the roughness height k is three orders of
magnitude smaller than the Obukhov curvature length Lc (which characterizes the
effects of curvature on the turbulent flow, see Berghout et al. arXiv:
2003.03294, 2020), are similar to those effects of a fully rough surface on a
flat plate turbulent boundary layer (BL). Hence, the value of the equivalent
sand grain height ks, that characterizes the drag properties of a rough
surface, is similar to those found for comparable sandpaper surfaces in a flat
plate BL. Next, we obtain the dependence of the torque (skin-friction drag) on
the Reynolds number for given wall roughness, characterized by ks, and find
agreement with the experimental results within 5 percent. Our findings
demonstrate that global torque measurements in the TC facility are well suited
to reliably deduce wall drag properties for any rough surface.

Petrovich, Wu, & Ali-Dib (2019) that these planets have been placed on these
orbits as a natural result of the precessional effects of a dissipating massive
disk and extend it by using direct N-body simulations and models for the
evolution of the gas disks, including photoevaporation. Based on a parameter
space exploration, we find that in order to reproduce the system the initial
disk mass had to be at least 95 M_Jup and dissipate on a timescale of at least
10^4 yr. This mass is consistent with the upper end of the observed disk masses
distribution, and the dissipation timescale is consistent with photoevaporation
models. We study the properties of such disks using simplified 1D thin disk
models and show that they are gravitationally stable, indicating that the two
planets must have formed via core accretion and thus prone to disk migration.
We hence finally investigate the sensitivity of this mechanism to the outer
planet's semi major axis, and find that the nearby 7:1, 8:1, and 9:1
mean-motion resonances can completely quench this mechanism, while even higher
order resonances can also significantly affect the system. Assuming the two
planets avoid these high order resonances and/or close encounters, the dynamics
seems to be rather insensitive to planet c semi major axis, and thus orbital
migration driven by the disk.

bin picking or pick and place, only two or three degrees of freedom (DOF) are

further dexterity of robot arms for multiple tasks can be achieved. Instead of
increasing the number of joints of a robot to improve flexibility and
adaptation, which increases control complexity, weight, and cost of the overall
system, malleable robots utilise a variable stiffness link between joints
allowing the relative positioning of the revolute pairs at each end of the link
to vary, thus enabling a low DOF serial robot to adapt across tasks by varying
its workspace. In this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a 2-DOF
malleable robot, calculate the general equation of its workspace using a
parameterisation based on distance geometry---suitable for robot arms of
variable topology, and characterise the workspace categories that the end

propose a life cycle that resolves the conundrum of how life can persist aloft
for hundreds of millions to billions of years. Most discussions of an aerial
biosphere in the Venus atmosphere temperate layers never address whether the
life-small microbial-type particles-is free floating or confined to the liquid
environment inside cloud droplets. We argue that life must reside inside liquid
droplets such that it will be protected from a fatal net loss of liquid to the
atmosphere, an unavoidable problem for any free-floating microbial life forms.
However, the droplet habitat poses a lifetime limitation: Droplets inexorably
grow (over a few months) to large enough sizes that are forced by gravity to
settle downward to hotter, uninhabitable layers of the Venusian atmosphere.
(Droplet fragmentation-which would reduce particle size-does not occur in
Venusian atmosphere conditions.) We propose for the first time that the only
way life can survive indefinitely is with a life cycle that involves microbial
life drying out as liquid droplets evaporate during settling, with the small
desiccated 'spores' halting at, and partially populating, the Venus atmosphere
stagnant lower haze layer (33-48 km altitude). We, thus, call the Venusian
lower haze layer a 'depot' for desiccated microbial life. The spores eventually
return to the cloud layer by upward diffusion caused by mixing induced by
gravity waves, act as cloud condensation nuclei, and rehydrate for a continued
life cycle. We also review the challenges for life in the extremely harsh
conditions of the Venusian atmosphere, refuting the notion that the 'habitable'
cloud layer has an analogy in any terrestrial environment.

this paper, we report the fabrication of a rapid and sensitive optofluidic SERS
device using a unique Au nanorod array (AuNRA) with a plasmon resonance
frequency in the near IR region. The highly stable and reproducible AuNRA were
fabricated by a facile dynamic oblique angle deposition technique. A typical

seconds after the injection of an aqueous solution BPY. Time-course
measurements revealed an outstandingly quick response of SERS in this system.
Using the AuNR microfluidic device, approximately 2x10-12 mole molecules were
enough to produce detectable SERS signals. This work demonstrates rapid and

several hardware-level features to enhance security (e.g., Intel MPX, ARM
TrustZone, Intel SGX, Intel CET). Due to security, performance and/or usability
issues these features have attracted steady criticism. One such feature is the
Intel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX), an instruction set architecture
extension promising spatial memory safety at a lower performance cost due to
hardware-accelerated bounds checking. However, recent investigations into MPX
have found that is neither as performant, accurate, nor precise as cutting-edge
software-based spatial memory safety. As a direct consequence, compiler and
operating system support for MPX is dying, and Intel has begun to manufacture
desktop CPUs without MPX. Nonetheless, given how ubiquitous MPX is, it provides
an excellent yet under-utilized hardware resource that can be aptly salvaged
for security purposes. In this paper, we propose Simplex, a library framework
that re-purposes MPX registers as general purpose registers. Using Simplex, we
demonstrate how MPX registers can be used to store sensitive information (e.g.,
encryption keys) directly on the hardware. We evaluate Simplex for performance
and find that its overhead is small enough to permit its deployment in all but
the most performance-intensive code. We refactored the string.h buffer

also modified the deepsjeng and lbm SPEC CPU2017 benchmarks to use Simplex and

Return-on-Investment (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on ""How

Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical
studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla
Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT
against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency
classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random

analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is
predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For
the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest,
provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second,
Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher
ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the

A kinetic impactor remains to be the most feasible method to deflect the
asteroid. However, due to the constraint of the launch capability, an impactor
with the limited mass can only produce a very limited amount of velocity
increment for the asteroid. In order to improve the deflection efficiency of
the kinetic impactor strategy, this paper proposed a new concept called the
Assembled Kinetic Impactor (AKI), which is combining the spacecraft with the
launch vehicle final stage. By making full use of the mass of the launch
vehicle final stage, the mass of the impactor will be increased, which will
cause the improvement of the deflection efficiency. According to the technical
data of Long March 5 (CZ-5) launch vehicle, the missions of deflecting Bennu
are designed to demonstrate the power of the AKI concept. Simulation results
show that, compared with the Classic Kinetic Impactor (CKI, performs
spacecraft-rocket separation), the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle
final stage can increase the deflection distance to more than 3 times, and
reduce the launch lead-time by at least 15 years. With the requirement of the
same deflection distance, the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle final
stage can reduce the number of launches to 1/3 of that of the number of CKI
launches. The AKI concept makes it possible to defend Bennu-like large
asteroids by a no-nuclear technique within 10-year launch lead-time. At the

the performance of cluster computing by executing one of data mining techniques

delay by using linear regression algorithm with apache spark as a framework for
cluster computing. The result shows that, by involving 5 PCs in cluster

to model phosphorus species in the Venusian atmosphere. We thoroughly explore
the potential pathways of formation of phosphine in a Venusian environment,
including in the planet's atmosphere, cloud and haze layers, surface, and
subsurface. We investigate gas reactions, geochemical reactions,
photochemistry, and other non-equilibrium processes. None of these potential
phosphine production pathways are sufficient to explain the presence of ppb
phosphine levels on Venus. If PH3's presence in Venus' atmosphere is confirmed,
it therefore is highly likely to be the result of a process not previously
considered plausible for Venusian conditions. The process could be unknown
geochemistry, photochemistry, or even aerial microbial life, given that on
Earth phosphine is exclusively associated with anthropogenic and biological
sources. The detection of phosphine adds to the complexity of chemical
processes in the Venusian environment and motivates in situ follow up sampling
missions to Venus. Our analysis provides a template for investigation of
phosphine as a biosignature on other worlds.

the tight orbital separation suggest that IGR~J18214-1318 is a wind accreting
source with eccentricity lower than 0.17. The intensity profile folded at the
orbital period shows a deep minimum compatible with an eclipse of the source by
the companion star. In addition, we report on the broad-band 0.6--100 keV

self-consistent physical models. We find that the spectrum is well fitted
either by a pure thermal Comptonization component, or, assuming that the source
is a neutron star accreting above the critical regime, by a combined thermal
and bulk-motion Comptonization model. In both cases, the presence of a local
neutral absorption (possibly related to the thick wind of the companion star)
is required.

In many problems the estimation of the minimum outlet size which guarantees

that the time is modeled by an exponential distribution with two unknown
parameters, this goal translates to the optimal estimation of a non-linear
transformation of the parameters. We obtain $c$-optimum experimental designs

additionally provided. Finally, a simulation study checks the performance of
the approximations made, first with the Fisher Information matrix, then with
the linearization of the function to be estimated. The results are useful for
experimenting in a laboratory and translating then the results to a larger

Bayesian optimization to optimize DPLTS such that the output error (measured in
terms of given metric Err) is minimized while epsilon-differential privacy is
satisfied. In addition, OptaTrace introduces a utility module that contains
several built-in error metrics for utility benchmarking and for choosing Err,

behavior emerges and there is a discrete change of phase of the wave function
after passing through each singular point. The relations between these phase
corrections and local charts are discussed. Some examples of waves of infinite

  for impulse control games with applications","PhD Thesis, 2019",,,,"math.OC cs.NA econ.GN math.NA q-fin.EC q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The topics treated in this thesis are inherently two-fold. The first part
considers the problem of a market maker optimally setting bid/ask quotes over a
finite time horizon, to maximize her expected utility. The intensities of the
orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on
unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control
problem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering,
control and PDMPs theory. The value function is characterized as the unique
continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation and
numerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal full
information spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is
unknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty
in terms of PnL sensitivity and observable order flow volatility.
  The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic impulse
control games. These offer a realistic and far-reaching modelling framework,
but the difficulty in solving such problems has hindered their proliferation. A
policy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of
quasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring
results.
  Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and an
improved algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is
undertaken with natural assumptions on the players strategies, which admit
graph-theoretic interpretations in the context of weakly chained diagonally
dominant matrices. The algorithm is used to compute with high precision
equilibrium payoffs and Nash equilibria of otherwise too challenging problems,
and even some for which results go beyond the scope of the currently available
theory.

the motile cells and matrix producers were the predominant cell types in the
migrating cell population and non-migrating state, respectively, and could be
suitably controlled according to the environmental conditions and cell density

equations was used as the mathematical model to control the B. subtilis cell

general, the hysteretic control of the cell state enables stable switching
between the migrating and growth states of the B. subtilis cell population,
thereby facilitating the biofilm life cycle. The results of corresponding
culture experiments were examined, and the obtained corollaries were used to
develop a model to input environmental conditions, especially, the external pH.
On this basis, the environmental conditions were incorporated in a simulation
model for the cell type control. In combination with a mathematical model of
the cell population dynamics, a prediction model for colony growth involving

in the world to enforce a strict lockdown where all nonessential businesses are
closed and citizens are ordered to stay at home. One of the consequences of
this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since
load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are
trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused
by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the
pandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging,
and has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this
paper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters
and fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns.
Additionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate
the change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast
the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they
demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to
traditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the
specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.

matter, their emergence is due to a change of a topological state of the
system. Here we investigate topological states of matter in a system with
injection and dissipation of energy. In an experiment involving a liquid
crystal cell under the influence of a low-frequency oscillatory electric field,
we observe a transition from non-vortex state to a state in which vortices
persist. Depending on the period and the type of the forcing, the vortices
self-organise forming square lattices, glassy states, and disordered vortex
structures. Based on a stochastic amplitude equation, we recognise the origin
of the transition as the balance between stochastic creation and deterministic
annihilation of vortices. Our results show that the matter maintained out of

trained on. However, while in this case the generator reproduces the pixels and

perturbations result in significant image distortions. In this work, we propose
to explicitly model the data distribution in latent space. We show that, under
a simple nonlinear operation, the data distribution can be modeled as Gaussian
and therefore expressed using sufficient statistics. This yields a simple
Gaussian prior, which we use to regularize the projection of images into the
latent space. The resulting projections lie in smoother and better behaved
regions of the latent space, as shown using interpolation performance for both
real and generated images. Furthermore, the Gaussian model of the distribution
in latent space allows us to investigate the origins of artifacts in the

by taking advantage of its intrinsic sparsity. It simultaneously encrypts the
data with the sampling matrix being the cryptographic key. To share the key
over an insecure wireless channel, we implement an elliptic-curve cryptography
(ECC) based key exchanging protocol. The CS operation is executed in a
custom-designed IC fabricated in 180nm CMOS technology. Mixed-signal circuits
are designed to optimize the power efficiency of the matrix-vector

low-power Cortex-M0 microcontroller (MCU). To be protected from timing and
power analysis attacks, the implementation avoids possible data-dependent
branches and also employs a randomized ECC initialization. At a compression
ratio of 8x, the average correlated coefficient between the reconstructed

provably second-order accurate scheme in time, while maintaining
energy-stability. The new method requires fewer matrix assemblies in each
Newton iteration resulting in faster solution time. The method is based on a
fully-implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in time and a pressure stabilization for
an equal order Galerkin formulation. That is, we use a conforming continuous
Galerkin (cG) finite element method in space equipped with a residual-based
variational multiscale (RBVMS) procedure to stabilize the pressure. We deploy
this approach on a massively parallel numerical implementation using parallel
octree-based adaptive meshes. We present comprehensive numerical experiments
showing detailed comparisons with results from the literature for canonical
cases, including the single bubble rise, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and
lid-driven cavity flow problems. We analyze in detail the scaling of our

among individuals with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). International clinical
guidelines for the management of Type 2 DM (T2DM) are founded on primary and
secondary prevention and favor the evaluation of CVD related risk factors
towards appropriate treatment initiation. CVD risk prediction models can
provide valuable tools for optimizing the frequency of medical visits and
performing timely preventive and therapeutic interventions against CVD events.
The integration of explainability modalities in these models can enhance human
understanding on the reasoning process, maximize transparency and embellish
trust towards the models' adoption in clinical practice. The aim of the present
study is to develop and evaluate an explainable personalized risk prediction
model for the fatal or non-fatal CVD incidence in T2DM individuals. An
explainable approach based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and the
Tree SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method is deployed for the
calculation of the 5-year CVD risk and the generation of individual
explanations on the model's decisions. Data from the 5-year follow up of 560
patients with T2DM are used for development and evaluation purposes. The
obtained results (AUC = 71.13%) indicate the potential of the proposed approach
to handle the unbalanced nature of the used dataset, while providing clinically
meaningful insights about the ensemble model's decision process.

information from trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and derives concise
representations that are analyzed in an effective, unified way for prediction
purposes. It is well known that DNNs are capable of analyzing complex data;
however, they lack transparency in their decision making, in the sense that it
is not straightforward to justify their prediction, or to visualize the
features on which the decision was based. Moreover, they generally require
large amounts of data in order to learn and become able to adapt to different
environments. This makes their use difficult in healthcare, where trust and
personalization are key issues. Transparency combined with high prediction
accuracy are the targeted goals of the proposed approach. It includes both
supervised DNN training and unsupervised learning of latent variables extracted
from the trained DNNs. Domain Adaptation from multiple sources is also
presented as an extension, where the extracted latent variable representations
are used to generate predictions in other, non-annotated, environments.
Successful application is illustrated through a large experimental study in
various fields: prediction of Parkinson's disease from MRI and DaTScans;
prediction of COVID-19 and pneumonia from CT scans and X-rays; optical

passing through a double-slit, experiences a 'momentum kick' due to the act of
which-way detection. There have been conflicting points of view on this issue
over many decades. This issue is addressed here in the general setting where
the which-way detection may be imperfect. It is shown here that the loss of
interference may still be interpreted as arising out of tiny momentum kicks
which the quanton appears to receive, irrespective of the nature of the
which-way detector. Interestingly, the magnitude of the random momentum kicks
is always h/2d, d being the slit separation, irrespective of how perfect or
imperfect the which-way detection is. This is contrary to what has been
suggested in the earlier literature. The imperfection of which-way detection
decides how frequent are the momentum kicks. It has been shown earlier that for
perfect which-way detection, the quanton receives a momentum kick fifty percent
of the time. Here it is shown that for imperfect which-way detection, the
quanton receives momentum kicks of the same magnitude, but less often. A
precise relation between the frequency of kicks and the visibility of
interference is found here.

a deep learning approach. Unlike conventional restoration tasks that can be
solved through supervised learning, the degradation in real photos is complex
and the domain gap between synthetic images and real old photos makes the
network fail to generalize. Therefore, we propose a novel triplet domain
translation network by leveraging real photos along with massive synthetic
image pairs. Specifically, we train two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to
respectively transform old photos and clean photos into two latent spaces. And
the translation between these two latent spaces is learned with synthetic
paired data. This translation generalizes well to real photos because the
domain gap is closed in the compact latent space. Besides, to address multiple
degradations mixed in one old photo, we design a global branch with apartial
nonlocal block targeting to the structured defects, such as scratches and dust
spots, and a local branch targeting to the unstructured defects, such as noises
and blurriness. Two branches are fused in the latent space, leading to improved
capability to restore old photos from multiple defects. Furthermore, we apply
another face refinement network to recover fine details of faces in the old
photos, thus ultimately generating photos with enhanced perceptual quality.
With comprehensive experiments, the proposed pipeline demonstrates superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods as well as existing commercial tools
in terms of visual quality for old photos restoration.

measurements and be conscious of the need to expressvthem as a best estimate
and a range of uncertainty. Errors are routinely classified as statistical or
systematic. Although statistical errors are usually dealt with in the first
years of science studies, the typical approaches are based on manually
performing repetitive observations. Our work proposes a set of laboratory
experiments to teach error and uncertainties based on data recorded with the
sensors available in many mobile devices. The main aspects addressed are the
physical meaning of the mean value and standard deviation, and the
interpretation of histograms and distributions. The normality of the
fluctuations is analyzed qualitatively comparing histograms with normal curves
and quantitatively comparing the number of observations in intervals to the
number expected according to a normal distribution and also performing a
Chi-squared test. We show that the distribution usually follows a normal
distribution, however, when the sensor is placed on top of a loudspeaker
playing a pure tone significant differences with a normal distribution are
observed. As applications to every day situations we discuss the intensity of
the fluctuations in different situations, such as placing the device on a table
or holding it with the hands in different ways. Other activities are focused on
the smoothness of a road quantified in terms of the fluctuations registered by
the accelerometer. The present proposal contributes to gaining a deep insight
into modern technologies and statistical errors and, finally, motivating and
encouraging engineering and science students.

physiological data collected every 5-minute from a cohort of over 200,000
critically ill patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) over a 2-year
period. Each episode of fever from the same patient were considered as an
independent event, with separations of at least 24 hours. We extracted
descriptive statistical features from six physiological data streams, including
heart rate, respiration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial
pressure, and oxygen saturation, and use these features to independently
predict the onset of fever. Using a bootstrap aggregation method, we created a
balanced dataset of 7,801 afebrile and febrile patients and analyzed features
up to 4 hours before the fever onset. We found that supervised machine learning
methods can predict fever up to 4 hours before onset in critically ill patients
with high recall, precision, and F1-score. This study demonstrates the
viability of using machine learning to predict fever among hospitalized adults.

mixture) is learned from a sketch vector, that serves as a highly compressed
representation of the dataset. This requires solving a non-convex optimization
problem, hence in practice approximate heuristics (such as CLOMPR) are used. In
this work we explore, by numerical simulations, properties of this non-convex
optimization landscape and those heuristics.

conducted on a shape-fixed loss surface. Differently, we first propose a novel
concept of deformation mapping in this paper to affect the behaviour of the
optimizer. Vertical deformation mapping (VDM), as a type of deformation
mapping, can make the optimizer enter a flat region, which often implies better
generalization performance. Moreover, we design various VDMs, and further
provide their contributions to the loss surface. After defining the local M
region, theoretical analyses show that deforming the loss surface can enhance
the gradient descent optimizer's ability to filter out sharp minima. With
visualizations of loss landscapes, we evaluate the flatnesses of minima
obtained by both the original optimizer and optimizers enhanced by VDMs on
CIFAR-100. The experimental results show that VDMs do find flatter regions.
Moreover, we compare popular convolutional neural networks enhanced by VDMs
with the corresponding original ones on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The
results are surprising: there are significant improvements on all of the
involved models equipped with VDMs. For example, the top-1 test accuracy of
ResNet-20 on CIFAR-100 increases by 1.46%, with insignificant additional
computational overhead.

used herein, are a hybrid Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System
(ANFIS), a single Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a hybrid Multi-Layer
Perceptron-Grey Wolf Optimizer (MLP-GWO). These models were evaluated for their
predictive precision, using various Solar and Diffuse Fraction (DF) irradiance

this research study, our goal was to automate suicidal ideation detection from
acoustic and linguistic features of an individual's speech using machine
learning (ML) algorithms. Using voice data collected from Veterans enrolled in
a large interventional study on Gulf War Illness at the Washington DC VA
Medical Center, we conducted an evaluation of the performance of different ML
approaches in achieving our objective. By fitting both classical ML and deep
learning models to the dataset, we identified the algorithms that were most
effective for each feature set. Among classical machine learning algorithms,
the Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on acoustic features performed best in
classifying suicidal Veterans. Among deep learning methods, the Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) trained on the linguistic features performed best. Our
study shows that speech analysis in a machine learning pipeline is a promising
approach for detecting suicidality among Veterans.

on the parameters of the spinopelvic parameters from open data source. Results:
Degree of spondylolisthesis(DS), Pelvic radius (PR), Sacral slope (SS), Pelvic

significant predictive power for the risk of NSLBP. The overall accuracy of the
equation prediction model is 85.8%.The MLP network algorithm determines that DS

(SOL2011-09-06T22:21X2.1) followed by the appearance of circular flare ribbons
and coronal dimmings. The initial magnetic field from extrapolation displays a
three-dimensional (3D) null topology overlying a sheared arcade. Prior to the
flare, magnetic loops rise due to the initial Lorentz force, and reconnect at
the 3D null, leading to expansion and loss of confined plasma that produce the
observed pre-flare coronal dimmings. Further, the simulated dynamics documents
the transfer of twist from the arcade to the overlying loops through
reconnections, developing a flux rope. The non-parallel field lines comprising
the rope and lower-lying arcades form an X-type geometry. Importantly, the
simultaneous reconnections at the 3D null and the X-type geometry can explain
the observed circular and parallel flare ribbons. Reconnections at the 3D null
transform closed inner spine field lines into open field lines of the outer
spine. The footpoints of these open field lines correspond to a ring-shaped
coronal dimming region, tracing the dome. Further, the flux rope bifurcates
because of these reconnections which also results in the generation of open
magnetic field lines. The plasma loss along the open field lines can
potentially explain the observed coronal dimming.
