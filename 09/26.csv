nano dielectric inclusions as the interaction between resonant material
properties and geometric resonances of electrostatic nature. One example of
such plasmonic crystals are graphene nanosheets that are periodically arranged
within a non-magnetic bulk dielectric. We identify local geometric resonances
on the length scale of the small scale period. From a materials perspective,
the graphene surface exhibits a dispersive surface conductance captured by the
Drude model. Together these phenomena conspire to generate Lorentz resonances
at frequencies controlled by the surface geometry and the surface conductance.
The Lorentz resonances found in the frequency response of the effective
dielectric tensor of the bulk metamaterial is shown to be given by an explicit
formula, in which material properties and geometric resonances are decoupled.
This formula is rigorous and obtained directly from corrector fields describing
local electrostatic fields inside the heterogeneous structure. Our analytical
findings can serve as an efficient computational tool to describe the general
frequency dependence of periodic optical devices. As a concrete example, we
investigate two prototypical geometries composed of nanotubes and nanoribbons.

unburnt H$_2$ and the super-equilibrium concentrations of radicals left past
the fuel consumption layer gradually decay to thermodynamic equilibrium. This
recombination region, it's argued here, is a second order effect induced by the
premature quenching of the shuffle reactions, which inhibits the decay to
equilibrium in the first approximation.
  Its structure and kinetics are studied in detail to capture the small but
finite reaction rates accounting for its characteristic length scale, which is
large enough to render the diffusive transport negligible, hence deactivating
the upstream feedback link with the main flame structure. It is isothermal and
can be described, in moderately lean flames, by just the distribution of H$_2$
as the sole degree of freedom, a drastic reduction consequence of the strongly
constrained evolution imposed by the almost exactly quenched shuffle reactions.
  The rate of decay to equilibrium of H$_2$ and radicals is thus dictated by
the balance between the convective transport and chemical sinks controlled by
the HO$_2$ kinetics, which becomes dominant after the shuffle reactions quench.
Essentially, it is a two-step mechanism with the first, rate-limiting step
converting O$_2$ into HO$_2$, whereas the second one, comprising multiple fast,
parallel pathways, depletes radicals as HO$_2$ is converted into O$_2$ and
H$_2$O.
  Generalizations to very lean and nearly stoichiometric flames, when the one
degree of freedom model is not applicable, as well as the effect of heat losses
are also briefly discussed.

Perspective-fourLine algorithm (V-P4L) for practical indoor localization. The
basic idea of V-P4L is to joint VLC and computer vision to achieve high
accuracy regardless of LED height differences. In particular, we first exploit
the space-domain information to estimate the orientation and coordinate of a
single rectangular LED luminaire in the camera coordinate system based on the
plane and solid geometry. Then, based on the time-domain information
transmitted by VLC and the estimated luminaire information, V-P4L can estimate
the position and pose of the camera by the single-view geometry theory and the
linear least square (LLS) method. To further mitigate the effect of height
differences among LEDs on localization accuracy, we then propose a correction
algorithm of V-P4L based on the LLS method and a simple optimization method.
Due to the combination of time- and space-domain information, V-P4L only
requires a single luminaire for localization without limitation on the
correspondences between the features and their projections. Simulation results
show that for V-P4L the position error is always less than 15 cm and the
orientation error is always less than 3{\deg} using popular indoor luminaires.

phenomena. In this work we show that the application of this equation extends
further, beyond superconductivity. In the normal state, the linearized

resolvent corresponds to the so called Cooperons, and can be used to calculate
the weak localization corrections. Specifically, we show how to solve this

spintronics and superconductivity. Firstly, we study spin injection from
ferromagnetic electrodes in the normal state, and describe the spatial
evolution of spin density in the sample, and the complete crossover from the
diffusive to the ballistic limit. Secondly, we address the so-called

while superexchange interaction determines the magnetic behavior in the
insulating LSMO film under compressive strain originating from the top LAO
layer. Based on those findings, the formation of a magnetic dead layer near the
LAO/LSMO interface is attributed to competition between the superexchange
interaction via Mn 3$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals under compressive strain and the
double-exchange interaction via the 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.

attention for sensor applications with unprecedented sensitivity. Despite the
large interest, few investigations into the frequency stability of high-$Q$
resonators have been reported. Such resonators are characterized by a linewidth
significantly smaller than typically employed measurement bandwidths, which is
the opposite regime to what is normally considered for sensors. Here, the
frequency stability of high-$Q$ silicon nitride string resonators is
investigated both in open-loop and closed-loop configurations. The stability is
here characterized using the Allan deviation. For open-loop tracking, it is
found that the Allan deviation gets separated into two regimes, one limited by
the thermomechanical noise of the resonator and the other by the detection
noise of the optical transduction system. The point of transition between the
two regimes is the resonator response time, which can be shown to have a linear
dependence on $Q$. Laser power fluctuations from the optical readout is found
to present a fundamental limit to the frequency stability. Finally, for
closed-loop measurements, the response time is shown to no longer be
intrinsically limited but instead given by the bandwidth of the closed-loop
tracking system. Computed Allan deviations based on theory are given as well
and found to agree well with the measurements. These results are of importance
for the understanding of fundamental limitations of high-$Q$ resonators and
their application as high performance sensors.

interference may be approaching a practical performance ceiling. Greater gains
are possible outside traditional GNSS orbits and spectrum. GNSS from low Earth
orbit (LEO) has long been viewed as promising but expensive, requiring large
constellations for rapid navigation solutions. The recent emergence of
commercial broadband LEO mega-constellations invites study on dual-purposing
these for both communications -- their primary mission -- and a secondary
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service. Operating at shorter
wavelengths than traditional GNSS, these constellations would permit highly
directive, relatively compact receiver antennas. PNT-specific on-orbit
resources would not be required: the transmitters, antennas, clocks, and
spectrum of the hosting broadband network would suffice for PNT.
Non-cooperative use of LEO signals for PNT is an option, but cooperation with
the constellation operator (""fusion"" with its communications mission) eases the
burden of tracking a dense, low-altitude constellation from the ground and
enables a receiver to produce single-epoch stand-alone PNT solutions. This
paper proposes such a cooperative concept, termed fused LEO GNSS. Viability
hinges on opportunity cost, or the burden a secondary PNT mission imposes on
the communications constellation operator. This is assessed in terms of
time-space-bandwidth product and energy budget. It is shown that a
near-instantaneous-fix PNT service over $\pm60${\deg} latitude (covering 99.8%
of the world's population) with positioning performance superior to traditional
GNSS pseudoranging would cost less than 1.6% of downlink capacity for the
largest of the new constellations, SpaceX's Starlink. This allocation is
comparable to adding one user consuming 5.7 Mbps of broadband service to each

among agents trading stocks, which manifest in the form of vibrant correlation
patterns among stock prices. Over the past few decades, complex financial
markets have often been represented as networks whose interacting pairs of
nodes are stocks, connected by edges that signify the correlation strengths.
However, we often have interactions that occur in groups of three or more
nodes, and these cannot be described simply by pairwise interactions but we
also need to take the relations between these interactions into account. Only
recently, researchers have started devoting attention to the higher-order
architecture of complex financial systems, that can significantly enhance our
ability to estimate systemic risk as well as measure the robustness of
financial systems in terms of market efficiency. Geometry-inspired network
measures, such as the Ollivier-Ricci curvature and Forman-Ricci curvature, can
be used to capture the network fragility and continuously monitor financial
dynamics. Here, we explore the utility of such discrete Ricci curvatures in
characterizing the structure of financial systems, and further, evaluate them
as generic indicators of the market instability. For this purpose, we examine
the daily returns from a set of stocks comprising the USA S&P-500 and the
Japanese Nikkei-225 over a 32-year period, and monitor the changes in the
edge-centric network curvatures. We find that the different geometric measures
capture well the system-level features of the market and hence we can
distinguish between the normal or `business-as-usual' periods and all the major
market crashes. This can be very useful in strategic designing of financial
systems and regulating the markets in order to tackle financial instabilities.

H$\alpha$ emission originating in Centrifugal Magnetospheres (CMs),
circumstellar structures in which centrifugal support due to magnetically
enforced corotation of the magnetically confined plasma enables it to
accumulate to high densities. It is not currently known whether the CM plasma
escapes via Centrifugal Breakout (CB), or by an unidentified leakage mechanism.
We have conducted the first comprehensive examination of the H$\alpha$ emission
properties of all stars currently known to display CM-pattern emission. We find
that the onset of emission is dependent primarily on the area of the CM, which
can be predicted simply by the value $B_{\rm K}$ of the magnetic field at the
Kepler corotation radius $R_{\rm K}$. Emission strength is strongly sensitive
to both CM area and $B_{\rm K}$. Emission onset and strength are {\em not}
dependent on effective temperature, luminosity, or mass-loss rate. These
results all favour a CB scenario, however the lack of intrinsic variability in
any CM diagnostics indicates that CB must be an essentially continuous process,
i.e.\ it effectively acts as a leakage mechanism. We also show that the
emission profile shapes are approximately scale-invariant, i.e.\ they are
broadly similar across a wide range of emission strengths and stellar
parameters. While the radius of maximum emission correlates closely as expected
to $R_{\rm K}$, it is always larger, contradicting models that predict that
emission should peak at $R_{\rm K}$.

Moreover, it is shown that the mutual information between two subsets of order

necessary conditions for CP conservation in the leptonic sector with massive
Majorana neutrinos. In particular, the emphasis is placed on the number of
CP-violating phases in the presence of a partial mass degeneracy (e.g., $m^{}_1
= m^{}_2 \neq m^{}_3$) or a complete mass degeneracy $m^{}_1 = m^{}_2 =
m^{}_3$, where $m^{}_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) stand for the masses of three
ordinary neutrinos. In the canonical seesaw model with three right-handed
neutrino singlets, CP-violating phases in the special case of a partial (e.g.,
$M^{}_1 = M^{}_2 \neq M^{}_3$) or complete (i.e., $M^{}_1 = M^{}_2 = M^{}_3$)
mass degeneracy of three heavy Majorana neutrinos are also examined. In
addition, we derive the renormalization-group equations of the weak-basis
invariants in the effective theory with a general mass spectrum of Majorana
neutrinos, to which the solutions establish the direct connection between CP
violation at low- and high-energy scales.

photons should exhibit dispersion. In 2009 the observation of a short gamma ray
burst seemed to bound the minimal length scale to distances smaller than the
Planck length, implying that spacetime appeared continuous to distances below
the Planck length. This poses a challenge for such minimal distance models.
Here we propose a modification of the position and momentum operators, ${\hat
x}$ and ${\hat p}$, which lead to a minimal length scale, but preserve the
photon energy-momentum relationship $E = p c$. In this way there is no
dispersion of photons with different energies. This can be accomplished without
modifying the commutation relationship $[{\hat x}, {\hat p}] = i \hbar$.

model the position of the SP in the M-R diagram is largely independent of the
choice of the hadronic EoS, but in dependence on the stiffness of the quark

between the maximum mass and the SP mass depends on the mass at the onset of

obtained from which a lower limit on the radius of hybrid stars is deduced.
Together with a lower limit on the radius of hadronic stars, derived from a
class of reasonably soft hadronic EoS including hyperons, we identify a region
in the M-R diagram which can be occupied only by hybrid stars. Accordingly, we
suggest that a NICER radius measurement on the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 in

Interestingly, both the short-period planet ($P_\mathrm{b}\sim7.13$ d) and

detecting precession of the planetary orbit due to General Relativistic effects

lattice QCD (LQCD) with larger-than-physical quark masses corresponding to a
pion mass of $m_{\pi}\sim 450$ MeV and a kaon mass of $m_{K}\sim 596$ MeV. The
two-baryon systems that are analyzed range from strangeness $S=0$ to $S=-4$ and
include the spin-singlet and triplet $NN$, $\Sigma N$ ($I=3/2$), and $\Xi\Xi$

phase shifts, low-energy scattering parameters, and binding energies when
applicable, are extracted using L\""uscher's formalism. While the results are
consistent with most of the systems being bound at this pion mass, the
interactions in the spin-triplet $\Sigma N$ and $\Xi\Xi$ channels are found to
be repulsive and do not support bound states. Using results from previous
studies at a larger pion mass, an extrapolation of the binding energies to the
physical point is performed and is compared with experimental values and
phenomenological predictions. The low-energy coefficients in pionless EFT
relevant for two-baryon interactions, including those responsible for $SU(3)$
flavor-symmetry breaking, are constrained. The $SU(3)$ symmetry is observed to
hold approximately at the chosen values of the quark masses, as well as the
$SU(6)$ spin-flavor symmetry, predicted at large $N_c$. A remnant of an
accidental $SU(16)$ symmetry found previously at a larger pion mass is further
observed. The $SU(6)$-symmetric EFT constrained by these LQCD calculations is
used to make predictions for two-baryon systems for which the low-energy
scattering parameters could not be determined with LQCD directly in this study,
and to constrain the coefficients of all leading $SU(3)$ flavor-symmetric

`centrifugal magnetospheres' (CMs), from the magnetic trapping of stellar wind
material in a region above the Kepler co-rotation radius. A longstanding
question is whether the eventual loss of such trapped material occurs from
gradual drift and/or diffusive leakage, or through sporadic `{\em centrifugal
break out}' (CBO) events, wherein magnetic tension can no longer contain the
built-up mass. We argue here that recent empirical results for Balmer-$\alpha$
emission from such B-star CMs strongly favor the CBO mechanism. Most notably,
the fact that the onset of such emission depends mainly on the field strength
at the Kepler radius, and is largely {\em independent} of the stellar
luminosity, strongly disfavors any drift/diffusion process, for which the net
mass balance would depend on the luminosity-dependent wind feeding rate. In
contrast, we show that in a CBO model the {\em maximum confined mass} in the
magnetosphere is independent of this wind feeding rate, and has a dependence on
field strength and Kepler radius that naturally explains the empirical scalings
for the onset of H$\alpha$ emission, its associated equivalent width, and even
its line profile shapes. However, the general lack of observed Balmer emission
in late-B and A-type stars could still be attributed to a residual level of
diffusive or drift leakage that does not allow their much weaker winds to fill
their CMs to the breakout level needed for such emission; alternatively this
might result from a transition to a metal-ion wind that lacks the requisite
Hydrogen.

solving (Ldist + 1) decoupled Riccati equations where Ldist (Ldist \leq L) is
the number of distinct non-zero eigenvalues of the coupling matrix. A salient

involves designing a sequence of motions to bring the separate constituent
parts of a product into their final placement in the product. Assembly planning
is naturally cast as a disassembly problem, giving rise to the assembly
partitioning problem: Given a set $A$ of parts, find a subset $S\subset A$,
referred to as a subassembly, such that $S$ can be rigidly translated to
infinity along a prescribed direction without colliding with $A\setminus S$.
While assembly partitioning is efficiently solvable, it is further desirable
for the parts of a subassembly to be easily held together. This motivates the
problem that we study, called connected-assembly-partitioning, which
additionally requires each of the two subassemblies, $S$ and $A\setminus S$, to
be connected. We show that this problem is NP-complete, settling an open
question posed by Wilson et al. (1995) a quarter of a century ago, even when
$A$ consists of unit-grid squares (i.e., $A$ is polyomino-shaped). Towards this
result, we prove the NP-hardness of a new Planar 3-SAT variant having an
adjacency requirement for variables appearing in the same clause, which may be
of independent interest. On the positive side, we give an $O(2^k n^2)$-time
fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (requiring low degree polynomial-time
pre-processing) for an assembly $A$ consisting of polygons in the plane, where
$n=|A|$ and $k=|S|$. We also describe a special case of unit-grid square
assemblies, where a connected partition can always be found in $O(n)$-time.

absorption and Ha emission. The projected distances span a range from d=9 to
497 kpc, redshifts of the galaxies range from z=0.10 to 0.48, and rest-frame
absolute B-band magnitudes range from $M_{\rm B}=-16.7$ to $-22.8$. Our
analysis shows that the rest-frame equivalent width of MgII, $W_r$(2796),
depends on halo radius($R_h$), $B$-band luminosity($L_{\rm B}$) and stellar
mass ($M_{\rm star}$) of the host galaxies, and declines steeply with
increasing $d$ for isolated, star-forming galaxies. $W_r$(2796) exhibits no
clear trend for either isolated, quiescent galaxies or non-isolated galaxies.
The covering fraction of MgII absorbing gas $\langle \kappa \rangle$ is high
with $\langle \kappa \rangle\gtrsim 60$% at $<40$ kpc for isolated galaxies and
declines rapidly to $\langle \kappa \rangle\approx 0$ at $d\gtrsim100$ kpc.
Within the gaseous radius, $\langle \kappa \rangle$ depends sensitively on both
$M_{\rm star}$ and the specific star formation rate inferred from Ha. Different
from massive quiescent halos, the observed velocity dispersion of MgII gas
around star-forming galaxies is consistent with expectations from virial

the Milky Way disk stars, its origin has been a recurrent question. We aim to
answer this question by inspecting 19 disk galaxies with stellar mass greater
than $10^{10}\,\rm M_\odot$ in recent cosmological high-resolution zoom-in
simulations: Galactica and NewHorizon. The thin and thick disks are reasonably
reproduced by the simulations with scale heights and luminosity ratios as
observed. We then spatially classify the thin and thick disks and find that the
thick disk stars are older, metal-poorer, kinematically-hotter, and higher in
accreted star fraction, while both disks are dominated by the stars formed in
situ. Half of the in-situ stars in the thick disks are formed before the
galaxies develop their disks, and the rest are formed in spatially and
kinematically thinner disks and then thickened with time by heating. However,
the 19 galaxies have various properties and evolutionary routes, highlighting
the need for statistically-large samples to draw general conclusions. We
conclude from our simulations that the thin and thick disk components are not
entirely distinct in terms of formation processes, but rather markers of the
evolution of galactic disks. Moreover, as the combined result of the thickening
of the existing disk stars and the continued formation of young thin-disk
stars, the vertical distribution of stars does not change much after the disks
settle, pointing to the modulation of both orbital diffusion and star formation
by the same confounding factor: the proximity of galaxies to marginal
stability.

using a ray-tracing scheme - and a diffuse component - solved with a
three-dimensional flux-limited diffusion (FLD) solver. The FLD solver for the

found in [PRL 122, 246401]. We then prove that the interacting TBG Hamiltonian
exhibits an exact U(4) symmetry in the exactly flat band (nonchiral-flat)
limit. We further define, besides a first chiral limit where the AA stacking
hopping is zero, a new second chiral limit where the AB/BA stacking hopping is
zero. In the first chiral-flat limit (or second chiral-flat limit) with exactly
flat bands, the TBG is enhanced to have an exact U(4)$\times$U(4) symmetry,
whose generators are different between the two chiral limits. While in the
first chiral limit and in the non-chiral case these symmetries have been found
in [PRX 10, 031034] for the $8$ lowest bands, we here prove that they are valid
for projection into any $8 n_\text{max}$ particle-hole symmetric TBG bands,
with $n_\text{max}>1$ being the practical case for small twist angles
$<1^\circ$. Furthermore, in the first or second chiral-nonflat limit without
flat bands, an exact U(4) symmetry still remains. We also elucidate the link
between the U(4) symmetry presented here and the similar but different U(4) of
[PRL 122, 246401]. Furthermore, we show that our projected Hamiltonian can be
viewed as the normal-ordered Coulomb interaction plus a Hartree-Fock term from
passive bands, and exhibits a many-body particle-hole symmetry which renders
the physics symmetric around charge neutrality. We also provide an efficient
parameterization of the interacting Hamiltonian. The existence of two chiral

gravitational microlensing via their light-bending gravity. Microlensing events
due to terrestrial-mass rogue planets are expected to have extremely small

possibility favored by the Gaia proper motion measurement of the source. The
planet may be orbiting a star but we rule out the presence of stellar

tests, we compare these observations with three random-field datasets, and we
also compare the known runaways to non-runaways. We find that the local
environments of non-runaways show higher aggregate central densities than for
runaways, implying the presence of some ""tips-of-iceberg"" (TIB) clusters. We
find that the frequency of these tiny clusters is low, $\sim 4-5\%$ of our
sample. This fraction is much lower than some previous estimates, but is
consistent with field OB stars being almost entirely runaway and walkaway
stars. The lack of TIB clusters implies that such objects either evaporate on
short timescales, or do not form, implying a higher cluster lower-mass limit
and consistent with a relationship between maximum stellar mass ($m_{\rm max}$)

interstellar medium, it has not yet been established whether its main formation
route is from gas-phase ion-molecule reactions or grain-surface hydrogen
additions on adsorbed nitrogen atoms. Deuterium fractionation can be used as a
tool to constrain formation mechanisms. High abundances of deuterated molecules
are routinely observed in the dense interstellar medium, with the ratio between
deuterated molecules and the main isotopologue enhanced by several orders of
magnitude with respect to the elemental D/H ratio. In the case of ammonia, the
detection of its triply deuterated isotopologue hints at high abundances of the
deuterated intermediate nitrogen radicals, ND, NHD and ND$_2$. So far however,
only ND has been detected in the interstellar medium. In this paper, to
constrain the formation of ammonia, we aim at determining the NHD/NH$_2$ and
ND$_2$/NHD abundance ratios, and compare them with the predictions of both pure
gas-phase and grain-surface chemical models. We searched for the fundamental
rotational transitions of NHD and ND$_2$ towards the class 0 protostar
IRAS16293-2422, towards which NH, NH$_2$ and ND had been previously detected.
Both NHD and ND$_2$ are detected in absorption towards the source. The relative
abundance ratios NH$_2$ : NHD : ND$_2$ are close to 8 : 4 : 1. These ratios can
be reproduced by our gas-phase chemical model within a factor of two-three.
Statistical ratios as expected from grain-surface chemistry are also consistent
with our data. Further investigations of the ortho-to-para ratio in ND$_2$ ,
both theoretical and observational, could bring new constraints to better
understand nitrogen hydride chemistry.

under-estimate it; they over-estimate the pressure; and the UV diagnostic of
ionization parameter has a strong metallicity dependence in this regime. Based
on these results, we suggest that upcoming James Webb Space Telescope

additional integration time to capture the optical [O II] and [O III] emission

constraints. We prove a convergence result for a discrete time approximation of
the value function based on a novel formulation of the constrained problem.
Then the Dynamic Programming approach is developed by a discretization in time
leading to a tree structure in space derived by the controlled dynamics, in
this construction the state constraints are taken into account to cut several
branches of the tree. Moreover, an additional pruning allows for the reduction
of the tree complexity as for the case without state constraints. Since the
method does not use an a priori space grid, no interpolation is needed for the
reconstruction of the value function and the accuracy essentially relies on the
time step $h$. These features permit a reduction in CPU time and in memory
allocations. The synthesis of optimal feedback controls is based on the values
on the tree and an interpolation on the values obtained on the tree will be
necessary if a different discretization in the control space is adopted, e.g.
to improve the accuracy of the method in the reconstruction of the optimal
trajectories. Several examples show how this algorithm can be applied to
problems in low dimension and compare it to a classical DP method on a grid.

(ALMA CO(2-1)) and ionized gas (MUSE IFU). We study different regions along the
outflow zone which extends out to ~2.3 kpc in the same direction (east-west) as
the radio jet, as well as nuclear/circumnuclear regions in the host galaxy
disk. The deprojected outflowing velocities of the cold molecular gas (median
Vcentral~189 km s^-1) are generally lower than those of the outflowing ionized
gas, which reach deprojected velocities of up to 750 km s^-1 close to the AGN,
and their spatial profiles follow those of the ionized phase. This suggests
that the outflowing molecular gas in the galaxy disk is being entrained by the
AGN wind. We derive molecular and ionized outflow masses of ~5.2x10^7 Msun and
8.5x10^4 Msun and molecular and ionized outflow mass rates of ~51 Msun yr^-1
and 0.14 Msun yr^-1. Therefore, the molecular phase dominates the outflow mass
and outflow mass rate, while the outflow kinetic power and momentum are similar
in both phases. However, the wind momentum load for the molecular and ionized
outflow phases are ~27-5 and <1, which suggests that the molecular phase is not
momentum conserving while the ionized one most certainly is. The molecular gas
content (~1.5x10^7 Msun) of the eastern spiral arm is approximately 50-70% of
the content of the western one. We interpret this as destruction/clearing of
the molecular gas produced by the AGN wind impacting in the host galaxy. The
increase of the molecular phase momentum implies that part of the kinetic
energy from the AGN wind is transmitted to the molecular outflow. This suggest
that in Sy-like AGN such as NGC 5643, the radiative/quasar and the
kinetic/radio AGN feedback modes coexist and may shape the host galaxies even
at kpc-scales via both positive and (mild) negative feedback.

variation and morphology of extrusion in Cu TSVs and the underlying mechanisms.
Extrusion statistics were obtained from TSV samples with two different pitch
distances. A notable increase in the magnitude of extrusion was observed in
vias with smaller pitch, yet the extrusion spread was largely unaffected. The
morphologies of the extruded vias were characterized and categorized, and
finite element analysis was carried out to study the effect of pitch distance
on stress and deformation. The results suggested that the overlapping of stress
fields from neighboring vias resulted in larger stress in the small-pitch vias,
which subsequently led to higher extrusion. The morphologies observed in the
extruded vias were related to the operation of different deformation mechanisms
under the combined effect of stress and microstructure. The statistical spread
of via extrusion, which was similar in both groups of vias, was related to the
stochastic nature of the via microstructure. By using a thin cap layer of Ta to
suppress the vacancy sources at the via top surface, the adverse effect of the
pitch distance was minimized and a pronounced reduction of extrusion was
achieved in vias of both pitch distances.

environment presents chemical and physical barriers to mobility. We explored
this mobility using a synthetic experimental system of small dye molecules
diffusing within a polymer network at short time scales. We find that the
diffusion of inert molecules is inhibited by the presence of the polymers.
Counter-intuitively, small, hydrophobic molecules display smaller reduction in
mobility and also able to diffuse faster through the system by leveraging
crowding specific parameters. We explained this phenomenon by developing a de
novo model and using these results, we hypothesized that non-specific
hydrophobic interactions between the molecules and polymer chains could
localize the molecules into compartments of overlapped and entangled chains
where they experience microviscosity, rather than macroviscosity. We introduced
a characteristic interaction time parameter to quantitatively explain
experimental results in the light of frictional effects and molecular
interactions. Our model is in good agreement with the experimental results and
allowed us to classify molecules into two different mobility categories solely
based on interaction. By changing the surface group, polymer molecular weight,
and by adding salt to the medium, we could further modulate the mobility and
mean square displacements of interacting molecules. Our work has implications
in understanding intracellular diffusive transport in microtubule networks and
other systems with macromolecular crowding and could lead to transport
enhancement in synthetic polymer systems.

Aim. We aim to quantify the impact of factors used by 3DS 2.0 in its

transactions with two Web sites systematically manipulating the nominal IVs
\textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{value}, \textsf{region}, and \textsf{website}.
We measured whether the user was \textsf{challenged} with an authentication,
whether the transaction was \textsf{declined}, and whether the card was
\textsf{blocked} as nominal DVs. Results. While \textsf{website} and
\textsf{card} largely did not show a significant impact on any outcome,
\textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{value} and \textsf{region} did. A change in
\textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{region} or \textsf{value} made it 5-7 times as
likely to be challenged with password authentication. However, even in a
foreign region with another factor being changed, the overall likelihood of
being challenged only reached $60\%$. When in the card's home region, a
transaction will be rarely declined ($< 5\%$ in control, $40\%$ with one factor
changed). However, in a region foreign to the card the system will more likely
decline transactions anyway (about $60\%$) and any change in
\textsf{machine\_data} or \textsf{value} will lead to a near-certain declined
transaction. The \textsf{region} was the only significant predictor for a card
being blocked ($\mathsf{OR}=3$). Conclusions. We found that the decisions to
challenge the user with a password authentication, to decline a transaction and
to block a card are governed by different weightings. 3DS 2.0 is most likely to
decline transactions, especially in a foreign region. It is less likely to
challenge users with password authentication, even if \textsf{machine\_data} or
\textsf{value} are changed.

functional and plausible relationships to other objects are maintained in the

is adaptive to the context of the scene is considered a challenging task.
Motivated by this problem, in this paper we introduce SceneGen, a generative
contextual augmentation framework that predicts virtual object positions and

placing virtual content. We formulate a novel spatial Scene Graph

drug delivery, and materials science as a whole. Due to the network
architecture of these materials, imbibement with water often results in uniform
swelling and isotropic expansion which scales with the degree of cross-linking.
However, the development of internal stresses during swelling can have dramatic
consequences, leading to surface instabilities as well as rupture or bursting
events. To better understand hydrogel behavior, macroscopic mechanical
characterization techniques (e.g.\ tensile testing, rheometry) are often used,
however most commonly these techniques are employed on samples that are in two
distinct states: (1) unswollen and without any solvent, or (2) in an
equilibrium swelling state where the maximum amount of water has been imbibed.
Rarely is the dynamic process of swelling studied, especially in samples where
rupture or failure events are observed. To address this gap, here we focus on
rupture events in poly(ethylene glycol)-based networks that occur in response
to swelling with water. Rupture events were visualized using high-speed
imaging, and the influence of swelling on material properties was characterized
using dynamic mechanical analysis. We find that rupture events follow a
three-stage process that includes a waiting period, a slow fracture period, and
a final stage in which a rapid increase in the velocity of crack propagation is
observed. We describe this fracture behavior based on changes in material
properties that occur during swelling, and highlight how this rupture behavior
can be controlled by straight-forward modifications to the hydrogel network
structure.

specifically, we conduct a comparison of three different forms of semantics in
MOGP. One semantic-based method, (i) Semantic Similarity-based Crossover (SSC),
is borrowed from single-objective GP, where the method has consistently being
reported beneficial in evolutionary search. We also study two other methods,
dubbed (ii) Semantic-based Distance as an additional criteriOn (SDO) and (iii)
Pivot Similarity SDO. We empirically and consistently show how by naturally
handling semantic distance as an additional criterion to be optimised in MOGP
leads to better performance when compared to canonical methods and SSC. Both
semantic distance based approaches made use of a pivot, which is a reference
point from the sparsest region of the search space and it was found that
individuals which were both semantically similar and dissimilar to this pivot
were beneficial in promoting diversity. Moreover, we also show how the
semantics successfully promoted in single-objective optimisation does not
necessary lead to a better performance when adopted in MOGP.

tested in a phantom and in vivo at 7 T with measured $B_1^+$ and $B_0$ maps

that the resulting trajectories converge to those generated by a traditional,

understanding for AR applications, 3D modeling, and robotics, providing the
geometry of a scene based on a single image. Recent works have shown that a
successful solution strongly relies on the diversity and volume of training
data. This data can be sourced from stereo movies and photos. However, they do
not provide geometrically complete depth maps (as disparities contain unknown
shift value). Therefore, existing models trained on this data are not able to
recover correct 3D representations. Our work shows that a model trained on this
data along with conventional datasets can gain accuracy while predicting
correct scene geometry. Surprisingly, only a small portion of geometrically
correct depth maps are required to train a model that performs equally to a
model trained on the full geometrically correct dataset. After that, we train
computationally efficient models on a mixture of datasets using the proposed

qualitative comparison of 3D point clouds, we show that our model defines the

Several theoretical treatments of this environment exist, including the small

different versions of the small slope approximation. All of these models give
different results for the scattering cross section and coherent reflection

the Na abundances of first generation stars, in the sense that the more Na-poor
the first generation stars, the larger the Na enrichment. By using the
inclinations of the globular clusters' orbits, the analyzed Na enrichments also
hinted at a boundary at ~0.3 dex to differentiate globular clusters with an
accreted or in situ origin, the accreted globular clusters having larger Na
enrichments. Because relatively larger intra-cluster Na enhancements are seen
in accreted globular clusters, and small Na enhancements are observed in
globular clusters formed in situ (although not exclusively), we speculate with
the possibility that the amplitude of the Na enrichment could be linked with
the building block paradigm. Globular clusters at the time of formation of
first and second generation stars would seem to keep memory of this

scenarios can range from a simple syntactic variation to more complex semantic

systems still work as a ""black box"", providing a yes/no answer that does not

Explainable Text Entailment - a novel composite approach for recognizing text
entailment which analyzes the entailment pair to decide whether it must be
resolved syntactically or semantically. Also, if a semantic matching is
involved, we make the answer interpretable, using external knowledge bases
composed of structured lexical definitions to generate natural language
justifications that explain the semantic relationship holding between the
pieces of text. Besides outperforming well-established entailment algorithms,
our composite approach gives an important step towards Explainable AI, allowing

due to its various applications such as video summarization, action

impressive results in action recognition. However, these methods need to
process a full video sequence to recognize the action, even though most of
these frames are similar and non-essential to recognizing a particular action.
Additionally, these non-essential frames increase the computational cost and
can confuse a method in action recognition. Instead, the important frames
called keyframes not only are helpful in the recognition of an action but also
can reduce the processing time of each video sequence for classification or in
other applications, e.g. summarization. As well, current methods in video
processing have not yet been demonstrated in an online fashion.
  Motivated by the above, we propose an online learnable module for keyframe
extraction. This module can be used to select key-shots in video and thus can
be applied to video summarization. The extracted keyframes can be used as input
to any deep learning-based classification model to recognize action. We also
propose a plugin module to use the semantic word vector as input along with
keyframes and a novel train/test strategy for the classification models. To our

of the electron between two adjacent potential wells with fidelity over 99.5%.
This effect can be used for the high fidelity all-electrical electron-spin

other spin initialization methods, our technique can be performed adiabatically

such $T$-periodic traveling waves are easily seen to be nonlinearly
asymptotically stable (with asymptotic phase) with exponential rates of decay
when subject to $NT$-periodic, i.e., subharmonic, perturbations. However, both
the allowable size of perturbations and the exponential rates of decay depend
on $N$, and, in particular, they tend to zero as $N\to\infty$, leading to a
lack of uniformity in such subharmonic stability results. In this work, we
build on recent work by the authors and introduce a methodology that allows us
to achieve a stability result for subharmonic perturbations which is uniform in
$N$. Our work is motivated by the dynamics of such waves when subject to
perturbations which are localized (i.e. integrable on the line), which has
recently received considerable attention by many authors.

the second one runs in $n^{O(k)}$ time. Our proof relies on new structural

this paper considers a new frequency-domain model of the human joint dynamics

$\Theta(N/\sqrt{\log(N)})$ distinct distances, the lower bound for a set of $N$
points (Erd\H{o}s, 1946). The only previous non-asymptotic work related to the
Erd\H{o}s distance problem that has been done was for $N \leq 13$. We take a
new non-asymptotic approach to this problem in a model case, studying the
distance distribution, or in other words, the plot of frequencies of each
distance of the $N\times N$ integer lattice. In order to fully characterize
this distribution, we adapt previous number-theoretic results from Fermat and
Erd\H{o}s in order to relate the frequency of a given distance on the lattice
to the sum-of-squares formula.
  We study the distance distributions of all the lattice's possible subsets;
although this is a restricted case, the structure of the integer lattice allows
for the existence of subsets which can be chosen so that their distance
distributions have certain properties, such as emulating the distribution of
randomly distributed sets of points for certain small subsets, or emulating
that of the larger lattice itself. We define an error which compares the
distance distribution of a subset with that of the full lattice. The structure
of the integer lattice allows us to take subsets with certain geometric
properties in order to maximize error; we show these geometric constructions

super-resolution (SISR) since the amazing improvement of high performance

recovering bicubic degradation. Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from
randomly blurred and noisy low-resolution (LR) images is still a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Context Hallucination
Network (SCHN) for blind super-resolution without knowing the degradation
kernel. We find that when the blur kernel is unknown, separate deblurring and
super-resolution could limit the performance because of the accumulation of
error. Thus, we integrate denoising, deblurring and super-resolution within one
framework to avoid such a problem. We train our model on two high quality
datasets, DIV2K and Flickr2K. Our method performs better than state-of-the-art
methods when input images are corrupted with random blur and noise.

estimate myocardial strain across the left ventricle, we register the sets of
short-axis, four-chamber and two-chamber views via a 2D non-rigid registration
algorithm implemented in a commercial software (Segment, Medviso). We then
create a series of interpolating functions for the three orthogonal directions
of motion and use them to deform a tetrahedral mesh representation of a
patient-specific left ventricle. Additionally, we correct for overestimation of
displacement by introducing a weighting scheme that is based on displacement
along the long axis. The procedure was evaluated on the STACOM 2011 dataset

longitudinal) compared to reported results in the challenge, for the imaging

galaxy - dark matter halo relations that are needed for a halo-based empirical
model of star formation in galaxies. Using a linear dimension reduction
algorithm and a model ensemble method, we find that for both star-forming and
quenched galaxies, the star formation history (SFH) is tightly related to the
halo mass assembly history (MAH). The quenching of a low-mass galaxy is mainly
due to the infall-ejection process related to a nearby massive halo, while the
quenching of a high-mass galaxy is closely related to the formation of a
massive progenitor in its host halo. The classification of star-forming and
quenched populations based solely on halo properties contains contamination
produced by sample imbalance and overlapping distributions of the two
populations. Guided by the results from hydrodynamic simulations, we build an
empirical model to predict the SFH of central galaxies based on the MAH of
their host halos, and we model the star-forming and quenched populations
separately. Our model is based on the idea of adopting star formation templates
from hydrodynamic simulations to reduce model complexity. We use various tests
to demonstrate that the model can recover star formation histories of
individual galaxies, and can statistically reproduce the galaxy bimodal
distribution, stellar mass - halo mass and star formation rate - halo mass
relations from low to high redshift, and assembly bias. Our study provides a
framework of using hydrodynamic simulations to discover, and to motivate the

modeling of complex nonlinear relational and spatial dependencies. In addition,
dynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand
values, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing
system, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the
contextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves
over time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context
Integrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal,
relational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead
demand forecasting. Our approach considers the demand network over various
geographical locations and represents the network as a graph. We define a
demand graph, where nodes represent demand time-series, and context graphs (one
for each type of context), where nodes represent contextual time-series.
Assuming that various contexts evolve and have a dynamic impact on the
fluctuation of demand, our proposed CIGNN model employs a fusion mechanism that
jointly learns from all available types of contextual information. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first approach that integrates dynamic contexts
with graph neural networks for spatio-temporal demand forecasting, thereby
increasing prediction accuracy. We present empirical results on two real-world
datasets, demonstrating that CIGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, in both periodic and irregular time-series networks.

large number of roadside sensors with an extremely long communication range.
However, the high operation cost to manage such a large-scale roadside sensor
network remains as a significant challenge. In this article, we propose Low
Operation-Cost LPWAN (LOC-LPWAN), a novel optimization framework that is
designed to reduce the operation cost using the cross-technology communication
(CTC). LOC-LPWAN allows roadside sensors to offload sensor data to passing
vehicles that in turn forward the data to a LPWAN server using CTC aiming to
reduce the data subscription cost. LOC-LPWAN finds the optimal communication
schedule between sensors and vehicles to maximize the throughput given an
available budget. Furthermore, LOC-LPWAN optimizes the fairness among sensors
by preventing certain sensors from dominating the channel for data
transmission. LOC-LPWAN can also be configured to ensure that data packets are
received within a specific time bound. Extensive numerical analysis performed
with real-world taxi data consisting of 40 vehicles with 24-hour trajectories
demonstrate that LOC-LPWAN reduces the cost by 50% compared with the baseline
approach where no vehicle is used to relay packets. The results also show that
LOC-LPWAN improves the throughput by 72.6%, enhances the fairness by 65.7%, and
reduces the delay by 28.8% compared with a greedy algorithm given the same

about quantum advantage are really going to be transformative. We go over
subtle complications of quantum chemical research that tend to be overlooked in
discussions involving quantum computers. We estimate quantum computer resources

chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly
compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum

estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic

coefficient fixed depth linear recurrences with positive (or in some cases

with non-constant coefficients, $a_{n+1} = n a_{n} + a_{n-1}$. The
decomposition law becomes every $m$ has a unique decomposition as $\sum s_i
a_i$ with $s_i \le i$, where if $s_i = i$ then $s_{i-1} = 0$. Similar to
Zeckendorf's original proof, we use the greedy algorithm. We show that almost
all the gaps between summands, as $n$ approaches infinity, are of length zero,
and give a heuristic that the distribution of the number of summands tends to a
Gaussian. Furthermore, we build a game based upon this recurrence relation,
generalizing a game on the Fibonacci numbers. Given a fixed integer $n$ and an
initial decomposition of $n= na_1$, the players alternate by using moves
related to the recurrence relation, and whoever moves last wins. We show that
the game is finite and ends at the unique decomposition of $n$, and that either
player can win in a two-player game. We find the strategy to attain the
shortest game possible, and the length of this shortest game. Then we show that
in this generalized game when there are more than three players, no player has
the winning strategy. Lastly, we demonstrate how one player in the two-player

sublinear in the number of nodes, i.e., $O(n^\eps)$ for $0 < \eps < 1$.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm for the 2-ruling set problem, running
in $\tilde{O}(\log^{1/6} \Delta)$ rounds whp, in the low-memory MPC model. We
then extend this result to $\beta$-ruling sets for any integer $\beta > 1$.
Specifically, we show that a $\beta$-ruling set can be computed in the
low-memory MPC model with $O(n^\eps)$ memory-per-machine in $\tilde{O}(\beta
\cdot \log^{1/(2^{\beta+1}-2)} \Delta)$ rounds, whp. From this it immediately
follows that a $\beta$-ruling set for $\beta = \Omega(\log\log\log
\Delta)$-ruling set can be computed in in just $O(\beta \log\log n)$ rounds
whp. The above results assume a total memory of $\tilde{O}(m + n^{1+\eps})$. We
also present algorithms for $\beta$-ruling sets in the low-memory MPC model
assuming that the total memory over all machines is restricted to
$\tilde{O}(m)$.

worldwide as of August 2020. The need for rapid testing is a high priority and
alternative testing strategies including X-ray image classification are a
promising area of research. However, at present, public datasets for COVID19
x-ray images have low data volumes, making it challenging to develop accurate
image classifiers. Several recent papers have made use of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to increase the training data volumes. But
realistic synthetic COVID19 X-rays remain challenging to generate. We present a
novel Mean Teacher + Transfer GAN (MTT-GAN) that generates COVID19 chest X-ray
images of high quality. In order to create a more accurate GAN, we employ
transfer learning from the Kaggle Pneumonia X-Ray dataset, a highly relevant
data source orders of magnitude larger than public COVID19 datasets.
Furthermore, we employ the Mean Teacher algorithm as a constraint to improve
stability of training. Our qualitative analysis shows that the MTT-GAN
generates X-ray images that are greatly superior to a baseline GAN and visually
comparable to real X-rays. Although board-certified radiologists can
distinguish MTT-GAN fakes from real COVID19 X-rays. Quantitative analysis shows
that MTT-GAN greatly improves the accuracy of both a binary COVID19 classifier
as well as a multi-class Pneumonia classifier as compared to a baseline GAN.
Our classification accuracy is favourable as compared to recently reported
results in the literature for similar binary and multi-class COVID19 screening
tasks.

significant variations of the polar field, which are important for the
modulation of solar cycles. We aim to study a prominent poleward surge during
solar cycle 24 on the southern hemisphere, and analyse its originating ACs and
the effect on the polar field evolution. We automatically identify and
characterize ARs based on synoptic magnetograms from the Solar Dynamic
Observatory. We assimilate these ARs with realistic magnetic configuration into
a surface flux transport model, and simulate the creation and migration of the
surge. Our simulations well reproduce the characteristics of the surge and show
that the prominent surge is mainly caused by the ARs belonging to two ACs
during Carrington Rotations 2145-2159 (December 2013-January 2015). The surge
has a strong influence on the polar field evolution of the southern hemisphere
during the latter half of cycle 24. Without the about one-year-long flux
emergence in the form of ACs, the polar field around the cycle minimum would
have remained at a low level and even reversed to the polarity at cycle 23
minimum. Our study also shows that the long-lived unipolar regions due to the
decay of the earlier emerging ARs cause an intrinsic difficulty of
automatically identifying and precisely quantifying later emerging ARs in ACs.

This so called Cold Classical Kuiper Belt is considered to have been formed in
situ from primordial ice pebbles that coagulated into planetesimals hundreds of
kilometers in diameter. According to this scenario, the accretion of pebbles
into large planetesimals would have occurred through the streaming instability
mechanism that would be effective in the primordial Solar System disk of gas
and solids. Nevertheless other objects with the same color characteristics as
those found in the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt can be encountered also past the
2:1 mean motion resonance with Neptune as scattered or detached objects. Here I
propose a mechanism that can account for both the cold Classical Kuiper Belt
objects and other reddish objects outside the Classical Kuiper Belt. According
to the proposed scenario, reddish objects were primordially in the outer
portion of the planetesimal disk which was however truncated somewhere below 42
au. In this manner the cold Classical Kuiper Belt and its scattered / detached
counterpart were respectively transported outwards by a short range or slightly
scattered to their present locations. Resonant objects were also formed by the
same process. This mechanism is aimed at explaining the distribution of all

different sensory inputs. Specifically, an alignment predictor is learned to
detect whether multiple sensory inputs are aligned, the error of which is used
to measure perception incongruity. A policy model takes different combinations

The variance of actions is further used to measure action incongruity. Using
both incongruities as intrinsic rewards, SEMI allows an agent to learn skills

exploiting the locality of basis functions and efficient prescreening of the

comparison with the traditional pre-defined transform basis, the advantages of

linear combination of dictionary features more effectively. Also we develop a

greatly and reduce its performance. Most existing gait datasets usually collect
data with a dozen different angles, or even more few. Limited view angles would
prevent learning better view invariant feature. It can further improve
robustness of gait recognition if we collect data with various angles at 1
degree interval. But it is time consuming and labor consuming to collect this
kind of dataset. In this paper, we, therefore, introduce a Dense-View GEIs Set
(DV-GEIs) to deal with the challenge of limited view angles. This set can cover
the whole view space, view angle from 0 degree to 180 degree with 1 degree
interval. In addition, Dense-View GAN (DV-GAN) is proposed to synthesize this
dense view set. DV-GAN consists of Generator, Discriminator and Monitor, where
Monitor is designed to preserve human identification and view information. The
proposed method is evaluated on the CASIA-B and OU-ISIR dataset. The
experimental results show that DV-GEIs synthesized by DV-GAN is an effective

prototypical distribution for the source domain in an intermediate embedding
space. This distribution encodes the abstract knowledge that is learned from
the source domain. We then use this distribution for aligning the target domain
distribution with the source domain distribution in the embedding space. We
provide theoretical analysis and explain conditions under which our algorithm
is effective. Experiments on benchmark adaptation task demonstrate our method
achieves competitive performance even compared with joint UDA approaches.

consists of the scale factor and the crossover rate. This paper addresses this
issue by analyzing adaptive parameter landscapes in PAMs for DE. First, we
propose a concept of an adaptive parameter landscape, which captures a moment
in a parameter adaptation process. For each iteration, each individual in the
population has its adaptive parameter landscape. Second, we propose a method of

metal-to-insulator transition. Two distinct switching mechanisms were reported
for such a system: electric-field-driven resistive switching and electrothermal
resistive switching. The latter results from an instability caused by Joule
heating. Here, we present the visualization of the reversible resistive
switching in a planar V$_2$O$_3$ thin-film device using high-resolution
wide-field microscopy in combination with electric transport measurements. We
investigate the interaction of the electrothermal instability with the
strain-induced spontaneous phase-separation in the V$_2$O$_3$ thin film at the
Mott-transition. The photomicrographs show the formation of a narrow metallic
filament with a minimum width $\lesssim$ 500\,nm. Although the filament
formation and the overall shape of the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs)
are typical of an electrothermal breakdown, we also observe atypical effects
like oblique filaments, filament splitting, and hysteretic IVCs with
sawtooth-like jumps at high currents in the low-resistance regime. We were able
to reproduce the experimental results in a numerical model based on a
two-dimensional resistor network. This model demonstrates that resistive
switching, in this case, is indeed electrothermal and that the intrinsic
heterogeneity is responsible for the atypical effects. This heterogeneity is
strongly influenced by strain, thereby establishing a link between switching
dynamics and structural properties.

spatial resolution as the limited detector resolution has to be shared with the
angular dimension. LF spatial super-resolution (SR) thus becomes an
indispensable part of the LF camera processing pipeline. The
high-dimensionality characteristic and complex geometrical structure of LF
images make the problem more challenging than traditional single-image SR. The
performance of existing methods is still limited as they fail to thoroughly
explore the coherence among LF sub-aperture images (SAIs) and are insufficient
in accurately preserving the scene's parallax structure. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel learning-based LF spatial SR framework.
Specifically, each SAI of an LF image is first coarsely and individually
super-resolved by exploring the complementary information among SAIs with
selective combinatorial geometry embedding. To achieve efficient and effective
selection of the complementary information, we propose two novel sub-modules
conducted hierarchically: the patch selector provides an option of retrieving
similar image patches based on offline disparity estimation to handle
large-disparity correlations; and the SAI selector adaptively and flexibly
selects the most informative SAIs to improve the embedding efficiency. To
preserve the parallax structure among the reconstructed SAIs, we subsequently
append a consistency regularization network trained over a structure-aware loss
function to refine the parallax relationships over the coarse estimation. In
addition, we extend the proposed method to irregular LF data. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first learning-based SR method for irregular LF
data. Experimental results over both synthetic and real-world LF datasets
demonstrate the significant advantage of our approach over state-of-the-art
methods.

capture such essential global topic-aware clues at discourse-level. Instead of
taking topic-agnostic n-gram utterance as processing unit for matching purpose
in existing systems, this paper presents a novel topic-aware solution for
multi-turn dialogue modeling, which segments and extracts topic-aware

capturing salient topic shift at discourse-level in need and thus effectively
track topic flow during multi-turn conversation. Our topic-aware modeling is
implemented by a newly proposed unsupervised topic-aware segmentation algorithm

topic segment with the response in a dual cross-attention way. Experimental
results on three public datasets show TADAM can outperform the state-of-the-art

pieces ($N\gg 1$) on a simple cubic lattice in a large 3D bounding box of base
$n \times n$, and calculate the growth rate, $\Lambda(n)$, of the corresponding
partition function, $Z_N\sim N^{\theta}[\Lambda(n)]^N$, at $n\gg 1$. Our
computations rely on a theorem of G.X. Viennot \cite{viennot-rev}, which
connects the generating function of a $(D+1)$-dimensional heap of pieces to the
generating function of projection of these pieces onto a $D$-dimensional
subspace. The growth rate of a heap of cubic blocks, which cannot touch each
other by vertical faces, is thus related to the position of zeros of the
partition function describing 2D lattice gas of hard squares. We study the
corresponding partition function exactly at low densities on finite $n\times n$
lattice of arbitrary $n$, and extrapolate its behavior to the jamming
transition density. This allows us to estimate the limiting growth rate,
$\Lambda =\lim_{n\to\infty}\Lambda(n)\approx 9.5$. The same method works for
any underlying 2D lattice and for various shapes of pieces: flat vertical
squares, mapped to an ensemble of repulsive dimers, dominoes mapped to an
ensemble of rectangles with hard-core repulsion, etc.

functioning of such cryptoassets. However recent studies have observed a trend
of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain,
it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research
derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized
blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review.
This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We
systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our
study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the
multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We
identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing
taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically
observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of
centralization classified over six architectural layers Governance Network

implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied. We
believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of
centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various

subdivided into shorter links interconnected by entanglement distribution via
Bell-state measurements to overcome inherent channel losses. This concept
requires on-demand single-photon sources with a high degree of multi-photon
suppression and high indistinguishability within each repeater node. For a
successful operation of the repeater, a spectral matching of remote quantum
light sources is essential. We present a spectrally tunable single-photon
source emitting in the telecom O-band with the potential to function as a
building block of a quantum communication network based on optical fibers. A
thin membrane of GaAs embedding InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) is attached onto a
piezoelectric actuator via gold thermocompression bonding. Here the thin gold
layer acts simultaneously as an electrical contact, strain transmission medium
and broadband backside mirror for the QD-micromesa. The nanofabrication of the
QD-micromesa is based on in-situ electron-beam lithography, which makes it
possible to integrate pre-selected single QDs deterministically into the center
of monolithic micromesa structures. The QD pre-selection is based on distinct
single-QD properties, signal intensity and emission energy. In combination with
strain-induced fine tuning this offers a robust method to achieve spectral
resonance in the emission of remote QDs. We show that the spectral tuning has
no detectable influence on the multi-photon suppression with $g^{(2)}(0)$ as
low as 2-4% and that the emission can be stabilized to an accuracy of 4 $\mu$eV

solutions to the ascending node of the pulsar orbit, and measured a precise
kinetic distance of the system. Using our timing measurements and published
optical observations, we investigate the binary history of this system using
the stellar evolution code MESA, and discuss solutions based on detailed WD
cooling at the edge of the WD age dichotomy paradigm. We determine the 3-D
velocity of the system and show that it has been undergoing a highly eccentric
orbit around the centre of our Galaxy. Furthermore, we set up a constraint over
dipolar gravitational radiation with the system, which is complementary to
previous studies given the mass of the pulsar. We also obtain a new limit on

social distancing remains untackled in academy. Beyond isolated efforts (from
sidewalk widenings to car-free Open Streets), there is a need for a large-scale
and quantitative strategy for cities to handle the challenges that COVID-19
poses in the use of public space. The main obstacle is a generalized lack of
publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide, and thus city
governments have not yet benefited from a complex systems approach of treating
urban sidewalks as networks. Here, we leverage sidewalk geometries from ten
cities in three continents, to first analyze sidewalk and roadbed geometries,
and find that cities most often present an arrogant distribution of public
space: imbalanced and unfair with respect to pedestrians. Then, we connect
these geometries to build a sidewalk network --adjacent, but not assimilable to
road networks, so fertile in urban science. In a no-intervention scenario, we
apply percolation theory to examine whether the sidewalk infrastructure in
cities can withstand the tight pandemic social distancing imposed on our
streets. The resulting collapse of sidewalk networks, often at widths below
three meters, calls for a cautious strategy, taking into account the
interdependencies between a city's sidewalk and road networks, as any
improvement for pedestrians comes at a cost for motor transport. With notable
success, we propose a shared-effort heuristic that delays the sidewalk
connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality.

on fermion bi-linears so neutral pseudo-scalar mesons can also be $\mathbf T$
eigenstates. The $\mathbf T$-parity should therefore be experimentally
observable and the $\mathbf{CPT}$ theorem dictates that $T= C P$.

Razavi and Gupta as a new comprehensive framework in sensitivity analysis.
According to these authors, VARS provides a more intuitive notion of

Here we review these arguments and critically compare the performance of
VARS-TO, for total-order index, against the total-order Jansen estimator. We
argue that, unlike classic variance-based methods, VARS lacks a clear
definition of what an ""important"" factor is, and show that the alleged
computational superiority of VARS does not withstand scrutiny. We conclude that
while VARS enriches the spectrum of existing methods for sensitivity analysis,
especially for a diagnostic use of mathematical models, it complements rather

performance thanks to deep learning. However, the generalization of semantic
segmentation in the wild remains challenging. In this paper, we address the
problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation.
Motivated by the fact that source and target domain have invariant semantic
structures, we propose to exploit such invariance across domains by leveraging
co-occurring patterns between pairwise pixels in the output of structured
semantic segmentation. This is different from most existing approaches that
attempt to adapt domains based on individual pixel-wise information in image,
feature, or output level. Specifically, we perform domain adaptation on the
affinity relationship between adjacent pixels termed affinity space of source
and target domain. To this end, we develop two affinity space adaptation
strategies: affinity space cleaning and adversarial affinity space alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance against some state-of-the-art methods on several challenging
benchmarks for semantic segmentation across domains. The code is available at

non-convexity. Our contribution develops a strategy that facilitates computing
all guaranteed globally optimal solutions for frame and shell structures under
multiple load cases and self-weight. To this purpose, we exploit the fact that
the stiffness matrix is usually a polynomial function of design variables,
allowing us to build an equivalent non-linear semidefinite programming
formulation over a semi-algebraic feasible set. This formulation is
subsequently solved using the Lasserre moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy,
generating a sequence of outer convex approximations that monotonically
converges from below to the optimum of the original problem. Globally optimal
solutions can subsequently be extracted using the Curto-Fialkow flat extension
theorem. Furthermore, we show that a simple correction to the solutions of the
relaxed problems establishes a feasible upper bound, thereby deriving a simple
sufficient condition of global $\varepsilon$-optimality. When the original
problem possesses a unique minimum, we show that this solution is found with a
zero optimality gap in the limit. These theoretical findings are illustrated on
several examples of topology optimization of frames and shells, for which we
observe that the hierarchy converges in a finite (rather small) number of

concept is well-known, a major challenge has been the implementation: how to
rationally design materials with functional non-equilibrium states and quantify
the dissipation? Here we address these questions for the widely used colloidal
nanoparticles that convey several functionalities. We propose that useful
non-equilibrium states can be realised by creating and maintaining steady-state
nanoparticle concentration gradients by continuous injection and dissipation of
energy. We experimentally demonstrate this with superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles that in thermodynamic equilibrium form a homogeneous functional
fluid with a strong magnetic response (a ferrofluid). To create non-equilibrium
functionalities, we charge the nanoparticles with anionic charge control agents
to create electroferrofluids where nanoparticles act as charge carriers that
can be driven with electric fields and current to non-homogeneous dissipative
steady-states. The dissipative steady-states exhibit voltage-controlled
magnetic properties and emergent diffuse interfaces. The diffuse interfaces
respond strongly to external magnetic fields, leading to dissipative patterns
that are not possible in the equilibrium state. We identify the closest
non-dissipative analogues of these dissipative patterns, discuss the
differences, and highlight how pattern formation in electroferrofluids is
linked to dissipation that can be directly quantified. Beyond electrically
controlled ferrofluids and patterns, we foresee that the concept can be
generalized to other functional nanoparticles to create various scientifically
and technologically relevant non-equilibrium states with optical, electrical,
catalytic, and mechanical responses that are not possible in thermodynamic

different asymptotic regimes occurring when
$\int_{0}\frac{\Phi(u)}{|\Psi(u)|}du<\infty$ or
$\int_{0}\frac{\Phi(u)}{|\Psi(u)|}du=\infty$. We first observe that when
$\int_{0}\frac{\Phi(u)}{|\Psi(u)|}du<\infty$, supercritical CBIs have a growth
rate dictated by the branching dynamics, namely there is a renormalization
$\tau(t)$, only depending on $\Psi$, such that $(\tau(t)Y_t,t\geq 0)$ converges
almost-surely to a finite random variable. When
$\int_{0}\frac{\Phi(u)}{|\Psi(u)|}du=\infty$, it is shown that the immigration
overwhelms the branching dynamics and that no linear renormalization of the
process can exist. Asymptotics in the second regime are studied in details for
all non-critical CBI processes via a nonlinear time-dependent renormalization
in law. Three regimes of weak convergence are then exhibited, where a misprint
in Pinsky's paper is corrected. CBI processes with critical branching

lesions are viewed as highly similar to other tissues. The traditional neural
network has a limited ability to learn features. Even if a host of feature maps
is expanded to obtain more semantic information, the accuracy of segmenting the
final medical image is slightly improved, and the features are excessively
redundant. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel
end-to-end semantic segmentation algorithm, DT-Net, and use two new convolution
strategies to better achieve end-to-end semantic segmentation of medical
images. 1. In the feature mining and feature fusion stage, we construct a
multi-directional integrated convolution (MDIC). The core idea is to use the
multi-scale convolution to enhance the local multi-directional feature maps to
generate enhanced feature maps and to mine the generated features that contain
more semantics without increasing the number of feature maps. 2. We also aim to
further excavate and retain more meaningful deep features reduce a host of
noise features in the training process. Therefore, we propose a convolution
thresholding strategy. The central idea is to set a threshold to eliminate a
large number of redundant features and reduce computational complexity. Through
the two strategies proposed above, the algorithm proposed in this paper
produces state-of-the-art results on two public medical image datasets. We
prove in detail that our proposed strategy plays an important role in feature
mining and eliminating redundant features. Compared with the existing semantic
segmentation algorithms, our proposed algorithm has better robustness.

properties: a real function defined on the non-negative orthant of $\mathbb
R^n$ is entropy-like (EL) if it is submodular, takes zero at zero,
non-decreasing, and has the Diminishing Returns property.
  Motivated by problems concerning the Shannon complexity of multipartite
secret sharing, a special case of the following general optimization problem is
considered: find the minimal cost of those EL functions which satisfy certain
constraints.
  In our special case the cost of an EL function is the maximal value of the
$n$ partial derivatives at zero. Another possibility could be the supremum of
the function range. The constraints are specified by a smooth bounded surface
$S$ cutting off a downward closed subset. An EL function is feasible if at the
internal points of $S$ the left and right partial derivatives of the function
differ by at least one.
  A general lower bound for the minimal cost is given in terms of the normals
of the surface $S$. The bound is tight when $S$ is linear. In the
two-dimensional case the same bound is tight for convex or concave $S$. It is
shown that the optimal EL function is not necessarily unique. The paper

  Dynamics","NeurIPS2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain creates an internal
model of the world to guide actions using sequences of ambiguous sensory
information. This is naturally formulated as a reinforcement learning problem
under partial observations, where an agent must estimate relevant latent
variables in the world from its evidence, anticipate possible future states,
and choose actions that optimize total expected reward. This problem can be
solved by control theory, which allows us to find the optimal actions for a
given system dynamics and objective function. However, animals often appear to
behave suboptimally. Why? We hypothesize that animals have their own flawed
internal model of the world, and choose actions with the highest expected
subjective reward according to that flawed model. We describe this behavior as
rational but not optimal. The problem of Inverse Rational Control (IRC) aims to
identify which internal model would best explain an agent's actions. Our
contribution here generalizes past work on Inverse Rational Control which
solved this problem for discrete control in partially observable Markov
decision processes. Here we accommodate continuous nonlinear dynamics and
continuous actions, and impute sensory observations corrupted by unknown noise
that is private to the animal. We first build an optimal Bayesian agent that
learns an optimal policy generalized over the entire model space of dynamics
and subjective rewards using deep reinforcement learning. Crucially, this
allows us to compute a likelihood over models for experimentally observable
action trajectories acquired from a suboptimal agent. We then find the model
parameters that maximize the likelihood using gradient ascent.

the case of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology that, having no

infrastructure, which often relies on the IP Multimedia Subsystem architecture.
Most telecom operators implement LTE-A, an advanced version of LTE often
marketed as 4G+, which achieves data rate peaks of 300 Mbps. Yet, although such
novel technology boosts the access to advanced multimedia contents and
services, telco operators continue to consider the VoIP market as the major
revenue for their business. In this work, the authors propose a detailed
performance assessment of VoIP traffic by carrying out experimental trials
across a real LTE-A environment. The experimental campaign consists of two
stages. First, we characterize VoIP calls between fixed and mobile terminals,
based on a dataset that includes more than 750,000 data-voice packets. We
analyze quality-of-service metrics such as round-trip time (RTT) and jitter, to
capture the influence of uncontrolled factors that typically appear in
real-world settings. In the second stage, we further consider VoIP flows across
a range of codecs, looking at the trade-offs between quality and bandwidth
consumption. Moreover, we propose a statistical characterization of jitter and
RTT (representing the most critical parameters), identifying the optimal
approximating distribution, namely the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV). The
estimation of parameters through the Maximum Likelihood criterion, leads us to
reveal both the short- and long-tail behaviour for jitter and RTT,
respectively.

proposed a few-shot object detector which is designed for detecting novel

object detection settings, our proposed few-shot detector concentrates on the
relations that lie in the level of objects instead of the full image with the
assistance of Self-Adaptive Attention Network (SAAN). The SAAN can fully
leverage the object-level relations through a relation GRU unit and
simultaneously attach attention on object features in a self-adaptive way
according to the object-level relations to avoid some situations where the
additional attention is useless or even detrimental. Eventually, the detection
results are produced from the features that are added with attention and thus
are able to be detected simply. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method in few-shot scenes.

patients that develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. If true, this hypothesis may
have practical value in allocating resources to particular patients while using
a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty of testing such a
hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data, which need to
be well-annotated and should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome.
This paper presents an original methodology for extracting semantic features
that correlate to severity from a data set with patient ICU admission labels
through interpretable models. The methodology employs a neural network trained
to recognise lung pathologies to extract the semantic features, which are then
analysed with low-complexity models to limit overfitting while increasing
interpretability. This analysis points out that only a few features explain
most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms. When
applied to an unrelated larger data set with pathology-related clinical notes,
the method has shown to be capable of selecting images for the learned
features, which could translate some information about their common locations
in the lung. Besides attesting separability on patients that eventually develop
severe symptoms, the proposed methods represent a statistical approach
highlighting the importance of features related to ICU admission that may have
been only qualitatively reported. While handling limited data sets, notable
methodological aspects are adopted, such as presenting a state-of-the-art lung
segmentation network and the use of low-complexity models to avoid overfitting.
The code for methodology and experiments is also available.

proposed contracts only specify three contract items, which guides users of
arbitrarily many different storage-cost types to invest in full, partial, or no

the social optimum when the utility knows the aggregate demand of each
storage-cost type (but not the individual user's type). When the utility only
knows the distribution of each storage-cost type's demand, our contracts can
lead to a near-optimal solution. The gap with the social optimum is as small as
1.5% based on the simulations using realistic data. We also show that the

having accomplished a series of previous tasks, that is, rewards are
non-Markovian. One natural and quite general way to represent history-dependent
rewards is via a Mealy machine, a finite state automaton that produces output
sequences from input sequences. In our formal setting, we consider a Markov
decision process (MDP) that models the dynamics of the environment in which the
agent evolves and a Mealy machine synchronized with this MDP to formalize the
non-Markovian reward function. While the MDP is known by the agent, the reward
function is unknown to the agent and must be learned.
  Our approach to overcome this challenge is to use Angluin's $L^*$ active
learning algorithm to learn a Mealy machine representing the underlying
non-Markovian reward machine (MRM). Formal methods are used to determine the
optimal strategy for answering so-called membership queries posed by $L^*$.
  Moreover, we prove that the expected reward achieved will eventually be at
least as much as a given, reasonable value provided by a domain expert. We
evaluate our framework on three problems. The results show that using $L^*$ to
learn an MRM in a non-Markovian reward decision process is effective.

on several material parameters for oblate rubble piles with different bulk
diameters $D$ are explored. Our numerical simulations show that both the
increase of interparticle cohesion and particle shape parameter in our model
can strengthen the bodies, especially for the smaller ones. In addition, we
find there exists some critical diameter $D_{cri,\rho}$ at which the variation
trend of $T_c$ with the bulk density $\rho$ reverses. Though a greater static
friction coefficient $\mu_S$ can strengthen the body, this effect attains a
minimum at a critical diameter $D_{cri,\phi}$ close to $D_{cri,\rho}$. The
continuum theory (analytical method) is used for comparison and two equivalent
critical diameters are obtained. The numerical results were fitted with the
analytical method and the ratio of the interparticle cohesion $c$ to the bulk
cohesion $C$ is estimated to be roughly 88.3. We find this ratio keeps constant
for different $c$ and $\rho$, while it strongly depends on the friction angle
$\phi$. Also, our numerical results further show that the dependency of $T_c$
on $\phi$ is opposite from that predicted by the continuum theory when $D$ <
$D_{cri,\phi}$. Finally, we find that the two critical diameters happen to be
close to the diameter when the mean normal stress of the body equals zero,

optimal grasps. To this end, we propose in this work a novel, end-to-end

for an unseen object observed from a single and unknown camera view. GPNet
builds on a key design of grasp proposal module that defines \emph{anchors of
grasp centers} at discrete but regular 3D grid corners, which is flexible to
support either more precise or more diverse grasp predictions. To test GPNet,
we contribute a synthetic dataset of 6-DOF object grasps; evaluation is
conducted using rule-based criteria, simulation test, and real test.
Comparative results show the advantage of our methods over existing ones.
Notably, GPNet gains better simulation results via the specified coverage,
which helps achieve a ready translation in real test. We will make our dataset

computationally challenge.
  Our goal is a line radiative transfer (RT) program that makes good use of
multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Parallelisation is essential to speed up computations
and to enable the tackling of large modelling tasks with personal computers.
  The program LOC is based on ray-tracing and uses standard accelerated lambda
iteration (ALI) methods for faster convergence. The program works on 1D and 3D
grids. The 1D version makes use of symmetries to speed up the RT calculations.
The 3D version works with octree grids and, to enable calculations with large
models, is optimised for low memory usage.
  Tests show that LOC gives results that are in agreement with other RT codes
to within ~2%. This is typical of code-to-code differences, which often are
related to different interpretations of the model set-up. LOC run times compare
favourably with those of Monte Carlo codes. In 1D tests, LOC runs were by up to
a factor ~20 faster on a GPU than on a single CPU core. In spite of the complex
path calculations, up to ~10 speed-up was observed also for 3D models using
octree discretisation. GPUs enable calculations of models with hundreds of
millions of cells, as encountered in the context of large-scale simulations of
interstellar clouds.
  LOC shows good performance and accuracy and and is able to handle many RT
modelling tasks on personal computers. Being written in Python, with the
computing-intensive parts implemented as compiled OpenCL kernels, it can also a
serve as a platform for further experimentation with alternative RT
implementations.

variations of disease. To address these, we proposed a four region lung

Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly
applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are
the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the
segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating
five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical

Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed
dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods
(0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive
correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities under the

the cloud structure, and the ability of dust models to simultaneously explain
sub-millimetre emission, NIR extinction, and NIR scattering.
  We use observations from the HAWK-I instrument to measure the NIR surface
brightness and extinction. These are compared with Herschel data on dust
emission and, with radiative transfer modelling, with predictions calculated
for different dust models.
  We find an optical depth ratio $\tau(250\,\mu{\rm m})/\tau(J)\approx
10^{-3}$, confirming earlier findings of high sub-millimetre emissivity. The
relationships between the column density derived from dust emission and the NIR
colour excesses is linear and consistent with the standard NIR extinction
curve. The extinction peaks at $A_J=2.6\,$mag, the NIR surface brightness
remaining correlated with $N({\rm H}_2)$ without saturation.
  Radiative transfer models can fit the sub-millimetre data with any of the
tested dust models. However, these predict a NIR extinction that is higher and
a NIR surface brightness that is lower than in observations. If the dust
sub-millimetre emissivity is rescaled to the observed value of
$\tau(250\,\mu{\rm m})/\tau(J)$, dust models with high NIR albedo can reach the
observed level of NIR surface brightness. The NIR extinction of the models
tends to be higher than directly measured, which is reflected in the shape of
the NIR surface brightness spectra.
  The combination of emission, extinction, and scattering measurements provides
strong constraints on dust models. The observations of LDN 1642 indicate clear
dust evolution, including a strong increase in the sub-millimetre emissivity,
not yet fully explained by the current dust models.

trajectories for a robotic mission to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, in order to
demonstrate the great advantages related to the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD). The
DFD is a D -$^3$He fuelled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system.
This fusion propulsion concept is based on a magnetically confined field
reversed configuration plasma, where the deuterium propellant is heated by
fusion products, and then expanded into a magnetic nozzle, providing both
thrust and electrical energy to the spacecraft [1]. The trajectories
calculations and analysis for the Titan mission are obtained based on the
characteristics provided by the PPPL [1]. Two different profile missions are
considered: the first one is a thrust-coast-thrust profile with constant thrust
and specific impulse; the second scenario is a continuous and constant thrust
profile mission. Each mission study is divided into four different phases,
starting from the initial low Earth orbit departure, the interplanetary
trajectory, Saturn orbit insertion and the Titan orbit insertion. For all
mission phases, maneuver time and propellant consumption are calculated. The
results of calculations and mission analysis offer a complete overview of the
advantages in term of payload mass and travel time. It is important to
emphasize that the deceleration capability is one of the DFD game changer: in
fact, the DFD performance allows to rapidly reach high velocities and
decelerate in even shorter time period. This capability results in a total trip
duration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years
considering the continuous thrust profile. The high payload enabling
capability, combined with the huge electrical power available from the fusion
reactor, leads to a tremendous advantage compared to present technology.

error-controlled lossy compression for large-scale high-performance
Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), an inverse problem commonly used in geophysical
exploration. This combination can significantly reduce data movement, allowing
a reduction in run time as well as peak memory. In the Exascale computing era,
frequent data transfer (e.g., memory bandwidth, PCIe bandwidth for GPUs, or
network) is the performance bottleneck rather than the peak FLOPS of the
processing unit. Like many other adjoint-based optimization problems, FWI is
costly in terms of the number of floating-point operations, large memory
footprint during backpropagation, and data transfer overheads. Past work for
adjoint methods has developed checkpointing methods that reduce the peak memory
requirements during backpropagation at the cost of additional floating-point
computations. Combining this traditional checkpointing with error-controlled
lossy compression, we explore the three-way tradeoff between memory, precision,
and time to solution. We investigate how approximation errors introduced by
lossy compression of the forward solution impact the objective function
gradient and final inverted solution. Empirical results from these numerical
experiments indicate that high lossy-compression rates (compression factors
ranging up to 100) have a relatively minor impact on convergence rates and the
quality of the final solution.

structure of loosely-bound nuclear systems: the Ratio. This observable consists
of the ratio of angular distributions for different reaction channels, viz.
elastic scattering and breakup, which cancels most of the dependence on the

interactions and properties of conceptual entities on the level of the complete

start from the detection and classification of named entity mentions in
individual sentences. Further, DWIE presented two main challenges when building
and evaluating IE models for it. First, the use of traditional mention-level
evaluation metrics for NER and RE tasks on entity-centric DWIE dataset can
result in measurements dominated by predictions on more frequently mentioned
entities. We tackle this issue by proposing a new entity-driven metric that
takes into account the number of mentions that compose each of the predicted
and ground truth entities. Second, the document-level multi-task annotations
require the models to transfer information between entity mentions located in
different parts of the document, as well as between different tasks, in a joint
learning setting. To realize this, we propose to use graph-based neural message
passing techniques between document-level mention spans. Our experiments show
an improvement of up to 5.5 F1 percentage points when incorporating neural
graph propagation into our joint model. This demonstrates DWIE's potential to
stimulate further research in graph neural networks for representation learning

challenge. This paper focuses on computing the multiplayer Team-Maxmin
Equilibrium with Coordination device (TMECor) in zero-sum extensive-form games.
TMECor models scenarios when a team of players coordinates ex ante against an
adversary. Such situations can be found in card games (e.g., in Bridge and
Poker), when a team works together to beat a target player but communication is
prohibited; and also in real world, e.g., in forest-protection operations, when
coordinated groups have limited contact during interdicting illegal loggers.
The existing algorithms struggle to find a TMECor efficiently because of their
high computational costs. To compute a TMECor in larger games, we make the
following key contributions: (1) we propose a hybrid-form strategy
representation for the team, which preserves the set of equilibria; (2) we
introduce a column-generation algorithm with a guaranteed finite-time
convergence in the infinite strategy space based on a novel best-response
oracle; (3) we develop an associated-representation technique for the exact

performance in terms of reconstruction error as well as visual quality.
However, these methods are limited in the sense that they can be trained only
on fully labeled data. Due to various challenges in obtaining real world
fully-labeled image deraining datasets, existing methods are trained only on
synthetically generated data and hence, generalize poorly to real-world images.
The use of real-world data in training image deraining networks is relatively
less explored in the literature. We propose a Gaussian Process-based
semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to
derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using unlabeled
real-world images. More specifically, we model the latent space vectors of
unlabeled data using Gaussian Processes, which is then used to compute
pseudo-ground-truth for supervising the network on unlabeled data. Through

The paper argues for revision of the historical image of Neumann to portray his

Hilbert's programme that knowledge could be expressed as logical predicates.
The change is described by relating Neumann's criticism of Carnap's logicism
and by discussing Neumann's rejection of the Turing Machine model of
computation. Probably under the influence of the founders of modern physics in
particular Wolfgang Pauli and Werner Heisenberg at the Advanced Study
Institute, Neumann changed to a natural philosopher of computation. Neumann's

Despite the remarkable performance of representation learning methods in the
analysis of time series, there are still several challenges associated with
these methods ranging from the complex structures of methods, the lack of
generality of solutions, the need for expert knowledge, and large-scale
training datasets. We introduce the piece-wise matching layer that works based
on two levels to address some of the aforementioned challenges. At the first
level, a set of morphological, statistical, and frequency features and
comparative forms of them are computed based on each periodic part and its
neighbors. At the second level, these features are modified by predefined
transformation functions based on a receptive field scenario. Several scenarios
of offline processing, incremental processing, fixed sliding receptive field,
and event-based triggering receptive field can be implemented based on the
choice of length and mechanism of indicating the receptive field. We propose
dynamic time wrapping as a mechanism that indicates a receptive field based on
event triggering tactics. To evaluate the performance of this method in time

signal. We compared the performance of our method against a variety of known

condition is shown necessary for satisfying the extension property. The idea is
to use a new weight function to return to the original case of Hamming weight.

propose lineage evolution reinforcement learning algorithm. Lineage evolution
reinforcement learning is a kind of derivative algorithm which accords with the
general agent population learning system. We take the agents in DQN and its
related variants as the basic agents in the population, and add the selection,
mutation and crossover modules in the genetic algorithm to the reinforcement
learning algorithm. In the process of agent evolution, we refer to the
characteristics of natural genetic behavior, add lineage factor to ensure the
retention of potential performance of agent, and comprehensively consider the
current performance and lineage value when evaluating the performance of agent.
Without changing the parameters of the original reinforcement learning
algorithm, lineage evolution reinforcement learning can optimize different
reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the idea of
evolution with lineage improves the performance of original reinforcement
learning algorithm in some games in Atari 2600.
