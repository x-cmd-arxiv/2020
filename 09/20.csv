  Temporal Context","11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, accepted at RecSys 2021 - Workshop on
  Perspectives on the Evaluation of Recommender Systems (PERSPECTIVES)",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommender systems research tends to evaluate model performance offline and
on randomly sampled targets, yet the same systems are later used to predict
user behavior sequentially from a fixed point in time. Simulating online
recommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy
between online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline
evaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model
is deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how
omitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads
to false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation
protocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal
context. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal
context in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce
temporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and
confirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we
validate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate
those produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy
on three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that
including our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.

where entities are composed of free-form text. However, most existing CKG
completion methods focus on the setting where all the entities are presented at
training time. Although this setting is standard for conventional KG
completion, it has limitations for CKG completion. At test time, entities in
CKGs can be unseen because they may have unseen text/names and entities may be
disconnected from the training graph, since CKGs are generally very sparse.
Here, we propose to study the inductive learning setting for CKG completion
where unseen entities may present at test time. We develop a novel learning
framework named InductivE. Different from previous approaches, InductiveE
ensures the inductive learning capability by directly computing entity
embeddings from raw entity attributes/text. InductiveE consists of a free-text
encoder, a graph encoder, and a KG completion decoder. Specifically, the
free-text encoder first extracts the textual representation of each entity
based on the pre-trained language model and word embedding. The graph encoder
is a gated relational graph convolutional neural network that learns from a
densified graph for more informative entity representation learning. We develop
a method that densifies CKGs by adding edges among semantic-related entities
and provide more supportive information for unseen entities, leading to better
generalization ability of entity embedding for unseen entities. Finally,
inductiveE employs Conv-TransE as the CKG completion decoder. Experimental
results show that InductiveE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in both standard and inductive settings on ATOMIC and ConceptNet
benchmarks. InductivE performs especially well on inductive scenarios where it
achieves above 48% improvement over present methods.

solved this problem in the case where the objective functional is an expected

including radiotherapy, radiation protection in manned space missions and
nanodevice fabrication techniques. However, experimentally measuring all the
necessary electronic interaction cross-sections for every relevant material is
an arduous task, so it is necessary having predictive models, sufficiently
accurate yet easily implementable. In this work we present a model, based on
the dielectric formalism, to provide reliable ionisation and excitation
cross-sections for electron-impact on complex biomolecular media, taking into
account their condensed-phase nature. We account for the indistinguishability
and exchange between the primary beam and excited electrons, for the molecular
electronic structure effects in the electron binding, as well as for
higher-order corrections to the first Born approximation. The resulting
approach yields total ionisation cross-sections, energy distributions of
secondary electrons, and total electronic excitation cross-sections for
condensed-phase biomaterials, once the electronic excitation spectrum is known,
either from experiments or from a predictive model. The results of this
methodology are compared with the available experimental data in water and
DNA/RNA molecular building blocks, showing a very good agreement and a great
predictive power in a wide range of electron incident energies, from the large
values characteristic of electron beams down to excitation threshold. The
proposed model constitutes a very useful procedure for computing the electronic
interaction cross-sections for arbitrary biological materials in a wide range

configuration offers us opportunities for both redundant calibration and
sky-based calibration algorithms; using the two in tandem is a potential
approach to mitigate calibration errors caused by inaccurate sky models. The
MWA Epoch of Reionization (EoR) experiment targets three patches of the sky
(dubbed EoR0, EoR1, and EoR2) with deep observations. Previous work in
\cite{Li_2018} and \cite{Wenyang_2019} studied the effect of tandem calibration
on the EoR0 field and found that it yielded no significant improvement in the
power spectrum over sky-based calibration alone. In this work, we apply similar
techniques to the EoR1 field and find a distinct result: the improvements in
the power spectrum from tandem calibration are significant. To understand this
result, we analyze both the calibration solutions themselves and the effects on
the power spectrum over three nights of EoR1 observations. We conclude that the
presence of the bright radio galaxy Fornax A in EoR1 degrades the performance
of sky-based calibration, which in turn enables redundant calibration to have a
larger impact. These results suggest that redundant calibration can indeed
mitigate some level of model-incompleteness error.

the detection of two giant planets orbiting the young, nearby star $\beta$
Pictoris. The $\delta$ Scuti pulsations of the star, overwhelming planetary
signals, need to be carefully suppressed. In this work, we independently
revisit the analysis of the RV data following a different approach than in the

(GP) with a stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator kernel can model
the $\delta$ Scuti pulsations. It provides similar results as parametric models
but with a simpler framework, using only 3 hyperparameters. It also enables to
model poorly sampled RV data, that were excluded from previous analysis, hence
extending the RV baseline by nearly five years. Altogether, the orbit and the
mass of both planets can be constrained from RV only, which was not possible
with the parametric modelling. To characterize the system more accurately, we
also perform a joint fit of all available relative astrometry and RV data. Our
orbital solutions for $\beta$ Pic b favour a low eccentricity of
$0.029^{+0.061}_{-0.024}$ and a relatively short period of $21.1^{+2.0}_{-0.8}$

identified refactoring patterns and defined three main common quality
improvement categories, including internal quality attributes, external quality
attributes, and code smells, by only considering refactoring-related commits.
However, this approach heavily depends on the manual inspection of commit

classify it according to the refactoring common quality improvement categories.
Specifically, we combine the N-Gram TF-IDF feature selection with binary and

in the theory in different ways. After an introductory review of the two
approaches: with an exactly fixed by delta-function membrane area $A$ [Seifert,
Z. Phys. B, 97, 299, (1995)] or approximatively by means of a Lagrange
multiplier $\sigma$ conjugated to $A$ [Milner and Safran, Phys. Rev. A, 36,

has been announced in the framework of a model containing stretching energy

Hamiltonian is not exactly solvable an approximating method based on the
Bogoliubov inequalities for the free energy has been developed. The area
constraint in the last approach appears as a self-consistent equation for the

analytically. However, much insight into the physics behind can be obtained

investigated in the presence of external magnetic and Aharanov-Bohm (AB) fields

and the energy spectra and the corresponding wave function for the ISKP in the

obtained energy spectra are used to study three selected diatomic molecules

applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly
challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a
crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per
post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic
connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training
to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g.,
accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes
a neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of
homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation
node, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique
significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic
connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection
pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping
framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE
state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60%

is classified as benign or malignant. This analysis shows that the texture
features have resulted in better accuracy than the other features with WFSVM

classical $O(d/n)$ excess risk rate, where $d$ is the dimension of the
covariates and $n$ is the number of samples. In particular, we construct a
bounded distribution such that the constrained least squares estimator incurs
an excess risk of order $\Omega(d^{3/2}/n)$ hence refuting a recent conjecture
of Ohad Shamir [JMLR 2015]. In contrast, we observe that non-linear predictors
can achieve the optimal rate $O(d/n)$ with no assumptions on the distribution
of the covariates. We discuss additional distributional assumptions sufficient
to guarantee an $O(d/n)$ excess risk rate for the least squares estimator.
Among them are certain moment equivalence assumptions often used in the robust
statistics literature. While such assumptions are central in the analysis of
unbounded and heavy-tailed settings, our work indicates that in some cases,
they also rule out unfavorable bounded distributions.

keeping maps updated, tracking objects, and planning. Localization algorithms
often take advantage of maps for estimating the car pose. Since maintaining and
using several maps is computationally expensive, it is important to analyze
which type of map is more adequate for each application. In this work, we
provide data for such analysis by comparing the accuracy of a particle filter
localization when using occupancy, reflectivity, color, or semantic grid maps.
To the best of our knowledge, such evaluation is missing in the literature. For
building semantic and colour grid maps, point clouds from a Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) sensor are fused with images captured by a front-facing camera.
Semantic information is extracted from images with a deep neural network.
Experiments are performed in varied environments, under diverse conditions of
illumination and traffic. Results show that occupancy grid maps lead to more
accurate localization, followed by reflectivity grid maps. In most scenarios,
the localization with semantic grid maps kept the position tracking without
catastrophic losses, but with errors from 2 to 3 times bigger than the
previous. Colour grid maps led to inaccurate and unstable localization even
using a robust metric, the entropy correlation coefficient, for comparing
online data and the map.

the key issues exhibited by each tool individually. In this paper we present an
innovative High-Resolution Augmentation (HRA) strategy that enables highly
accurate correspondence even in the presence of significant mesh resolution
mismatch between the input shapes. This augmentation provides an effective
workaround for the resolution limitations imposed by the adopted morphable
model. The HRA in its global and localized versions represents a novel
refinement strategy for surface subdivision methods. We demonstrate the
accuracy of the proposed pipeline on multiple challenging benchmarks, and
showcase its effectiveness in surface registration and texture transfer.

between disease- and drug-induced gene expression profiles, quantified by a
disease-drug 'connectivity score.' Over the past 15 years, several studies have
proposed variations in calculating connectivity scores towards improving

understanding of the stellar-mass black hole (BH) formation. The primary and
secondary BH are both inferred to fall inside the pair-instability (PI) mass
gap. Here we propose that the formation of such binaries is possible through
gas accretion onto the BH remnants of Population III (Pop~III) stars born in
high-redshift ($z>10$) minihalos. Once the parent halo has grown to the
atomic-cooling limit, even brief episodes of gas accretion in the dense central
regions of the halo can increase the masses of Pop~III remnant BHs above the PI
limit. Starting with a BBH with an initial mass of O(100) ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ we
find that it would only need to spend about 100~Myr in the inner few pc of an
atomic-cooling halo to accrete about 50~${\rm M_{\odot}}$ of material and
resemble a system similar to GW190521. The dynamical friction timescale for the
binary to sink to the dense inner region of its parent halo is comparable or
shorter than the accretion timescale required to increase their mass above the
PI limit. Once in the core of the halo, the binary can enter a phase of
hyper-Eddington accretion, where it would only take a few thousand years to
exceed the PI limit through accretion. Even more massive BBHs could form
through this channel, and be detectable by detectors with improved
low-frequency sensitivity. Single Pop~III BH remnants would also grow through
accretion and could later form binaries dynamically. As little as a few percent
of Pop~III BH remnants may be sufficient to match the rate of massive BBH
mergers inferred from GW190521 of $0.13^{+0.3}_{-0.11}\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$.

build convnets over datasets with non-trivial symmetries, such as patterns over
the surface of a sphere. However, one limitation of this approach is the need
to explicitly define the Lie group underlying the desired invariance property
before training the convnet. Whereas rotations on the sphere have a well-known
symmetry group ($\mathrm{SO}(3)$), the same cannot be said of many real-world
factors of variability. For example, the disentanglement of pitch, intensity
dynamics, and playing technique remains a challenging task in music information

the weak and strong arbitrage bubble limits. For the case where the arbitrage
bubble's volatility is zero (deterministic bubble), the weak limit corresponds
to the usual Black-Scholes model. The strong limit case also give a
Black--Scholes model, but the underlying asset's mean value replaces the
interest rate. When the bubble is stochastic, the theory also has weak and
strong asymptotic limits that give rise to option price dynamics that are
similar to the Black--Scholes model. Explicit formulas are derived for Gaussian

participants. Although, several general purpose tools exist to identify toxic
contents, those may incorrectly flag some words commonly used in the Software
Engineering (SE) context as toxic (e.g., 'junk', 'kill', and 'dump') and vice
versa. To encounter this challenge, an SE specific tool has been proposed by
the CMU Strudel Lab (referred as the `STRUDEL' hereinafter) by combining the
output of the Perspective API with the output from a customized version of the
Stanford's Politeness detector tool. However, since STRUDEL's evaluation was
very limited with only 654 SE text, its practical applicability is unclear.
Therefore, this study aims to empirically evaluate the Strudel tool as well as
four state-of-the-art general purpose toxicity detectors on a large scale SE
dataset. On this goal, we empirically developed a rubric to manually label
toxic SE interactions. Using this rubric, we manually labeled a dataset of
6,533 code review comments and 4,140 Gitter messages. The results of our
analyses suggest significant degradation of all tools' performances on our
datasets. Those degradations were significantly higher on our dataset of formal
SE communication such as code review than on our dataset of informal
communication such as Gitter messages. Two of the models from our study showed

for trajectory data which can learn expressively explanatory models for

for risk assessment, while many risks are not yet well understood. The lack of
empirical data and complex causal and outcome relationships make it difficult
to estimate the degree to which certain risk types are exposed. Traditional
risk models are based on classical set theory. In comparison, fuzzy logic
models are built on fuzzy set theory and are useful for analyzing risks with
insufficient knowledge or inaccurate data. Fuzzy logic systems help to make
large-scale risk management frameworks more simple. For risks that do not have
an appropriate probability model, a fuzzy logic system can help model the cause
and effect relationships, assess the level of risk exposure, rank key risks in
a consistent way, and consider available data and experts'opinions. Besides, in
fuzzy logic systems, some rules explicitly explain the connection, dependence,
and relationships between model factors. This can help identify risk mitigation
solutions. Resources can be used to mitigate risks with very high levels of
exposure and relatively low hedging costs. Fuzzy set and fuzzy logic models can
be used with Bayesian and other types of method recognition and decision
models, including artificial neural networks and decision tree models. These
developed models have the potential to solve difficult risk assessment
problems. This research paper explores areas in which fuzzy logic models can be
used to improve risk assessment and risk decision making. We will discuss the
methodology, framework, and process of using fuzzy logic systems in risk
assessment.

modality heterogeneity. On the one hand, the textual embeddings are not
discriminative enough, which originates from the high abstraction of the
textual descriptions. One the other hand,Global average pooling (GAP) is
commonly utilized to extract more general or smoothed features implicitly but
ignores salient local features, which are more important for the cross-modal
matching problem. With that in mind, a novel Dual-path CNN with Max Gated block
(DCMG) is proposed to extract discriminative word embeddings and make
visual-textual association concern more on remarkable features of both
modalities. The proposed framework is based on two deep residual CNNs jointly
optimized with cross-modal projection matching (CMPM) loss and cross-modal
projection classification (CMPC) loss to embed the two modalities into a joint
feature space. First, the pre-trained language model, BERT, is combined with
the convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn better word embeddings in the
text-to-image matching domain. Second, the global Max pooling (GMP) layer is
applied to make the visual-textual features focus more on the salient part. To
further alleviate the noise of the maxed-pooled features, the gated block (GB)
is proposed to produce an attention map that focuses on meaningful features of
both modalities. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark
dataset, CUHK-PEDES, in which our approach achieves the rank-1 score of 55.81%

that Walrasian equilibria maximize the sum of agent valuations. This ensures
efficiency, but can lead to extreme inequality across individuals. Many

Furthermore, a parameter of the pricing rule directly determines which CES

holds for any valuations that are homogeneous, differentiable, and concave. We

movement of agents over a common road network. Most approaches to this problem
handle the agents as point objects, wherein the size of the agent is
significantly smaller than the road on which it travels. In this paper, we
consider spatially extended agents which have a size comparable to the length
of the road on which they travel. An optimal multi agent path finding approach
for spatially-extended agents was proposed in the eXtended Conflict Based
Search (XCBS) algorithm. As XCBS resolves only a pair of conflicts at a time,
it results in deeper search trees in case of cascading or multiple (more than
two agent) conflicts at a given location. This issue is addressed in eXtended
Conflict Based Search with Awareness (XCBS-A) in which an agent uses awareness
of other agents' plans to make its own plan. In this paper, we explore XCBS-A
in greater detail, we theoretically prove its completeness and empirically
demonstrate its performance with other algorithms in terms of variances in road
characteristics, agent characteristics and plan characteristics. We demonstrate
the distributive nature of the algorithm by evaluating its performance when
distributed over multiple machines. XCBS-A generates a huge search space
impacting its efficiency in terms of memory; to address this we propose an
approach for memory-efficiency and empirically demonstrate the performance of
the algorithm. The nature of XCBS-A is such that it may lead to suboptimal
solutions, hence the final contribution of this paper is an enhanced approach,
XCBS-Local Awareness (XCBS-LA) which we prove will be optimal and complete.

high-quality Bengali-English parallel corpus comprising of 2.75 million
sentence pairs, more than 2 million of which were not available before.
Training on neural models, we achieve an improvement of more than 9 BLEU score
over previous approaches to Bengali-English machine translation. We also
evaluate on a new test set of 1000 pairs made with extensive quality control.
We release the segmenter, parallel corpus, and the evaluation set, thus
elevating Bengali from its low-resource status. To the best of our knowledge,

  Control","Accepted to The 2nd International Conference on Distributed
  Artificial Intelligence",,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Decentralized multi-agent control has broad applications, ranging from
multi-robot cooperation to distributed sensor networks. In decentralized
multi-agent control, systems are complex with unknown or highly uncertain
dynamics, where traditional model-based control methods can hardly be applied.
Compared with model-based control in control theory, deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) is promising to learn the controller/policy from data without
the knowing system dynamics. However, to directly apply DRL to decentralized
multi-agent control is challenging, as interactions among agents make the
learning environment non-stationary. More importantly, the existing multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms cannot ensure the closed-loop
stability of a multi-agent system from a control-theoretic perspective, so the
learned control polices are highly possible to generate abnormal or dangerous
behaviors in real applications. Hence, without stability guarantee, the
application of the existing MARL algorithms to real multi-agent systems is of
great concern, e.g., UAVs, robots, and power systems, etc. In this paper, we
aim to propose a new MARL algorithm for decentralized multi-agent control with
a stability guarantee. The new MARL algorithm, termed as a multi-agent
soft-actor critic (MASAC), is proposed under the well-known framework of
""centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution"". The closed-loop stability
is guaranteed by the introduction of a stability constraint during the policy
improvement in our MASAC algorithm. The stability constraint is designed based
on Lyapunov's method in control theory. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we
present a multi-agent navigation example to show the efficiency of the proposed
MASAC algorithm.

language processing applications. In particular, the use of multi-head
attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend

however, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that
makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the
model's representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a
novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based
on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose
a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in
multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model's expressiveness.
Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on
the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention.
Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate
that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature
diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent
performance improvement on various tasks.

remains challenging how to potentiate antibacterial activity and meanwhile
minimize toxicity hazards to the environment. Here, we experimentally show that
the functionality of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through copper ions displays
selective antibacterial activity significantly stronger than that of rGO itself
and no toxicity to mammalian cells. Remarkably, this antibacterial activity is
two orders of magnitude greater than the activity of its surrounding copper
ions. We demonstrate that the rGO is functionalized through the cation-${\pi}$
interaction to massively adsorb copper ions to form a rGO-copper composite in
solution and result in an extremely low concentration level of surrounding
copper ions (less than ~0.5 ${\mu}M$). These copper ions on rGO are positively
charged and strongly interact with negatively charged bacterial cells to
selectively achieve antibacterial activity, while rGO exhibits the
functionality to not only actuate rapid delivery of copper ions and massive
assembly onto bacterial cells but also result in the valence shift in the
copper ions from Cu$^{2+}$ into Cu$^{+}$ which greatly enhances the
antibacterial activity. Notably, this functionality of rGO through
cation-${\pi}$ interaction with copper ions can similarly achieve algaecidal
activity but does not exert cytotoxicity against neutrally charged mammalian
cells. The remarkable selective antibacterial activity from the rGO
functionality as well as the inherent broad-spectrum-antibacterial physical
mechanism represents a significant step toward the development of a novel
antibacterial material and reagent without environmental hazards for practical
application.

different stations in the system at the network-level. Although prediction
errors were slightly lower in the case of univariate models, we found that the
multivariate model results were promising for the network-level prediction,
especially in systems where there is a relatively large number of stations that

suggested that demographic information and other environmental variables were
significant factors to model bikes in BSSs. We also demonstrated that the

wheels to command its orientation while in the air. Prior work has demonstrated
on a hardware prototype that simple PD control with hand-tuned gains is
sufficient, but hardly optimal, to stabilize the orientation in under 500ms.
The goal of this work is to decrease the stabilization time and reject
disturbances using nonlinear control methods. A model-based Feedback
Linearization (FL) was added to compensate for the nonlinear Coriolis terms.
However, with external disturbances, model uncertainty and sensor noise, the FL
controller does not guarantee stability. As an alternative, a second controller
was developed using backstepping methods with an adaptive compensator for
external disturbances, model uncertainty, and sensor offset. The controller was
designed using Lyapunov analysis. A simulation was written using the full
nonlinear dynamics of AGRO in an isotropic steering configuration in which
control authority over its pitch and roll are equalized. The PD+FL control
method was compared to the backstepping control method using the same initial
conditions in simulation. Both the backstepping controller and the PD+FL
controller stabilized the system within 250 milliseconds. The adaptive
backstepping controller was also able to achieve this performance with the
adaptation law enabled and compensating for offset noisy sinusoidal

properties that might be distinct from those in condensed matter. The
fundamental reason is that photonic eigenstates can have arbitrary occupation
numbers, whereas in electronic systems these are limited by the Pauli
principle. Here, we address the steady-state transport of pseudothermal photons
between two waveguides connected through a cavity with Bose-Hubbard interaction
between photons. One of the waveguides is subjected to a broadband incoherent
pumping. We predict a continuous transition between the regimes of Lorentzian
and Gaussian chaotic light emitted by the cavity. The rich variety of
nonequilibrium transport regimes is revealed by the zero-frequency noise. There
are three limiting cases, in which the noise-current relation is characterized
by a power-law, $S\propto J^\gamma$. The Lorentzian light corresponds to
Breit-Wigner-like transmission and $\gamma=2$. The Gaussian regime corresponds
to many-body transport with the shot noise ($\gamma=1$) at large currents; at
low currents, however, we find an unconventional exponent $\gamma=3/2$
indicating a nontrivial interplay between multi-photon transitions and
incoherent pumping. The nonperturbative solution for photon dephasing is
obtained in the framework of the Keldysh field theory and Caldeira-Leggett
effective action. These findings might be relevant for experiments on photon
blockade in superconducting qubits, thermal states transfer, and photon

numerical simulations of large-scale-mechanically-driven turbulent flows in the
isothermal ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework. The mechanical forcing
is either purely solenoidal or purely compressive and the turbulent
steady-states considered exhibit root mean square (RMS) Mach numbers 0.1
$\lesssim$ M $\lesssim$ 11. A continuous small-scale electromotive forcing
injects magnetic helical fluctuations, which lead to the build-up of ever
larger magnetic structures. Spectral scaling exponents are observed which, for
low Mach numbers, are consistent with previous research done in the
incompressible case. Higher compressibility leads to flatter magnetic helicity
scaling exponents. The deviations from the incompressible case are
comparatively small for solenoidally-driven turbulence, even at high Mach
numbers, as compared to those for compressively-driven turbulence, where strong
deviations are already visible at relatively mild RMS Mach numbers M $\gtrsim$
3. Compressible effects can thus play an important role in the inverse transfer
of magnetic helicity, especially when the turbulence drivers are rather
compressive. Theoretical results observed in the incompressible case can,
however, be transferred to supersonic turbulence by an appropriate change of
variables, using the Alfv\'en velocity in place of the magnetic field.

real-world problems, most existing studies focus on quite specific
applications, such as the prediction of taxi demand, ridesharing order, traffic
speed, and so on. This hinders the STTP research as the approaches designed for
different applications are hardly comparable, and thus how an
application-driven approach can be generalized to other scenarios is unclear.
To fill in this gap, this paper makes three efforts: (i) we propose an analytic
framework, called STAnalytic, to qualitatively investigate STTP approaches

aiming to make different application-driven approaches comparable; (ii) we
design a spatio-temporal meta-model, called STMeta, which can flexibly
integrate generalizable temporal and spatial knowledge identified by
STAnalytic, (iii) we build an STTP benchmark platform including ten real-life
datasets with five scenarios to quantitatively measure the generalizability of
STTP approaches. In particular, we implement STMeta with different deep
learning techniques, and STMeta demonstrates better generalizability than
state-of-the-art approaches by achieving lower prediction error on average

and everlasting problems poses new challenges for which traditional batch-based
offline algorithms turn out to be insufficient in terms of computational time
and predictive performance. One of the most crucial limitations is that we
cannot assume having access to a finite and complete data set - we always have
to be ready for new data that may complement our model. This poses a critical
problem of providing labels for potentially unbounded streams. In the real
world, we are forced to deal with very strict budget limitations, therefore, we
will most likely face the scarcity of annotated instances, which are essential
in supervised learning. In our work, we emphasize this problem and propose a
novel instance exploitation technique. We show that when: (i) data is
characterized by temporary non-stationary concepts, and (ii) there are very few
labels spanned across a long time horizon, it is actually better to risk
overfitting and adapt models more aggressively by exploiting the only labeled
instances we have, instead of sticking to a standard learning mode and
suffering from severe underfitting. We present different strategies and
configurations for our methods, as well as an ensemble algorithm that attempts
to maintain a sweet spot between risky and normal adaptation. Finally, we
conduct a complex in-depth comparative analysis of our methods, using

Their effectiveness rests on the distributional hypothesis: words that occur in
the same context carry similar semantic information. Here, we adapt this
approach to index visual semantics in images of scenes. To this end, we
formulate a distributional hypothesis for objects and scenes: Scenes that
contain the same objects (object context) are semantically related. Similarly,
objects that appear in the same spatial context (within a scene or subregions
of a scene) are semantically related. We develop two approaches for learning
object and scene embeddings from annotated images. In the first approach, we
adapt LSA and Word2vec's Skipgram and CBOW models to generate two sets of
embeddings from object co-occurrences in whole images, one for objects and one
for scenes. The representational space spanned by these embeddings suggests
that the distributional hypothesis holds for images. In an initial application
of this approach, we show that our image-based embeddings improve scene
classification models such as ResNet18 and VGG-11 (3.72\% improvement on Top5
accuracy, 4.56\% improvement on Top1 accuracy). In the second approach, rather
than analyzing whole images of scenes, we focus on co-occurrences of objects
within subregions of an image. We illustrate that this method yields a sensible
hierarchical decomposition of a scene into collections of semantically related
objects. Overall, these results suggest that object and scene embeddings from
object co-occurrences and spatial context yield semantically meaningful
representations as well as computational improvements for downstream
applications such as scene classification.

where the spectral-type approaches are its important subclass. Its key first
step is to desire learning a representation coefficient matrix with block
diagonal structure. To realize this step, many methods were successively
proposed by imposing different structure priors on the coefficient matrix.
These impositions can be roughly divided into two categories, i.e., indirect
and direct. The former introduces the priors such as sparsity and low rankness
to indirectly or implicitly learn the block diagonal structure. However, the
desired block diagonalty cannot necessarily be guaranteed for noisy data. While
the latter directly or explicitly imposes the block diagonal structure prior
such as block diagonal representation (BDR) to ensure so-desired block
diagonalty even if the data is noisy but at the expense of losing the convexity
that the former's objective possesses. For compensating their respective
shortcomings, in this paper, we follow the direct line to propose Adaptive
Block Diagonal Representation (ABDR) which explicitly pursues block diagonalty
without sacrificing the convexity of the indirect one. Specifically, inspired
by Convex BiClustering, ABDR coercively fuses both columns and rows of the
coefficient matrix via a specially designed convex regularizer, thus naturally
enjoying their merits and adaptively obtaining the number of blocks. Finally,
experimental results on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of ABDR to the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

mathematical structure within a class of similar structures under an extension
concept that gives rise to mathematically natural notions of possibility and
necessity. A statement $\varphi$ is possible in a structure (written
$\Diamond\varphi$) if $\varphi$ is true in some extension of that structure,
and $\varphi$ is necessary (written $\Box\varphi$) if it is true in all
extensions of the structure. A principal case for us will be the class Mod(T)
of all models of a given theory T---all graphs, all groups, all fields, or what
have you---considered under the substructure relation. In this article, we aim
to develop the resulting modal model theory. The class of all graphs is a
particularly insightful case illustrating the remarkable power of the modal
vocabulary, for the modal language of graph theory can express connectedness,
$k$-colorability, finiteness, countability, size continuum, size $\aleph_1$,
$\aleph_2$, $\aleph_\omega$, $\beth_\omega$, first $\beth$-fixed point, first
$\beth$-hyper-fixed-point and much more. A graph obeys the maximality principle
$\Diamond\Box\varphi(a)\to\varphi(a)$ with parameters if and only if it
satisfies the theory of the countable random graph, and it satisfies the
maximality principle for sentences if and only if it is universal for finite
graphs.

and plays a crucial role in public security. Nevertheless, HFR is confronted
with challenges from large domain discrepancy and insufficient heterogeneous
data. In this paper, we formulate HFR as a dual generation problem, and tackle
it via a novel Dual Variational Generation (DVG-Face) framework. Specifically,
a dual variational generator is elaborately designed to learn the joint
distribution of paired heterogeneous images. However, the small-scale paired
heterogeneous training data may limit the identity diversity of sampling. In
order to break through the limitation, we propose to integrate abundant
identity information of large-scale visible data into the joint distribution.
Furthermore, a pairwise identity preserving loss is imposed on the generated
paired heterogeneous images to ensure their identity consistency. As a
consequence, massive new diverse paired heterogeneous images with the same
identity can be generated from noises. The identity consistency and identity
diversity properties allow us to employ these generated images to train the HFR
network via a contrastive learning mechanism, yielding both domain-invariant
and discriminative embedding features. Concretely, the generated paired
heterogeneous images are regarded as positive pairs, and the images obtained
from different samplings are considered as negative pairs. Our method achieves
superior performances over state-of-the-art methods on seven challenging
databases belonging to five HFR tasks, including NIR-VIS, Sketch-Photo,
Profile-Frontal Photo, Thermal-VIS, and ID-Camera. The related code will be

generalizes a simpler model, like probit regression. All skew-symmetric
distributions and link functions arise from symmetric distributions by
incorporating a skewness parameter through some skewing mechanism. In this work
we address some fundamental issues in skewed probit regression, and more
genreally skew-symmetric distributions or skew-symmetric link functions. We
address the issue of identifiability of the skewed probit model parameters by
reformulating the intercept from first principles. A new standardization of the
skew link function is given to provide and anchored interpretation of the
inference. Possible skewness parameters are investigated and the penalizing
complexity priors of these are derived. This prior is invariant under
reparameterization of the skewness parameter and quantifies the contraction of
the skewed probit model to the probit model. The proposed results are available
in the R-INLA package and we illustrate the use and effects of this work using
simulated data, and well-known datasets using the link as well as the
likelihood.

ordinary fermions acquire their masses, where an ordinary fermion (f) couples
to a technifermion (F) mediated by an Extended Technicolor (ETC) boson leading
to fermion masses that vary with the ETC mass scale ($M_E$) as $1/M_E^2$.
Recently, we discussed a new approach consisting of models where TC and QCD are
coupled through a larger theory, in this case the solutions of these equations
are modified compared to those of the isolated equations, and TC and QCD
self-energies are of the Irregular form, which allows us to build models where
ETC boson masses can be pushed to very high energies. In this work we extend
these results for 331-TC models, in particular considering a coupled system of
Schwinger-Dyson equations, we show that all technifermions of the model exhibit
the same asymptotic behavior for TC self-energies. As an application we discuss
how the mass splitting of the order $O(100)GeV$ could be generated between the
second and third generation of fermions.

novel methods, F^2-Softmax and MefMax, for a balanced training even with the
skewed frequency distribution. MefMax assigns tokens uniquely to frequency
classes, trying to group tokens with similar frequencies and equalize frequency
mass between the classes. F^2-Softmax then decomposes a probability
distribution of the target token into a product of two conditional
probabilities of (i) frequency class, and (ii) token from the target frequency
class. Models learn more uniform probability distributions because they are
confined to subsets of vocabularies. Significant performance gains on seven
relevant metrics suggest the supremacy of our approach in improving not only
the diversity but also the quality of generated texts.

spring, summer and winter. Every spring starts with $N$ dormant individuals

an individual is awake, it starts reproducing at a constant rate. By the end of
spring, all individuals are awake and continue reproducing independently as
Yule processes during the whole summer. In the winter, $N$ individuals chosen
uniformly at random go to sleep until the next spring, and the other

effects can lead to significant bias in effect estimates. This problem, known
as spatial confounding, is encountered modelling forestry data to assess the
effect of temperature on tree health. Reliable inference is difficult as
results depend on whether or not spatial effects are included in the model. The
mechanism behind spatial confounding is poorly understood and methods for
dealing with it are limited. We propose a novel approach, spatial+, in which
collinearity is reduced by replacing the covariates in the spatial model by
their residuals after spatial dependence has been regressed away. Using a thin
plate spline model formulation, we recognise spatial confounding as a
smoothing-induced bias identified by Rice (1986), and through asymptotic
analysis of the effect estimates, we show that spatial+ avoids the bias
problems of the spatial model. This is also demonstrated in a simulation study.
Spatial+ is straight-forward to implement using existing software and, as the
response variable is the same as that of the spatial model, standard model
selection criteria can be used for comparisons. A major advantage of the method
is also that it extends to models with non-Gaussian response distributions.
Finally, while our results are derived in a thin plate spline setting, the
spatial+ methodology transfers easily to other spatial model formulations.

a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of
the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted
to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of
the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that
an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent
contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as
results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk
estimation in order to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the
control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic
spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people
becomes practically impossible, but before the fraction of infected people
reaches the scale where a lock-down becomes unavoidable), this inference of
individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our
approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require
communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such
communication may be encrypted and anonymized and thus compatible with privacy
preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable
to enhance performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in
the currently developed mobile applications.

from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey
and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused
huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the
role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can
fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's
life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's
life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural
disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing).
These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and
other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist
and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our
theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an
online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies
(completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,
enabling us to identify trends that require further explanation and research as

AEGBM3D filtering. The BP technique based on the neural network machine
learning approach continually restrains the output if the input block does not

Exceptional orthogonal polynomials were originally discovered as eigenfunctions

classical orthogonal polynomial sequences to not extend to the XOP sequences.
One such property is the restriction of the zeros to the convex hull of the

processed in \textit{batches} by $m$ parallel servers; the system throughput
critically depends on the batch size and a corresponding sub-additive speedup
function. In practice, throughput optimization relies on numerical searches for
the optimal batch size, a process that can take up to multiple days in existing
commercial systems. In this paper, we model the system in terms of a closed
queueing network; a standard Markovian analysis yields the optimal throughput
in $\omega\left(n^4\right)$ time. Our main contribution is a mean-field model
of the system for the regime where the system size is large. We show that the
mean-field model has a unique, globally attractive stationary point which can
be found in closed form and which characterizes the asymptotic throughput of
the system as a function of the batch size. Using this expression we find the
\textit{asymptotically} optimal throughput in $O(1)$ time. Numerical settings
from a large commercial system reveal that this asymptotic optimum is accurate
in practical finite regimes.

overcome some of the practical drawbacks of our method for non-linear gender

the compact matrix LSTM to compress noisy data near perfectly, making the

carbon-bearing molecules in protoplanetary discs will result in systematic
radial variations in the C/O ratios in the gas and ice. This variation is
proposed as a tracer of the formation location of gas-giant planets. However,
disc chemistry can affect the C/O ratios in the gas and ice, thus potentially
erasing the chemical fingerprint of snowlines in gas-giant atmospheres. We
calculate the molecular composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres using elemental
abundances extracted from a chemical kinetics model of a disc midplane where we
have varied the initial abundances and ionization rates. The models predict a
wider diversity of possible atmospheres than those predicted using elemental
ratios from snowlines only. As found in previous work, as the C/O ratio exceeds
the solar value, the mixing ratio of CH$_{4}$ increases in the lower
atmosphere, and those of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and HCN increase mainly in the upper
atmosphere. The mixing ratio of H$_{2}$O correspondingly decreases. We find
that hot Jupiters with C/O$>1$ can only form between the CO$_{2}$ and CH$_{4}$
snowlines. Moreover, they can only form in a disc which has fully inherited
interstellar abundances, and where negligible chemistry has occurred. Hence,
carbon-rich planets are likely rare, unless efficient transport of
hydrocarbon-rich ices via pebble drift to within the CH$_{4}$ snowline is a
common phenomenon. We predict combinations of C/O ratios and elemental
abundances that can constrain gas-giant planet formation locations relative to
snowline positions, and that can provide insight into the disc chemical

preservation when a model is used on data of interest (target data) which

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is an interesting research direction for
this challenge as it avoids a costly annotation of the target data.
Pseudo-labeling methods achieve the best results in UDA-based re-ID.
Surprisingly, labeled source data are discarded after this initialization step.
However, we believe that pseudo-labeling could further leverage the labeled
source data in order to improve the post-initialization training steps. In
order to improve robustness against erroneous pseudo-labels, we advocate the
exploitation of both labeled source data and pseudo-labeled target data during
all training iterations. To support our guideline, we introduce a framework
which relies on a two-branch architecture optimizing classification and triplet
loss based metric learning in source and target domains, respectively, in order
to allow \emph{adaptability to the target domain} while ensuring
\emph{robustness to noisy pseudo-labels}. Indeed, shared low and mid-level
parameters benefit from the source classification and triplet loss signal while
high-level parameters of the target branch learn domain-specific features. Our
method is simple enough to be easily combined with existing pseudo-labeling UDA
approaches. We show experimentally that it is efficient and improves
performance when the base method has no mechanism to deal with pseudo-label

and remarkable progress has been achieved by searching for semantic regions and
exploiting label dependencies. However, current works utilize RNN/LSTM to
implicitly capture sequential region/label dependencies, which cannot fully
explore mutual interactions among the semantic regions/labels and do not
explicitly integrate label co-occurrences. In addition, these works require
large amounts of training samples for each category, and they are unable to
generalize to novel categories with limited samples. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge-guided graph routing (KGGR) framework, which unifies
prior knowledge of statistical label correlations with deep neural networks.
The framework exploits prior knowledge to guide adaptive information
propagation among different categories to facilitate multi-label analysis and
reduce the dependency of training samples. Specifically, it first builds a
structured knowledge graph to correlate different labels based on statistical
label co-occurrence. Then, it introduces the label semantics to guide learning
semantic-specific features to initialize the graph, and it exploits a graph
propagation network to explore graph node interactions, enabling learning
contextualized image feature representations. Moreover, we initialize each
graph node with the classifier weights for the corresponding label and apply
another propagation network to transfer node messages through the graph. In
this way, it can facilitate exploiting the information of correlated labels to
help train better classifiers. We conduct extensive experiments on the
traditional multi-label image recognition (MLR) and multi-label few-shot

optimal randomization mechanism, i.e., the distribution and its parameters, for
a given utility metric. Existing works have identified the optimal
distributions in some special cases, while leaving all other utility metrics
(e.g., usefulness and graph distance) as open problems. Since existing works
mostly rely on manual analysis to examine the search space of all
distributions, it would be an expensive process to repeat such efforts for each
utility metric. To address such deficiency, we propose a novel approach that
can automatically optimize different utility metrics found in diverse
applications under a common framework. Our key idea that, by regarding the
variance of the injected noise itself as a random variable, a two-fold
distribution may approximately cover the search space of all distributions.
Therefore, we can automatically find distributions in this search space to
optimize different utility metrics in a similar manner, simply by optimizing
the parameters of the two-fold distribution. Specifically, we define a
universal framework, namely, randomizing the randomization mechanism of
differential privacy (R$^2$DP), and we formally analyze its privacy and
utility. Our experiments show that R$^2$DP can provide better results than the
baseline distribution (Laplace) for several utility metrics with no known
optimal distributions, whereas our results asymptotically approach to the
optimality for utility metrics having known optimal distributions. As a side
benefit, the added degree of freedom introduced by the two-fold distribution
allows R$^2$DP to accommodate the preferences of both data owners and
recipients.

challenge due to the low reactivity of Ir at low temperatures and the
vaporization of volatile gas species such as IrO3(g) and IrO2(g) at high
temperatures and high oxygen partial pressures. To address this challenge, we
combine thermodynamic analysis of the Pr-Ir-O2 system with experimental results
from the conventional physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique of
co-sputtering. Our results indicate that only high growth temperatures yield
films with crystallinity sufficient for utilizing and tailoring the desired
topological electronic properties. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that
high deposition temperatures and high partial pressures of gas species O2(g)
and IrO3(g), are required to stabilize Pr2Ir2O7. We further find that the gas
species partial pressure requirements are beyond that achievable by any
conventional PVD technique. We experimentally show that conventional PVD growth
parameters produce exclusively Pr3IrO7, which conclusion we reproduce with
theoretical calculations. Our findings provide solid evidence that in situ
synthesis of Pr2Ir2O7 thin films is fettered by the inability to grow with
oxygen partial pressure on the order of 10 Torr, a limitation inherent to the
PVD process. Thus, we suggest high-pressure techniques, in particular chemical
vapor deposition (CVD), as a route to synthesis of Pr2Ir2O7, as this can
support thin film deposition under the high pressure needed for in situ
stabilization of Pr2Ir2O7.

show that the average returns of strategies are strongly density dependent,
i.e. they depend on the wealth invested in each strategy at any given time. In
the absence of noise the market would slowly evolve toward an efficient
equilibrium, but the statistical uncertainty in profitability (which is
adjusted to match real markets) makes this noisy and uncertain. Even in the
long term, the market spends extended periods of time away from perfect
efficiency. We show how core concepts from ecology, such as the community

the market ecology explain how market inefficiencies spontaneously occur and

transistors (TeraFETs) fed with femtosecond and picosecond pulses. Varying the
pulse width (tpw) from 10-15 s to 10-10 s under a constant input power
condition revealed two distinctive pulse detection modes. In the short pulse
mode (tpw << L/s, where L is the gated channel length, s is the plasma
velocity), the source-to-drain voltage response is a sharp pulse oscillatory
decay preceded by a delay time on the order of L/s. The plasma wave travels
along the channel like the shallow water wave with a relatively narrow wave
package. In the long pulse mode (tpw > L/s), the response profile has two
oscillatory decay processes and the propagation of plasma wave is analogues to
oscillating rod with one side fixed. The ultimate response time at the long
pulse mode is significantly higher than that under the short pulse conditions.
The detection conditions under the long pulse mode are close to the step
response condition, and the response time conforms well to the analytical
theory for the step function response. The simulated waveform agrees well with
the measured pulse response. Our results show that the measurements of the
pulse response enable the material parameter extraction from the pulse response
data (including the effective mass, kinematic viscosity and momentum relaxation
time).

rigid if it is far(in terms of Hamming distance) from any matrix of low rank.
Although we know rigid matrices exist, obtaining explicit constructions of
rigid matrices have remained a long-standing open question. This decade has
seen tremendous progress towards understanding matrix rigidity. In the past,
several matrices such as Hadamard matrices and Fourier matrices were
conjectured to be rigid. Very recently, many of these matrices were shown to
have low rigidity. Further, several explicit constructions of rigid matrices in
classes such as $E$ and $P^{NP}$ were obtained recently. Among other things,
matrix rigidity has found striking connections to areas as disparate as
communication complexity, data structure lower bounds and error-correcting
codes. In this survey, we present a selected set of results that highlight
recent progress on matrix rigidity and its remarkable connections to other

is Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)-attack. The APT attacker can achieve his
hostile goals by obtaining information and gaining financial benefits regarding
the infrastructure of a network. One of the solutions to detect a secret APT
attack is using network traffic. Due to the nature of the APT attack in terms
of being on the network for a long time and the fact that the network may crash
because of high traffic, it is difficult to detect this type of attack. Hence,
in this study, machine learning methods such as C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian
network and deep neural network are used for timely detection and
classification of APT-attacks on the NSL-KDD dataset. Moreover, 10-fold cross
validation method is used to experiment these models. As a result, the accuracy
(ACC) of the C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian network and 6-layer deep learning
models is obtained as 95.64%, 88.37% and 98.85%, respectively, and also, in
terms of the important criterion of the false positive rate (FPR), the FPR
value for the C5.0 decision tree, Bayesian network and 6-layer deep learning
models is obtained as 2.56, 10.47 and 1.13, respectively. Other criterions such
as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false negative rate and F-measure are
also investigated for the models, and the experimental results show that the
deep learning model with automatic multi-layered extraction of features has the
best performance for timely detection of an APT-attack comparing to other
classification models.

electrostatics in molecular solvation. Its numerical solution using a boundary
integral formulation requires a mesh on the molecular surface only, yielding
accurate representations of the solute, which is usually a complicated
geometry. Here, we utilize adjoint-based analyses to form two goal-oriented
error estimates that allows us to determine the contribution of each
discretization element (panel) to the numerical error in the solvation free
energy. This information is useful to identify high-error panels to then refine
them adaptively to find optimal surface meshes. We present results for spheres
and real molecular geometries, and see that elements with large error tend to
be in regions where there is a high electrostatic potential. We also find that
even though both estimates predict different total errors, they have similar
performance as part of an adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Our test cases
suggest that the adaptive mesh refinement scheme is very effective, as we are
able to reduce the error one order of magnitude by increasing the mesh size
less than 20\%. This result sets the basis towards efficient automatic mesh
refinement schemes that produce optimal meshes for solvation energy
calculations.

MLE training remains the de facto approach for autoregressive NMT because of
its computational efficiency and stability. Despite this mismatch between the
training objective and task measure, we notice that the samples drawn from an
MLE-based trained NMT support the desired distribution -- there are samples
with much higher BLEU score comparing to the beam decoding output. To benefit
from this observation, we train an energy-based model to mimic the behavior of
the task measure (i.e., the energy-based model assigns lower energy to samples
with higher BLEU score), which is resulted in a re-ranking algorithm based on
the samples drawn from NMT: energy-based re-ranking (EBR). We use both marginal
energy models (over target sentence) and joint energy models (over both source

investigated over a comprehensive range of the Reynolds numbers ($1\leq Re \leq
10000$) and Atwood numbers $(0.05 \leq A \leq 0.7)$ using an improved lattice
Boltzmann multiphase method. We first reported that the instability with a
moderately high Atwood number of 0.7 undergoes a sequence of distinguishing
stages at high Reynolds numbers, named as the linear growth, saturated velocity
growth, reacceleration and chaotic development stages. The spike and bubble at
the secondary stage evolve with the constant velocities and their values agree
well with the potential flow theory. Owing to the increasing strengths of the
vortices, the spike and bubble are accelerated with velocities exceeding than
the asymptotic values and the evolution of the instability enters into the
reacceleration stage. Lastly, the curves for the spike and bubble velocities
have some fluctuations at the chaotic stage and also a complex interfacial
structure with large topological change is observed, while it still preserves
the symmetry property. To determine the nature of the late-time growth, we also
calculated the spike and bubble growth rates by using five popular statistical
methods and two comparative techniques are recommended, resulting in the spike
and bubble growth rates of about 0.13 and 0.022, respectively. When the
Reynolds number is gradually reduced, some later stages cannot be reached
successively and the structure of the evolutional interface becomes relatively
smooth. Moreover, we observe that the spike growth rate shows an overall
increase with the Atwood number, while it has little influence on the bubble
growth rate being approximately 0.0215.
