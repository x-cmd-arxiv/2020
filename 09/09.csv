minimum speed so-called Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR) with Lorentz
violation and the Gravitational Bose Einstein Condensate (GBEC) as the central
core of a star of gravitational vacuum (gravastar), where one normally
introduces a cosmological constant for representing an anti-gravity. This usual
model of gravastar with an equation of state (EOS) for vacuum energy inside the
core will be generalized for many modes of vacuum (dark energy star) in order
to circumvent the embarrassment generated by the horizon singularity as the
final stage of a gravitational collapse. In the place of the problem of a
singularity of an event horizon, we introduce a phase transition between
gravity and anti-gravity before reaching the Schwarzschild (divergent) radius
$R_S$ for a given coexistence radius $R_{coexistence}$ slightly larger than
$R_S$ and slightly smaller than the core radius $R_{core}$ of GBEC, where the
metric of the repulsive sector (core of GBEC) would diverge for $r=R_{core}$,
so that for such a given radius of phase coexistence $R_S<R_{coexistence}
<R_{core}$, both divergences at $R_S$ of Schwarzschild metric and at $R_{core}$
of the repulsive core are eliminated, thus preventing the formation of the
event horizon. So the causal structure of SSR helps us to elucidate such puzzle
of singularity of event horizon by also providing a quantum interpretation for
GBEC and thus by explaining the origin of a strong anisotropy due to the
minimum speed that leads to the phase transition gravity/anti-gravity during
the collapse of the star. Furthermore, due to the absence of an event horizon
of black hole (BH) where any signal cannot propagate, the new collapsed
structure presents a signal propagation in its region of coexistence of phases
where the coexistence metric does not diverge.

and linewidth of each disordered microcavity exactly, comparing the results
with the resonant-state expansion for a large basis set and within its first
and second orders of perturbation theory. We show that random shifts of
interfaces cause a growth of the inhomogeneous broadening of the fundamental
mode that is proportional to the magnitude of disorder. Simultaneously, the
quality factor of the microcavity decreases inversely proportional to the
square of the magnitude of disorder. We also find that first-order perturbation
theory works very accurately up to a reasonably large disorder magnitude,
especially for calculating the resonance energy, which allows us to derive
qualitatively the scaling of the microcavity properties with disorder strength.

problems (JSSP). But RL for JSSP is usually done using a vectorized
representation of machine features as the state space. It has three major
problems: (1) the relationship between the machine units and the job sequence
is not fully captured, (2) exponential increase in the size of the state space
with increasing machines/jobs, and (3) the generalization of the agent to
unseen scenarios. We present a novel framework - GraSP-RL, GRAph neural
network-based Scheduler for Production planning problems using Reinforcement
Learning. It represents JSSP as a graph and trains the RL agent using features
extracted using a graph neural network (GNN). While the graph is itself in the
non-euclidean space, the features extracted using the GNNs provide a rich
encoding of the current production state in the euclidean space, which is then
used by the RL agent to select the next job. Further, we cast the scheduling
problem as a decentralized optimization problem in which the learning agent is
assigned to all the production units and the agent learns asynchronously from
the data collected on all the production units. The GraSP-RL is then applied to
a complex injection molding production environment with 30 jobs and 4 machines.
The task is to minimize the makespan of the production plan. The schedule
planned by GraSP-RL is then compared and analyzed with a priority dispatch rule
algorithm like first-in-first-out (FIFO) and metaheuristics like tabu search
(TS) and genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed GraSP-RL outperforms the FIFO,
TS, and GA for the trained task of planning 30 jobs in JSSP. We further test
the generalization capability of the trained agent on two different problem
classes: Open shop system (OSS) and Reactive JSSP (RJSSP) where our method
produces results better than FIFO and comparable results to TS and GA.

elucidate the role of nitrogen in the crystal growth rates and crystal habits

crystal formation in cirrus clouds, we find that basal and primary prismatic
facets exhibit a layer of premelted ice, with thickness in the subnanometer
range. For partial pressures of 1 bar, well above the expected values in the
troposphere, we find that only small amounts of nitrogen are adsorbed. The
adsorption takes place onto the premelted surface, and hardly any nitrogen
dissolves within the premelting film. The premelting film thickness does not
change either. We quantify the resulting change of the ice/vapor surface
tension to be in the hundredth of mN/m and find that the structure of the
pristine ice surface is not changed in a significant manner. We perform a
trajectory analysis of colliding water molecules, and find that the attachment
rates from direct ballistic collision are very close to unity irrespective of
the nitrogen pressure. Nitrogen is however at sufficient density to deflect a
fraction of trajectories with smaller distance than the mean free path. Our
results show explicitly that the reported differences in growth rates measured
in pure water vapor and a controlled nitrogen atmosphere are not related to a
significant disruption of the ice surface due to nitrogen adsorption. On the
contrary, we show clearly from our trajectory analysis that nitrogen slows down
the crystal growth rates due to collisions between water molecules with bulk
nitrogen gas. This clarifies the long standing controversy of the role of inert
gases on crystal growth rates and demonstrates their influence is solely
related to the diffusion limited flow of water vapor across the gas phase.

technologies such as binary translation, decompilation, emulation,
virtualization, and application migration. Although multicore architectures are
ubiquitous, the state-of-the-art translation tools do not handle concurrency
primitives correctly. Doing so is rather challenging because of the subtle
differences in the concurrency models between architectures.
  In response, we address various aspects of the challenge. First, we develop
correct and efficient translations between the concurrency models of two
mainstream architecture families: x86 and ARM (versions 7 and 8). We develop
direct mappings between x86 and ARMv8 and ARMv7, and fence elimination
algorithms to eliminate redundant fences after direct mapping. Although our
mapping utilizes ARMv8 as an intermediate model for mapping between x86 and
ARMv7, we argue that it should not be used as an intermediate model in a
decompiler because it disallows common compiler transformations.
  Second, we propose and implement a technique for inserting memory fences for
safely migrating programs between different architectures. Our technique checks
robustness against x86 and ARM, and inserts fences upon robustness violations.
Our experiments demonstrate that in most of the programs both our techniques
introduce significantly fewer fences compared to naive schemes for porting
applications across these architectures.

the weight and deformability specific ratios of flexoelectricity of solids are
limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical model of flexoelectricity of
three-dimensional interconnected porous materials. Compared to the solid
materials, porous materials can exhibit flexoelectricity under arbitrary
loading forms due to their complex microstructures, and the weight and
deformability specific flexoelectric output is much higher than that of the
solids. Then, we verify the model by measuring the flexoelectric response of
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The
porous PDMS with 3D micron-scale interconnected structures exhibits two orders
of magnitude higher weight and deformability specific flexoelectric output than
that of the solid truncated pyramid PDMS. The flexoelectric signal is found to
be linearly proportional to the applied strain, the microstructural size and
the frequency. Finally, we apply the theory to a more practical bending sensor,
and demonstrate its stable functioning and accurate response. Our model can be

full posterior distribution is to compute the ratio of two models' normalising
constants, known as the Bayes factor. Often in realistic problems, this
involves the integration of analytically intractable, high-dimensional
distributions, and therefore requires the use of stochastic methods such as
thermodynamic integration (TI). In this paper we apply a variation of the TI
method, referred to as referenced TI, which computes a single model's
normalising constant in an efficient way by using a judiciously chosen
reference density. The advantages of the approach and theoretical
considerations are set out, along with explicit pedagogical 1 and 2D examples.
Benchmarking is presented with comparable methods and we find favourable

recently been discussed for different scenarios, but observational support is
generally missing. In this Letter, we test applicability of the `Wind-Driven
model' (Uno & Maeda 2020) to a sample of UV/Optical TDEs. With the model, we
aim to derive the physical properties of the Optical/UV TDEs, such as mass-loss
rates and characteristic radii. The model assumes optically thick continuous
outflows like stellar winds, and one key question is how the wind-launched
radius is connected to physical processes in TDEs. As one possibility, through
a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black-hole
masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, we propose
that the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius ($R_{\rm SI}$)
where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects; we show that
the escape velocities at $R_{\rm SI}$ are roughly consistent with the wind
velocities. By applying the model to a sample of Optical/UV TDE candidates, we
find that explosive mass ejections ($\gtrsim 10 ~M_{\odot}{\rm yr^{-1}}$) from
$R_{\rm SI}$ ($\sim 10^{14}{\rm ~cm}$) can explain the observed properties of
TDEs around peak luminosity. We also apply the same framework to a peculiar
transient, AT2018cow. The model suggests that AT2018cow is likely a TDE induced
by an intermediate-mass black hole ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{4}~M_{\odot}$).

likely to be caught by the advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors in their O3 run. The
O1 and O2 observation run data, however, strongly favor a cutoff of the BHMF
much sharper than the exponential one. In this work we show that a power-law

quite a few LIMBH events can be detected in the O3 observation run of advanced

subgoals in episodic reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. ISA interleaves
reinforcement learning with the induction of a subgoal automaton, an automaton
whose edges are labeled by the task's subgoals expressed as propositional logic
formulas over a set of high-level events. A subgoal automaton also consists of
two special states: a state indicating the successful completion of the task,
and a state indicating that the task has finished without succeeding. A
state-of-the-art inductive logic programming system is used to learn a subgoal
automaton that covers the traces of high-level events observed by the RL agent.
When the currently exploited automaton does not correctly recognize a trace,
the automaton learner induces a new automaton that covers that trace. The
interleaving process guarantees the induction of automata with the minimum
number of states, and applies a symmetry breaking mechanism to shrink the
search space whilst remaining complete. We evaluate ISA in several gridworld
and continuous state space problems using different RL algorithms that leverage
the automaton structures. We provide an in-depth empirical analysis of the
automaton learning performance in terms of the traces, the symmetry breaking
and specific restrictions imposed on the final learnable automaton. For each
class of RL problem, we show that the learned automata can be successfully
exploited to learn policies that reach the goal, achieving an average reward
comparable to the case where automata are not learned but handcrafted and given
beforehand.

in which macroscopicity has been approached experimentally and are readily
turned into LG tests for a single dichotomic variable Q. Applying this approach
to the double-slit experiment in which a non-invasive measurement at the slits
is included, we exhibit LG violations. We find that these violations are always
accompanied by destructive interference. The converse is not true in general
and we find that there are non-trivial regimes in which there is destructive
interference but the two-time LG inequalities are satisfied which implies that
it is in fact often possible to assign (indirectly determined) probabilities
for the interferometer paths. Similar features have been observed in recent
work involving a LG analysis of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and we compare
with those results. We extend the analysis to the triple-slit experiment again
finding LG violations, and we also exhibit examples of some surprising
relationships between LG inequalities and NSIT conditions that do not exist for
dichotomic variables. For the simple harmonic oscillator, we find an
analytically tractable example showing a two-time LG violation with a gaussian

networks of spiking neurons, but how this is done remains elusive. While
nonlinear computations can be implemented successfully in spiking neural
networks, this requires supervised training and the resulting connectivity can
be hard to interpret. In contrast, the required connectivity for any
computation in the form of a linear dynamical system can be directly derived
and understood with the spike coding network (SCN) framework. These networks
also have biologically realistic activity patterns and are highly robust to
cell death. Here we extend the SCN framework to directly implement any
polynomial dynamical system, without the need for training. This results in
networks requiring a mix of synapse types (fast, slow, and multiplicative),
which we term multiplicative spike coding networks (mSCNs). Using mSCNs, we
demonstrate how to directly derive the required connectivity for several
nonlinear dynamical systems. We also show how to carry out higher-order
polynomials with coupled networks that use only pair-wise multiplicative
synapses, and provide expected numbers of connections for each synapse type.
Overall, our work demonstrates a novel method for implementing nonlinear
computations in spiking neural networks, while keeping the attractive features
of standard SCNs (robustness, realistic activity patterns, and interpretable
connectivity). Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of our approach,
and how the high accuracy and robustness of the approach may be of interest for
neuromorphic computing.

and outflow kinematics. A dark lane of obscuring material is seen in silhouette
in several emission lines and in model-subtracted ALMA mm continuum dust
residuals near the position of T Tau Sa+Sb, revealing the attenuating
circumbinary ring around T Tau S. The flux variability of T Tau S is linked in
part to the binary orbit; T Tau Sb brightens near orbital apastron as it
emerges from behind circumbinary material. Outflow diagnostics confirm that T
Tau N powers the blue-shifted western outflow, and the T Tau S binary drives
the northwest-southeastern flow. Analysis of the southern outflow shows
periodic arcs ejected from the T Tau system. Correlation of these arc locations
and tangential kinematics with the orbit timing suggests that launch of the
last four southern outflow ejections is contemporaneous with, and perhaps
triggered by, the T Tau Sa+Sb binary periastron passage. We present a geometry
of the T Tau triple that has the southern components foreground to T Tau N,
obscured by a circumbinary ring, with mis-aligned disks and interacting
outflows. Particularly, a wind from T Tauri Sa that is perpendicular to its
circumstellar disk might interact with the circumbinary material, which may
explain conflicting high contrast measurements of the system outflows in the
literature. T Tauri is an important laboratory to understand early dynamical
processes in young multiple systems. We discuss the historical and future
characteristics of the system in this context.

characteristic scale of the ensemble is estimated by using only members that
satisfy the Einstein field equations. The averaged characteristic scale is
compatible with the Planck length when considering an ensemble of solutions to
the Einstein field equations with an effective cosmological constant. The
multiverse ensemble is split in Planck-seed universes with vacuum energy
density of order one; thus, $ \tilde{\Lambda}\approx 8\pi$ in Planck units and
$a$-derivable universes. For~$a$-derivable universe with a characteristic scale
of the order of the observed Universe $a\approx 8\times10^{60}$, the
cosmological constant $\Lambda=\tilde{\Lambda}/a^{2}$ is in the range
$10^{-121}$--$10^{-122}$, which is close in magnitude to the observed value
$10^{-123}$. We point out that the smallness of $\Lambda$ can be viewed to be
natural if its value is associated with the entropy of the Universe. This
approach to the CCP reconciles the Planck-scale huge vacuum energy--density
predicted by QFT considerations, as valid for Planck-seed universes, with the
observed small value of the cosmological constant as relevant to an
$a$-derivable universe as~observed.

the complete surface of the liver, given a partial point cloud of the organ
obtained during the surgical laparoscopic procedure. We introduce a new data
augmentation technique that randomly perturbs shapes in their frequency domain
to compensate the limited size of our dataset. The core of our method is a
variational autoencoder (VAE) that is trained to learn a latent space for
complete shapes of the liver. At inference time, the generative part of the
model is embedded in an optimisation procedure where the latent representation
is iteratively updated to generate a model that matches the intraoperative
partial point cloud. The effect of this optimisation is a progressive non-rigid
deformation of the initially generated shape. Our method is qualitatively
evaluated on real data and quantitatively evaluated on synthetic data. We
compared with a state-of-the-art rigid registration algorithm, that our method
outperformed in visible areas.

conformal dimension $2-\Delta$. The Dirac conformal primary wavefunctions are
delta function normalizable with respect to the Dirac inner product provided
they lie on the principal series with conformal dimension $\Delta = 1+i\lambda$

unique accreted population, part of the boxy/peanut-shaped (B/P) bulge or a

photometry. We also use Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motions to infer the
Galactic positions and velocities along with orbital properties for 523 bulge

sample has a > 50\% probability of being bound to the bulge, and half are halo
interlopers. We also see that the occurrence rate of halo interlopers increases
steadily with decreasing metallicity across the full range of our sample (-3 <
[Fe/H] < 0.5). Our examination of the kinematics of the confined compared to
the unbound stars indicates the metal-poor bulge ([Fe/H] < -1 dex) comprises at
least two populations; those confined to the boxy/peanut bulge and halo stars
passing through the inner galaxy. We conclude that an orbital analysis
approach, as we have employed, is important to uncover and understand the
composite nature of the metal-poor stars in the inner region.

become the backbone of the physics community to probe the chaotic behaviour and
random quantum fluctuations of quantum fields. This paper is devoted to the
study of out-of-equilibrium aspects and quantum chaos appearing in the universe
from the paradigm of two well known bouncing cosmological solutions viz.
$Cosine~ hyperbolic$ and $Exponential$ models of scale factors. Besides
$circuit~ complexity$, we use the $Out-of-Time~ Ordered~ correlation~ (OTOC)$
functions for probing the random behaviour of the universe both at early and
the late times. In particular, we use the techniques of well known two-mode
squeezed state formalism in cosmological perturbation theory as a key
ingredient for the purpose of our computation. To give an appropriate
theoretical interpretation that is consistent with the observational
perspective we use the scale factor and the number of e-foldings as a dynamical
variable instead of conformal time for this computation. From this study, we
found that the period of post bounce is the most interesting one. Though it may
not be immediately visible, but an exponential rise can be seen in the
$complexity$ once the post bounce feature is extrapolated to the present time
scales. We also find within the very small acceptable error range a universal
connecting relation between Complexity computed from two different kinds of
cost functionals-$linearly~ weighted$ and $geodesic~ weighted$ with the OTOC.
Furthermore, from the $complexity$ computation obtained from both the
cosmological models and also using the well known MSS bound on quantum Lyapunov
exponent, $\lambda\leq 2\pi/\beta$ for the saturation of chaos, we estimate the
lower bound on the equilibrium temperature of our universe at late time scale.

to many astrophysical phenomena. The jets produced by gamma-ray bursts and
tidal disruption events are accompanied by the accretion of material onto a
black hole or neutron star, with the accretion rate exceeding the Eddington
limit of the compact object by orders of magnitude. In such systems, radiation
dominates the energy-momentum budget of the outflow, and the dynamical
evolution of the jet is governed by the equations of radiation hydrodynamics.
Here we show that there are analytic solutions to the equations of radiation
hydrodynamics in the viscous (i.e., diffusive) regime that describe structured,
relativistic jets, which consist of a fast-moving, highly relativistic core
surrounded by a slower-moving, less relativistic sheath. In these solutions,
the slower-moving, outer sheath contains most of the mass, and the jet
structure is mediated by local anisotropies in the radiation field. We show
that, depending on the pressure and density profile of the ambient medium, the
angular profile of the jet Lorentz factor is Gaussian or falls off even more
steeply with angle. These solutions have implications for the nature of jet
production and evolution in hyperaccreting systems, and demonstrate that such
jets -- and the corresponding jet structure -- can be sustained entirely by
radiative processes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the
context of jetted tidal disruption events and short and long gamma-ray bursts.

key aspects of the star- and the planet-formation processes. During the warm-up
phase the presence of young protostellar objects induces molecules to evaporate
from the dust surface into the gas phase, enhancing its chemical complexity.
Similarly, in circumstellar disks, the position of the so-called snow-lines is
determined by evaporation, with important consequences for the formation of
planets. The amount of molecules that are desorbed depends on the interaction
between the species and the grain surface, which is controlled by the binding
energy. Recent theoretical and experimental works point towards a distribution
of values for this parameter instead of the single value often employed in
astrochemical models.We present here a new ""multi-binding energy"" framework, to
assess the effects that a distribution of binding energies has on the amount of

but the efficiency with which they couple to the interstellar medium (ISM)
depends strongly on how effectively early, pre-SN feedback clears dense gas
from star-forming regions. There are observational constraints on the
magnitudes and timescales of early stellar feedback in low ISM pressure
environments, yet no such constraints exist for more cosmologically typical
high ISM pressure environments. In this paper, we determine the mechanisms
dominating the expansion of HII regions as a function of size-scale and
evolutionary time within the high-pressure ($P/k_\rm{B}$~$10^{7-8}$K cm$^{-3}$)
environment in the inner 100pc of the Milky Way. We calculate the thermal
pressure from the warm ionised ($P_\rm{HII}$; 10$^{4}$K) gas, direct radiation
pressure ($P_\rm{dir}$), and dust processed radiation pressure ($P_\rm{IR}$).
We find that (1) $P_\rm{dir}$ dominates the expansion on small scales and at
early times (0.01-0.1pc; $<$0.1Myr); (2) the expansion is driven by
$P_\rm{HII}$ on large scales at later evolutionary stages ($>0.1$pc; $>1$Myr);
(3) during the first ~1Myr of growth, but not thereafter, either $P_{\rm IR}$
or stellar wind pressure likely make a comparable contribution. Despite the
high confining pressure of the environment, natal star-forming gas is
efficiently cleared to radii of several pc within ~2Myr, i.e. before the first
SNe explode. This `pre-processing' means that subsequent SNe will explode into
low density gas, so their energy and momentum will efficiently couple to the
ISM. We find the HII regions expand to a radius of 3pc, at which point they
have internal pressures equal with the surrounding external pressure. A
comparison with HII regions in lower pressure environments shows that the
maximum size of all HII regions is set by pressure equilibrium with the ambient
ISM.

a sample of massive and compact merger remnant galaxies hosting high-velocity

redshift ($z \sim 0.6$). From their mid-infrared emission and compact
morphologies, these galaxies are estimated to have exceptionally large star
formation rate (SFR) surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR} \sim 10^{3}$
$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$), approaching the Eddington limit for
radiation pressure on dust grains. This suggests that star formation feedback
may be driving the observed outflows. However, these SFR estimates suffer from
significant uncertainties. We therefore sought an independent tracer of star
formation to probe the compact starburst activity in these systems. In this
paper, we present SFR estimates calculated using 1.5 GHz continuum Jansky Very
Large Array observations for 19 of these galaxies. We also present updated
infrared (IR) SFRs calculated from WISE survey data. We estimate SFRs from the
IR to be larger than those from the radio for 16 out of 19 galaxies by a median
factor of 2.5. We find that this deviation is maximized for the most compact
galaxies hosting the youngest stellar populations, suggesting that compact
starbursts deviate from the IR-radio correlation. We suggest that this
deviation stems either from free-free absorption of synchrotron emission, a
difference in the timescale over which each indicator traces star formation, or
exceptionally hot IR-emitting dust in these ultra-dense galaxies.

the longer timescale variability. Here we fit our reltrans model simultaneously
to the time-averaged energy spectrum and the lag-energy spectra of the Seyfert

hard lags as fluctuations in the slope and strength of the illuminating

merger channel, but the majority focuses on stellar mass black holes (BHs)
orbiting in the prograde direction. Little work has been done to examine the
impact of retrograde orbiters (ROs) on the formation and mergers of BBHs in AGN
disks. Quantifying the retrograde contribution is important, since roughly half
of all orbiters should initially be on retrograde orbits when the disk forms.
We perform an analytic calculation of the evolution of ROs in an AGN disk.
Because this evolution could cause the orbits of ROs to cross those of prograde
BBHs, we derive the collision rate between a given RO and a given BBH orbiting
in the prograde direction. In the examples given here, ROs in the inner region
of the disk experience a rapid decrease in the semimajor axis of their orbits
while also becoming highly eccentric in less than a million years. This rapid
orbital evolution could lead to extreme mass ratio inspirals detectable by the
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. The collision rates of our example ROs with
prograde BBHs in the migration trap depend strongly on the volume of the inner
radiation-pressure-dominated region which depends on the mass of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH). Rates are lowest for larger mass SMBHs, which
dominate the AGN merger channel, suggesting that merger rates for this channel

the main sources of uncertainty: star formation rate (SFR) density, metallicity
evolution, common envelope, mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow, natal kicks,
core-collapse supernova model and initial mass function. Among binary evolution
processes, uncertainties on common envelope ejection have a major impact: the
local merger rate density of BNSs varies from $\sim{}10^3$ to $\sim{}20$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ if we change the common envelope efficiency parameter from
$\alpha_{\rm CE}=7$ to 0.5, while the local merger rates of BBHs and BHNSs vary
by a factor of $\sim{}2-3$. The BBH merger rate changes by one order of
magnitude, when $1 \sigma$ uncertainties on metallicity evolution are taken
into account. In contrast, the BNS merger rate is almost insensitive to
metallicity. Hence, BNSs are the ideal test bed to put constraints on uncertain
binary evolution processes, such as common envelope and natal kicks. Only
models assuming values of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim{}2$ and moderately low natal
kicks (depending on the ejected mass and the SN mechanism), result in a local
BNS merger rate density within the 90% credible interval inferred from the

comparison between their stellar population properties with the goal of
establishing differences and similarities between them. We make use of
propensity score matching (PSM) to mitigate potential biases between the two

Also, we take advantage of spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting results
from magphys made available by the GAMA collaboration. The analyses are made by
comparing the distributions from the SED fitting directly, as well as
investigating the differences in correlations between their parameters, and
finally by using principal component analysis (PCA). We explore important
differences and similarities between UV weak and upturn galaxies in terms of
several parameters, such as: metallicity, age, specific star formation rate,
time of last burst of star-formation, to mention a few. Notable differences are
those concerning (g-r) colour, metallicity, and time since last burst of
star-formation: UV upturn are redder in the optical, more metallic, and their
last burst of star-formation happened earlier in time. These differences
suggest that UV upturn systems have shorter star-formation histories (i.e. have

galaxy radius (the ""Tully-Fisher relation""; TFR). On the other hand,
ellipticals appear to trace a 2D surface in size-mass-velocity space (the
""Fundamental Plane""; FP). Over the years, a number of studies have attempted to
understand these empirical relations, usually in terms of variations of the
virial theorem for E galaxies and in terms of the scaling relations of dark
matter halos for spirals. We use Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations to show that the scaling relations of both
ellipticals and spirals arise as the result of (i) a tight galaxy mass-dark
halo mass relation and (ii) the self-similar mass profile of cold dark matter
halos. In this interpretation, E and S galaxies of a given stellar mass inhabit
halos of similar masses, and their different scaling laws result from the
varying amounts of dark matter enclosed within their luminous radii. This
scenario suggests a new galaxy distance indicator applicable to galaxies of all

puzzles, such as why the TFR is independent of surface brightness, or what
causes the ""tilt"" in the FP. Our results provide strong support for the
predictions of LCDM in the strongly non-linear regime, as well as guidance for

$\sim$ 5-10 R$_\oplus$ around stars with ages $<100$ Myr. These young planets
are likely to be the progenitors of the ubiquitous super-earths/sub-neptunes,
that are well studied around stars with ages $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr. The formation and
early evolution of super-earths/sub-neptunes are poorly understood. Various
planetary origin scenarios predict a wide range of possible formation
entropies. We show how the formation entropies of young ($\sim$20-60 Myr),
highly irradiated planets can be constrained if their mass, radius and age are
measured. This method works by determining how low-mass a H/He envelope a
planet can retain against mass-loss. This lower bound on the H/He envelope mass
can then be converted into an upper bound on the entropy. If planet mass
measurements with errors $\lesssim 20$\% can be achieved for the discovered
young planets around DS Tuc A and V1298 Tau, then insights into their origins
can be obtained. For these planets, higher measured planet masses would be
consistent with standard core-accretion theory. In contrast, lower planet
masses ($\lesssim 6-7$ M$_\oplus$) would require a ""boil-off"" phase during
protoplanetary disc dispersal to explain.

interaction. We use a sample of 42 SLSN I images obtained with $\textit{HST}$
and measure the number of companion galaxies by counting the objects detected
within a given radius from the host. As a comparison, we used two Monte
Carlo-based methods to estimate the expected average number of companion
objects in the same images, as well as a sample of 32 galaxies that have hosted
long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). About 50% of SLSN I hosts have at least one major
companion (within a flux ratio of 1:4) within 5 kpc. The average number of
major companions per SLSN I host galaxy is $0.70^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$. Our Monte
Carlo comparison methods yield a lower number of companions for random objects
of similar brightness in the same image or for the SLSN host after randomly
redistributing the sources in the same image. The Anderson-Darling test shows
that this difference is statistically significant independent of the redshift
range. The same is true for the projected distance distribution of the
companions. The SLSN I hosts are, thus, found in areas of their images, where
the object number density is greater than average. SLSN I hosts have more
companions than GRB hosts ($0.44^{+0.25}_{-0.13}$ companions per host
distributed over 25% of the hosts) but the difference is not statistically
significant. The difference between their separations is, however, marginally
significant. The dwarf galaxies hosting SLSNe I are often part of interacting
systems. This suggests that SLSNe I progenitors are formed after a recent burst
of star formation. Low metallicity alone cannot explain this tendency.

additionally incorporates the S/N distribution of several resolved filters. The
SED-derived resolved E(B-V)$_{\text{stars}}$, stellar population ages, SFRs,

slopes being unconstrained by the resolved photometry. The results from our

[CII]158um emitting region has an effective radius 1.5 - 2.5 times larger than
the optical one, consistent with recent observations. This [CII] halo in our
simulated galaxy arises as the joint effect of stellar outflows and carbon
photoionization by the galaxy UV field, rather than from the emission of
unresolved nearby satellites. At the typical angular resolution of current
observations (> 0.15"") only merging satellites can be detected; detection of
star-forming regions requires resolutions of < 0.05"". The [CII]-detected
satellite has a 2.5 kpc projected distance from the galaxy disk, whereas the
star-forming regions are embedded in the disk itself (distance < 1 kpc). This
suggests that multi-component systems reported in the literature, which have
separations > 2 kpc, are merging satellites, rather than galactic
substructures. Finally, the star-forming regions found in our mock maps follow
the local L[CII] - SFR_UV relation of galaxy disks, although sampling the
low-luminosity, low-SFR tail of the distribution. We show that future JWST
observations, bridging UV and [CII] datasets, will be exceptionally suited to
characterize galaxy substructures thanks to their exquisite spatial resolution
and sensitivity to both low-metallicity and dust-obscured regions that are
bright at infrared wavelengths.

surrounding a central supermassive black hole. Here we explore the evolution of
stars embedded in these extreme astrophysical environments (AGN stars). Because
AGN disks are much hotter and denser than the interstellar medium, AGN stars
are subject to very different boundary conditions than normal stars. They are
also strongly affected by both mass accretion, which can runaway given the vast
mass of the disk, and mass loss due to super-Eddington winds. Moreover,
chemical mixing plays a critical role in the evolution of these stars by
allowing fresh hydrogen accreted from the disk to mix into their cores. We find
that, depending on the local AGN density and sound speed and the duration of
the AGN phase, AGN stars can rapidly become very massive (M > 100 M$_\odot$).
These stars undergo core-collapse, leave behind compact remnants and contribute
to polluting the disk with heavy elements. We show that the evolution of AGN
stars can have a profound impact on the evolution of AGN metallicities, as well
as the production of gravitational waves sources observed by LIGO-Virgo. We
point to our galactic center as a region well-suited to test some of our

generating and subsequently amplifying strong magnetic fields. While the
magnetic field generation is enhanced and spatially smoothed by the application
of a kilotesla-level seed field, the sign of the generated field does not
always follow the sign of the seed field. One unexpected consequence of the
amplification process is a reversal in the sign of the amplified magnetic field
when, for example, the target outer cross section is changed from square to
circular. Using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that sign
reversal is linked to the stability of the surface magnetic field of opposite
sign from the seed which arises at the target inner surface during laser
irradiation. The stability of the surface magnetic field and consequently the
sign of the final amplified field depends sensitively on the target, laser, and
seed magnetic field conditions, which could be leveraged to make laser-driven
microtube implosions an attractive platform for the study of magnetic fields in
high energy density plasma in regimes where sign reversal either is or is not

technologies even worsened the situation; thus, microprocessors design has
become highly susceptible to reliability concerns. This paper examines
asymmetric aging phenomenon, which is a major reliability concern in advanced

from unequal timing degradation over time and consequently introduce
reliability concerns. So far, most studies approached asymmetric aging from
circuit or physical design viewpoint, but these solutions were quite limited

focused on the following subsystems: execution units, register files and the

  Universal Sentence Encoder",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The novel corona-virus disease (also known as COVID-19) has led to a
pandemic, impacting more than 200 countries across the globe. With its global
impact, COVID-19 has become a major concern of people almost everywhere, and
therefore there are a large number of tweets coming out from every corner of
the world, about COVID-19 related topics. In this work, we try to analyze the
tweets and detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter,
which can enable us to better understand the situation, and devise better
planning. More specifically we propose a model based on the universal sentence
encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal
sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the
similarity of tweets. We then used the sentence similarity and their
embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm to group similar
tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a
text summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the
underlying topics of each cluster. Through experimental results, we show that
our model can detect very informative topics, by processing a large number of
tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the
tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution,
it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any
other context rather than COVID-19. Experimental results show superiority of
our proposed approach to other baselines, including TF-IDF, and latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

behavior of action growth, similar to the case of the normal RN black holes, is

violates the electromagnetic duality. For restoring this duality, we add the
Maxwell boundary term (at order 3-derivative) to the action and discuss the
outcomes of the addition. Also, we have used another method that introduces UV
finite cut off at AdS boundary to evaluate the complexity growth rate of dyonic
black holes with and without $F^4$ corrections. In this method, without adding
a surface term, late time growth rate of complexity exhibits expected behavior.

produce generic captions, leaving out important image details. Furthermore,
these systems may even misrepresent the image in order to produce a simpler
caption consisting of common concepts. In this paper, we first analyze both
modern captioning systems and evaluation metrics through empirical experiments
to quantify these phenomena. We find that modern captioning systems return
higher likelihoods for incorrect distractor sentences compared to ground truth
captions, and that evaluation metrics like SPICE can be 'topped' using simple
captioning systems relying on object detectors. Inspired by these observations,
we design a new metric (SPICE-U) by introducing a notion of uniqueness over the
concepts generated in a caption. We show that SPICE-U is better correlated with
human judgements compared to SPICE, and effectively captures notions of
diversity and descriptiveness. Finally, we also demonstrate a general technique
to improve any existing captioning model -- by using mutual information as a
re-ranking objective during decoding. Empirically, this results in more unique
and informative captions, and improves three different state-of-the-art models
on SPICE-U as well as average score over existing metrics.

metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG), a recently proposed theory that has been shown
to successfully pass the local observational tests and to produce a certain
progress in cosmology. We use HMPG in its well-known scalar-tensor
representation. The latter coincides with general relativity containing, as a
source of gravity, a conformally coupled scalar field $\phi$ and a
self-interaction potential $V(\phi)$. The $\phi$ field can be canonical or
phantom, and accordingly the theory splits into canonical and phantom sectors.
We seek solitonic (stringlike) vacuum solutions of HMPG, that is, completely
regular solutions with Minkowski metric far from the symmetry axis, with a
possible angular deficit. A transition of the theory to the Einstein conformal
frame is used as a tool, and many of the results apply to the general
Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class of scalar-tensor theories as well as $f(R)$
theories of gravity. One of these results is a one-to-one correspondence
between stringlike solutions in the Einstein and Jordan frames if the conformal
factor that connects them is everywhere regular. An algorithm for construction
of stringlike solutions in HMPG and scalar-tensor theories is suggested, and
some examples of such solutions are obtained and discussed.

simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical spectroscopy and broadband photometry
to stellar population models. We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more
massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times. Comparing galaxies
found in massive clusters with those in the field, we find galaxies with
$M_\ast<10^{11.3}$ M$_{\odot}$ in the field have more extended SFHs. From the
SFHs we calculate the mass-weighted ages, and compare age distributions of
galaxies between the two environments, at fixed mass. We constrain the
difference in mass-weighted ages between field and cluster galaxies to
$0.31_{^{-0.33}}^{_{+0.51}}$ Gyr, in the sense that cluster galaxies are older.
We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show
that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without
pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both
the average age difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly
different from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched
population is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall.
Our results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z>1 has been
driven by different physical processes than those at play at z=0.

crucial to better understand the mass loss. The tomographic method, that relies
on the design of spectral masks containing lines forming in given ranges of
optical depths in the stellar atmosphere, is an ideal technique for this
purpose. It is applied to high-resolution spectro-interferometric VLTI/AMBER
observations of the Mira-type AGB star S Ori. First, the interferometric
visibilities are extracted at wavelengths contributing to the tomographic masks
and fitted to those computed from a uniform disk model. This allows the
measurement of the geometrical extent of the atmospheric layer probed by the
corresponding mask. Then, we compare the observed atmospheric extension with
those measured from available 1D pulsation CODEX models and 3D
radiative-hydrodynamics CO5BOLD simulations. We found that while the average
optical depths probed by the tomographic masks in S Ori decrease (with $<\log
\tau_0> = -0.45$, $-1.45$, and $-2.45$ from the innermost to the central and
outermost layers), the angular diameters of these layers increase, from 10.59
$\pm$ 0.09 mas through 11.84 $\pm$ 0.17 mas, up to 14.08 $\pm$ 0.15 mas. A
similar behavior is observed when the tomographic method is applied to 1D and
3D dynamical models. Thus, this study derives, for the first time, a
quantitative relation between optical- and geometrical-depth scales when
applied to the Mira star S Ori, or to 1D and 3D dynamical models. In the
context of Mira-type stars, the knowledge of the link between the optical and
geometrical depths opens the way to derive the shock-wave propagation velocity,
which can not be directly observed in these stars.

mechanism is analogous to the stretching of the vorticity field in turbulence.
Leveraging the non-local nature of turbulence dynamics, we introduce a new
decomposition that isolates the energetic exchange due to local drop-induced
surface effects, from the non-local action of turbulent fluctuations. We
perform direct numerical simulations of single inertial drops in isotropic
turbulence and show that an important contribution to the increments of the
surface energy arises from the non-local stretching of the fluid-fluid
interface by eddies far from the drop surface (outer eddies). We report that
this mechanism is dominant and independent of surface dynamics in a range of

Cooperative solutions with shared resources that address these challenges
become a real option in helping to handle these events. This paper presents an
evaluation of dynamic monitoring and collaborative dissemination supported by
vehicular groups. It aims to analyze the impact of multiple mobile and fixed
events in an urban environment on information propagation, considering barriers
imposed by the events and the environment. Differently from other studies in
the literature, this work takes into account both fixed and mobile events, as
well as simultaneous events. NS3 results show that the evaluated system
monitored at least 87% and 51.5% of the time for mobile and fixed events
respectively, and delivered information over 77% and 50% of the time for those
events, with average delay remains close to 0.3s in most scenarios. The results
also reveal that a more continuous monitoring of the mobile events is highly
dependent on the orientation of the vehicles. The main contribution of this
work consists of the performance analysis of both fixed and mobile simultaneous
events to support studies on how moving events impact on the dissemination and
delivery of real-time data, and thus encouraging the development of new data
dissemination protocols for VANETs.

increased risk of adolescent suicide attempts, while controlling for
socioeconomic and demographic differences. Design: A data-driven analysis using
cross-sectional data. Setting: Communities in the state of Montana from 1999 to
2017. Subjects: Selected 22,447 adolescents of whom 1,631 adolescents attempted
suicide at least once. Measures: Overall 29 variables (predictors) accounting
for psychological behaviors, illegal substances consumption, daily activities
at schools and demographic backgrounds, were considered. Analysis: A library of
machine learning algorithms along with the traditionally-used logistic
regression were used to model and predict suicide attempt risk. Model
performances (goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy) were measured using
accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. Results: The non-parametric
Bayesian tree ensemble model outperformed all other models, with 80.0% accuracy
in goodness-of-fit (F-score:0.802) and 78.2% in predictive accuracy
(F-score:0.785). Key health-behaviors identified include: being sad/hopeless,
followed by safety concerns at school, physical fighting, inhalant usage,
illegal drugs consumption at school, current cigarette usage, and having first
sex at an early age (below 15 years of age). Additionally, the minority groups
(American Indian/Alaska Natives, Hispanics/Latinos), and females are also found
to be highly vulnerable to attempting suicides. Conclusion: Significant
contribution of this work is understanding the key health-behaviors and health
disparities that lead to higher frequency of suicide attempts among
adolescents, while accounting for the non-linearity and complex interactions
among the outcome and the exposure variables.

of photodetection. In an uniformly accelerated reference frame, the detector,
interacting with the field prepared in an arbitrary state of the Rindler Fock
space, is excited only by absorption processes. For the uniformly accelerated
detector prepared in the ground state, we evaluate the transition probability
rate in three important situations. In the first one the field is prepared in

that the latter excitation rates are equal is recovered. Accelerated or
inertial observer interpretations of the measurements performed by the
accelerated detector is presented. Finally, we investigate the behaviour of the
detector in a frame which is inertial in the remote past but in the far future

the analogous quantity for the detector at rest in a non-inertial reference

and verified a clear orbital period variation (OPV) with a cyclic behavior. We
investigated if this variation could be explained by the Applegate mechanism,
the apsidal motion, or the light travel time (LTT) effect. We found that the
Applegate mechanism would hardly explain the OPV with its current theoretical
description. We obtained using different approaches that the apsidal motion is
a less likely explanation than the LTT effect. We showed that the LTT effect
with one circumbinary body is the most likely cause for the OPV, which was
reinforced by the orbital stability of the third body. The LTT best solution
provided an orbital period of ~24 yr for the outer body. Under the assumption
of coplanarity between the external body and the inner binary, we obtained a
Jupiter-like planet around the GK Vir. In this scenario, the planet has one of
the longest orbital periods, with a full observational baseline, discovered so
far. However, as the observational baseline of GK Vir is smaller than twice the
period found in the O-C diagram, the LTT solution must be taken as preliminary.

sparse regression finds at most $k$ predictors for each responsor for linear
approximation, $1\leq k \leq d-1$. The key problem in sparse regression is
subset selection, which usually suffers from high computational cost. Recent
years, many improved approximate methods of subset selection have been
published. However, less attention has been paid on the non-approximate method
of subset selection, which is very necessary for many questions in data
analysis. Here we consider sparse regression from the view of correlation, and
propose the formula of conditional uncorrelation. Then an efficient
non-approximate method of subset selection is proposed in which we do not need
to calculate any coefficients in regression equation for candidate predictors.
By the proposed method, the computational complexity is reduced from
$O(\frac{1}{6}{k^3}+mk^2+mkd)$ to $O(\frac{1}{6}{k^3}+\frac{1}{2}mk^2)$ for
each candidate subset in sparse regression. Because the dimension $d$ is
generally the number of observations or experiments and large enough, the

$O(\log n)$ in time $O(\log n)$ starting from an arbitrary weakly connected

messages to nodes they know the identifier of, and new connections can be
established by sending node identifiers. If the initial network's graph is
weakly connected and has constant degree, then our algorithm constructs the
desired topology with each node sending and receiving only $O(\log n)$ messages
in each round in time $O(\log n)$, w.h.p., which beats the currently best
$O(\log^{3/2} n)$ time algorithm of [G\""otte et al., SIROCCO'19]. Since the
problem cannot be solved faster than by using pointer jumping for $O(\log n)$
rounds (which would even require each node to communicate $\Omega(n)$ bits),
our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We achieve this speedup by using short
random walks to repeatedly establish random connections between the nodes that
quickly reduce the conductance of the graph using an observation of [Kwok and
Lau, APPROX'14]. Additionally, we show how our algorithm can be used to
efficiently solve graph problems in \emph{hybrid networks} [Augustine et al.,
SODA'20]. Motivated by the idea that nodes possess two different modes of
communication, we assume that communication of the \emph{initial} edges is
unrestricted, whereas only polylogarithmically many messages can be
communicated over edges that have been established throughout an algorithm's
execution. For an (undirected) graph $G$ with arbitrary degree, we show how to
compute connected components, a spanning tree, and biconnected components in
time $O(\log n)$, w.h.p. Furthermore, we show how to compute an MIS in time
$O(\log d + \log \log n)$, w.h.p., where $d$ is the initial degree of $G$.

gestures into English speech by tracking the finger's orientation, gestures and
hand motion. It uses hardware sensors like Flex, Accelerometer and gyroscope
and intelligent software to capture and translate the gestures into speech.
This paper explains the translation of both Alphabet and Word gestures. New
approaches and algorithms are proposed and implemented to address
hardware-dependent issues in existing glove based designs. The whole device is
designed to be modular with distributed processing units to encourage modular
enhancement, reducing complexity, and interrelation between subsystems.Decision
Trees are used in gesture recognition and error correction. We hope that the

Silicon Dating targets devices with no known-new record or purpose-built

asymmetry imprinted by software reveals device use. Using empirical results

process upper bounds the non-predictive information, which the associated
system encodes about its environment. Thus, emergent information processing
capabilities can be understood from the perspective of a pressure towards high
thermodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the second law of thermodynamics
plays a crucial role in the emergence of complex, self-organising dissipative
structures. Such structures are thermodynamically favoured, because they can
dissipate free energy reservoirs, which would not be accessible otherwise.
Thereby, they allow a closed system to move from one meta-stable state to
another meta-stable state of higher entropy. This paper will argue, that these
two views are not contradictory, but that their combination allows to
understand the transition from simple self-organising dissipative structures to
complex information processing systems. If the efficiency required by a
dissipative structure to harvest enough work from the channeled flow of free
energy to maintain its own structure is high, there is a drive for this system
to be predictive. Still, the existence of this dissipative system is
thermodynamically favoured, compared to a situation without any dissipative
structure. Due to the emergence of a hierarchy of dissipative systems, which by
themselves are non-equilibrium structures that can be dissipated, such a drive
develops naturally, as one ascends in this hierarchy further and further away

existing approaches allow for the joint segmentation of normal tissue and brain

fact that annotated datasets typically address only one specific task and rely
on task-specific imaging protocols including a task-specific set of imaging
modalities. In this work, we propose a novel approach to build a joint tissue
and lesion segmentation model from aggregated task-specific hetero-modal
domain-shifted and partially-annotated datasets. Starting from a variational
formulation of the joint problem, we show how the expected risk can be
decomposed and optimised empirically. We exploit an upper bound of the risk to
deal with heterogeneous imaging modalities across datasets. To deal with
potential domain shift, we integrated and tested three conventional techniques
based on data augmentation, adversarial learning and pseudo-healthy generation.
For each individual task, our joint approach reaches comparable performance to
task-specific and fully-supervised models. The proposed framework is assessed
on two different types of brain lesions: White matter lesions and gliomas. In

parameters. In a slow-fading environment, we show that with only random
rotations at the IRS, the proposed scheme can capitalize on the multi-user
(MU)-diversity effect to approach the performance of coherent beamforming as
the number of users grows large. Next we study the sum-rate scaling of
IRS-assisted OBF in the correlated Rayleigh fast fading environment under a
deterministic beamforming scheme that results in a considerable sum-rate
improvement.

Much attention has been devoted to methods for protecting individual privacy

method of multiplier (GADMM) algorithm for minimizing a linearly constrained
separable nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth optimization problem. The GADMM
generalizes the classical ADMM by including proximal terms in each primal
updates and an over-relaxation parameter in the dual update. We prove that any
limit point of the sequence is a critical point. By introducing a modified
augmented Lagrangian we show that the sequence generated by the GADMM is
bounded and the norm of the difference of consecutive terms approaches to zero.
Under the powerful {K\L} properties we show that the GADMM sequence has a
finite length and converges to a stationary point, and we drive its convergence
rate. Given a proper lower-semicontinuous function $f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R$
and a critical point $x^*\in\mathbb R^n$, the {K\L} property asserts that there
exists a continuous concave monotonically increasing function $\psi$ such that
around $x^*$ it holds $\psi'(f(x)-f(x^*))\cdot{\rm dist}(0,\partial f(x))\ge 1$
. When $\psi(s)=s^{1-\theta}$ with $\theta\in[0,1]$ this is equivalent to
$|f(x)-f(x^*)|^{\theta}{\rm dist}(0,\partial f(x))^{-1}$ to remain bounded
around $x^*$. We show that if $\theta=0$, the sequence generated by GADMM
converges in a finite numbers of iterations. If $\theta\in(0,1/2]$, then the
rate of convergence is $cQ^{k}$ where $c>0$, $Q\in(0,1)$, and $k\in\mathbb N$

O(1/k^{r})$ where $r=(1-\theta)/(2\theta-1)$ will be achieved.

tasks to assist them in learning, sixty-six activities from eleven different

from the American Association of Physics Teachers 2014 lab report. The results
were examined using k-means cluster analysis revealing three design clusters.

a Scientist cluster, activities emphasize design of experiments by students,
discussion, error analysis, reasonableness checking, supporting claims, and
making assumptions or simplifications. The Learning Concepts cluster focuses on
prediction of results and experimental observations. The Building Models
cluster emphasizes discussion and answering physics or math questions that do
not use collected data. This work connects common features appearing in physics

models fully account for the physics of the dense plasma of WD interiors. We
use MESA to investigate cooling models for a set of massive and ultra-massive
WDs (0.9-1.3 $M_\odot$) for which previous models fail to match kinematic age
indicators based on Gaia DR2. We find that the WDs in this population can be
explained as C/O cores experiencing unexpectedly rapid $^{22}$Ne sedimentation
in the strongly liquid interior just prior to crystallization. We propose that
this rapid sedimentation is due to the formation of solid clusters of $^{22}$Ne
in the liquid C/O background plasma. We show that these heavier solid clusters
sink faster than individual $^{22}$Ne ions and enhance the sedimentation
heating rate enough to dramatically slow WD cooling. MESA models including our
prescription for cluster formation and sedimentation experience cooling delays
of $\approx$4 Gyr on the WD Q branch, alleviating tension between cooling ages
and kinematic ages. This same model then predicts cooling delays coinciding
with crystallization of 6 Gyr or more in lower mass WDs (0.6-0.8 $M_\odot$).
Such delays are compatible with, and perhaps required by, observations of WD
populations in the local 100 pc WD sample and the open cluster NGC 6791. These
results motivate new investigations of the physics of strongly coupled C/O/Ne
plasma mixtures in the strongly liquid state near crystallization and tests

and multi-messenger modeling of this source, using a fully self-consistent
one-zone model that includes the contribution of external radiation fields
typical of flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). We identify three different
activity states of the blazar: one quiescent state and two flaring states with
hard and soft gamma-ray spectra. We find two hadronic models that can describe
the multi-wavelength emission during all three states: a leptohadronic model
with a contribution from photo-hadronic processes to X-rays and gamma rays, and
a proton synchrotron model, where the emission from keV to 10 GeV comes from
proton synchrotron radiation. Both models predict a substantial neutrino flux
that is correlated with the gamma-ray and soft X-ray fluxes. Our results are
compatible with the detection of a neutrino during the quiescent state, based
on event rate statistics. We conclude that the soft X-ray spectra observed
during bright flares strongly suggest a hadronic contribution, which can be
interpreted as additional evidence for cosmic ray acceleration in the source
independently of neutrino observations. We find that more arguments can be made
in favor of the leptohadronic model vis-a-vis the proton synchrotron scenario,
such as a lower energetic demand during the quiescent state. However, the same
leptohadronic model would be disfavored for flaring states of PKS 1502+106 if
no IceCube events were found from the direction of the source before 2010,

for the classical Banach spaces, but is now known for $E= \ell_p$ and $E=L_p$
for all $1\leq p<\infty$. However, the arguments are rather indirect: the proof
for $L_1$ goes via non-amenability of $\ell^\infty({\mathcal K}(\ell_1))$ and a
transference principle developed by Daws and Runde (Studia Math., 2010). In
this note, we provide a short proof that ${\mathcal B}(L_1)$ and some of its
subalgebras are non-amenable, which completely bypasses all of this machinery.
Our approach is based on classical properties of the ideal of representable
operators on $L_1$, and shows that ${\mathcal B}(L_1)$ is not even

\citet{per18} use VLA and VLBA archival data (between 1989 and 1997) to show
that the transient rises in flux density by a factor of at least five in less
than approximately 20 years. With the additional data presented here, we revise
the rise time to between approximately four years and six years, based on a new
detection of the source at 15.4 GHz from October 2011. Our results strengthen
the interpretation of Cyg A-2 as the result of a Tidal Disruption Event (TDE),
as we can identify the location of the compact object responsible for the TDE
and can estimate the angular expansion speed of the resulting radio emitting
structures, equivalent to an apparent expansion speed of $<0.9c$. While our
results are consistent with recent X-ray analyses, we can rule out a previously
suggested date of early 2013 for the timing of the TDE. We favour a timing
between early 2009 and late 2011. Applying the model of \citet{nak11}, we
suggest a TDE causing a mildly relativistic outflow with a (density-dependent)
total energy $>10^{49}$ erg. Due to the improved temporal coverage of our
archival measurements, we find that it is unlikely that Cyg A-2 has previously
been in a high luminosity radio state over the last 30 years.

effects of the COVID-19 crisis in Australia to understand the ongoing changes
in the income distribution as well as the impact of policy responses. By
semi-parametrically combining incomplete observed data from three different
sources, namely, the Monthly Longitudinal Labour Force Survey, the Survey of
Income and Housing and the administrative payroll data, we estimate the impact
of COVID-19 and the associated policy responses on the Australian income
distribution between February and June 2020, covering the immediate periods
before and after the initial outbreak. Our results suggest that despite the
growth in unemployment, the Gini of the equalised disposable income inequality
dropped by nearly 0.03 point since February. The reduction is because of the
additional wage subsidies and welfare supports offered as part of the policy
response, offsetting a potential surge in income inequality. Additionally, the
poverty rate, which could have been doubled in the absence of the government
response, also reduced by 3 to 4 percentage points. The result shows the
effectiveness of temporary policy measures in maintaining both the living
standards and the level of income inequality. However, the heavy reliance on
the support measures raises the possibility that the changes in the income
distribution may be reversed and even substantially worsened off should the
measures be withdrawn.

these objects is attributed to inhomogeneous surface structures (e.g. chemical
spots), which are typically linked to strong magnetic fields
($B\gtrsim100\,{\rm G}$) visible at the surface. It has been reported that
$\approx44$~per~cent of all A-type stars observed during the \emph{Kepler}
mission exhibit rotationally modulated light curves. This is surprising
considering that $\lesssim10$~per~cent of all MS A-type stars are known to be
strongly magnetic (i.e. they are Ap/Bp stars). We present a spectroscopic
monitoring survey of 44 A and late-B type stars reported to exhibit rotational
modulation in their \emph{Kepler} light curves. The primary goal of this survey
is to test the hypothesis that the variability is rotational modulation by
comparing each star's rotational broadening ($v\sin{i}$) with the equatorial
velocities ($v_{\rm eq}$) inferred from the photometric periods. We searched
for chemical peculiarities and binary companions in order to provide insight
into the origin of the apparent rotational modulation. We find that 14 stars in
our sample have $v\sin{i}>v_{\rm eq}$ and/or have low-mass companions that may
contribute to or be responsible for the observed variability. Our results
suggest that more than $10$~per~cent of all MS A and late-B type stars may
exhibit inhomogeneous surface structures; however, the incidence rate is likely

we analyze the neutrino emission properties and the conditions leading to the
growth of flavor instabilities in merger remnants consisting of a hypermassive
neutron star and an accretion disk during the first 10 ms after the merger. The
analyses are based on hydrodynamical simulations that include a modeling of
neutrino emission and absorption effects via the ""Improved
Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme"" (ILEAS). We also examine the
nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process
(r-process) inside the material ejected during this phase. The dominant
emission of $\bar\nu_e$ over $\nu_e$ from the merger remnant leads to favorable
conditions for the occurrence of fast pairwise flavor conversions of neutrinos,
independent of the chosen equation of state or the mass ratio of the binary.
The nucleosynthesis outcome is very robust, ranging from the first to the third
r-process peaks. In particular, more than $10^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ of strontium are
produced in these early ejecta that may account for the GW170817 kilonova
observation. We find that the amount of ejecta containing free neutrons after
the $r$-process freeze-out, which may power early-time UV emission, is reduced
by roughly a factor of 10 when compared to simulations that do not include weak
interactions. Finally, the potential flavor equipartition between all neutrino
flavors is mainly found to affect the nucleosynthesis outcome in the polar
ejecta within $\lesssim 30^\circ$, by changing the amount of the produced

correlations between photon pairs that are initially prepared in a two-mode
squeezed state. More specifically, considering the rotation of the Earth, the
space-time around the Earth is described by the Kerr metric. Our results show
that these state correlations, which initially increase for a specific range of
satellite's orbital altitude, will gradually approach a finite value with
increasing height of satellites orbit (when the special relativistic effects
become relevant). More importantly, our analysis demonstrates that the changes
of correlations generated by the total gravitational frequency shift could
reach the level of <0.5$\%$ within the satellites height at geostationary Earth

We aim to identify distant galaxy clusters as extended X-ray sources coincident
with overdensities of characteristically bright galaxies. Methods. We use
optical and near-infrared (NIR) data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and VISTA
Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) surveys to identify distant galaxy
clusters as overdensities of bright, $z_{phot}\geq 0.8$ galaxies associated
with extended X-ray sources detected in the ultimate XMM extragalactic survey
(XXL). Results. We identify a sample of 35 candidate clusters at $0.80\leq
z\leq 1.93$ from an approximately 4.5 deg$^2$ sky area. This sample includes 15
newly discovered candidate clusters, ten previously detected but unconfirmed
clusters, and ten spectroscopically confirmed clusters. Although these clusters
host galaxy populations that display a wide variety of quenching levels, they
exhibit well-defined relations between quenching, cluster-centric distance, and
galaxy luminosity. The brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) within our sample
display colours consistent with a bimodal population composed of an old and red
subsample together with a bluer, more diverse subsample. Conclusions. The
relation between galaxy masses and quenching seem to be already in place at
$z\sim 1$, although there is no significant variation of the quenching fraction
with the cluster-centric radius. The BCG bimodality might be explained by the
presence of a younger stellar component in some BCGs but additional data are
needed to confirm this scenario.

network miscalibration has the potential to lead to significant treatment

proposed approach is based on expected calibration error, which is a common

easily break the security of 4-input XOR BR PUFs and 4-input XOR TBR PUFs with
modeling accuracy $\sim$ 99%. Similar attacks were executed using single-layer
neural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial kernel
and the obtained results showed that single NNs failed to break the PUF
security. Furthermore, SVM results confirmed the same modeling accuracy
reported in previous research ($\sim$ 50%). For the first time, this research
empirically shows that DL networks can be used as powerful modeling techniques
against these complex PUF architectures for which previous conventional machine
learning techniques had failed. Furthermore, a detailed scalability analysis is
conducted on the DL networks with respect to PUFs' stage size and complexity.
The analysis shows that the number of layers and hidden neurons inside every
layer has a linear relationship with PUFs' stage size, which agrees with the
theoretical findings in deep learning. Consequently, A new obfuscated
architecture is introduced as a first step to counter DL modeling attacks and
it showed significant resistance against such attacks (16% - 40% less
accuracy). This research provides an important step towards prioritizing the
efforts to introduce new PUF architectures that are more secure and
invulnerable to modeling attacks. Moreover, it triggers future discussions on
the removal of influential bits and the level of obfuscation needed to confirm
that a specific PUF architecture is resistant against powerful DL modeling

test sets of noisy Raman spectrum. The proposed technique is applied to denoise
and compare the performance with different wavelet noise reduction methods.
Output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) are the performance evaluation index. It is
shown that output SNR of the proposed noise reduction technology is 10.24 dB
greater than that of the wavelet noise reduction method while the RMSE and the
MAPE are 292.63 and 10.09, which are much better than the proposed technique.

contrasting the evolution of the indicators. This shows that it is possible to

relatively difficult to classify the spectrum under baseline noise and additive
white Gaussian noise environments. The framework consists of two main engines.
Wavelet transform is proposed as the framework front-end for transforming 1-D
noise Raman spectrum to two-dimensional data. This two-dimensional data will be
fed to the framework back-end which is a classifier. The optimum classifier is
chosen by implementing several traditional machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) algorithms, and then we investigated their classification
accuracy and robustness performances. The four MLs we choose included a Naive
Bayes (NB), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Random Forest (RF) and a
K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) where a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was
chosen for a DL classifier. Noise-free, Gaussian noise, baseline noise, and
mixed-noise Raman spectrums were applied to train and validate the ML and DCNN
models. The optimum back-end classifier was obtained by testing the ML and DCNN
models with several noisy Raman spectrums (10-30 dB noise power). Based on the
simulation, the accuracy of the DCNN classifier is 9% higher than the NB
classifier, 3.5% higher than the RF classifier, 1% higher than the KNN
classifier, and 0.5% higher than the SVM classifier. In terms of robustness to
the mixed noise scenarios, the framework with DCNN back-end showed superior
performance than the other ML back-ends. The DCNN back-end achieved 90%
accuracy at 3 dB SNR while NB, SVM, RF, and K-NN back-ends required 27 dB, 22
dB, 27 dB, and 23 dB SNR, respectively. In addition, in the low-noise test data
set, the F-measure score of the DCNN back-end exceeded 99.1% while the
F-measure scores of the other ML engines were below 98.7%.

high-quality multiwavelength observations from multiple instruments, we studied
the event in detail in the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. In the source
region, the continual emergence of two positive polarities (P1 and P2) that
appeared as two pores (A and B)is unambiguous. Interestingly, P2 and Pore B
slowly approached P1 and Pore A, implying a magnetic flux convergence. During
the emergence and convergence, P1 and P2 successively interacted with a minor
negative polarity (N3) that emerged, which led to a continuous magnetic flux
cancellation. As a result, the overlying loops became much sheared and finally
evolved into a tiny twisted flux rope that was evidenced by a transient inverse
S-shaped sigmoid, the twisted filament threads with blueshift and redshift
signatures, and a hot channel. All the results show that the formation of the

the continuous magnetic flux emergence, convergence, and cancellation in the

gravitational wave (GW) signals of compact binary coalescences, using
single-interferometer data from LIGO detectors. As novel contribution, we
adopted a resampling white-box approach to advance towards a statistical
understanding of uncertainties intrinsic to CNNs in GW data analysis.
Resampling is performed by repeated $k$-fold cross-validation experiments, and
for a white-box approach, behavior of CNNs is mathematically described in
detail. Through a Morlet wavelet transform, strain time series are converted to
time-frequency images, which in turn are reduced before generating input
datasets. Moreover, to reproduce more realistic experimental conditions, we
worked only with data of non-Gaussian noise and hardware injections, removing
freedom to set signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in GW templates by hand.
After hyperparameter adjustments, we found that resampling smooths
stochasticity of mini-batch stochastic gradient descend by reducing mean
accuracy perturbations in a factor of $3.6$. CNNs were quite precise to detect
noise but not sensitive enough to recall GW signals, meaning that CNNs are
better for noise reduction than generation of GW triggers. However, applying a
post-analysis, we found that for GW signals of SNR $\geq 21.80$ with H1 data
and SNR $\geq 26.80$ with L1 data, CNNs could remain as tentative alternatives
for detecting GW signals. Besides, with receiving operating characteristic
curves we found that CNNs show much better performances than those of Naive
Bayes and Support Vector Machines models and, with a significance level of
$5\%$, we estimated that predictions of CNNs are significant different from
those of a random classifier. Finally, we elucidated that performance of CNNs
is highly class dependent because of the distribution of probabilistic scores
outputted by the softmax layer.

magnetic helicity of solar wind turbulence and its role in regulating magnetic
energy spectra and proton temperatures. Results show that the presence of the
helicity signature is very common in solar wind turbulence at scales $0.3
\lesssim k\rho_p \lesssim 1$, with $k$ being the wavenumber and $\rho_p$ the
proton gyroradius. The sign of the helicity is mostly positive, indicating the
dominance of right-handed polarization of the turbulence. The helicity
magnitude usually increases with $k$ and $\beta_{{\parallel}p}$ (the proton
parallel beta) when $k\rho_p$ and $\beta_{{\parallel}p}$ are less than unity.
As helicity magnitude increases, the power index of the energy spectrum becomes
more negative, and the proton temperatures $T_{{\perp}p}$ and
$T_{{\parallel}p}$ rise significantly, where $T_{{\perp}p}$ and
$T_{{\parallel}p}$ are the perpendicular and parallel temperatures with respect
to the background magnetic field. In particular, the rise of $T_{{\perp}p}$ is
faster than $T_{{\parallel}p}$ when $\beta_{{\parallel}p} < 1$ is satisfied.
The faster rise of $T_{{\perp}p}$ with the helicity magnitude may be
interpreted as the result of the preferentially perpendicular heating of solar
wind protons by kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) turbulence.

challenging in an unsupervised setting as the label information is not

centroids, i.e., pseudo labels, that represent semantic classes. During
learning, these centroids are also used to reconstruct the input samples. It
hence ensures the representativeness of centroids - each centroid represents
visually similar samples. Therefore, the centroids give information about
positive (visually similar) and negative (visually dissimilar) samples. Based
on pseudo labels, we propose a novel unsupervised metric loss which enforces
the positive concentration and negative separation of samples in the embedding

variable models widely used in education, psychology, and epidemiology to model
multivariate categorical data. A SLAM assumes that multiple discrete latent
attributes explain the dependence of observed variables in a highly structured
fashion. Usually, the maximum marginal likelihood estimation approach is
adopted for SLAMs, treating the latent attributes as random effects. The
increasing scope of modern assessment data involves large numbers of observed
variables and high-dimensional latent attributes. This poses challenges to
classical estimation methods and requires new methodology and understanding of
latent variable modeling. Motivated by this, we consider the joint maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) approach to SLAMs, treating latent attributes as
fixed unknown parameters. We investigate estimability, consistency, and
computation in the regime where sample size, number of variables, and number of
latent attributes all can diverge. We establish the statistical consistency of
the joint MLE and propose efficient algorithms that scale well to large-scale
data for several popular SLAMs. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior
empirical performance of the proposed methods. An application to real data from
an international educational assessment gives interpretable findings of

equation absent a pressure gradient. The resulting expressions enable us to
relate the boundary-layer characteristics of a velocity profile, $u(y)$, to an
assumed flow function and its wall derivative relative to the wall-normal
coordinate, $y$. Consequently, disturbance, displacement, and momentum
thicknesses, as well as skin friction and drag coefficients, which are
typically evaluated and tabulated in classical monographs, can be readily
determined for a given profile, $F(\xi)=u/U$. Here $\xi=y/\delta$ denotes the
boundary-layer coordinate. These expressions are then employed to provide a
rational explanation for the 1921 Pohlhausen polynomial paradox, namely, the
reason why a quartic representation of the velocity leads to less accurate
predictions of the disturbance, displacement, and momentum thicknesses than
using cubic or quadratic polynomials. Not only do we identify the factors
underlying this behaviour, we proceed to outline a procedure to overcome its
manifestation at any order. This enables us to derive optimal piecewise
approximations that do not suffer from the particular limitations affecting
Pohlhausen's $F(\xi)=2\xi-2\xi^3 +\xi^4$. For example, our alternative profile,
$F(\xi)=(5\xi-3\xi^3+\xi^4)/3$, leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in
precision when incorporated into the K\'arm\'an-Pohlhausen approach in both
viscous and thermal analyses. Then noting the significance of the Blasius
constant, $\bar{s} \approx 1.630398$, this approach is extended to construct a
set of uniformly valid solutions, including
$F(\xi)=1-\exp[-\bar{s}\xi(1+\bar{s}\xi/2+\xi^2)]$, which continues to hold
beyond the boundary-layer edge as $y\rightarrow\infty$. Given its substantially
reduced error, the latter is shown, through comparisons to other models, to be
practically equivalent to the Blasius solution.

interactions can be modeled as disturbance inputs to the subsystems, these
disturbances depend on the network's states. As a consequence, a disturbance
attenuation property of each isolated subsystem is, alone, insufficient to
ensure that the network behavior is robust to unintended interactions. In this
paper, we provide sufficient conditions on subsystem dynamics and interaction
maps, such that the network's behavior is robust to unintended interactions.
These conditions require that each subsystem attenuates constant external
disturbances, is monotone or ""near-monotone"", the unintended interaction map is
monotone, and the prescribed interaction map does not contain feedback loops.
We employ this result to guide the design of resource-limited genetic circuits.
More generally, our result provide conditions under which robustness of

shared steering control was achieved through a haptic guidance system which
provided active assistance torque on the steering wheel. Ten subjects
participated in a high-fidelity driving simulator experiment. Two types of
adaptive algorithms were investigated: haptic guidance decreases when driver
grip strength increases (HG-Decrease), and haptic guidance increases when
driver grip strength increases (HG-Increase). These two algorithms were
compared to manual driving and two levels of fixed authority haptic guidance,

describe well the rest of the datasets, raising our confidence in our fitted
binary properties. Our fit requires hot-spots (likely magnetic poles) on the
surface of the companion star, and we see evidence that these spots move over
the 8 yr span of our photometry. The derived binary inclination $i =
69.3^\circ\pm 2.3^\circ$, together with the center-of-mass velocity (from the
radial-velocity fits) $K_{\rm C} = 347.0\pm 3.7\,$ $\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$, give
a fairly typical neutron star mass of $1.47\pm 0.09\,M_\odot$.

dominated electron-phonon interaction, for three different semi-metals: single
and bilayer graphene, and semi-Dirac, all grown on polar substrates such as,
SiC or SiO_2. The problem of polaron has been studied by Feynman and others for
ordinary polar crystals. But the study of polaron formation in the context of
the above-mentioned 2D semi-metals having non-scalar effective Hamiltonians is
novel. When SL and BL graphene are grown on polar substrates, their electrons
can interact with the surface phonons of those polar substrates, as has been
discussed by Fratini et al. That gives rise to the possibility of polaron
formation in the context of SL and BL graphene, although they themselves are
non-polar. Semi-Dirac material, like SL and BL graphene, has been considered to
be grown on a polar substrate and the resulting polaron-dynamics has been
investigated. As was discovered by Pardo and Pickett, the interfaces of
(TiO_2)_5/(VO_2)_3 heterostructure, in which semi-Dirac dispersion was
observed, are non-polar. This justifies the treatment of semi-Dirac, for the
purpose of this paper, in the same footing as non-polar materials like SL and
BL graphene. The electron self energy, or polaron energy, calculated
analytically for BL graphene for small electron-momentum, is shown to vary
linearly with the electron momentum. Despite the similarity between BL graphene
and ordinary polar crystals in the parabolic nature of the electronic
band-structure in the absence of electron-phonon interaction, the linear
energy-momentum dispersion of BL graphene polarons stands in stark contrast to
the quadratic energy-momentum dispersion of the polarons produced in ordinary
polar crystals. In addition to the polaron energy, the decay rate(in the
absence of polaron formation), has been calculated for the above-mentioned
materials.

the collaboration networks of inventors, hence regarding patents as a positive
sign of invention. However, patenting is, most importantly, a strategic action
used by companies to compete with each other. This study sheds light on
inter-organisational adversarial relationships in patenting for the first time.
We constructed and analysed the network of companies connected via patent
opposition relationships that occurred between 1980 and 2018. A majority of the
companies are directly or indirectly connected to each other and hence form the
largest connected component. We found that in the network, many companies
disapprove patents in various industrial sectors as well as those owned by
foreign companies. The network exhibits heavy-tailed, power-law-like degree
distribution and assortative mixing, making it an unusual type of topology. We
further investigated the dynamics of the formation of this network by
conducting a temporal network motif analysis, with patent co-ownership among
the companies considered. By regarding opposition as a negative relationship
and patent co-ownership as a positive relationship, we analysed where
collaboration may occur in the opposition network and how such positive
relationships would interact with negative relationships. The results
identified the structurally imbalanced triadic motifs and the temporal patterns
of the occurrence of triads formed by a mixture of positive and negative
relationships. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of the emergence of the
inter-organisational adversarial relationships may differ from those of other
types of negative relationships hence necessitating further research.

causal agent is an autonomous physical system, maintained in a steady state,
far from thermal equilibrium, with special subsystems: sensors, actuators, and
learning machines. Using feedback, the learning machine, driven purely by
thermodynamic constraints, changes its internal states to learn probabilistic
functional relations inherent in correlations between sensor and actuator
records. We argue that these functional relations just are causal relations
learned by the agent, and so such causal relations are simply relations between
the internal physical states of a causal agent. We show that learning is driven
by a thermodynamic principle: the error rate is minimised when the dissipated
power is minimised. While the internal states of a causal agent are necessarily
stochastic, the learned causal relations are shared by all machines with the
same hardware embedded in the same environment. We argue that this dependence
of causal relations on such `hardware' is a novel demonstration of causal

'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim class are located entirely within the orbit of Venus making
them difficult to detect by ground-based observatories. The first-known
asteroid of this class, (594913) 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim, was discovered by the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2020 January during a twilight search for
asteroids at small solar elongations that ran between September 2019 and
January 2020. Due to its large diameter of $\sim$2 km, the discovery of
(594913) 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim is surprising because contemporary NEA population
models predict a scarcity of asteroids of this size located inside the orbit of
Venus. To compare the discovery of (594913) 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim by ZTF with the
predictions of NEA population models, we estimated the ZTF survey completeness
at detecting 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim asteroids and the number of 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim
asteroids expected to have been discovered by simulating observations of
synthetic 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim asteroids. We find that the 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim
population completeness of the survey is $\sim$18$\%$ and there is only a 5$\%$
probability that a single 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim asteroid would have been
discovered. Given the small chance for (594913) 'Ayl\'{o}'chaxnim to have been

asteroid population models may need to be revised.

In the literature, the inferential properties under covariate-adaptive

it is well known that the usual two sample t-test for treatment effect is
typically conservative, in the sense that the actual test size is smaller than
the nominal level. This phenomenon of invalid tests has also been found for
generalized linear models without adjusting for the covariates and are
sometimes more worrisome due to inflated Type I error. The purpose of this
study is to examine the unadjusted test for treatment effect under generalized
linear models and covariate-adaptive randomization. For a large class of
covariate-adaptive randomization methods, we obtain the asymptotic distribution
of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and derive the conditions under
which the test is conservative, valid, or anti-conservative. Several commonly
used generalized linear models, such as logistic regression and Poisson
regression, are discussed in detail. An adjustment method is also proposed to
achieve a valid size based on the asymptotic results. Numerical studies confirm
the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
adjustment method.

two types of overloaded CD-NOMA, i.e., sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and
dense code multiple access (DCMA), which are distinctive from each other in
terms of their codebooks having sparsity or not. By analysing their individual
diversity orders (DO) in Rayleigh fading channels, it is found that DCMA can be
designed to enjoy full DO which is equal to the maximum number of resource
nodes in the system. This is in contrast to SCMA whose error rate suffers from
limited DO equal to the codebook sparsity (i.e., the effective number of
resource nodes occupied by each user). We conduct theoretical analysis for the
codebook design criteria and propose to use generalized sphere decoder for DCMA
detection. We numerically evaluate two types of multiple access schemes under
""4x6"" (i.e., six users communicate over four subcarriers) and ""5x10"" NOMA
settings and reveal that DCMA gives rise to significantly improved error rate
performance in Rayleigh fading channels, whilst having decoding complexity
comparable to that of SCMA.

defines a topological invariant for the interacting system. In certain cases
this invariant agrees with the many-body generalization of the TKNN number

three steps: text detection, text recognition, and text field labeling. While
text detection and text recognition have been heavily studied and improved a
lot in literature, text field labeling is less explored and still faces many
challenges. Existing learning based methods for text labeling task usually
require a large amount of labeled examples to train a specific model for each
type of document. However, collecting large amounts of document images and
labeling them is difficult and sometimes impossible due to privacy issues.
Deploying separate models for each type of document also consumes a lot of
resources. Facing these challenges, we explore one-shot learning for the text
field labeling task. Existing one-shot learning methods for the task are mostly
rule-based and have difficulty in labeling fields in crowded regions with few
landmarks and fields consisting of multiple separate text regions. To alleviate
these problems, we proposed a novel deep end-to-end trainable approach for
one-shot text field labeling, which makes use of attention mechanism to
transfer the layout information between document images. We further applied
conditional random field on the transferred layout information for the
refinement of field labeling. We collected and annotated a real-world one-shot
field labeling dataset with a large variety of document types and conducted
extensive experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model. To
stimulate research in this direction, the collected dataset and the one-shot
model will be released1.

material (CSM) interaction with previously ejected material, a phenomenon that
is unusual among SE SNe. We analyse observational data, consisting of optical
light curves and spectra. For SN 2019oys we also have detections in radio as
well as limits from UV and X-rays. Both light curves show spectacular
re-brightening after about 100 days. In the case of SN 2019tsf, the
re-brightening is followed by a new period of decline, and the spectra never
show signs of narrow emission lines that would indicate CSM interaction. On the
contrary, SN 2019oys made a spectral makeover from a Type Ib to a spectrum
clearly dominated by CSM interaction at the light curve brightening phase. Deep
spectra reveal a plethora of narrow high ionization lines, including coronal
lines, and the radio observations show strong emission. The rather similar
light curve behaviour indicate CSM interaction as the powering source. For SN
2019oys the evidence for a phase where the ejecta hit H-rich material, likely
ejected from the progenitor star, is conspicuous. We observe strong narrow
lines of H and He, but also a plethora of high ionization lines, including
coronal lines, revealing shock interaction. Spectral simulations of SN 2019oys
show two distinct density components, one with density > 1e9/cm3, dominated by
somewhat broader, low ionization lines of H I, He I, Na I and Ca II, and one
with narrow, high ionization lines at a density about 1e6 /cm3. The former is
strongly affected by electron scattering. The evidence for CSM interaction in
SN 2019oys is corroborated by detections in radio. On the contrary, for SN
2019tsf, we find little evidence in the spectra for any CSM interaction.

emerging. What is important though now is the fidelity of the cryptography,

created a graph state along a path consisting of all the qubits of ibmqx4 and
ibmq_16_melbourne respectively and we measure the strength of the entanglement
using negativity measurement of the qubit pairs. Then, using the qubits with
maximal entanglement, we send the modified encryption key to the receiver. The
key is modified by permutation and superdense coding before transmission. The
receiver reverts the process and gets the actual key. We carried out the
complete experiment in the IBM Quantum Experience project. Our result shows a
15% to 20% higher fidelity of encryption and decryption than a random selection

In 1976, Burr, Erd\H{o}s, and Lov\'asz initiated the study of the parameter

Specifically, we seek to identify graphs for which a minimal $q$-Ramsey graph
can contain arbitrarily many such vertices. We call a graph satisfying this
property $s_q$-abundant. Among other results, we prove that every cycle is
$s_q$-abundant for any integer $q\geq 2$. We also discuss the cases when $H$ is
a clique or a clique with a pendant edge, extending previous results of Burr et

generalize and extend earlier constructions that have proven useful in the

Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) models are ubiquitously applied to perovskites without
considering their validity. Herein, an advanced technique mapping
photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as a function of both the excitation
pulse energy and repetition frequency is developed and employed to examine the
validity of these models. While ABC and SRH fail to explain the charge dynamics
in a broad range of conditions, the addition of Auger recombination and
trapping to the SRH model enables a quantitative fitting of PLQY maps and
low-power PL decay kinetics, and extracting trap concentrations and efficacies.
Higher-power PL kinetics requires the inclusion of additional non-linear
processes. The PLQY mapping developed herein is suitable for a comprehensive
testing of theories and is applicable to any semiconductor.

the shift depends on the rotation angle of the crystal. It is also found that

can be prone to human-induced errors like the entry of incorrect data or entry
of no data for many days. In addition to such human prone errors, the
fluctuations in the prices itself make the creation of stable and robust

price forecasting, in this paper, we present techniques to build robust crop
price prediction models considering various features such as (i) historical
price and market arrival quantity of crops, (ii) historical weather data that
influence crop production and transportation, (iii) data quality-related

preferences is uniquely recoverable from random choice. This paper shows
through two examples that such uniqueness fails in general if risk preferences
are random but do not conform to expected utility theory. In the first,
non-uniqueness obtains even if all preferences are confined to the betweenness
class (Dekel, 1986) and are suitably monotone. The second example illustrates
random choice behavior consistent with random expected utility that is also
consistent with random non-expected utility. On the other hand, we find that if

monotone in first-order stochastic dominance, random choice again uniquely
identifies the distribution of preferences. Finally, we argue that, depending

electron bunches, which leads to resonant excitation of the wakefield, even if
the repetition frequency of bunches differs from the plasma frequency. In this
case, the synchronization of frequencies is restored due to defocusing of the
bunches which get into the bad phases with respect to the plasma wave. However,
in this case, the bunches are lost, which as a result of this do not
participate in the excitation of the wakefield. In this paper, numerical
simulation was used to study the dynamics of electron bunches and the
excitation of the wakefield in a magnetized plasma by a long sequence of short
bunches of relativistic electrons. When a magnetic field is used, the
defocussed bunches return to the region of interaction with the field after a
certain time. In this case, the electrons of the bunches, returning to the
necessary phases of the field, participate in the excitation of the wakefield.
Also, the use of a magnetic field leads to an increase of the frequency of the
excited wave relative to the repetition frequency of bunches. The latter
increases the time for maintaining the resonance and, consequently, leads to an
increase of the amplitude of the excited wakefield.

learn effective appearance representation from both whole body and body parts

for the current state and the first input of the solution, the optimal feedback
law, is applied to the system. This procedure requires to solve the OCP in
every time step. Recently, a new approach was suggested for linear MPC. The
parametric solution of a linear quadratic OCP is a piecewise-affine feedback
law. The solution at a point in state space provides an optimal feedback law
and a domain on which this law is the optimal solution. As long as the system
remains in the domain, the law can be reused and the calculation of an OCP is
avoided. In some domains the optimal feedback laws are identical. By uniting
the corresponding domains, bigger domains are achieved and the optimal feedback
law can be reused more often. In the present paper, we investigate in how far
this approach can be extended from linear to nonlinear MPC, we propose an
algorithm and we illustrate the achieved savings with an example.

In this regard, finite-dimensional Gaussian process (GP) regression models
bring a valuable solution, as they guarantee that the inequality constraints
are satisfied everywhere. Nevertheless, these models are currently restricted
to small dimensional situations (up to dimension 5). Addressing this issue, we
introduce the MaxMod algorithm that sequentially inserts one-dimensional knots
or adds active variables, thereby performing at the same time dimension
reduction and efficient knot allocation. We prove the convergence of this
algorithm. In intermediary steps of the proof, we propose the notion of
multi-affine extension and study its properties. We also prove the convergence
of finite-dimensional GPs, when the knots are not dense in the input space,
extending the recent literature. With simulated and real data, we demonstrate
that the MaxMod algorithm remains efficient in higher dimension (at least in
dimension 20), and needs fewer knots than other constrained GP models from the
state-of-the-art, to reach a given approximation error.

Upon cooling below 80 K, Pb2CaOsO6 simultaneously undergoes a metal--insulator
transition and develops antiferromagnetic order. Pb2ZnOsO6, on the other hand,
remains a paramagnetic metal down to 2 K. The key difference between the two
compounds lies in their crystal structure. The Os atoms in Pb2ZnOsO6 are
arranged on an approximately face-centred cubic lattice with strong
antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange couplings. The geometrical
frustration inherent to this lattice prevents magnetic order from forming down
to the lowest temperatures. In contrast, the unit cell of Pb2CaOsO6 is heavily
distorted up to at least 500 K, including antiferroelectric-like displacements
of the Pb and O atoms despite metallic conductivity above 80 K. This distortion
relieves the magnetic frustration, facilitating magnetic order which in turn
drives the metal--insulator transition. Our results suggest that the phase
transition in Pb2CaOsO6 is spin-driven, and could be a rare example of a Slater
transition.

Value Decomposition Network (VDN) and QMIX estimate the value of long-term
returns as a scalar that does not contain the information of randomness. Our
proposed model QR-MIX introduces quantile regression, modeling joint
state-action values as a distribution, combining QMIX with Implicit Quantile
Network (IQN). However, the monotonicity in QMIX limits the expression of joint
state-action value distribution and may lead to incorrect estimation results in
non-monotonic cases. Therefore, we proposed a flexible loss function to
approximate the monotonicity found in QMIX. Our model is not only more tolerant

between multiple wireless devices. The energy consumption and discovery latency
of this procedure are determined by the parametrization of the protocol. In
most existing protocols, reception and transmission are temporally coupled.
Such schemes are referred to as \textit{slotted}, for which the problem of
finding optimized parametrizations has been studied thoroughly in the
literature. However, slotted approaches are not efficient in applications in
which new devices join the network gradually and only the joining devices and a
master node need to run the ND protocol simultaneously. For example, this is
typically the case in IoT scenarios or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) piconets.
Here, protocols in which packets are transmitted with periodic intervals (PI)
can achieve significantly lower worst-case latencies than slotted ones. For
this class of protocols, optimal parameter values remain unknown. To address
this, we propose an optimization framework for PI-based BLE-like protocols,
which translates any specified duty-cycle (and therefore energy budget) into a
set of optimized parameter values. We show that the parametrizations resulting
from one variant of our proposed scheme are optimal when one receiver discovers
one transmitter, and no other parametrization or ND protocol - neither slotted
nor slotless - can guarantee lower discovery latencies for a given duty-cycle
in this scenario. Since the resulting protocol utilizes the channel more
aggressively than other ND protocols, beacons will collide more frequently.
Hence, due to collisions, the rate of successful discoveries gracefully
decreases for larger numbers of devices discovering each other simultaneously.
We also propose a scheme for configuring the BLE protocol (and not just
BLE-\textit{like} protocols).

the filament spine. We find regions along the filament where the
angular-dependency with the line-of-sight (LOS) is the dominant factor and dust
polarization may trace the underlying kinked magnetic field morphology. We also
find that reversals in the recovered magnetic field direction are not
unambiguously associated to any particular morphology. Other physical
parameters, such as density or temperature, are relevant and sometimes dominant
compared to the magnetic field structure in modulating the observed signal. We
demonstrate that the Zeeman effect and the $RM$ recover the line-of-sight
magnetic field strength to within a factor 2.1 - 3.4. We conclude that the

ET), combined with the redshifts determined from electromagnetic counter parts
and host galaxies, one can expect the Hubble constant to be constrained at the
precision of $\sim 10^{-2}$ with 20 well-observed binary neutron star (BNS)
mergers. Additional standard-siren measurements from other types of future
gravitational-wave sources (NS-BH and BBH) will provide more precision
constraints of this important cosmological parameter. Therefore, we obtain that
future measurements of the luminosity distances of gravitational waves sources
will be much more competitive than the current analysis, which makes it
expectable more vigorous and convincing constraints on the Hubble constant in a
cosmological-model-independent way.

$\mathrm{A_{1g}}$ modes for single-layer and natural bilayer MoS$_2$ over a
broad range of temperatures ($8 < $T$ < 300$ K). Both the Raman shift and FWHM
of these modes show linear temperature dependence for $T>100$ K, whereas they
become independent of temperature for $T<100$ K. Using first-principles
calculations, we show that three-phonon anharmonic effects intrinsic to the

of both the modes. It also plays an important role in determining the
temperature-dependence of the frequency of the Raman modes. The observed
evolution of the line-width of the A$_{1g}$ mode suggests that electron-phonon
processes are additionally involved. From the analysis of the
temperature-dependent Raman spectra of MoS$_2$ on two different substrates --
SiO$_2$ and hexagonal boron nitride, we disentangle the contributions of
external stress and internal impurities to these phonon-related processes. We
find that the renormalization of the phonon mode frequencies on different

role of intrinsic phonon anharmonic effects in deciding the Raman shift in

extremely low in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. Since knowledge of that

conducted experiments involve participants giving voice commands to the drone
in both languages in order to compare the effectiveness of each of them,

Additionally, different levels of distortion have been applied to the voice
commands in order to test the proposed approach when facing noisy input
signals. The obtained results show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable
of interpreting user voice instructions achieving an improvement in
speech-to-action recognition for both languages when using phoneme matching in

using our phoneme matching approach the results are improved achieving 93.33%

show that the closure of the set of prime elements of $D$ is the union of the

However, such generators haven't appeared yet because either the current

microscale such that the sliding contact between a microsized graphite flake
and an n-type silicon is in a structural superlubric state, namely a ultralow
friction and wearless state. This SLSG generates a stable electrical current at
a high density (~119 Am-2) for at least 5,000 cycles. Since no current decay
and wear were observed during the entire experiment, we believe that the real
persistence of the SLSG should be enduring or substantively unlimited. In
addition, the observed results exclude the mechanism of friction excitation in
our Schottky generator, and provide the first experimental support of the
conjectured mechanism of depletion layer establishment and destruction (DLED).
Furthermore, we demonstrate a physical process of the DLED mechanism by the use
of a quasi-static semiconductor finite element simulation. Our work may guide
and accelerate future SLSGs into real applications.

the entanglement (or Schmidt) gap $\delta\xi$, i.e., the lowest laying gap of
the entanglement spectrum, at a two-dimensional quantum critical point. We
focus on the paradigmatic quantum spherical model, which exhibits a
second-order transition, and is mappable to free bosons with an additional
external constraint. We analytically show that the Schmidt gap vanishes at the
critical point, although only logarithmically. For a system on a torus and the
half-system bipartition, the entanglement gap vanishes as $\pi^2/\ln(L)$, with
$L$ the linear system size. The entanglement gap is nonzero in the paramagnetic
phase and exhibits a faster decay in the ordered phase. The rescaled gap
$\delta\xi\ln(L)$ exhibits a crossing for different system sizes at the
transition, although logarithmic corrections prevent a precise verification of
the finite-size scaling. Interestingly, the change of the entanglement gap
across the phase diagram is reflected in the zero-mode eigenvector of the
spin-spin correlator. At the transition quantum fluctuations give rise to a
non-trivial structure of the eigenvector, whereas in the ordered phase it is
flat. We also show that the vanishing of the entanglement gap at criticality

planning. Current modeling approaches resort to numerical solvers that simulate
the tumor progression according to a given differential equation. Using
highly-efficient numerical solvers, a single forward simulation takes up to a
few minutes of compute. At the same time, clinical applications of tumor
modeling often imply solving an inverse problem, requiring up to tens of
thousands forward model evaluations when used for a Bayesian model
personalization via sampling. This results in a total inference time
prohibitively expensive for clinical translation. While recent data-driven
approaches become capable of emulating physics simulation, they tend to fail in
generalizing over the variability of the boundary conditions imposed by the
patient-specific anatomy. In this paper, we propose a learnable surrogate for
simulating tumor growth which maps the biophysical model parameters directly to
simulation outputs, i.e. the local tumor cell densities, whilst respecting
patient geometry. We test the neural solver on Bayesian tumor model
personalization for a cohort of glioma patients. Bayesian inference using the
proposed surrogate yields estimates analogous to those obtained by solving the
forward model with a regular numerical solver. The near-real-time computation

probability to remain in the tubular neighborhood of a smooth path, is a
central quantity in the study of path probabilities. Previous works considered
the sojourn probability in the limit of vanishing tube radius, and employed the
metric induced by the diffusion tensor, rather than that of the ambient space,
to define the tube enclosing the smooth path. This presents two difficulties in
experimentally measuring sojourn probabilities: first, the state-dependence of
the diffusion tensor is not known apriori, and second, the limit has to be
accessed through a sequence of measurements at finite tube radius. Here we
circumvent these difficulties by obtaining a general expression for the sojourn
probability of $N$-dimensional It\^o processes in tubes whose radii are small
but finite, and fixed by the metric of the ambient Euclidean space. The central
quantity in our study is the rate at which trajectories leave the tube for the
first time. This has an interpretation as a Lagrangian and can be measured
directly in experiment. We find that this Lagrangian differs, in general, from
the Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian and has a form not previously reported in the
literature. We confirm our result by comparing to numerical simulations for a
one-dimensional diffusion process with state-dependent diffusivity. We
demonstrate that the most probable tube for a barrier crossing depends
sensitively on the tube radius. We find that that while in the limit of
vanishing tube radius the ratio of sojourn probabilities for a pair of distinct
paths is in general divergent, the same for a path and its time-reversal is
always convergent and finite. This provides, in turn, a pathwise definition of
irreversibility for It\^o processes that is agnostic to the state-dependence of
the diffusion tensor.

cosmological model with small damping scale is considered. In this model
galaxies and clusters of galaxies are identified with rare high density peaks,
what suppresses the action of random factors in the vicinity of peaks and makes
the process of halos formation more rapid and regular. High concentration of
irregular subhalos surrounding the central peaks and their subsequent merging
just after formation allows to consider this medium as a mixture of
collisionless dispersed dark matter (DM) particles and collisional subhalos.
Merging of these subhalos with the central dominating halo is accompanied by
tidal destruction of the central cusp, what progressively shallows the density
profile and promotes formation of super massive central black holes. In the
framework of this model we can reproduce the observed correlation of mass and
density of virialized galaxies and clusters of galaxies known as the virial
paradox [4,5]. These correlations are closely linked with the composition of DM
and the shape of the power spectrum what allows to restrict them using already
available observations. These correlations put constraints on the HDM and WDM
models and allow to test models of cosmological inflation. We confirm that the
missing satellite problem is directly linked with the virial paradox and
reheating of the Universe which increases temperature and entropy of the
baryons, prevents formation of first stars and divides halos into two
populations: the first one includes galaxies formed before reheating which are
mainly concentrated in the vicinity of the massive ones while the second
population -- numerous dark halos formed after reheating -- accumulates
majority of DM but does not contain stars. Their spatial distribution is more
homogeneous.

become the most prominent countermeasure to protect cryptographic
implementations against physical side-channel attacks (SCAs). The core idea of
masking is to randomly split every sensitive intermediate variable during
computation into at least t+1 shares, where t denotes the maximum number of
shares that are allowed to be observed by an adversary without learning any
sensitive information. In other words, it is assumed that the adversary is
bounded either by the possessed number of probes (e.g., microprobe needles) or
by the order of statistical analyses while conducting higher-order SCA attacks
(e.g., differential power analysis). Such bounded models are employed to prove
the SCA security of the corresponding implementations. Consequently, it is
believed that given a sufficiently large number of shares, the vast majority of
known SCA attacks are mitigated. In this work, we present a novel
laser-assisted SCA technique, called Laser Logic State Imaging (LLSI), which
offers an unlimited number of contactless probes, and therefore, violates the
probing security model assumption. This technique enables us to take snapshots
of hardware implementations, i.e., extract the logical state of all registers
at any arbitrary clock cycle with a single measurement. To validate this, we
mount our attack on masked AES hardware implementations and practically
demonstrate the extraction of the full-length key in two different scenarios.
First, we assume that the location of the registers (key and/or state) is
known, and hence, their content can be directly read by a single snapshot.
Second, we consider an implementation with unknown register locations, where we
make use of multiple snapshots and a SAT solver to reveal the secrets.

Unsupervised approaches potentially allow to use much more data at a lower

Tailed (WAT) cluster Abell 562. We have combined Gemini observations with
archival data from the literature to form a sample of 76 cluster members and
derived a mean redshift of $0.1088 \pm 0.0004$ and a velocity dispersion of
$919 \pm 116$ km s$^{-1}$. This relatively large velocity dispersion suggests
either a very massive cluster ($M_{dyn} > 6.9 \times$ 10$^{14}$ $M_{sun}$)
and/or a merger system. The merger model is supported by a non-Gaussian galaxy
velocity distribution, an elongated spatial distribution of likely cluster
members, and an elongated X-ray emitting gas. This scenario would generate the
bulk flow motion of the intra-cluster medium that can exert enough ram pressure
to bend the radio jets. Thus, our observations support the model in which a
recent off-axis merger event produced the cluster wide conditions needed to
shape the WAT in Abell 562.

The most popular distance between such metric measure spaces is
theGromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, which is the solution of a quadratic
assignment problem. The GW distance is however limited to the comparison of
metric measure spaces endowed with a probability distribution. To alleviate
this issue, we introduce two Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulations: a
distance and a more tractable upper-bounding relaxation.They both allow the
comparison of metric spaces equipped with arbitrary positive measures up to
isometries. The first formulation is a positive and definite divergence based
on a relaxation of the mass conservation constraint using a novel type of
quadratically-homogeneous divergence. This divergence works hand in hand with
the entropic regularization approach which is popular to solve large scale
optimal transport problems. We show that the underlying non-convex optimization
problem can be efficiently tackled using a highly parallelizable and
GPU-friendly iterative scheme. The second formulation is a distance between
mm-spaces up to isometries based on a conic lifting. Lastly, we provide
numerical experiments onsynthetic examples and domain adaptation data with a
Positive-Unlabeled learning task to highlight the salient features of the
unbalanced divergence and its potential applications in ML.

scientific opinions in this respect are diverse. Furthermore, as researchers,
we sometimes ask ourselves whether our work in this area is really ""worth it"",
given the ambiguous prognosis regarding the future of VR. To tackle this
question, we explore three different areas of VR research in this dissertation,
namely locomotion, interaction, and perception. We begin our journey by
structuring VR locomotion and by introducing a novel locomotion concept for
large distance traveling via virtual body resizing. In the second part, we
focus on our interaction possibilities in VR. We learn how to represent virtual
objects via self-transforming controllers and how to store our items in VR
inventories. We design comprehensive 3D gestures for the audience and provide
an I/O abstraction layer to facilitate the realization and usage of such
diverse interaction modalities. The third part is dedicated to the exploration
of perceptual phenomena in VR. In contrast to locomotion and interaction, our
contributions in the field of perception emphasize the strong points of
immersive setups. We utilize VR to transfer the illusion of virtual body
ownership to nonhumanoid avatars and exploit this phenomenon for novel gaming
experiences with animals in the leading role. As one of our contributions, we
demonstrate how to repurpose the dichoptic presentation capability of immersive
setups for preattentive zero-overhead highlighting in visualizations. We round

obstacle to black-box security-evaluation efforts. In-depth security analysis
requires locating and classifying the algorithm in often very large binary
images, thus rendering manual inspection, even when aided by heuristics, time
consuming.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach to automate the identification and
classification of (proprietary) cryptographic primitives within binary code.
Our approach is based on Data Flow Graph (DFG) isomorphism, previously proposed
by Lestringant et al. Unfortunately, their DFG isomorphism approach is limited
to known primitives only, and relies on heuristics for selecting code fragments
for analysis. By combining the said approach with symbolic execution, we
overcome all limitations of their work, and are able to extend the analysis
into the domain of unknown, proprietary cryptographic primitives. To
demonstrate that our proposal is practical, we develop various signatures, each
targeted at a distinct class of cryptographic primitives, and present
experimental evaluations for each of them on a set of binaries, both publicly
available (and thus providing reproducible results), and proprietary ones.
Lastly, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our approach,
called Where's Crypto?, in the form of a plug-in for the popular IDA

With the
latest sample, we adopt both a flexible Gaussian mixture model and a Gaussian
plus Cauchy-Lorentz component model to infer the mass distribution of neutron
stars and use the Bayesian model selection to explore evidence for
multimodality and a sharp cutoff in the mass distribution. The two models yield
rather similar results. Consistent with previous studies, we find evidence for
a bimodal distribution together with a cutoff at a mass of $M_{\rm
max}=2.26_{-0.05}^{+0.12}M_\odot$ (68% credible interval; for the Gaussian
mixture model). If such a cutoff is interpreted as the maximum gravitational
mass of nonrotating cold neutron stars, the prospect of forming supramassive
remnants is found to be quite promising for the double neutron star mergers
with a total gravitational mass less than or equal to 2.7$M_\odot$ unless the
thermal pions could substantially soften the equation of state for the very hot
neutron star matter. These supramassive remnants have a typical kinetic
rotational energy of approximately $1-2\times 10^{53}$ ergs. Together with a

collaboration with Le Monde, a leading French newspaper, we designed a novel
query algorithm for exploiting such heterogeneous corpora through keyword
search. We model our underlying data as graphs and, given a set of search
terms, our algorithm nds links between them within and across the heterogeneous
datasets included in the graph. We draw inspiration from prior work on keyword
search in structured and unstructured data, which we extend with the data
heterogeneity dimension, which makes the keyword search problem computationally
harder. We implement our algorithm and we evaluate its performance using

an online handwriting pattern. However, it is challenging to reconstruct an
online handwriting pattern given an offline handwriting image, especially for
multiple-stroke character as Japanese kanji. The multiple-stroke character
requires not only point coordinates but also stroke orders whose difficulty is
exponential growth by the number of strokes. Besides, several crossed and touch
points might increase the difficulty of the recovered task. We propose a deep
neural network-based method to solve the recovered task using a large online
handwriting database. Our proposed model has two main components: Convolutional
Neural Network-based encoder and Long Short-Term Memory Network-based decoder
with an attention layer. The encoder focuses on feature extraction while the
decoder refers to the extracted features and generates the time-sequences of
coordinates. We also demonstrate the effect of the attention layer to guide the
decoder during the reconstruction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
method by both visual verification and handwritten character recognition.
Although the visual verification reveals some problems, the recognition
experiments demonstrate the effect of trajectory recovery in improving the
accuracy of offline handwritten character recognition when online recognition
for the recovered trajectories are combined.

so that we dealt with the most suitable candidates to trace any stellar
structure located beyond the cluster tidal radius. From star-by-star reddening
corrected color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) we defined four adjacent strips along
the MS, for which we built the respective stellar density maps, once the
contamination by field stars was properly removed. The resulting field star
cleaned stellar density maps show a short tidal tail and some scattered debris.
Such extra-tidal features are hardly detected when much shallower Gaia DR2 data

Indeed, by using 2.5 magnitudes below the cluster MS turnoff as the faintest

cluster's tidal radius, and some hints for field star density variations are
found across a circle of radius 3.5deg centered on the cluster and with similar

distinguishable from that of the cluster, with some superposition, which
resembles that of stars located beyond 3.5deg from the cluster center.

statistical approach. We infer the internal luminosity for the sample of hot
Jupiters, study its effect on the interior structure, and put constraints on
which mechanism is the dominant one. We develop a flexible and robust
hierarchical Bayesian model that couples the interior structure of exoplanets
to their observed properties. We apply the model to 314 hot Jupiters and infer
the internal luminosity distribution for each planet and study at the
population level ({\it i}) the mass-luminosity-radius distribution and as a
function of equilibrium temperature the distributions of the ({\it ii}) heating
efficiency, ({\it iii}) internal temperature, and the ({\it iv}) pressure of
the radiative-convective-boundary (RCB). We find that hot Jupiters tend to have
high internal luminosity leading to hot interiors. This has important
consequences on the cooling rate and we find that the RCB is located at low
pressures. Assuming that the ultimate source of the extra heating is the
irradiation from the host star, we illustrate that the heating efficiency
follows a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with previous results. We discuss
our findings in the context of the proposed heating mechanisms and illustrate
that ohmic dissipation, advection of potential temperature, and thermal tides
are in agreement with certain trends inferred from our analysis and thus all
three models can explain aspects of the observations. We provide new insights

the ubiquitous occurrence of a charge instability, signalled by a
divergent/negative electronic compressibility, in a range of doping from the

normal metals. We show that the breaking of rotational invariance favors this
instability: both spin-anisotropy in the interaction and crystal-field
splitting among the orbitals make the instability zone extend to larger
dopings, making it relevant for real materials like iron-based superconductors.
These observations help us build a coherent picture of the occurrence and
extent of this instability. We trace it back to the partial freezing of the
local degrees of freedom in the Hund's metal, which reduces the allowed local
configurations and thus the quasiparticle itinerancy. The abruptness of the
unfreezing happening at the Hund's metal frontier can be directly connected to

Here we prove that in proper settings the Ollivier-Ricci curvature of random

atmospheres. Observations have shown that stellar flares emit energy in a wide
energy range (10^30-10^38 ergs), a fraction of which lies in X-rays and extreme
ultraviolet (XUV). These flares heat the upper atmosphere of a planet, leading
to increased escape rates, and can result in atmospheric erosion over a period
of time. Observations also suggest that primordial terrestrial planets can
accrete voluminous H/He envelopes. Stellar radiation can erode these
protoatmospheres over time, and the extent of this erosion has implications for
the planet's habitability. We use the energy-limited equation to calculate
hydrodynamic escape rates from these protoatmospheres irradiated by XUV stellar
flares and luminosity. We use the Flare-Frequency Distribution of 492 FGKM
stars observed with TESS to estimate atmospheric loss in Habitable Zone
planets. We find that for most stars, luminosity-induced escape is the main
loss mechanism, with a minor contribution from flares. However, flares dominate
the loss mechanism of $\sim$20\% M4-M10 stars. M0-M4 stars are most likely to
completely erode both their proto- and secondary atmospheres, and M4-M10 are
least likely to erode secondary atmospheres. We discuss the implications of

the interaction between the rare-earth dopant and native point defects (Ga and

and through defect association. We find co-doping with oxygen can facilitate
the incorporation of Eu into the lattice. The unassociated Eu$_{\rm Ga}$ is an
electrically and optically active defect center and its behavior is profoundly
impacted by local defect--defect interaction. Defect complexes such as Eu$_{\rm

telescope located in San Pedro M\'artir (Mexico). We also include additional
ground-based follow-up photometry as well as high-resolution spectroscopy and
high-angular imaging observations. The inner, larger planet has a radius of

outer, smaller planet has a radius of $R=1.56_{-0.13}^{+0.15}$ R$_{\oplus}$ on
an 18.8-day orbit. The data are found to be consistent with circular, co-planar
and stable orbits that are weakly influenced by the 2:1 mean motion resonance.
Our TTV analysis of the combined dataset enables model-independent constraints

data-driven parametrisations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical
models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to
provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of
high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrisation using direct
data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations.
  The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data
assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the
system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is
viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to
emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the
system. Finally, the ML-based parametrisation model is added to the physical
core truncated model to produce a hybrid model.
  The DA component of the proposed method relies on an ensemble Kalman filter
while the ML parametrisation is represented by a neural network. The approach
is applied to the two-scale Lorenz model and to MAOOAM, a reduced-order coupled
ocean-atmosphere model. We show that in both cases the hybrid model yields
forecasts with better skill than the truncated model. Moreover, the attractor
of the system is significantly better represented by the hybrid model than by
the truncated model.

performance under all other acoustic conditions. Besides, this model must be
tiny, fast, and perform inference in a streaming fashion, in order to have
minimal impact on CPU, memory, battery and latency. We propose novel techniques
to meet these multi-faceted requirements, including using a new asymmetric
loss, and adopting adaptive runtime suppression strength. We also show that
such a model can be quantized as a 8-bit integer model and run in realtime.

build Barabasi-Albert model networks with different modularity by a new ad hoc
algorithm that rewire links forming networks with community structure. We
traced the network robustness using the largest connected component (LCC). We
find that higher level of modularity decreases the model network robustness
under both attack strategies, i.e. model network with higher community
structure showed faster LCC disruption when subjected to node removal. Very
interesting, we find that when model networks showed non-modular structure or
low modularity, the degree-based (ID) is more effective than the
betweenness-based node attack strategy (IB). Conversely, in the case the model
network present higher modularity, the IB strategies becomes clearly the most
effective to fragment the LCC. Last, we investigated how the modularity of the
network structure evaluated by the modularity indicator (Q) affect the
robustness and the efficacy of the attack strategies in 12 real-world social
networks. We found that the modularity Q is negatively correlated with the
robustness of the real-world social networks under IB node attack strategy
(p-value< 0.001). This result indicates how real-world networks with higher
modularity (i.e. with higher community structure) may be more fragile to
betwenness-based node attack. The results presented in this paper unveil the
role of modularity and community structure for the robustness of networks and
may be useful to select the best node attack strategies in network.

magneto-thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars in three dimensions with
account for neutrino emission, obtained with the pseudo-spectral code Parody.
We investigate both the secular evolution, especially in connection with the
onset of instabilities during the Hall phase, and the short-term evolution
following episodes of localised energy injection. Simulations show that a
resistive tearing instability develops in about a Hall time if the initial
toroidal field exceeds ~$10^{15}$ G. This leads to crustal failures because of
the huge magnetic stresses coupled with the local temperature enhancement
produced by dissipation. Localised heat deposition in the crust results in the
appearance of hot spots on the star surface which can exhibit a variety of
patterns. Since the transport properties are strongly influenced by the
magnetic field, the hot regions tend to drift away and get deformed following
the magnetic field lines while cooling. The shapes obtained with our
simulations are reminiscent of those recently derived from NICER X-ray
observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J0030+0451.

more than 45 years, extensive-form correlation is still generally not well
understood. Part of the reason for this gap is that the sequential nature of
extensive-form games allows for a richness of behaviors and incentives that are
not possible in normal-form settings. This richness translates to a
significantly different complexity landscape surrounding extensive-form
correlated equilibria. As of today, it is known that finding an optimal
extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE), extensive-form coarse correlated
equilibrium (EFCCE), or normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE) in a
two-player extensive-form game is computationally tractable when the game does
not include chance moves, and intractable when the game involves chance moves.
In this paper we significantly refine this complexity threshold by showing
that, in two-player games, an optimal correlated equilibrium can be computed in
polynomial time, provided that a certain condition is satisfied. We show that
the condition holds, for example, when all chance moves are public, that is,
both players observe all chance moves. This implies that an optimal EFCE, EFCCE
and NFCCE can be computed in polynomial time in the game size in two-player
games with public chance moves, providing the biggest positive complexity
result surrounding extensive-form correlation in more than a decade.

We propose two modeling approaches that generate solutions that are robust to

where deviations in qualification requirements are bounded by a constraint. In
the first approach, we aggregate uncertain constraints to ensure that the total
number of job qualifications present at a job is not less than a worst-case
value. We show that these values can be computed beforehand, resulting in a
robust model with little additional complexity compared with the nominal model.
In our second approach, we bound the overall qualification deviation over all
jobs. While this approach is more complex, we show that it is still possible to
derive a compact problem formulation by using a linear programming formulation

possibility of current observational facilities being able to capture
planet-formation in action. Over the last decade, our understanding of the

observations have shown that subtle perturbations in the kinematic structure of
protoplanetary disks are found in multiple sources, potentially the
characteristic disturbances associated with embedded planets. In this work, we
review the theoretical background of planet-disk interactions, focusing on the
kinematical features, and the current methodologies used to observe these
interactions in spatially and spectrally resolved observations. We discuss the
potential pit falls of such kinematical detections of planets, providing
best-practices for imaging and analysing interferometric data, along with a set
of criteria to use as a benchmark for any claimed detection of embedded
planets. We finish with a discussion on the current state of simulations in

21 upper limits, up to $J=10$) and six [C I] ${^3P}_1 \rightarrow {^3P}_0$ and

range in excitation in their mid-$J=4,5$ and high-$J=7,8$ lines, on average
lower than ($L_{\rm IR}$-brighter) BzK-color- and submillimeter-selected

not necessarily prevalent in gas mass-selected galaxies at $z=1.2$. We use
stacking and Large Velocity Gradient models to measure and predict the average
CO ladders at $z<2$ and $z\geq2$, finding $r_{21}=0.75 \pm 0.11$ and
$r_{31}=0.77 \pm 0.14$, respectively. From the models, we infer that the

This fits a picture in which the global excitation is driven by an increase in
the star formation rate surface density of galaxies with redshift. We derive a
neutral atomic carbon abundance of $(1.9 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-5}$, comparable
to the Milky Way and main-sequence galaxies at similar redshifts, and fairly
high densities ($\geq 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$), consistent with the low-$J$ CO

(RL) in the context of discrete-time linear-quadratic mean-field games
(LQ-MFGs). Our setting differs from most existing work on RL for MFGs, in that
we consider a non-stationary MFG over an infinite horizon. We propose an
actor-critic algorithm to iteratively compute the mean-field equilibrium (MFE)
of the LQ-MFG. There are two primary challenges: i) the non-stationarity of the
MFG induces a linear-quadratic tracking problem, which requires solving a
backwards-in-time (non-causal) equation that cannot be solved by standard
(causal) RL algorithms; ii) Many RL algorithms assume that the states are
sampled from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain (MC), that is, the
chain is already mixed, an assumption that is not satisfied for real data
sources. We first identify that the mean-field trajectory follows linear
dynamics, allowing the problem to be reformulated as a linear quadratic
Gaussian problem. Under this reformulation, we propose an actor-critic
algorithm that allows samples to be drawn from an unmixed MC. Finite-sample
convergence guarantees for the algorithm are then provided. To characterize the
performance of our algorithm in multi-agent RL, we have developed an error
bound with respect to the Nash equilibrium of the finite-population game.

the bounce-back (BB) boundary, which corresponds to the no-slip boundary. The
BB boundary prevents the LBM from capturing the accurate shear drag on the wall
when addressing high Reynolds number flows using coarse-grid systems. In this
study, we proposed a ""wall-function bounce (WFB)"" boundary that incorporates a
wall function into the LBM's boundary condition and overcomes the limitation of
the BB. The WFB boundary calculates the appropriate shear drag on the wall
using a wall function model, and thereafter modifies distribution functions to
reflect the shear drag. The Spalding's law was utilized as the wall function in
WFB. Simulations of turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau}$=640 and 2003 using
the LBM-based large-eddy simulation (LBM-LES) were conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed boundary condition. The results indicate that the
BB boundary underestimated the time-averaged velocity in the buffer layer at
$Re_{\tau}$=640, and the averaged velocity in the entire domain at
$Re_{\tau}$=2003, when using coarse-grid systems. However, WFB obtained the
proper shear drag on the wall and thus, compensated for the underestimation and
agreed better with the experimental or DNS data, especially at the first-layer
grid. In addition, WFB improved the Reynolds normal stress in the near-wall
region to some extent. The distributions of shear stress on the wall by WFB was
analogous to those by the wall model function in the finite volume method.

detectability is always confirmed, and it is highlighted, especially in the
cases that the shot noise level is large and that target statistical anisotropy
has a blue-tilted shape in Fourier space. The application of the TripoSH-based

fit the aLIGO strain and chirp data with lower mass, compact coalescing binary
systems such as neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS), black hole - neutron star
(BH-NS), and black hole-black hole (BH-BH) systems. In MOG BH - BH component
masses can be smaller than the component masses $m_1=85M_\odot$ and
$m_2=66M_\odot$ inferred from the aLIGO GW190521 gravitational wave event. This
reduces the mass of the final remnant mass $M_f=150M_\odot$ and allows the

conventional stellar collapse models.

cancellation from spatial domain. To develop electronic countermeasures against

paper. In the RASS jammer, elements of the array antenna are activated
randomly, leading to stable mainlobe and random sidelobes, different from the
traditional jammer that applies the complete antenna array enjoying constant
mainlobe and sidelobes. We study the covariance matrix of jamming signals
received by radars, and derive its rank, revealing that the covariance matrix
is of full rank. We also calculate the output jamming to signal and noise ratio
(JSNR) after the subspace-based jamming suppression methods used in MSRS under
the proposed jamming method, which demonstrates that the full rank property
invalidates such suppression methods. Numerical results verify our analytical

transverse waves has been proposed as a possible way to convert magnetic energy
into thermal energy but increasingly, MHD models suggest this is not a
sufficiently efficient mechanism. We model heating by phase-mixing of
transverse MHD waves in various configurations, to investigate whether certain
circumstances can enhance the heating sufficiently to sustain the million
degree solar corona and to assess the impact of the propagation and
phase-mixing of transverse MHD waves on the structure of the boundary shell of
coronal loops. We use 3D MHD simulations of a pre-existing density enhancement
in magnetised medium and a boundary driver to trigger the propagation of
transverse waves with the same power spectrum as measured by the COmP. We
consider different density structures, boundary conditions at the non-drive
footpoint, characteristics of the driver, and different forms of magnetic
resistivity. We find that different initial density structures affect the
evolution of the boundary shell and some driver configurations enhance the
heating generated from the dissipation of the MHD waves. In particular, drivers
coherent on a larger spatial scale and higher dissipation coefficients generate
significant heating, although it is still insufficient. We conclude that while
phase-mixing of transverse MHD waves is unlikely to sustain the thermal
structure of the corona, there are configurations that allow for an enhanced
efficiency of this mechanism. We provide possible signatures to identify the
presence of such configurations, such as the location of where the heating is
deposited along the coronal loop

AlphaZero provides an alternative in silico means of game balance assessment.
It is a system that can learn near-optimal strategies for any rule set from
scratch, without any human supervision, by continually learning from its own
experience. In this study we use AlphaZero to creatively explore and design new

percentage of draws in professional play, and the non-negligible number of
games that end while both players are still in their home preparation. We
compare nine other variants that involve atomic changes to the rules of chess.
The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while
keeping the games close to the original. By learning near-optimal strategies
for each variant with AlphaZero, we determine what games between strong human
players might look like if these variants were adopted. Qualitatively, several
variants are very dynamic. An analytic comparison show that pieces are valued
differently between variants, and that some variants are more decisive than

(PCA) on the measured X-ray parameters shows that while the X-ray Eddington
ratio is the main source of variations within our sample (PC1), variations in
the soft and hard excesses form the second principal component (PC2) and it is
dominated by the NLS1s. The correlation between the soft and hard excess in
NLS1 galaxies may suggest a common origin for the two components, such as a
blurred reflection model. The presented Suzaku sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies is
a useful tool for analysis of the X-ray properties of AGN, and for the study of
the soft and hard excesses observed in AGN.

phenomenon that when neural networks are trained on a sequence of tasks they
rapidly forget previously learned tasks. It has been observed that catastrophic
forgetting is most severe when tasks are dissimilar to each other. We propose
the use of sparse routing networks for continual learning. For each input,
these network architectures activate a different path through a network of
experts. Routing networks have been shown to learn to route similar tasks to
overlapping sets of experts and dissimilar tasks to disjoint sets of experts.
In the continual learning context this behaviour is desirable as it minimizes
interference between dissimilar tasks while allowing positive transfer between
related tasks. In practice, we find it is necessary to develop a new training
method for routing networks, which we call co-training which avoids poorly
initialized experts when new tasks are presented. When combined with a small
episodic memory replay buffer, sparse routing networks with co-training
outperform densely connected networks on the MNIST-Permutations and
MNIST-Rotations benchmarks.

(pPDEs) in, e.g. optimization or interactive applications, makes it imperative
to design highly efficient and equally accurate surrogate models. The reduced
basis method (RBM) presents as such an option. Enabled by a mathematically
rigorous error estimator, RBM constructs a low-dimensional subspace of the
parameter-induced high fidelity solution manifold from which an approximate
solution is computed. It can improve efficiency by several orders of magnitudes
leveraging an offline-online decomposition procedure. However, this
decomposition, usually through the empirical interpolation method (EIM) when
the PDE is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, is either
challenging to implement, or severely degrades online efficiency.
  In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct solver, as
opposed to an assistant, for solving nonlinear pPDEs on the reduced level. The
resulting method, called Reduced Over-Collocation method (ROC), is stable and
capable of avoiding the efficiency degradation inherent to a traditional
application of EIM. Two critical ingredients of the scheme are collocation at
about twice as many locations as the dimension of the reduced solution space,
and an efficient L1-norm-based error indicator for the strategic selection of
the parameter values to build the reduced solution space. Together, these two
ingredients render the proposed L1-ROC scheme both offline- and
online-efficient. A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation
appearing in alternative RBM approaches that utilize EIM for nonlinear and
nonaffine problems is circumvented, both in the offline and online stages.
Numerical tests on different families of time-dependent and steady-state
nonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of L1-ROC and
its superior stability performance.

multiple variables, especially for those typically solved by an alternating
minimization (AM) strategy that splits the original optimization problem into a
set of sub-problems corresponding to each variable, and then iteratively
optimize each sub-problem using a fixed updating rule. However, due to the
intrinsic non-convexity of the original optimization problem, the optimization
can usually be trapped into spurious local minimum even when each sub-problem
can be optimally solved at each iteration. Meanwhile, learning-based
approaches, such as deep unfolding algorithms, are highly limited by the lack
of labelled data and restricted explainability. To tackle these issues, we
propose a meta-learning based alternating minimization (MLAM) method, which
aims to minimize a partial of the global losses over iterations instead of
carrying minimization on each sub-problem, and it tends to learn an adaptive
strategy to replace the handcrafted counterpart resulting in advance on
superior performance. Meanwhile, the proposed MLAM still maintains the original
algorithmic principle, which contributes to a better interpretability. We
evaluate the proposed method on two representative problems, namely, bi-linear
inverse problem: matrix completion, and non-linear problem: Gaussian mixture
models. The experimental results validate that our proposed approach
outperforms AM-based methods in standard settings, and is able to achieve
effective optimization in challenging cases while other comparing methods would
typically fail.

their shared latent semantic space. Then these message-level generalized MMD
distances are synthesized by newly proposed mixed instance kernels to
user-level distances. We finally minimize the distances between the samples of
the partially-matched classes from these two domains. In order to solve the

demonstrated that our model outperformed the baselines by a large margin under
six metrics. Case studies showed that formal reports and extracted

limits the accuracy of models employed for visual data analytics. In this

automatically detects and recovers from drift. ODIN uses adversarial
autoencoders to learn the distribution of high-dimensional images. We present
an unsupervised algorithm for detecting drift by comparing the distributions of
the given data against that of previously seen data. When ODIN detects drift,
it invokes a drift recovery algorithm to deploy specialized models tailored
towards the novel data points. These specialized models outperform their
non-specialized counterpart on accuracy, performance, and memory footprint.
Lastly, we present a model selection algorithm for picking an ensemble of
best-fit specialized models to process a given input. We evaluate the efficacy

decrease the number of required energy and gradient evaluations.

084029 (2020)], we investigate the shadow behaviors of rotating Hayward-de
Sitter black hole for static observers at a finite distance in terms of
astronomical observables. This paper uses the newly introduced distortion
parameter in [arXiv:2006.00685] to describe the shadow's shape quantitatively.
We show that the spin parameter would distort shadows and the magnetic monopole
charge would increase the degree of deformation. At the same time, the
distortion could be relieved because of the cosmological constant and the
distortion would increase with the distance from the black hole. Besides, the
spin parameter, magnetic monopole charge and cosmological constant increase
will cause the shadow to shrink.

  the Effects of Heterogeneous Memory on Performance",,,,,"cs.MA econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce an agent-based model of delegation relationships between a
principal and an agent, which is based on the standard-hidden action model
introduced by Holmstr\""om and, by doing so, provide a model which can be used
to further explore theoretical topics in managerial economics, such as the
efficiency of incentive mechanisms. We employ the concept of agentization,
i.e., we systematically transform the standard hidden-action model into an
agent-based model. Our modeling approach allows for a relaxation of some of the
rather ""heroic"" assumptions included in the standard hidden-action model,
whereby we particularly focus on assumptions related to the (i) availability of
information about the environment and the (ii) principal's and agent's
cognitive capabilities (with a particular focus on their learning capabilities
and their memory). Our analysis focuses on how close and how fast the incentive
scheme, which endogenously emerges from the agent-based model, converges to the
solution proposed by the standard hidden-action model. Also, we investigate
whether a stable solution can emerge from the agent-based model variant. The
results show that in stable environments the emergent result can nearly reach
the solution proposed by the standard hidden-action model. Surprisingly, the
results indicate that turbulence in the environment leads to stability in
earlier time periods.

  Digital Marketing Campaigns",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Campaign is a frequently employed instrument in lifting up the GMV (Gross
Merchandise Volume) of retailer in traditional marketing. As its counterpart in
online context, digital-marketing-campaign (DMC) has being trending in recent
years with the rapid development of the e-commerce. However, how to empower
massive sellers on the online retailing platform the capacity of applying
combined multiple digital marketing campaigns to boost their shops' revenue, is
still a novel topic. In this work, a comprehensive solution of generating
optimized combined multiple DMCs is presented. Firstly, a potential
personalized DMC pool is generated for every retailer by a newly proposed
neural network model, i.e. the DMCNet (Digital-Marketing-Campaign Net).
Secondly, based on the sub-modular optimization theory and the DMC pool by
DMCNet, the generated combined multiple DMCs are ranked with respect to their
revenue generation strength then the top three ranked campaigns are returned to
the sellers' back-end management system, so that retailers can set combined
multiple DMCs for their online shops just in one-shot. Real online A/B-test
shows that with the integrated solution, sellers of the online retailing
platform increase their shops' GMVs with approximately 6$\%$.

behavioral adjustments have been unavoidable to stay viable. In this paper, we
employ a data-centric approach to investigate individual mobility adaptations
and mask-wearing in Seoul, South Korea. We first identify six epidemic phases
and two waves based on COVID-19 case count and its geospatial dispersion. The
phase-specific linear models reveal the strong, self-driven mobility reductions
in the first escalation and peak with a common focus on public transit use and
less-essential weekend/afternoon trips. However, comparable reduction was not
present in the second wave, as the shifted focus from mobility to mask-wearing
was evident. Although no lockdowns and gentle nudge to wear mask seemed
counter-intuitive, simple and persistent communication on personal safety has
been effective and sustainable to induce cooperative behavioral adaptations.
Our phase-specific analyses and interpretation highlight the importance of
targeted response consistent with the fluctuating epidemic risk.

  Characteristic Mode Theory","23 pages, 5 Figures",,,,"eess.SP physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  This work introduces a theoretical extension of the characteristic mode
formulation for analysing the vertical electric dipole lying above a lossy
dielectric half-space. As the conventional characteristic formulation fails to
maintain the orthogonality of the characteristic field modes over the infinite
sphere, an alternate modal formulation is proposed here to maintain the
orthogonality for both the current and field modes. The modal results are found
to match closely with its method of moment counterparts. Later, the modes of an
isolated dipole with no ground plane have been used to predict the role of the
lossy ground plane through a theory of the linear combination of the
eigenvectors. The proposed formulations have been studied with different
heights from the ground plane and are compared with the direct modal solutions
to validate its accuracy. It helps to provide a thorough understanding of how
the isolated modes interact among each other to constitute the perturbed modes
in the presence of the lossy half-space. It can find application to include the
lossy earth effect in the study of the lightning fields and the path loss
modelling of the antennas over the lossy ground.
