large enough times the probability distribution agrees exactly with the
prediction of Random Matrix Theory if one identifies the appropriate ensemble
of random matrices. We find that this ensemble is not the circular orthogonal
one - composed of symmetric random unitary matrices and associated with
time-reversal-invariant evolution operators - but is an ensemble of random
matrices on a more restricted symmetric space (depending on the parity of the
number of sites this space is either ${Sp(N)/U(N)}$ or
${O(2N)/{O(N)\!\times\!O(N)}}$). Even if the latter ensembles yield the same
averaged spectral form factor as the circular orthogonal ensemble they show
substantially enhanced fluctuations. This behaviour is due to a recently
identified additional anti-unitary symmetry of the self-dual kicked Ising
model.

providing an expression for the propagator in closed form. In all other cases,
the iteration results in an approximation that holds for times smaller than

distribution that is not described by the commonly assumed lognormal, showing
that this conclusion remains valid, particularly for narrow peaks where the
shape of the mass distribution is insensitive to the peak properties and
critical collapse determines a minimum width. We propose some alternative
models that may better describe the shape, both for the narrow peak case and
for much broader peaks where the effect of the peak shape is significant. We
highlight the skew-lognormal and a generalised model motivated by the physics
of critical collapse as the best of these possible alternatives. These models
can be used as an accurate and fast approximation to the numerically calculated
mass distribution, allowing for efficient implementation in an MCMC analysis.
We advocate the use of one of these two models instead of the lognormal with
sufficiently accurate data, such as future LIGO-Virgo observations, or when
considering strongly mass dependent constraints on the PBH abundance.

design. The learning to rank (LTR) framework models this problem as a
sequential problem of selecting lists of content and observing where users
decide to click. Most previous work on LTR assumes that the user considers each
item in the list in isolation, and makes binary choices to click or not on
each. We introduce a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model to the LTR framework,
which captures the behaviour of users who consider the ordered list of items as
a whole and make a single choice among all the items and a no-click option.
Under the MNL model, the user favours items which are either inherently more
attractive, or placed in a preferable position within the list. We propose
upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms to minimise regret in two settings -
where the position dependent parameters are known, and unknown. We present
theoretical analysis leading to an $\Omega(\sqrt{JT})$ lower bound for the

in the known-parameter setting, and an $\tilde{O}(K^2\sqrt{JT})$ upper bound on

Separately, Gottesman and Knill showed that if all gates are restricted to be
Clifford, then there is a polynomial time simulation. We combine these two
ideas and show that treewidth and planarity can be exploited to improve
Clifford circuit simulation. Our main result is a classical algorithm with
runtime scaling asymptotically as $n^{\omega/2}<n^{1.19}$ which samples from
the output distribution obtained by measuring all $n$ qubits of a planar graph
state in given Pauli bases. Here $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication
exponent. We also provide a classical algorithm with the same asymptotic
runtime which samples from the output distribution of any constant-depth
Clifford circuit in a planar geometry. Our work improves known classical
algorithms with cubic runtime. A key ingredient is a mapping which, given a
tree decomposition of some graph $G$, produces a Clifford circuit with a
structure that mirrors the tree decomposition and which emulates measurement of
the corresponding graph state. We provide a classical simulation of this
circuit with the runtime stated above for planar graphs and otherwise

chemical deposition and plankton sensitivity to small chemical gradients are
crucial parameters that drive nonlinear pattern formation in the plankton

metrics that help define the loss of known information while transferring data
through a noisy channel. These metrics cannot be used for quantifying the
opposite process: the harvesting of new information. Correlation functions and
correlation coefficients do play an important role in collecting new
information from noisy sources. However, Bershad and Rockmore [1974] based
their formulas on contradictory a priori assumptions in Real-space and in
Fourier-space. Their formulations were subsequently copied literally to the
practical science of electron microscopy, where those a priori assumptions now
distort most quality metrics in Cryo-EM. Cryo-EM became a great success in
recent years [Wiley Award 2017; Nobel prize for Chemistry 2017] and became the
method of choice for revealing structures of biological complexes like
ribosomes, viruses, or corona-virus spikes, vitally important during the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Those early misconceptions now interfere with the
objective comparison of independently obtained results. We found that the roots
of these problems significantly pre-date those 1970s publications and were
already inherent in the original SNR definitions. We here propose novel metrics
to assess the amount of information harvested in an experiment, information
which is measured in bits. These new metrics assess the total amount of
information collected on an object, as well as the information density
distribution within that object. The new metrics can be applied everywhere
where data is collected, processed, compressed, or compared. As an example, we
compare the structures of two recently published SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We
also introduce new metrics for transducer-quality assessment in many sciences
including: cryo-EM, biomedical imaging, microscopy, signal processing,
photography, tomography, etc.

discover strong disorder-phonon coupling. This breaks global symmetry and
dramatically suppresses phonon-lifetimes compared to alloying alone, providing
an additional design strategy for phonon engineering. These findings have

targets in novel indoor environments with near-perfect accuracy. However, these
agents are equipped with idealized sensors for localization and take
deterministic actions. This setting is practically sterile by comparison to the
dirty reality of noisy sensors and actuations in the real world -- wheels can
slip, motion sensors have error, actuations can rebound. In this work, we take
a step towards this noisy reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that
rely on visual estimates of egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find
these agents outperform naive adaptions of current point-goal agents to this
setting as well as those incorporating classic localization baselines. Further,
our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics or odometry (where am
I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want to go?). This enables
a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot or floor type) by
simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model -- circumventing the expense of
re-training of the navigation policy. Our agent was the runner-up in the
PointNav track of CVPR 2020 Habitat Challenge.

TMC-1 in the Taurus region, using the Yebes 40 m telescope. The observed
C3N/C3N- and C5N/C5N- abundance ratios are 140 and 2, respectively; that is
similar to those found in the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich star
IRC+10216. Although the formation mechanisms for the neutrals are different in
interstellar (ion-neutral reactions) and circumstellar clouds
(photodissociation and radical-neutral reactions), the similarity of the
C3N/C3N- and C5N/C5N- abundance ratios strongly suggests a common chemical path
for the formation of these anions in interstellar and circumstellar clouds. We
discuss the role of radiative electronic attachment, reactions between N atoms
and carbon chain anions Cn-, and that of H- reactions with HC3N and HC5N as
possible routes to form CnN-. The detection of C5N- in TMC-1 gives strong
support for assigning to this anion the lines found in IRC+10216, as it
excludes the possibility of a metal-bearing species, or a vibrationally excited
state. New sets of rotational parameters have been derived from the observed
frequencies in TMC-1 and IRC+10216 for C5N- and the neutral radical C5N.

freedom, the generalized SU(2) Proca theory (GSU2P for short) is the
non-Abelian version of the well-known generalized Proca theory where the action
is invariant under global transformations of the SU(2) group. This theory was
formulated for the first time in Phys. Rev. D 94 (2016) 084041, having
implemented the required primary constraint-enforcing relation to make the
Lagrangian degenerate and remove one degree of freedom from the vector field in
accordance with the irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group. It was
later shown in Phys. Rev. D 101 (2020) 045008, ibid 045009, that a secondary
constraint-enforcing relation, which trivializes for the generalized Proca
theory but not for the SU(2) version, was needed to close the constraint
algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to implement this secondary
constraint-enforcing relation in GSU2P and to make the construction of the
theory more transparent. Since several terms in the Lagrangian were dismissed
in Phys. Rev. D 94 (2016) 084041 via their equivalence to other terms through
total derivatives, not all of the latter satisfying the secondary
constraint-enforcing relation, the work was not so simple as directly applying
this relation to the resultant Lagrangian pieces of the old theory. Thus, we
were motivated to reconstruct the theory from scratch. In the process, we found
the beyond GSU2P.

Way, as well as in nearby Galaxies. Thanks to their highly variable emissions
and complex phenomenology, they have attracted the interest of the high energy
astrophysical community since the dawn of X-ray Astronomy. In more recent
years, they have challenged our comprehension of physical processes in many
more energy bands, ranging from the infrared to very high energies. In this
review, we provide a broad but concise summary of the physical processes
dominating the emission from high mass X-ray binaries across virtually the
whole electromagnetic spectrum. These comprise the interaction of stellar winds
with the high gravitational and magnetic fields of compact objects, the
behaviour of matter under extreme magnetic and gravity conditions, and the
perturbation of the massive star evolutionary processes by presence in a binary
system. We highlight the role of the INTEGRAL mission in the discovery of many
of the most interesting objects in the high mass X-ray binary class and its
contribution in reviving the interest for these sources over the past two
decades. We show how the INTEGRAL discoveries have not only contributed to
significantly increase the number of high mass X-ray binaries known, thus
advancing our understanding of the population as a whole, but also have opened
new windows of investigation that stimulated the multi-wavelength approach
nowadays common in most astrophysical research fields. We conclude the review
by providing an overview of future facilities being planned from the X-ray to
the very high energy domain that will hopefully help us in finding an answer to
the many questions left open after more than 18 years of INTEGRAL scientific
observations.

subwavelength circular motion of water particles. Thus, we directly observe

the proof of the fact that every normalized basic sequence has a subsequence
which generates a spreading model (the Brunel-Sucheston Theorem). Based on this
application, as an intermediate step, we can talk about the notion of
$(k,\varepsilon)-$oscillation stable sequence, which will be described and
analyzed more generally in this article. Indeed, we introduce the notion
$((\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block oscillation stable sequence where
$(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k$ is a finite sequence of barriers and using what we
will call blocks of barriers. In particular, we prove that the Ramsey Theorem
is equivalent to the statement ``for every finite sequence

normalized sequence $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ there is a subsequence

$((\mathcal{B}_i\cap\mathcal{P}(M))_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block oscillation

Besides, we introduce the $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}-$block asymptotic
model of a normalized basic sequence where $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$
is a sequence of barriers. These models are a generalization of the spreading
models and are related to the $((\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block
oscillation stable sequences. We show that the Brunel-Sucheston is satisfied
for the $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}-$block asymptotic models, and we also
prove that this result is equivalent to the Ramsey Theorem. The difference
between our theorem and the Brunel-Sucheston Theorem is based on the number of
different models that are obtained from the same normalized basic sequence

using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, with the aim of characterizing the
cross-over from emergent U(1) symmetry at the transition (for $q \ge 4$) to
$Z_q$ symmetry of the ordered state. We also study classical three-dimensional
clock models with spatial anisotropy corresponding to the space-time anisotropy
of the quantum systems. The U(1) to ${Z_q}$ symmetry cross-over in all these
systems is governed by a dangerously irrelevant operator. We specifically study
$q=5$ and $q=6$ models with different forms of the quantum fluctuations and
different anisotropies in the classical models. We find the expected classical
XY critical exponents and scaling dimensions $y_q$ of the clock fields.
However, the initial weak violation of the U(1) symmetry in the ordered phase,
characterized by a $Z_q$ symmetric order parameter $\phi_q$, scales in an
unexpected way. As a function of the system size $L$, close to the critical
temperature $\phi_q \propto L^p$, where the known value of the exponent is
$p=2$ in the classical isotropic clock model. In contrast, for strongly
anisotropic classical models and the quantum models we find $p=3$. For weakly
anisotropic classical models we observe a cross-over from $p=2$ to $p=3$
scaling. The exponent $p$ directly impacts the exponent $\nu'$ governing the
divergence of the U(1) to $Z_q$ cross-over length scale $\xi'$ in the
thermodynamic limit, according to the relationship $\nu'=\nu(1+|y_q|/p)$, where
$\nu$ is the conventional correlation length exponent. We present a
phenomenological argument based on an anomalous renormalization of the clock
field in the presence of anisotropy, possibly as a consequence of topological
(vortex) line defects.

dark matter simulations populated with galaxies up to redshift $z=1$ to test
the performance of this estimator. We find that phase differences are sensitive
to the absolute value of the second order bias ($c_2=b_2/b_1$), and demonstrate
why this is the case. For a $\sim$1500 sq. deg. galaxy survey we recover $c_2$
with an error of approximately $0.1$ for a wide range of $c_2$ values; current
constraints from redshift surveys have errors of 0.1-0.6 depending on redshift.
This new statistic is therefore expected to provide constraints for $c_2$ which
are complementary and competitive with constraining power by the conventional
estimators from the power spectrum and bispectrum. For the Dark Energy Survey

failed for the same underlying reasons, so that they can be treated more
effectively, and investigate the following questions: (1) Does an approach
developed to identify problems in system logs generalize to identifying
problems in continuous deployment logs? (2) How does dimensionality reduction
affect the quality of automated log clustering? (3) How does the criterion used
for merging clusters in the clustering algorithm affect clustering quality?
  Method: We replicate and extend earlier work on clustering system log files
to assess its generalization to continuous deployment logs. We consider the
optional inclusion of one of these dimensionality reduction techniques:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Moreover, we consider three

Weighted Linkage), in addition to the Complete Linkage criterion used in
earlier work. We empirically evaluate the 16 resulting configurations on

  Results: Our study shows that (1) identifying problems in continuous
deployment logs via clustering is feasible, (2) including NMF significantly
improves overall accuracy and robustness, and (3) Complete Linkage performs
best of all merge criteria analyzed.
  Conclusions: We conclude that problem identification via automated log
clustering is improved by including dimensionality reduction, as it decreases
the pipeline's sensitivity to parameter choice, thereby increasing its
robustness for handling different inputs.

  Term Frequency based Approach","6 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  User-generated reviews serve as crucial references in shopper's
decision-making process. Moreover, they improve product sales and validate the
reputation of the website as a whole. Thus, it becomes important to design
reviews ranking methods that help shoppers make informed decisions quickly.
However, reviews ranking has its unique challenges. First, there is no
relevance labels for reviews. A relevant review for shopper A might not be
relevant to shopper B. Second, since shoppers cannot click on reviews, we have
no ways of getting relevance feedback. Eventually, reviews ranking suffers from
the lack of ground truth due to the variability in the standard of relevance
for different users. In this paper, we aim to address the challenges of helping
users to find information they might be interested in from the sea of customer
reviews. Using the Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset collected and organized by
UCSD, we first constructed user profiles based on user's personal web trails,
recent shopping history and previous reviews, incorporated user profiles into
our ranking algorithm, and assigned higher ranks to reviews that address
individual shopper's concerns to the largest extent. Also, we leveraged user
profiles to recommend products based on reviews texts. We evaluated our model
based on both empirical evaluations and numerical evaluations of review scores.
The results from both evaluation methods reveal a significant increase in the
quality of top reviews as well as user satisfaction for over 1000 products. Our
reviews based recommendation system also suggests that there's a large chance
of user viewing and liking the product we recommend. Our work shows the basic
steps of developing a ranking method that learns from a particular end-user's
preferences.

the perception of local structures. Local subspaces are fitted by
multidimensional ellipses that are spanned by basis vectors. An accurate and
efficient vector transformation method is proposed based on analytical
differentiation of multidimensional projections formulated as implicit
functions. The results are visualized as glyphs and analyzed using a full set
of specifically-designed interactions supported in our efficient web-based

graphs in $\widetilde{O}(m^{4/3+o(1)}U^{1/3})$ time. Our algorithm is inspired
by potential reduction interior point methods for linear programming. Instead
of using scaled gradient/Newton steps of a potential function, we take the step
which maximizes the decrease in the potential value subject to advancing a
certain amount on the central path, which can be efficiently computed. This
allows us to trace the central path with our progress depending only
$\ell_\infty$ norm bounds on the congestion vector (as opposed to the $\ell_4$
norm required by previous works) and runs in $O(\sqrt{m})$ iterations. To
improve the number of iterations by establishing tighter bounds on the
$\ell_\infty$ norm, we then consider the weighted central path framework of
Madry \cite{M13,M16,CMSV17} and Liu-Sidford \cite{LS20}. Instead of changing
weights to maximize energy, we consider finding weights which maximize the
maximum decrease in potential value. Finally, similar to finding weights which
maximize energy as done in \cite{LS20} this problem can be solved by the
iterative refinement framework for smoothed $\ell_2$-$\ell_p$ norm flow
problems \cite{KPSW19} completing our algorithm. We believe our potential
reduction based viewpoint provides a versatile framework which may lead to
faster algorithms for max flow.

hydrogen target. The measurement covers the range 5.0 GeV/$c^2$ $< W <$ 17.0

exchanged photon, $W$ the mass of the final hadronic system and $p_T$ the
transverse momentum of the $\omega$ meson with respect to the virtual-photon
direction. The measured non-zero SDMEs for the transitions of transversely
polarised virtual photons to longitudinally polarised vector mesons
($\gamma^*_T \to V_L$) indicate a violation of $s$-channel helicity
conservation. Additionally, we observe a sizeable contribution of
unnatural-parity-exchange (UPE) transitions that decreases with increasing $W$.
The results provide important input for modelling Generalised Parton

model-dependent way the contribution of UPE transitions and assess the role of
parton helicity-flip GPDs in exclusive $\omega$ production.

calculate the entanglement entropy at zero temperature as well as the mutual
information and the entanglement negativity at finite temperatures between the

described within Luttinger-liquid theory. Our results show that the
entanglement entropy diverges when one approaches the limit of stability, the

mutual information reaches a finite value in the infinite-temperature limit,
which is the consequence of the infinite linear electron spectrum of Luttinger
theory. The entanglement negativity becomes exactly zero above a certain
temperature, i.e., the lattice and the electrons become non-entangled above
this temperature. If the electron-electron interaction is unscreened or weakly
screened, this characteristic temperature diverges with the system size.
However, if the interaction is strongly screened the characteristic temperature
is finite and independent of the system size.

non-trivial functions of a conformal cross ratio and are constrained to obey a
crossing equation. After reviewing basic facts about the structure of

junctions suffice to form two sides of the quantum metrology triangle, relating
frequency to either voltage or current, but not its base, which directly links

causal-inferential theory: a triple consisting of a theory of causal
influences, a theory of inferences (of both the Boolean and Bayesian
varieties), and a specification of how these interact. Recasting the notions of
operational and realist theories in this mold clarifies what a realist account
of an experiment offers beyond an operational account. It also yields a novel
characterization of the assumptions and implications of standard no-go theorems
for realist representations of operational quantum theory, namely, those based
on Bell's notion of locality and those based on generalized noncontextuality.
Moreover, our process-theoretic characterization of generalised
noncontextuality is shown to be implied by an even more natural principle which
we term Leibnizianity. Most strikingly, our framework offers a way forward in a
research program that seeks to circumvent these no-go results. Specifically, we
argue that if one can identify axioms for a realist causal-inferential theory
such that the notions of causation and inference can differ from their
conventional (classical) interpretations, then one has the means of defining an
intrinsically quantum notion of realism, and thereby a realist representation
of operational quantum theory that salvages the spirit of locality and of
noncontextuality.

HCO$^{+}$ 1-0 line emission data from the IRAM 30 m. The mm-RRLs reveal an

previously constrained the characteristic emission time-scales of different

metallicity. However, we omitted the effects of dust extinction. Here, we
extend our suite of SFR tracer emission time-scales by accounting for
extinction, using synthetic emission maps of a high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulation of an isolated, Milky-Way-like disc galaxy. The stellar feedback
included in the simulation is inefficient compared to observations, implying
that it represents a limiting case in which the duration of embedded star
formation (and the corresponding effect of extinction) is overestimated. Across
our experiments, we find that extinction mostly decreases the SFR tracer
emission time-scale, changing the time-scales by factors of 0.04-1.74,
depending on the gas column density. UV filters are more strongly affected than
H$\alpha$ filters. We provide the limiting correction factors as a function of
the gas column density and flux sensitivity limit for a wide variety of SFR
tracers. Applying these factors to observational characterisations of the
molecular cloud lifecycle produces changes that broadly fall within the quoted
uncertainties, except at high kpc-scale gas surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm
g}\gtrsim20~{\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}}}$). Under those conditions, correcting
for extinction may decrease the measured molecular cloud lifetimes and feedback
time-scales, which further strengthens previous conclusions that molecular
clouds live for a dynamical time and are dispersed by early, pre-supernova
feedback.

investigate the possibility of exploiting cosmic void statistics to disentangle
the degeneracies resulting from a proper combination of $f(R)$ modified gravity
and neutrino mass. We use N-body simulations to analyse the density profiles
and size function of voids traced by both dark matter particles and haloes. We
find clear evidence of the enhancement of gravity in $f(R)$ cosmologies in the
void density profiles at $z=1$. However, these effects can be almost completely
overridden by the presence of massive neutrinos because of their thermal
free-streaming. Despite the limited volume of the analysed simulations does not
allow us to achieve a statistically relevant abundance of voids larger than $40

as a deep potential well at large gravitational redshift relative to distant

speeds and can impart a significant Doppler shift to its electromagnetic
emission, sometimes resulting in a net observed blueshift at infinity. Thus, a
black hole broadens the line emission from monochromatic sources in its
vicinity into a smoothly decaying ""red wing""--whose flux vanishes at large
redshift--together with a ""blue blade"" that retains finite flux up to a sharp
edge corresponding to the maximum observable blueshift. In this paper, we study
the blue blade produced by isotropic monochromatic emitters on circular
equatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole, and obtain simple relations
describing how the maximum blueshift encodes black hole spin and inclination.
We find that small values of the maximum blueshift yield an excellent probe of
inclination, while larger values provide strong constraints on spin or

challenge in modern-day cosmology. We present a formalism to compress arbitrary
observables into a small number of bins by projection into a model-specific
subspace that minimizes the prior-averaged log-likelihood error. The lower
dimensionality leads to a dramatic reduction in covariance matrix noise,
significantly reducing the number of mocks that need to be computed. Given a
theory model, a set of priors, and a simple model of the covariance, our method
works by using singular value decompositions to construct a basis for the
observable that is close to Euclidean; by restricting to the first few basis
vectors, we can capture almost all the constraining power in a
lower-dimensional subspace. Unlike conventional approaches, the method can be
tailored for specific analyses and captures non-linearities that are not
present in the Fisher matrix, ensuring that the full likelihood can be
reproduced. The procedure is validated with full-shape analyses of power
spectra from BOSS DR12 mock catalogs, showing that the 96-bin power spectra can
be replaced by 12 subspace coefficients without biasing the output cosmology;
this allows for accurate parameter inference using only $\sim 100$ mocks. Such
decompositions facilitate accurate testing of power spectrum covariances; for
the largest BOSS data chunk, we find that: (a) analytic covariances provide
accurate models (with or without trispectrum terms); and (b) using the sample
covariance from the MultiDark-Patchy mocks incurs a $\sim 0.5\sigma$ shift in
$\Omega_m$, unless the subspace projection is applied. The method is easily
extended to higher order statistics; the $\sim 2000$-bin bispectrum can be
compressed into only $\sim 10$ coefficients, allowing for accurate analyses
using few mocks and without having to increase the bin sizes.

refinement (AMR) simulations of cosmological galaxy formation, and study its
impact on a simulated dwarf galaxy as part of the 'EDGE' project. The target
galaxy has a maximum circular velocity of 21 km/s but evolves in a region which
is moving at up to 90 km/s relative to the hydrodynamic grid. In the absence of
any mitigation, diffusion softens the filaments feeding our galaxy. As a
result, gas is unphysically held in the circumgalactic medium around the galaxy
for 320 Myr, delaying the onset of star formation until cooling and collapse
eventually triggers an initial starburst at z=9. Using genetic modification, we
produce 'velocity-zeroed' initial conditions in which the grid-relative
streaming is strongly suppressed; by design, the change does not significantly
modify the large scale structure or dark matter accretion history. The
resulting simulation recovers a more physical, gradual onset of star formation
starting at z=17. While the final stellar masses are nearly consistent ($4.8
\times 10^6\,M_\odot$ and $4.4\times 10^6\,M_\odot$ for unmodified and
velocity-zeroed respectively), the dynamical and morphological structure of the
z=0 dwarf galaxies are markedly different due to the contrasting histories. Our
approach to diffusion suppression is suitable for any AMR zoom cosmological
galaxy formation simulations, and is especially recommended for those of small
galaxies at high redshift.

and structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in these collisions and
also encodes information about how the wakes that jets excite in a droplet of
QGP form and relax. However, in experiment, one cannot know what a particular
jet in a heavy ion collision would have looked like without quenching, making
it difficult to interpret measurements in terms of individual jet modification.
The goal of this Monte Carlo study is to gain insight into the modification of
jet observables using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching as
a test bed. In this Monte Carlo study (but not in experiment) it is possible to
watch $\textit{the same jet}$ as it evolves in vacuum or in QGP. We use this
ability to disentangle the effects of modification of individual jets in heavy
ion collisions vs. the effects of differing selection bias on the distribution
of two observables: fractional energy loss and groomed $\Delta R$. We find that
in the hybrid model the distribution of groomed $\Delta R$ appears to be
unmodified in a sample of jets selected after quenching, as in heavy ion
collisions, and confirm that this lack of modification arises because of a
selection bias toward jets that lose only a small fraction of their energy. If
instead we select jets in a way that avoids this bias, and then follow these
selected jets as they are quenched, we show that there is, in fact, a
substantial modification of the $\Delta R$ of individual jets. We show that
this jet modification is principally due to the incorporation of particles
coming from the wake that the parton shower excites in the plasma as a
component of what an experimentalist reconstructs as a jet. The effects we
discuss are substantial in magnitude, suggesting that our qualitative
conclusions are more general than the Monte Carlo study in which we obtain
them.

result of relativistic effects occurring in jets pointing at a small angle with

the BL Lac parent population, having jets oriented at larger angles. According
to the ""unification scenario"" of AGNs, radio galaxies with low luminosity and
edge-darkened radio morphology are the most promising candidates to be the
parent population of BL Lacs. Here we compare the large-scale environment, an
orientation independent property, of well-defined samples of BL Lacs with
samples of radio-galaxies all lying in the local Universe. Our study reveals
that BL Lacs and radio galaxies live in significantly different environments,
challenging predictions of the unification scenario. We propose a solution to
this problem proving that large-scale environments of BL Lacs is statistically
consistent with that of compact radio-sources, known as FR0s, sharing similar
properties. This implies that highly relativistic jets are ubiquitous and are
the natural outcome of the accretion of gas into the deep gravitational
potential well produced by supermassive black holes.

Way and in nearby galaxies, show star-to-star variations in specific elements

MPs are not restricted to ancient clusters, with massive clusters down to
$\sim2$ Gyr showing signs of chemical variations. This suggests that young and
old clusters share the same formation mechanism but most of the work to date on
younger clusters has focused on N-variations. Initial studies even suggested
that younger clusters may not host spreads in other elements beyond N (e.g.,
Na), calling into question whether these abundance variations share the same
origin as in the older GCs. In this work, we combine HST photometry with
VLT/MUSE spectroscopy of a large sample of RGB stars (338) in the Large
Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 1978, the youngest globular to date with reported
MPs in the form of N-spreads. By combining the spectra of individual RGB stars
into N-normal and N-enhanced samples, based on the ""chromosome map"" derived
from HST, we search for mean abundance variations. Based on the NaD line, we
find a Na-difference of $\Delta$[Na/Fe]$=0.07\pm0.01$ between the populations.
While this difference is smaller than typically found in ancient GCs (which may
suggest a correlation with age), this result further confirms that the MP
phenomenon is the same, regardless of cluster age and host galaxy. As such,
these young clusters offer some of the strictest tests for theories on the
origin of MPs.

between the star formation rate (SFR) and the local environment
($\delta_{gal}$) of galaxies in the early universe ($2<z<5$). Unlike what is
observed at lower redshifts ($z<2$), we observe a definite, nearly monotonic
increase in the average SFR with increasing galaxy overdensity over more than
an order of magnitude in $\delta_{gal}$. The robustness of this trend is
quantified by accounting for both uncertainties in our measurements and galaxy
populations that are either underrepresented or not present in our sample and
find that the trend remains significant under all circumstances. This trend
appears to be primarily driven by the fractional increase of galaxies in high
density environments that are more massive in their stellar content and are
forming stars at a higher rate than their less massive counterparts. We find
that, even after stellar mass effects are accounted for, there remains a weak
but significant SFR-$\delta_{gal}$ trend in our sample implying that additional
environmentally-related processes are helping to drive this trend. We also find
clear evidence that the average SFR of galaxies in the densest environments
increases with increasing redshift. These results lend themselves to a picture
in which massive gas-rich galaxies coalesce into proto-cluster environments at
$z\sim3$, interact with other galaxies or with a forming large-scale medium,
subsequently using or losing most of their gas in the process, and begin to
seed the nascent red sequence that is present in clusters at slightly lower
redshifts.

interaction in excitonic systems, wherein an irradiating light beam tunes
exciton transition frequencies. Here we show that, when excitons are placed in
a nanophotonic cavity, the excitonic Stark effect can become highly nonlinear,
exhibiting multi-valued and hysteretic Stark shifts that depend on the history
of the irradiating light. This multistable Stark effect (MSE) arises from
feedback between the cavity mode occupation and excitonic population, mediated
by the Stark-induced mutual tuning of the cavity and excitonic resonances.
Strikingly, the MSE manifests even for very dilute exciton concentrations and
can yield discontinuous Stark shift jumps of order meV. We expect that the MSE
can be realized in readily available transition metal dichalcogenide excitonic
systems placed in planar photonic cavities, at modest pump intensities. This
phenomenon can provide new means to engineer coupled states of light and matter
that can persist even in the single exciton limit.

machine, an analog quantum computer that only requires multiphoton interference
and single-photon detection, is considered to be a promising candidate to reach
this goal. However, the probabilistic nature of photon sources and inevitable
loss in evolution network make the execution time exponentially increasing with
the problem size. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a timestamp
boson sampling that can reduce the execution time by 2 orders of magnitude for
any problem size. We theoretically show that the registration time of sampling
events can be retrieved to reconstruct the probability distribution at an
extremely low-flux rate. By developing a time-of-flight storage technique with
a precision up to picosecond level, we are able to detect and record the
complete time information of 30 individual modes out of a large-scale 3D
photonic chip. We successfully validate boson sampling with only one registered
event. We show that it is promptly applicable to fill the remained gap of
realizing quantum advantage by timestamp boson sampling. The approach
associated with newly exploited resource from time information can boost all
the count-rate-limited experiments, suggesting an emerging field of timestamp

($M_\ast$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of galaxies, and its
explanation in terms of the central-satellite dichotomy, form a cornerstone of
our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the hierarchical structure
formation paradigm. We revisit this framework in the IllustrisTNG simulation in
the context of the most extreme local tidal anisotropy $\alpha_{\rm peak}$
experienced by each galaxy over cosmic time, which is an excellent proxy for
environmental influence. We show that, while sharing a common monotonic
$M_\ast$-$v_{\rm peak}$ relation, central, satellite and `splashback' galaxies
define a hierarchy of increasing $\alpha_{\rm peak}$. We also find that the
sSFR of objects in small haloes unaffected by feedback from an active nucleus
typically decreases with increasing $\alpha_{\rm peak}$. Our results support an
alternate viewpoint in which a galaxy can be identified by the value of
$\alpha_{\rm peak}$; i.e., rather than being placed on the central-satellite
dichotomy, a galaxy is better classified by its location in a continuum of
tidal environments. This conceptual shift can potentially yield a more robust
understanding of galaxy evolution and the galaxy-dark matter connection, e.g.,
in accurately modelling subtle effects such as sSFR-induced secondary
clustering.

show that the spin excitation spectrum resembles a continuum of nearly flat

bursts from Swift J1858.6-0814, implying that the compact object in the system
is a neutron star. Some of the bursts show photospheric radius expansion, so
their peak flux can be used to estimate the distance to the system. The peak
luminosity, and hence distance, can depend on several system parameters; for
the most likely values, a high inclination and a helium atmosphere,
$D=12.8_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ kpc, although systematic effects allow a conservative
range of $9-18$ kpc. Before one burst, we detect a QPO at $9.6\pm0.5$ mHz with
a fractional rms amplitude of $2.2\pm0.2$% ($0.5-10$ keV), likely due to
marginally stable burning of helium; similar oscillations may be present before
the other bursts but the light curves are not long enough to allow their
detection. We also search for burst oscillations but do not detect any, with an
upper limit in the best case of 15% fractional amplitude (over $1-8$ keV).
Finally, we discuss the implications of the neutron star accretor and this
distance on other inferences which have been made about the system. In
particular, we find that Swift J1858.6-0814 was observed at super-Eddington
luminosities at least during bright flares during the variable stage of its

that the surrounding environment has a large effect on their resulting
morphology. To investigate this we use a sample of 50 Extended Radio Active
Galactic Nuclei (ERAGN) detected in the Observations of Redshift Evolution in
Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. These sources are all successfully
cross-identified to galaxies within a redshift range of $0.55 \leq z \leq
1.35$, either through spectroscopic redshifts or accurate photometric
redshifts. We find that ERAGN are more compact in high-density environments
than those in low-density environments at a significance level of 4.5$\sigma$.
Among a series of internal properties under our scrutiny, only the radio power
demonstrates a positive correlation with their spatial extent. After removing
the possible radio power effect, the difference of size in low- and
high-density environments persists. In the global environment analyses, the
majority (86\%) of high-density ERAGN reside in the cluster/group environment.
In addition, ERAGN in the cluster/group central regions are preferentially
compact with a small scatter in size, compared to those in the cluster/group
intermediate regions and fields. In conclusion, our data appear to support the
interpretation that the dense intracluster gas in the central regions of galaxy
clusters plays a major role in confining the spatial extent of radio jets.

massive galaxies. We carry out post-processing simulations of Lagrangian
tracers to track the evolution of enstrophy, a proxy of turbulence, and its
related sinks and sources. This allows us to isolate in depth the physical
processes that determine the evolution of turbulence during the recurring
strong and weak AGN feedback events, which repeat self-similarly over the Gyr
evolution. We find that the evolution of enstrophy/turbulence in the gaseous
halo is highly dynamic and variable over small temporal and spatial scales,
similar to the chaotic weather processes on Earth. We observe major
correlations between the enstrophy amplification and recurrent AGN activity,
especially via its kinetic power. While advective and baroclinc motions are
always sub-dominant, stretching motions are the key sources of the
amplification of enstrophy, in particular along the jet/cocoon, while
rarefactions decrease it throughout the bulk of the volume. This natural
self-regulation is able to preserve, as ensemble, the typically-observed
subsonic turbulence during cosmic time, superposed by recurrent spikes via
impulsive anisotropic AGN features (wide outflows, bubbles, cocoon shocks).
This study facilitates the preparation and interpretation of the
thermo-kinematical observations enabled by new revolutionary X-ray IFU

improving safety and efficiency. The exponential increase in computing
resources and the availability of large amount of data in this digital era has
led to the resurgence of machine learning from its last winter. Therefore, in
this chapter, we discuss how some of the advances in machine learning,
specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning can be leveraged to
develop next-generation autonomous UAS. We first begin motivating this chapter
by discussing the application, challenges, and opportunities of the current UAS
in the introductory section. We then provide an overview of some of the key
deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques discussed throughout this
chapter. A key area of focus that will be essential to enable autonomy to UAS
is computer vision. Accordingly, we discuss how deep learning approaches have
been used to accomplish some of the basic tasks that contribute to providing
UAS autonomy. Then we discuss how reinforcement learning is explored for using
this information to provide autonomous control and navigation for UAS. Next, we
provide the reader with directions to choose appropriate simulation suites and
hardware platforms that will help to rapidly prototype novel machine learning

analysis of line-strength indices in the red spectral range [5700,8800] \AA.
The increasing contribution of red supergiants to this red regime is
responsible for a deviation of the index measurements with respect to their
position within the model grids in the standard spectral range [3600,5700] \AA.
We demonstrate that a combination of red indices, as well as a qualitative
assessment of the mean luminosity-weighted underlying stellar population, is
required in order to distinguish between a true superyoung population and other
possible causes of this deviation, such as abundance ratio variations. Our
result implies that many presumably quenched low-mass galaxies actually contain
gas that is triggering some level of star formation. They have, therefore,
either accreted external gas, internally recycled enough gas from stellar
evolution to trigger new star formation, or they kept a gas reservoir after the
harassment or stripping process that quenched them in first place. Internal
processes are favoured since we find no particular trends between our
non-quenched galaxies and their environment, although more work is needed to
fully discard an external influence.

been realized relatively recently. Here, we review the current state of
terahertz time-domain spectroscopy experiments in high magnetic fields. We
start with an overview of time-domain terahertz detection schemes with a
special focus on how they have been incorporated into optically accessible
high-field magnets. Advantages and disadvantages of different types of magnets
in performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy experiments are also
discussed. Finally, we highlight some of the new fascinating physical phenomena
that have been revealed by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in high magnetic
fields.

tell-tale gravitational wave emissions during binary inspirals. Stable orbits

orders of magnitude larger than even Magnetars, their consequent
electromagnetic emissions will be spectacular during binary inspirals. While

the adiabatic evolution of long-wavelength modes (for instance, produced in
sharp transitions between slow-roll and ultra slow-roll phases), we derive a
general expression for the bispectrum's squeezed limit in co-moving

relation (proportional to the spectral index of the power spectrum) plus
additional terms containing time derivatives of the power spectrum. In
addition, we show that it is always possible to write the perturbed metric in
conformal Fermi coordinates, independently of whether the inflationary
background is attractor or non-attractor, allowing the computation of the
physical primordial bispectrum's squeezed limit as observed by local inertial

leads. As a special case of this spin pumping, a precessing macrospin
(magnetization) can assist electrons in tunneling. In small systems, however,
the Coulomb blockade effect can block the transport of electrons. Here, we
investigate the competition between macrospin-assisted tunneling and Coulomb
blockade for the simplest system where both effects meet; namely, for a single
tunnel junction between a normal metal and a metallic ferromagnet with
precessing magnetization. By combining Fermi's golden rule with magnetization
dynamics and charging effects, we show that the macrospin-assisted tunneling
can soften or even break the Coulomb blockade. The details of these effects --
softening and breaking of Coulomb blockade -- depend on the macrospin dynamics.
This allows, for example, to measure the macrospin dynamics via a system's
current-voltage characteristics. It also allows to control a spin current
electrically. From a general perspective, our results provide a platform for
the interplay between spintronics and electronics on the mesoscopic scale. We

travel-time effect dominated eclipse timing variations. We performed a joint
photodynamical analysis of the eclipse timing variation curves, photometric
data, and the spectral energy distribution, coupled with the use of PARSEC
stellar isochrones. We find that the inner binary consists of slightly evolved,
near twin stars of masses of 1.12 and 1.09 $M_\odot$ and radii of 1.40 and 1.31
$R_\odot$. The third, less massive star has a mass of 0.75 $M_\odot$ and radius
of 0.70 $R_\odot$. The low mutual inclination and eccentricities of the orbits
show that the system is highly coplanar and surprisingly circular.

partitioning (ODNP) problem addressing uncertainties in load and renewable

existing distribution grid; that are likely to survive as self-adequate islands
if supply from the main grid is lost. {This constitutes a planning problem.}
Practical constraints like ensuring network radiality and availability of
grid-forming generators are considered. Quality of the obtained solution is
evaluated by comparison with: a) an upper bound on the probability that the
identified islands are supply-deficient, and b) a lower bound on the optimal
value of the true problem. Performance of the ODNP formulation is illustrated
on a modified IEEE 37-bus feeder. It is shown that the network flexibility is
well utilized; the partitioning changes with risk budget; and that the SAA
method is able to yield good quality solutions with modest computation cost.

carried out to extensively compare, make an assessment and evaluate the
characteristic and performance parameter, such as the average/passive gain of
the proposed antenna in the presence of background noise. Prior to the start of
the FEKO simulation studies, a physical mechanical dimension measurements via a
Digital instrumentation were conducted for the following: Radiating Element
Size: The actual length (L), and width (W), Substrate Material Size: The
substrate length (Lsub), width (Wsub), and height (h). The proposed antenna
model for GPS only patch antenna operating at 1.57542 GHz and the dual band
patch antenna resonating at 1.5925 GHz are developed. To be specific, this work
presents the design, modeling, determining passive gain of the RF GPS L1 patch
vs. dual band patch antenna with intended targeted applications within the
automotive system and space. Simulation are undertaken to generate the RF GPS
L1 patch and dual band patch antenna structure respectively for the sole
purpose of evaluating the performance of the proposed dual band antenna.
Simulation are performed rather than mathematical modelling. The emphasis of
this paper is how to obtain the equivalent amount of total passive gain in a

The Mach number of the translating compressible vortex rings (Mv) investigated
so far in the literature is subsonic as, the shock tube pressure ratio (PR)
considered is relatively low. In this numerical study we focus on low to high
vortex ring Mach numbers (0.31 < Mv < 1.08) cases with a particular focus on
very high Mv cases that are not been reported in experiments as, it is
difficult to obtain in laboratory. Using hydrogen as a driver section gas
inside the shock tube, a supersonic compressible vortex ring (Mv > 1) is
obtained for first time. It is established that the SST k-{\omega} based DES
turbulent model replicates the experimental observation better than the
previously published results at different stages of development of the vortex
ring. DES, which is an inbuilt hybrid of LES and RANS approaches is evoked that
can automatically switch to the sub-grid scale (SGS) model in the LES regions
(i.e. with different scale vortical structures) and to a RANS model in the rest
of the region (i.e. where the grid spacing is greater than the turbulent length
scale). The DES model can predict characteristics of the shear layer vortices
as well as counter-rotating vortex rings (CRVRs) as reported in the
experimental measurements. Formation of multiple triple points and the
corresponding slip-stream shear layers and thus multiple CRVRs behind the
primary vortex ring at different radial locations, in addition to the usual
CRVRs, appears to be a unique characteristic for high Mach number vortex rings.

this contribution for ferroelectric perovskite thin-films has not been
systematically explored. We use first-principles density functional theory and
the example of ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ thin-films on various substrates to show
that ignoring the thermal expansion of the substrate (that is, assuming that

function of temperature) results in ferroelectric transition temperatures and
structural trends that are completely qualitatively different from calculations

turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) in slender cylindrical containers
(with diameter-to-height aspect ratio $\Gamma=1/2$) filled with a
small-Prandtl-number fluid ($Pr \approx0.8$), the Large Scale Circulation (LSC)
is suppressed and a Boundary Zonal Flow (BZF) develops near the sidewall,
characterized by a bimodal PDF of the temperature, cyclonic fluid motion, and
anticyclonic drift of the flow pattern (with respect to the rotating frame).
This BZF carries a disproportionate amount ($>60\%$) of the total heat
transport for $Pr < 1$ but decreases rather abruptly for larger $Pr$ to about
$35\%$. In this work, we show that the BZF is robust and appears in rapidly
rotating turbulent RBC in containers of different $\Gamma$ and in a broad range
of $Pr$ and $Ra$. Direct numerical simulations for $0.1 \leq Pr \leq 12.3$,
$10^7 \leq Ra \leq 5\times10^{9}$, $10^{5} \leq 1/Ek \leq 10^{7}$ and $\Gamma$

Rayleigh number $Ra$ and Ekman number $Ek$ as $\delta_0/H \sim \Gamma^{0}
\Pr^{\{-1/4, 0\}} Ra^{1/4} Ek^{2/3}$ (${Pr<1, Pr>1}$) and the drift frequency
as $\omega/\Omega \sim \Gamma^{0} Pr^{-4/3} Ra Ek^{5/3}$, where $H$ is the cell
height and $\Omega$ the angular rotation rate. The mode number of the BZF is 1
for $\Gamma \lesssim 1$ and $2 \Gamma$ for $\Gamma$ = {1,2} independent of $Ra$

than 90 percent of this energy has been stored in the ocean as heat since 1970,
with about 64 percent of that in the upper 700 m. Differences in upper ocean
heat content anomaly (OHCA) estimates, however, exist. Here, we evaluate spread
in upper OHCA estimates arising from choices in instrumental bias corrections
and mapping methods, in addition to the effect of using a common ocean mask.
The same dataset was mapped by six research groups for 1970 to 2008, with six
instrumental bias corrections applied to expendable bathythermograph (XBT)
data. We find that use of a common ocean mask may impact estimation of global
OHCA by +- 13 percent. Uncertainty due to mapping method dominates over XBT
bias correction at a global scale and is largest in the Indian Ocean and in the
eddy-rich and frontal regions of all basins. Uncertainty due to XBT bias
correction is largest in the Pacific Ocean within 30N to 30S. In both mapping
and XBT cases, spread is higher since the 1990s. Important differences in
spatial trends among mapping methods are found in the well-observed Northwest
Atlantic and the poorly-observed Southern Ocean. Although our results cannot
identify the best mapping or bias correction schemes, they identify where and
when greater uncertainties exist, and so where further refinements may yield
the largest improvements. Our results highlight the need for a future
international coordination to evaluate performance of existing mapping methods.

$\mathcal{H}_k$ (known as tridiagonal space) of analytic functions on

We consider shift operators $M_z$ on $\mathcal{H}_k$ and prove that $M_z$ is
left-invertible if and only if $\{|{a_n}/{a_{n+1}}|\}_{n\geq 0}$ is bounded
away from zero. We find that, unlike the case of weighted shifts, Shimorin's
models for left-invertible operators fail to bring to the foreground the
tridiagonal structure of shifts. In fact, the tridiagonal structure of a kernel
$k$, as above, is preserved under Shimorin model if and only if $b_0=0$ or that
$M_z$ is a weighted shift. We prove concrete classification results concerning
invariance of tridiagonality of kernels, Shimorin models, and positive

  We also develop a computational approach to Aluthge transforms of shifts.
Curiously, in contrast to direct kernel space techniques, often Shimorin models
fails to yield tridiagonal Aluthge transforms of shifts defined on tridiagonal
spaces.

relaxation phenomenology known as ""aging"", as a diagnostic tool to find
universal features that distinguish between the energy landscapes of Ising spin
models and the ferromagnet. According to RD, a non-equilibrium system after a
quench relies on fluctuations that randomly generate a sequence of irreversible
record-sized events (quakes or avalanches) that allow the system to escape
ever-higher barriers of meta-stable states within a complex, hierarchical
energy landscape. Once these record events allow the system to overcome such
barriers, the system relaxes by tumbling into the following meta-stable state
that is marginally more stable. Within this framework, a clear distinction can
be drawn between the coarsening dynamics of an Ising ferromagnet and the aging
of the spin glass, which are often put in the same category. To that end, we
interpolate between the spin glass and ferromagnet by varying the admixture $p$
of ferromagnetic over anti-ferromagnetic bonds from the glassy state (at 50%
each) to wherever clear ferromagnetic behavior emerges. The accumulation of
record events grows logarithmic with time in the glassy regime, with a sharp
transition at a specific admixture into the ferromagnetic regime where such
activations saturate quickly. We show this effect both for the Edwards-Anderson
model on a cubic lattice as well as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (mean-field)
spin glass. While this transition coincides with a previously observed
zero-temperature equilibrium transition in the former, that transition has not
yet been described for the latter.

intelligent wheelchairs, exploration-assistant remote WMR. Recent increase in
remote and autonomous operations\requirements for WMR has led to more and more
use of IoT devices within the control loop. Consequently, providing interfaces
for malicious interactions through false data injection attacks (FDIA).
Moreover, optimization-based FDIAs have been shown to cause catastrophic
consequences in feedback control systems while by-passing any residual-based
monitoring system. Since these attacks target system measurement process, this
paper focuses on the problem of improving the resiliency of dynamical observers
against FDIA. Specifically, we propose an attack-resilient pruning algorithm
which attempts to exclude compromised channels from being processed by the
observer. The proposed pruning algorithm improves attack-localization precision
to $100\%$ with high probability, which correspondingly improves the resiliency
of the underlying UKF to FDIA. The improvements due to the developed resilient
pruning-based observer is validated through a numerical simulation of a

provide, for the first time, a very general construction of drawings attaining
the same bound. Surprisingly, the proof is extremely short and may as well

the phenomenon discovered by Moon in 1968 that a random set of $n$ points on

non-stationary, with the number of resetting events growing with time as
$\sqrt{t}$. We calculate the resulting spatial probability distribution of the

decomposition. In a finite interval, we define an optimization problem that is

occurs the system is reset to its minimal operating point. We define and
optimize an objective function that maximizes the reward (being close to
maximum operation) minus a penalty for each breakdown. We also investigate
extensions of this basic model to include delay after each reset and to two
dimensions. Finally, we study the growth dynamics of a domain in which the

equivalences in finite element (FE) analysis so that existing thermo-mechanical

thermal properties of the nerve materials is established, and results of a pure
heat conduction analysis performed in Abaqus CAE Software 6.13-3 are validated
with analytical solutions for a range of steady and transient conditions. This
validation includes the definition of equivalent active membrane properties
that enable prediction of the action potential. Then, as a step towards fully
coupled models, electromechanical coupling is implemented through the
definition of equivalent piezoelectric properties of the nerve membrane using
the thermal expansion coefficient, enabling prediction of the mechanical
response of the nerve to the action potential. Results: Results of the coupled
electro-mechanical model are validated with previously published experimental
results of deformation for the squid giant axon, crab nerve fibre and garfish
olfactory nerve fibre. Conclusion: A simplified coupled electro-mechanical
modelling approach is established through an electro-thermal equivalent FE
model of a nervous cell for biomedical applications. Significance: One of the
key findings is the mechanical characterization of the neural activity in a
coupled electro-mechanical domain, which provides insights into the
electromechanical behaviour of nervous cells, such as thinning of the membrane.
This is a first step towards modelling 3D electromechanical alteration induced

that not only describe gravity in the realm of a quantum world, but also its
relation to elementary particles and other fundamental forces. Here, we outline
the preliminary results for a model of quantum universe, in which gravity is
fundamentally and by construction quantic. The model is based on three well
motivated assumptions with compelling observational and theoretical evidence:
quantum mechanics is valid at all scales; quantum systems are described by
their symmetries; universe has infinite independent degrees of freedom. The
last assumption means that the Hilbert space of the Universe has
$SU(N\rightarrow \infty) \cong \text{area preserving Diff.} (S_2)$ symmetry,
which is parameterized by two angular variables. We show that, in the absence
of a background spacetime, this Universe is trivial and static. Nonetheless,
quantum fluctuations break the symmetry and divide the Universe to subsystems.
When a subsystem is singled out as reference -- observer -- and another as
clock, two more continuous parameters arise, which can be interpreted as
distance and time. We identify the classical spacetime with parameter space of
the Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless.
In this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics
in the Hilbert space into its parameter space. Finite dimensional symmetries of
elementary particles emerge as a consequence of symmetry breaking when the
Universe is divided to subsystems/particles, without having any implication for
the infinite dimensional symmetry and its associated interaction - perceived as
gravity. This explains why gravity is a universal force.

between the excitonic transition in typical oligonucleotide-based molecular
beacons labelled with a pair of organic dye molecules, demonstrating an
efficient donor to acceptor resonance energy transfer, and the tuneable
open-access cavity mode. The photoluminescence of this hybrid system under
non-resonant laser excitation and the dependence of the relative population of

Furthermore, by analysing the dependence of the relaxation pathways between
energy states in this system, we have demonstrated that predominant strong

molecule can lead to such a large an energy shift that the energy transfer from
the acceptor exciton reservoir to the mainly donor lower polaritonic state can
be achieved, thus yielding the chromophores donor-acceptor role reversal or

represent vector fields of a bilinear system by permutations or graphs, so that

combinatorial characterization of controllability for bilinear systems, which
consequently provides novel applications of symmetric group and graph theory to
control theory. Moreover, the developed combinatorial approaches are compatible
with Lie algebra decompositions, including the Cartan and non-intertwining
decomposition. This compatibility enables the exploitation of representation
theory for analyzing controllability, which allows us to characterize
controllability properties of bilinear systems governed by semisimple and

theory. Then these probabilities, computed from states and events, are to be
compared with relative frequencies of observations. Schrodinger's equation
still is valid in one model of the axioms of quantum theory, which I call the
Schrodinger model. However, the role of Schrodinger's equation is auxiliary,
since it serves to help compute the continuous temporal evolution of the
probabilities given by the Generalized Born's Rule. In other models, such as
the Heisenberg model, the auxiliary equations are quite different, but the
Generalized Born's Rule is the same formula (covariance) and gives the same
results (invariance). Also some aspects of the Schrodinger model are not found
in the isomorphic Heisenberg model, and they therefore do not have any physical
significance. One example of this is the infamous collapse of the quantum
state. Other quantum phenomena, such as entanglement, are easy to analyze in
terms of the Generalized Born's Rule without any reference to the unnecessary
concept of collapse. Finally, this leads to the possibility of quantum theory
with other sorts of auxiliary equations instead of Schrodinger's equation, and
examples of this are given. Throughout this treatise the leit motif is the
central importance of quantum probability and most especially of the
simplifying role of the time dependent Generalized Born's Rule in quantum
theory.

by machine learning, we built a calibration setup, able to generate labeled

debris discs around polluted white dwarfs are often inconsistent with the
predictions of models of shielded Poynting-Robertson drag on the dust particles
in the discs. Moreover, many cool polluted white dwarfs do not show any
observational evidence of accompanying discs. This may be explained, in part,
if the debris discs had shorter lifetimes and higher accretion rates than
predicted by Poynting-Robertson drag alone. We consider the role of a magnetic
field on tidally disrupted diamagnetic debris and its subsequent effect on the
formation, evolution, and accretion rate of a debris disc. We estimate that
magnetic field strengths greater than $\sim$10kG may decrease the time needed
for circularisation and the disc lifetimes by several orders of magnitude and
increase the associated accretion rates by a similar factor, relative to
Poynting-Robertson drag. We suggest some polluted white dwarfs may host
magnetic fields below the typical detectable limit and that these fields may
account for a proportion of polluted white dwarfs with missing debris discs. We
also suggest that diamagnetic drag may account for the higher accretion rate
estimates among polluted white dwarfs that cannot be predicted solely by
Poynting-Robertson drag and find a dependence on magnetic field strength,
orbital pericentre distance, and particle size on predicated disc lifetimes and
accretion rates.

types while in mathematics we interpret each qualitative change by a
bifurcation. Hopf bifurcation is an important venue to generate a signal with
an arbitrary frequency. Hence, the investigations of musical sounds via
bifurcation control theory are long-overdue and natural contributions. In this
paper, we address the tone coloring of sounds by dynamical modeling of spectral
and temporal envelopes. Multiple number of leading harmonic partials of a note
(modulo a hearing sound velocity threshold) are attributed into an Eulerian
differential system with n-tuple Hopf singularity. The qualitative evolution of
the temporal envelop is then simulated over a set of consecutive time-intervals
via bifurcation control of the differential system. For an instance, our
proposed approach is applied on audio C#4 files obtained from piano and violin.
Fourier analysis is used to generate the amplitude spectral vectors. Then, we
associate each amplitude spectral vector with an Eulerian flow-invariant leaf.
Bifurcation control suffices to accurately construct the desired spectral and
amplitude envelopes of musical notes. These correspond with a rich bifurcation
scenarios involving Clifford toral manifolds for the Eulerian differential
system. In order to reduce the technicalities, we employ several reduction
techniques and use one bifurcation parameter. We show how different ordered
sets of elementary bifurcations such as pitchfork and (double) saddle-node
bifurcations are associated with the qualitative temporal envelop changes of a
C]4 played by either a piano or a violin. A complete hysteresis type cycle is
observed within the temporal envelop bifurcations of the C#4 played by violin.

The method allows us to monitor the early stages of Escherichia coli biofilm
formation, cell attachment and microcolony formation, in-situ and in real time.
We study the response of the biofilm to a number of different antibiotics and

which are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Instead, simulation-to-real
domain adaptation (SRDA) trains a DNN using unlimited synthetic data with
automatically generated labels and transfers the learned model to real

employ a multi-stage pipeline and focus on feature-level alignment. They
require prior knowledge of real-world statistics and ignore the pixel-level
dropout noise gap and the spatial feature gap between different domains. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named ePointDA, to address
the above issues. Specifically, ePointDA consists of three modules:
self-supervised dropout noise rendering, statistics-invariant and
spatially-adaptive feature alignment, and transferable segmentation learning.
The joint optimization enables ePointDA to bridge the domain shift at the
pixel-level by explicitly rendering dropout noise for synthetic LiDAR and at
the feature-level by spatially aligning the features between different domains,
without requiring the real-world statistics. Extensive experiments adapting
from synthetic GTA-LiDAR to real KITTI and SemanticKITTI demonstrate the
superiority of ePointDA for LiDAR point cloud segmentation.

between 2019 and 2026. However, recent high-profile accidents have
significantly impacted consumer confidence in this technology. The cause for
many of these accidents can be traced back to the inability of these vehicles
to correctly sense the impending danger. In response, manufacturers have been
improving the already extensive on-vehicle sensor packages to ensure that the
system always has access to the data necessary to ensure safe navigation.
However, these sensor packages only provide a view from the vehicle's
perspective and, as a result, autonomous vehicles still require frequent human
intervention to ensure safety.
  To address this issue, I developed a system, called Horus, that combines
on-vehicle and infrastructure-based sensors to provide a more complete view of
the environment, including areas not visible from the vehicle. I built a
small-scale experimental testbed as a proof of concept. My measurements of the
impact of sensor failures showed that even short outages (1 second) at slow
speeds (25 km/hr scaled velocity) prevents vehicles that rely on on-vehicle
sensors from navigating properly. My experiments also showed that Horus
dramatically improves driving safety and that the sensor fusion algorithm
selected plays a significant role in the quality of the navigation. With just a
pair of infrastructure sensors, Horus could tolerate sensors that fail 40% of
the time and still navigate safely. These results are a promising first step
towards safer autonomous vehicles.

downsample-and-hold induces a ripple between downsamples that causes the
satellite angular rate to significantly overshoot the desired limit. Analysis
in the $z$-domain is carried out in order to understand the phenomenon. An
interpolating Chebyshev-type filter is proposed that allows attitude commands
to be encoded in terms of a set of filter coefficients. Using the interpolating
filter, commands can be issued at the ACS rate but with significantly reduced
memory requirements. The attitude control system of NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter is used as an example to illustrate the behavior of a practical
attitude control system.

the energy conversion of space plasma at multiple scales. This work focuses on
the propagation, polarization and wave composition properties of the solar wind
turbulence within 0.3AU, and its variation with heliocentric distances at MHD
scales (from 10s to 1000s in the spacecraft frame). We present the probability
density function of propagation wavevectors (${\rm{PDF}}(k_\parallel,k_\perp)$)
for solar wind turbulence winthin 0.3 AU for the first time: (1) wavevectors
cluster quasi-(anti-)parallel to the local background magnetic field for
$kd_{\rm i}<0.02$, where $d_{\rm i}$ is the ion inertial length; (2)
wavevectors shift to quasi-perpendicular directions for $kd_{\rm i}>0.02$.
Based on our wave composition diagnosis, we find that: the outward/anti-sunward
Alfv\'en mode dominates over the whole range of scales and distances, the
spectral energy density fraction of the inward/sunward fast mode decreases with
distance, and the fractional energy densities of the inward and outward slow
mode increase with distance. The outward fast mode and inward Alfv\'en mode
represent minority populations throughout the explored range of distances and
scales. On average, the degree of anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations
defined with respect to the minimum variation direction decreases with
increasing scale, with no trend in distance at all scales. Our results provide
comprehensive insight into the scenario of transport and transfer of the solar
wind fluctuations/turbulence in the inner heliosphere.

systems of a processing facility is usually referred to as holdup. In this
work, we propose to use an array of detectors co-axial to the inspected pipe to
measure the holdup material. This method is implementable into an automated
system capable of crawling on surfaces and pipes of various curvatures, which
would enable faster, easier, and more accurate holdup safeguards measurements.
We first demonstrated that the current holdup assay procedure could lead to a
non-negligible bias in the estimate of special nuclear material mass, due to
the simplified assumption of deposited geometry introduced by the Generalized
Geometry Holdup (GGH) model. The new approach consists of imaging the inner
holdup material by characterizing the detector array's response and unfolding
it from the measured light output. Our experimental proof of principle consists
of three NaI(Tl) detectors surrounding an aluminum pipe containing two
cesium-137( 137Cs) sources. We derived the source distribution inside the pipe
by first calculating the detector response matrix using a method adaptive to
the surface geometry of the object containing the measured holdup material.
Creating a matrix of the detector array's measured counts, we then proceed to
solve an inverse problem, resulting in an accurately located source position
and activity distribution within the response matrix's spatial resolution. We
then developed a simulated model of the envisioned experimental setup, which
accurately described both the activity and position of the source in 2D.
Finally, we extended our model onto a discretized three-dimensional model of
the system, encompassing 36 detectors. For the 3D simulation of four different
source geometries, the model accurately localized the source position in 3D,
while the activity retained a maximum relative error of +-5.32%.

a bounding box. This makes LaSOT, to our knowledge, the largest densely

dedicated high quality platform for both training and evaluation of trackers.
The average video length of LaSOT is around 2,500 frames, where each video
contains various challenge factors that exist in real world video footage,such
as the targets disappearing and re-appearing. These longer video lengths allow
for the assessment of long-term trackers. To take advantage of the close
connection between visual appearance and natural language, we provide language
specification for each video in LaSOT. We believe such additions will allow for
future research to use linguistic features to improve tracking. Two protocols,
full-overlap and one-shot, are designated for flexible assessment of trackers.
We extensively evaluate 48 baseline trackers on LaSOT with in-depth analysis,

determining the performance that can be realized using feedback control. This
determination is especially important, but difficult, in the context of
controlling transitional flows. The highly non-normal nature of the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations makes the flow sensitive to small perturbations, with
potentially drastic performance consequences on closed-loop flow control
performance. Full-information controllers, such as the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR), have demonstrated some success in reducing transient energy
growth and suppressing transition; however, sensor-based output feedback
controllers with comparable performance have been difficult to realize. In this
study, we propose two methods for sensor selection that enable sensor-based
output feedback controllers to recover full-information control performance:
one based on a sparse controller synthesis approach, and one based on a
balanced truncation procedure for model reduction. Both approaches are
investigated within linear and nonlinear simulations of a sub-critical channel
flow with blowing and suction actuation at the walls. We find that sensor
configurations identified by both approaches allow sensor-based static output
feedback LQR controllers to recover full-information LQR control performance,
both in reducing transient energy growth and suppressing transition. Further,
our results indicate that both the sensor selection methods and the resulting
controllers exhibit robustness to Reynolds number variations.

regularizes ill-posed problems by restricting the ensemble to the linear span
of the initial ensemble, or by iterating regularization with early stopping.
Another regularization approach for EKI, Tikhonov EKI, penalizes the objective
function using the $l_2$ penalty term, preventing overfitting in the standard
EKI. This paper proposes a strategy to implement $l_p, 0<p\leq 1,$
regularization for EKI to recover sparse structures in the solution. The
strategy transforms a $l_p$ problem into a $l_2$ problem, which is then solved
by Tikhonov EKI. The transformation is explicit, and thus the proposed approach

information to guide the attack and achieve outstanding performance. However,
the high complexity of time and space makes them unmanageable for large scale

argue that the main reason is that they have to use the whole graph for
attacks, resulting in the increasing time and space complexity as the data
scale grows. In this work, we propose an efficient Simplified Gradient-based

specific target nodes through a multi-stage attack framework, which needs only
a much smaller subgraph. In addition, we present a practical metric named
Degree Assortativity Change (DAC) to measure the impacts of adversarial attacks
on graph data. We evaluate our attack method on four real-world graph networks

that SGA can achieve significant time and memory efficiency improvements while

$1$) on a Lie group so that its differentiation gives a Rota-Baxter operator on

decompositions of Iwasawa and Langlands, carry natural Rota-Baxter operators.
Formal inverse of the Rota-Baxter operator on a Lie group is precisely the
crossed homomorphism on the Lie group, whose tangent map is the differential
operator of weight $1$ on a Lie algebra. A factorization theorem of Rota-Baxter
Lie groups is proved, deriving directly on the Lie group level, the well-known
global factorization theorems of Semenov-Tian-Shansky in his study of
integrable systems. As geometrization, the notions of Rota-Baxter Lie
algebroids and Rota-Baxter Lie groupoids are introduced, with the former a
differentiation of the latter. Further, a Rota-Baxter Lie algebroid naturally
gives rise to a post-Lie algebroid, generalizing the well-known fact for
Rota-Baxter Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. It is shown that the
geometrization of a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra or a Rota-Baxter Lie group can be
realized by its action on a manifold. Examples and applications are provided

the fact that, we do not need to introduce and solve any additional equations

pressure ($P=1.8$) at which it exhibits remarkable stability against
crystallization on cooling. It is demonstrated that the TCF allows addressing
the development of the orientational correlations in the structures that do not
allow drawing definite conclusions from the studies of the bond-orientational
order parameters. Our results demonstrate that the orientational correlations,
if measured by the heights of the peaks in the TCF, significantly increase on
cooling. This rise in the orientational ordering is not captured properly by
the Kirkwood's superposition approximation. Detailed considerations of the
peaks' shapes in the TCF suggest the existence of a link between the
orientational ordering and the slowdown of the system's dynamics. Our findings
support the view that the development of the orientational correlations in
liquids may play a significant role in the liquids' dynamics and that the
considerations of the pair distribution function may not be sufficient to
understand intuitively all the structural changes that happen with liquids on
supercooling.

recovery approaches. A tensor rank has several definitions, unlike the matrix
rank--e.g. the CP rank and the Tucker rank. Many low-rank tensor recovery
methods are focused on the Tucker rank. Since the Tucker rank is nonconvex and
discontinuous, many relaxations of the Tucker rank have been proposed, e.g.,
the tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, and weighted tensor
Schatten-$p$ norm. In particular, the weighted tensor Schatten-p norm has two
parameters, the weight and $p$, and the tensor nuclear norm and weighted tensor
nuclear norm are special cases of these parameters. However, there has been no
detailed discussion of whether the effects of the weighting and $p$ are
synergistic. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank tensor completion model
using the weighted tensor Schatten-$p$ norm to reveal the relationships between
the weight and $p$. To clarify whether complex methods such as the weighted
tensor Schatten-$p$ norm are necessary, we compare them with a simple method
using rank-constrained minimization. It was found that the simple methods did
not outperform the complex methods unless the rank of the original tensor could
be accurately known. If we can obtain the ideal weight, $p = 1$ is sufficient,
although it is necessary to set $p<1$ when using the weights obtained from
observations. These results are consistent with existing reports.

characterizes the relationship among several different formulations of this

that this information projection problem is equivalent to minimization of a
certain Onsager-Machlup (OM) function with respect to an associated stochastic
process. We then construct several reformulations in the more specific setting
of classical Wiener space. First, we show that KL-weighted optimization over
shift measures can also be expressed in terms of an OM function for an
associated stochastic process that we are able to characterize. Next, we show
how to encode the feasible set of shift measures through an explicit functional
constraint by constructing an appropriate penalty function. Finally, we express
our information projection problem as a calculus of variations problem, which
suggests a solution procedure via the Euler-Lagrange equation. We work out the
details of these reformulations for several specific examples.

weak conditions on the rate of decrease of these error probabilities as a
function of sequence length. Specifically, we propose a threshold-based test
that ensures exponential decay of misclassification error and false alarm

one constraint being that it is a non-vanishing constant and the other being
that it has an exponential decay rate. For both cases, we characterize bounds
on the false reject probability, as a function of the threshold, for each pair

graphs that are needed for healthcare artificial intelligence. However, the

processes creates a major bottleneck for mining new relations. In this paper,
we present Hi-RES, a framework for high-throughput relation extraction

electronic health records (EHRs) significantly increases the classification
accuracy. Methods: We use relation triplets obtained from structured databases
and semistructured webpages to label sentences from target corpora as positive
training samples. Two methods are also provided for creating improved negative
samples by combining positive samples with na\""ive negative samples. We propose
a common model that summarizes sentence information using large-scale
pretrained language models and multi-instance attention, which then joins with
the concept embeddings trained from the EHRs for relation prediction. Results:
We apply the Hi-RES framework to develop classification algorithms for
disorder-disorder relations and disorder-location relations. Millions of
sentences are created as training data. Using pretrained language models and
EHR-based embeddings individually provides considerable accuracy increases over
those of previous models. Joining them together further tremendously increases
the accuracy to 0.947 and 0.998 for the two sets of relations, respectively,
which are 10-17 percentage points higher than those of previous models.
Conclusion: Hi-RES is an efficient framework for achieving high-throughput and

classification system is closed and complete, and there are no unknown or novel
classes in the unseen data. However, this assumption may be too strict for the
real world. Often, novel classes are overlooked when the classification system
is constructed. The closed nature forces a model to assign a label given a new
sample and may lead to overestimation of known land covers (e.g., crop area).
To tackle this issue, we propose a multitask deep learning method that
simultaneously conducts classification and reconstruction in the open world
(named MDL4OW) where unknown classes may exist. The reconstructed data are
compared with the original data; those failing to be reconstructed are
considered unknown, based on the assumption that they are not well represented
in the latent features due to the lack of labels. A threshold needs to be
defined to separate the unknown and known classes; we propose two strategies
based on the extreme value theory for few-shot and many-shot scenarios. The
proposed method was tested on real-world hyperspectral images; state-of-the-art
results were achieved, e.g., improving the overall accuracy by 4.94% for the
Salinas data. By considering the existence of unknown classes in the open
world, our method achieved more accurate hyperspectral image classification,

without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a
masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label

unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful.
It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open

$\gtrsim$ 0.75 films undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition as
transform from normal to superconducing states upon cooling. For the $x$
$\lesssim$ 0.71 films, the resistance increases with decreasing temperature
from 2 K down to 40 mK. A normal state to anomalous metallic state transition
is observed in the $x$ $\simeq$ 0.73 film, i.e., near the transition
temperature, the resistance of the film decreases sharply upon cooling as if
the system would cross over to superconducting state, but then saturates to a
value far less than that in normal state. When a small magnetic field
perpendicular to the film plane is applied, the anomalous metallic state occurs
in the $x$ $\gtrsim$ 0.75 films. It is found that both disorder and magnetic
field can induce the transition from superconductor to anomalous metal and
their influences on the transition are similar. For the the magnetic field
induced case, we find the sheet resistance $R_{\square}(T,H)$ ($T$ and $H$

bosonic and dynamical gauge field fluctuation resulting from superconducting

information for successful attacks. Researchers have been experimenting with
Oblivious RAM (ORAM) to address the privacy of access patterns. ORAM is a
powerful low-level primitive that provides application-agnostic protection for
any I/O operations, however, at a high cost. We find that some
application-specific access patterns, such as sequential block I/O, do not
provide additional information to adversaries. Others, such as sorting, can be
replaced with specific oblivious algorithms that are more efficient than ORAM.
The challenge is that developers may need to look into all the details of
application-specific access patterns to design suitable solutions, which is
time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we present the lightweight SGX

background as a positive thermodynamic pressure in the extended phase space, we
study the thermodynamic behaviors of the regular Hayward-AdS (HAdS) black hole
(BH) by investigating $P-\upsilon$ critical and cooling-heating phase
transition. We compare the difference of two thermodynamic processes between
the HAdS BH and the Bardeen-AdS (BAdS) BH. It is found that the phase
transition of the BAdS BH tends to be more the van der Waals (vdW) phase
transition. For the cooling-heating phase transition, we find the inversion
curves of the HAdS BH are always higher than the BAdS BH under the same
pressure and magnetic charge. We also compare the smallest existence mass, the
zero-temperature remnant, and the critical magnetic charge. The results suggest
that the inner horizon and the outer horizon of the Hayward BH are easier to
merge, and the singularity is easier to expose.

analytics to mine and analyze the data to improve their services and products

workflows spanning multiple stages, from data cleaning to visualization.
Existing text analytics systems usually accommodate a subset of these stages
and often fail to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, provenance,
workflow reusability and reproducibility, and compatibility with established
practices. Based on a set of design considerations we derive from these
challenges, we propose Leam, a system that treats the text analysis process as
a single continuum by combining advantages of computational notebooks,
spreadsheets, and visualization tools. Leam features an interactive user
interface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing
multiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that
captures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text
analysis and enables coordination among different components of the system,
including data, code, and visualizations. We report our current progress in
Leam development while demonstrating its usefulness with usage examples.
Finally, we outline a number of enhancements to Leam and identify several

applications such as data storage require fast and flexible means to tune the
plasmonic colors, while keeping them vibrant and stable. Here, a surface-relief
aluminum metasurface that reflects polarization-tunable plasmonic colors is
designed and experimentally demonstrated. Excitation of localized surface
plasmons encodes discrete combinations of the incident and reflected polarized
light into diverse colors. A single storage unit - a nanopixel - stores a
multiple-bit piece of information in the orientation of its constituent
nanoantennae. This information is then reliably retrieved by inspecting the
reflected color sequence with two linear polarizers. It is the broad color
variability and high spatial resolution of the proposed encoding approach that
supports a strong promise for rapid parallel read-out and encryption of
high-density optical data. Our method also enables the robust generation of
dynamic kaleidoscopic images with no detrimental ""cross-talk"" effect. The

Schr\""odinger's equation, to name a few, where the involution in the PDE
supports curl-free or curl constraint-preserving evolution of a vector field.
Since mimetic numerical schemes for the solution of the former class of PDEs
are well-developed, we draw guidance from them for the solution of the latter
class of PDEs. We show that a study of the curl constraint-preserving
reconstruction gives us a great deal of insight into the design of consistent,
mimetic schemes for these involutionary PDEs. The importance of
multidimensional Riemann solvers in facilitating the design of such schemes is
also documented. We study the problem of curl constraint-preserving
reconstruction as it pertains to the design of mimetic discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) and finite volume (FV) schemes for PDEs that support such an involution.
This is done for two and three dimensional structured mesh problems where we
deliver closed form expressions for the reconstruction. The role that this
reconstruction plays in the curl-free, or curl-preserving prolongation of
vector fields in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is also discussed. In two
dimensions, a von Neumann analysis of structure-preserving DG-like schemes that

ever-increasing attention due to the emergence of large-scale applications.
Recently, based on a popular matrix sketching algorithm---frequent directions,
previous work has introduced co-occuring directions (COD) to reduce the
approximation error for this problem. Although it enjoys the space complexity
of $O((m_x+m_y)\ell)$ for two input matrices $X\in\mathbb{R}^{m_x\times n}$ and
$Y\in\mathbb{R}^{m_y\times n}$ where $\ell$ is the sketch size, its time
complexity is $O\left(n(m_x+m_y+\ell)\ell\right)$, which is still very high for
large input matrices. In this paper, we propose to reduce the time complexity
by exploiting the sparsity of the input matrices. The key idea is to employ an
approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) method which can utilize the
sparsity, to reduce the number of QR decompositions required by COD. In this
way, we develop sparse co-occuring directions, which reduces the time
complexity to $\widetilde{O}\left((\nnz(X)+\nnz(Y))\ell+n\ell^2\right)$ in
expectation while keeps the same space complexity as $O((m_x+m_y)\ell)$, where
$\nnz(X)$ denotes the number of non-zero entries in $X$. Theoretical analysis
reveals that the approximation error of our algorithm is almost the same as
that of COD. Furthermore, we empirically verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of our algorithm.

constraints of the communication user (CU), which characterizes the optimal
tradeoff between radar and communication. In addition to simply using the
communication signal for target probing, we further consider to exploit
dedicated probing signals to enhance the radar sensing performance. We commence
by studying the single-CU scenario, where a closed-form solution to the
beamforming design problem is provided. It is then proved that a dedicated
radar probing signal is not needed. As a further step, we consider a more
complicated multi-CU scenario, where the beamforming design is formulated as a
non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming. The optimal
solutions are obtained by applying semidefinite relaxation with guaranteed
rank-1 property. It is shown that under the multi-CU scenario, the dedicated

proposed weighted empirical stretching (WES) as a novel loss function to
increase the overlap area of the two distributions. The function depends on the

the function capability, we generated ideal distributed curves (unimodal,

performance was robust to the various noise levels. The improved results in

O(nm^5 ), with n the number of electrons and a prefactor on the order of 10 to
20. With low orders of Hamiltonian matrix-vector products, a whole repertoire
of approximations widely used in modern electronic structure theory, including
various orders of perturbation theory and/or truncated CI at different orders
of excitations can be implemented for quantum computing for both routine and
benchmark results at chemical accuracy. The lowest order matrix-vector product

expected to be a leading algorithm for demonstrating quantum supremacy for Ab
Initio simulations, one of the most anticipated real world applications. The

  UWB Inter-agent Ranging",,,,,"eess.SP cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates an infra-structure free global localization of a
group of communicating mobile agents (e.g., first responders or exploring
robots) via an ultra-wideband (UWB) inter-agent ranging aided dead-reckoning.
We propose a loosely coupled cooperative localization algorithm that acts as an
augmentation atop the local dead-reckoning system of each mobile agent. This
augmentation becomes active only when an agent wants to process a relative
measurement it has taken. The main contribution of this paper is addressing the
challenges in the proper processing of the UWB range measurements in the
framework of a loosely coupled cooperative localization. Even though UWB offers
a decimeter level accuracy in line-of-sight (LoS) ranging, its accuracy
degrades significantly in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to the significant
unknown positive bias in the measurements. Thus, the measurement models for the
UWB LoS and NLoS ranging conditions are different, and proper processing of
NLoS measurements requires a bias compensation measure. We also show that, in
practice, the measurement modal discriminators determine the type of UWB range
measurements should be probabilistic. To take into account the probabilistic
nature of the NLoS identifiers when processing UWB inter-agent ranging
feedback, we employ an interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator in our
localization filter. We also propose a bias compensation method for NLoS UWB
measurements. The effectiveness of our cooperative localization is demonstrated
via an experiment for a group of pedestrians who use UWB relative range
measurements among themselves to improve their shoe-mounted INS geolocation.

time-consuming. Few-shot image classification has thus been proposed to
effectively use only a limited number of labeled examples to train models for
new classes. Recent works based on transferable metric learning methods have
achieved promising classification performance through learning the similarity
between the features of samples from the query and support sets. However, rare
of them explicitly considers the model interpretability, which can actually be
revealed during the training phase.
  For that, in this work, we propose a metric learning based method named
Region Comparison Network (RCN), which is able to reveal how few-shot learning
works as in a neural network as well as to find out specific regions that are
related to each other in images coming from the query and support sets.
Moreover, we also present a visualization strategy named Region Activation
Mapping (RAM) to intuitively explain what our method has learned by visualizing
intermediate variables in our network. We also present a new way to generalize
the interpretability from the level of tasks to categories, which can also be
viewed as a method to find the prototypical parts for supporting the final
decision of our RCN. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets clearly
show the effectiveness of our method over existing baselines.

Recently, we have developed a novel scheme called NAO2GTO to achieve linear
scaling (Order-N) calculations for hybrid density-functionals. In our scheme,
the most time-consuming step is the calculation of the electron repulsion
integrals (ERIs) part. So how to create an even distribution of these ERIs in
parallel implementation is an issue of particular importance. Here, we present
two static scalable distributed algorithms for the ERIs computation. Firstly,
the ERIs are distributed over ERIs shell pairs. Secondly, the ERIs is
distributed over ERIs shell quartets. In both algorithms, the calculation of
ERIs is independent of each other, so the communication time is minimized. We
show our speedup results to demonstrate the performance of these static
parallel distributed algorithms in the Hefei Order-N packages for \textit{ab

the simulations indicate a lower fraction of blue galaxies than what found in
the KiDS-AMICO catalogue: we argue that this may be due to an underestimate of
star-forming galaxies in the simulations. The selection of clusters with a
larger magnitude difference between the two brightest central galaxies, which
may indicate a more relaxed cluster dynamical status, improves the agreement

J1818.0-1607, following it for more than one month with high cadence. The
observations commenced less than 35 hours after its registered first outburst.
We obtained timing, polarisation and spectral information. Swift J1818.0-1607
has an unusually steep spectrum for a radio emitting magnetar and also has a
relatively narrow and simple pulse profile. The position angle swing of the
polarisation is flat over the pulse profile, possibly suggesting that our
line-of-sight grazes the edge of the emission beam. This may also explain the
steep spectrum. The spin evolution shows large variation in the spin-down rate,
associated with four distinct timing events over the course of our
observations. Those events may be related to the appearance and disappearance
of a second pulse component. The first timing event coincides with our actual
observations, while we did not detect significant changes in the emission
properties which could reveal further magnetospheric changes. Characteristic
ages inferred from the timing measurements over the course of months vary by
nearly an order of magnitude. A longer-term spin-down measurement over
approximately 100 days suggests an characteristic age of about 500 years,
larger than previously reported. Though Swift J1818.0-1607 could still be one
of the youngest neutron stars (and magnetars) detected so far, we caution using
the characteristic age as a true-age indicator given the caveats behind its

Buffered environmental contours serve the same purpose, but with respect to the
so-called buffered failure probability. In contrast to classical environmental
contours, buffered environmental contours do not just take into account failure
vs. functioning, but also to which extent the system is failing. This is
important to take into account whenever the consequences of failure are
relevant. For instance, if we consider a power network, it is important to know
not just that the power supply is failed, but how many consumers are affected
by the failure. In this paper, we study the connections between environmental
contours, both classical and buffered, and optimal structural design. We
connect the classical environmental contours to the risk measure value-at-risk.
Similarly, the buffered environmental contours are naturally connected to the
convex risk measure conditional value-at-risk. We study the problem of
minimizing the risk of the cost of building a particular design. This problem
is studied both for value-at-risk and conditional-value-at-risk. By using the
connection between value-at-risk and the classical environmental contours, we
derive a representation of the design optimization problem expressed via the
environmental contour. A similar representation is derived by using the
connection between conditional value-at-risk and the buffered environmental
contour. From these representations, we derive a sufficient condition which
must hold for an optimal design. This is done both in the classical and the
buffered case. Finally, we apply these results to solve a design optimization
problem from structural reliability.

for 304 field OB stars from the spatially complete, Runaways and Isolated
O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). We obtain stellar masses
and projected rotational velocities $v_r\sin i $ for the sample using RIOTS4

proper motions. Kinematic analyses of the masses, $v_r\sin i $, non-compact
binaries, high-mass X-ray binaries, and Oe/Be stars largely support predictions
for the statistical properties of the DES and BSS populations. We find that
dynamical ejections dominate over supernova ejections by a factor of $\sim 2-3$
in the SMC, and our results suggest a high frequency of DES runaways and binary
ejections. Objects seen as BSS runaways also include two-step ejections of
binaries that are reaccelerated by SN kicks. We find that two-step runaways
likely dominate the BSS runaway population. Our results further imply that any
contribution from $\it{in-situ}$ field OB star formation is small. Finally, our
data strongly support the post-mass-transfer model for the origin of classical
Oe/Be stars, providing a simple explanation for the bimodality in the $v_r\sin

relies on its Lipschitz constant. To avoid computing it, backtracking rules can
be used. While such a rule has already been designed for the forward-backward
algorithm (FBwB), this scheme is not flexible enough when a non-differentiable
penalization with a linear operator is added to a constraint. In this work we
propose a backtracking rule for the primal-dual scheme (PDwB), and evaluate its
performance for the epigraphical constrained high dynamical reconstruction in
high contrast polarimetric imaging, under TV penalization.

nebula ETHOS 1 (PN G068.1+11.0). Simultaneous modelling of light and radial
velocity curves reveals the binary to comprise a hot and massive
pre-white-dwarf with an M-type main-sequence companion. A good fit to the
observations was found with a companion that follows expected
mass-temperature-radius relationships for low-mass stars, indicating that
despite being highly irradiated it is consistent with not being significantly
hotter or larger than a typical star of the same mass. Previous modelling
indicated that ETHOS 1 may comprise the first case where the orbital plane of
the central binary does not lie perpendicular to the nebular symmetry axis, at
odds with the expectation that the common envelope is ejected in the orbital
plane. We find no evidence for such a discrepancy, deriving a binary
inclination in agreement with that of the nebula as determined by
spatio-kinematic modelling. This makes ETHOS 1 the ninth post-common-envelope
planetary nebula in which the binary orbital and nebular symmetry axes have
been shown to be aligned, with as yet no known counter-examples. The
probability of finding such a correlation by chance is now less than 0.00002%.

and undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ and two sets of nodes, senders $\mathcal{S}
(\subset V)$ and targets $\mathcal{T} (\subset V)$, a directed subgraph
$\vec{G}$ of $G$ is a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG on $G$, if $\vec{G}$
is a DAG and every sender can reach at least one target, and every target is
reachable from at least one sender in $\vec{G}$. We say that a weakly
$\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG $\vec{G}$ on $G$ is minimal if any proper subgraph
of $\vec{G}$ is no longer a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG. This DAG is a
relaxed version of the original (or strongly) $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG,
where every target is reachable from every sender. This is because a strongly
$\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG $G$ does not always exist; some graph has no
strongly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG even in the case
$|\mathcal{S}|=|\mathcal{T}|=2$. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm
always constructs a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG for any $|\mathcal{S}|$
and $|\mathcal{T}|$. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is self-stabilizing;
even if the constructed DAG deviates from the reachability requirement by a
breakdown or exhausting the battery of a node having an arc in the DAG, this
algorithm automatically reconstructs the DAG to satisfy the requirement again.
The convergence time of the algorithm is $O(D)$ asynchronous rounds, where $D$
is the diameter of a given graph. We conduct small simulations to evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation result indicates that its
execution time decreases when the number of sender nodes or target nodes is
large.

problem. This paper reformulates HPO as a computer experiment and proposes a
novel sequential uniform design (SeqUD) strategy with three-fold advantages: a)
the hyperparameter space is adaptively explored with evenly spread design
points, without the need of expensive meta-modeling and acquisition
optimization; b) the batch-by-batch design points are sequentially generated
with parallel processing support; c) a new augmented uniform design algorithm
is developed for the efficient real-time generation of follow-up design points.
Extensive experiments are conducted on both global optimization tasks and HPO
applications. The numerical results show that the proposed SeqUD strategy
outperforms benchmark HPO methods, and it can be therefore a promising and
competitive alternative to existing AutoML tools.

response in the presence of the generated carriers has been mainly limited to
numerical simulations so far. Here, we develop a framework to calculate the
nonequilibrium Green's function of generic insulating systems under a DC

expansion techniques, we derive a semi-quantitative formula for the Green's

calculate dissipative current response of the nonequilibrium steady state,
which turns out to be not simply characterized by the intraband current
proportional to the tunneling probability. We also apply the present formalism
to noncentrosymmetric insulators, and propose nonreciprocal charge and spin
transport peculiar to tunneling electrons.

the process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on,

novel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover
the excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that
the additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from
the excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in
the MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most
favorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113%

multiplicative growth and diffusive transport. In the presence of disorder,
these systems tend to form localized structures which alternate between long
periods of relative stasis and short bursts of activity. This behaviour, known
as intermittency in physics and punctuated equilibrium in evolutionary theory,
is difficult to forecast; in particular there is no general principle to locate
the regions where the system will settle, how long it will stay there, or where
it will jump next. Here I introduce a predictive theory of linear intermittency
that closes these gaps. I show that any positive linear system can be mapped
onto a generalization of the ""maximal entropy random walk"", a Markov process on
graphs with non-local transition rates. This construction reveals the
localization islands as local minima of an effective potential, and
intermittent jumps as barrier crossings in that potential. My results unify the
concepts of intermittency in linear systems and Markovian metastability, and
provide a generally applicable method to reduce, and predict, the dynamics of
disordered linear systems. Applications span physics, evolutionary dynamics and
epidemiology.

to identify defective lines using a model-agnostic technique, i.e., an
Explainable AI technique that provides information why the model makes such a
prediction. Broadly speaking, our LINE-DP first builds a file-level defect
model using code token features. Then, our LINE-DP uses a state-of-the-art
model-agnostic technique (i.e.,LIME) to identify risky tokens, i.e., code
tokens that lead the file-level defect model to predict that the file will be
defective. Then, the lines that contain risky tokens are predicted as defective
lines. Through a case study of 32 releases of nine Java open source systems,
our evaluation results show that our LINE-DP achieves an average recall of
0.61, a false alarm rate of 0.47, a top 20%LOC recall of0.27, and an initial
false alarm of 16, which are statistically better than six baseline approaches.
Our evaluation shows that our LINE-DP requires an average computation time of
10 seconds including model construction and defective line identification time.
In addition, we find that 63% of defective lines that can be identified by our
LINE-DP are related to common defects (e.g., argument change, condition
change). These results suggest that our LINE-DP can effectively identify
defective lines that contain common defectswhile requiring a smaller amount of
inspection effort and a manageable computation cost.

detection is plasmonically enhanced. Absorption of photons from the evanescent
wave is avoided by detuning the laser from atomic resonance which makes the

  positions enacted in a new event",,,,,"cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Black Lives Matter has been a major force for social change in the US since
2014, with social media playing a core role in the development and
proliferation of the movement. The largest protests in US history occurred in
late May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands
of Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM
movement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they
occurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the
COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest
conditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and
with COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was
hypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a
balancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread.
However, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion
of the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither
supporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as
a factor. Framings of the movement by BLM supporters largely replicated those
of earlier studies, with new frames emerging surrounding the opposition the
movement has received from racism, police militarisation and President Donald
Trump. Discourse evidenced worrying levels of polarisation, hate, incivility
and conspiracy content and bore many similarities to previously studied COVID
discourse. This suggests that George Floyd's death, as yet another example of
an African American man killed by US police, was largely seen through
established, polarised identity positions that made reactions to the incident
and resulting protest largely a foregone conclusion, established and
articulated without reference to the ongoing pandemic.

characterised by two necessary conditions that together are sufficient. A
simple consequence is that realisability in the presence of a choreography
becomes decidable. In this article we extend this work by generalising
choreographies to control-state choreographies, which enable parallelism. We
redefine P2P systems on grounds of control-state machines and show that a
control-state choreography is equivalent to the rendez-vous compositions of its
peers and that language-synchronisability coincides with synchronisability.
These results are used to characterise realisability of control-state

necessary conditions: a sequence condition and a choice condition. Then we also
show that these two conditions together are sufficient for the realisability of

period. However, recent evidence of deviations from gyrochronology relations
was reported in the literature. Here, we study the influence of tidal
interaction between a star and its companion on the rotation velocity of the
star, in order to explain peculiar stellar rotation velocities. The interaction
of a star and its planet is followed using a comprehensive numerical framework
that combines tidal friction, magnetic braking, planet migration, and detailed
stellar evolution models from the GARSTEC grid. We focus on close-in companions
from 1 to 20 M$_{Jup}$ orbiting low-mass, 0.8 and 1 M$_{\odot}$, main-sequence
stars with a broad metallicity range from [Fe/H] = -1 to solar. Our simulations
suggest that the dynamical interaction between a star and its companion can
have different outcomes, which depend on the initial semi-major axis and the
mass of the planet, as well as the mass and metallicity of its host star. In
most cases, especially in the case of planet engulfment, we find a catastrophic
increase in stellar rotation velocity from 1 kms$^{-1}$ to over 40 kms$^{-1}$,
while the star is still on the main-sequence. The main prediction of our model
is that low-mass main-sequence stars with abnormal rotation velocities should
be more common at low-metallicity, as lower [Fe/H] favours faster planet
engulfment, provided occurrence rate of close in massive planets is similar at
all metallicities. Our scenario explains peculiar rotation velocities of
low-mass main-sequence stars by the tidal interaction between the star and its
companion. Current observational samples are too small and incomplete, and thus
do not allow us to test our model.

in reproducing the distributions of the surface phytoplankton chlorophyll in

scale-relationships in the impact of different drivers (turbulent diffusion,
mean and eddy advection, primary productivity) on the phytoplankton chlorophyll
concentrations. We find that in the 1/4{\deg} (~25km) model, advection has a
substantial impact on the rate of primary productivity, whilst the turbulent
diffusion term has a fairly negligible impact. Turbulent diffusion has an
impact on the phytoplankton variability, with the impact being scale-propagated
and amplified by the larger scale surface currents. We investigate the impact
of a surface nutrient decline and some changes to mesoscale eddy kinetic energy
(climate change projections) on the surface phytoplankton concentrations. The
RDA model suggests that unless mesoscale eddies radically change, phytoplankton
chlorophyll scales sub-linearly with the nutrients, and it is relatively stable
with respect to the nutrient concentrations. Furthermore we explore how a white
multiplicative Gaussian noise introduced into the RDA model on its resolution
scale propagates across spatial scales through the non-linear model dynamics
under different sets of phytoplankton drivers. The unifying message of this
work is that the low complexity (e.g. RDA) models can be successfully used to
realistically model some specific aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and by
using those models one can explore many questions that would be beyond
computational affordability of the higher-complexity ecosystem models.

existence of both unregistered areas and actual changed areas would lower the
performance of many change detection algorithms in unsupervised condition.To
alleviate the effect of unregistered objects in the paired images, we propose a
novel change detection framework utilizing a special neural network
architecture -- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate many better
coregistered images. In this paper, we show that GAN model can be trained upon
a pair of images through using the proposed expanding strategy to create a
training set and optimizing designed objective functions. The optimized GAN
model would produce better coregistered images where changes can be easily
spotted and then the change map can be presented through a comparison strategy
using these generated images explicitly.Compared to other deep learning-based

makes most of the deep learning structure.Experimental results on synthetic

carrier dynamics in materials down to sub-femtosecond resolution. To perform
such measurement, while keeping the pump induced perturbation to the sample as
small as possible, it is essential to have a detection scheme with high signal
to noise ratio. Achieving such high signal to noise ratio is easy with phase
sensitive detection based on lock-in-amplifier when a high repetition rate
laser is used as the optical pulse source. However such a lock-in-amplifier
based method does not work well when a low repetition rate laser is used for
the measurement. In this article, a sensitive detection scheme which combines
the advantages of boxcar which rejects noise in time domain and
lock-in-amplifier which isolates signal in frequency domain for performing
pump-probe measurements using low-repetition rate laser system is proposed and
experimentally demonstrated. A theoretical model to explain the process of
signal detection and a method to reduce the pulse to pulse energy fluctuation
in probe pulses is presented. By performing pump-probe measurements at various
detection conditions the optimum condition required for obtaining transient
absorption signal with low noise is presented. The reported technique is not
limited to pump-probe measurements and can be easily modified to suite for
other sensitive measurements at low-repetition rates.

pharmaceutical systems and more specifically, water purification systems.
Purified water which has certain conductivity is an important ingredient in
many pharmaceutical products. Almost every pharmaceutical company has a water
purifying unit as a part of its interdependent systems. Early detection of
faults right at the edge can significantly decrease maintenance costs and
improve safety and output quality, and as a result, lead to the production of
better medicines. In this paper, with the help of a few sensors and data mining
approaches, an anomaly detection system is built for CHRIST Osmotron water
purifier. This is a practical research with real-world data collected from
SinaDarou Labs Co. Data collection was done by using six sensors over two-week
intervals before and after system overhaul. This gave us normal and faulty
operation samples. Given the data, we propose two anomaly detection approaches
to build up our edge fault detection system. The first approach is based on
supervised learning and data mining e.g. by support vector machines. However,
since we cannot collect all possible faults data, an anomaly detection approach
is proposed based on normal system identification which models the system
components by artificial neural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted
with the dataset generated in this study to show the accuracy of the
data-driven and model-based anomaly detection methods.

  models for mixed ordered-continuous outcomes",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Poverty is a multidimensional concept often comprising a monetary outcome and
other welfare dimensions such as education, subjective well-being or health,
that are measured on an ordinal scale. In applied research, multidimensional
poverty is ubiquitously assessed by studying each poverty dimension
independently in univariate regression models or by combining several poverty
dimensions into a scalar index. This inhibits a thorough analysis of the
potentially varying interdependence between the poverty dimensions. We propose
a multivariate copula generalized additive model for location, scale and shape
(copula GAMLSS or distributional copula model) to tackle this challenge. By
relating the copula parameter to covariates, we specifically examine if certain
factors determine the dependence between poverty dimensions. Furthermore,
specifying the full conditional bivariate distribution, allows us to derive
several features such as poverty risks and dependence measures coherently from
one model for different individuals. We demonstrate the approach by studying
two important poverty dimensions: income and education. Since the level of
education is measured on an ordinal scale while income is continuous, we extend
the bivariate copula GAMLSS to the case of mixed ordered-continuous outcomes.
The new model is integrated into the GJRM package in R and applied to data from
Indonesia. Particular emphasis is given to the spatial variation of the
income-education dependence and groups of individuals at risk of being
simultaneously poor in both education and income dimensions.

This study aims to model the interactions in the population by means of a
complex network and to shed some light on the effectiveness of localised
control measures in Italy in relation to the school opening in mid-September.
The formulation of an epidemiological predictive model is given: the advantage
of using this model lies in that it discriminates between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cases of COVID-19 as the interactions with these two categories of
infected individuals are captured separately, allowing for a study on the
impact of asymptomatic cases. This model is then extended to a structured
nonhomogeneous version by means of the Watts-Strogatz complex network, which is
adopted widely to model societal interactions as it holds the small world
property. Finally, a case study on the situation in Italy is given: first the
homogeneous model is used to compare the official data with the data of the
recent seroprevalence study from Istat; second, in view of the return to school
in mid-September, a study at regional level is conducted. The results of this
study highlight the importance of coordinating the deployment of appropriate
control measures that take into account the role of asymptomatic infections,

  evaluation based on axiomatic requirements",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0257003",,"stat.AP stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is often used to assess
and compare hospital performance. While it has been recognized that hospitals
may differ in their SMRs due to differences in patient composition, there is a
lack of rigorous analysis of this and other - largely unrecognized - properties
of the SMR. Methods: This paper proposes five axiomatic requirements for
adequate standardized mortality measures: strict monotonicity, case-mix
insensitivity, scale insensitivity, equivalence principle, and dominance
principle. Given these axiomatic requirements, effects of variations in patient
composition, hospital size, and actual and expected mortality rates on the SMR
were examined using basic algebra and calculus. In this regard, we
distinguished between standardization using expected mortality rates derived
from a different dataset (external standardization) and standardization based
on a dataset including the considered hospitals (internal standardization).
Results: Under external standardization, the SMR fulfills the axiomatic
requirements of strict monotonicity and scale insensitivity but violates the
requirement of case-mix insensitivity, the equivalence principle, and the
dominance principle. All axiomatic requirements not fulfilled under external
standardization are also not fulfilled under internal standardization. In
addition, the SMR under internal standardization is scale sensitive and
violates the axiomatic requirement of strict monotonicity. Conclusions: The SMR
fulfills only two (none) out of the five proposed axiomatic requirements under
external (internal) standardization. Generally, the SMRs of hospitals are
differently affected by variations in case mix and actual and expected
mortality rates unless the hospitals are identical in these characteristics.
These properties hamper valid assessment and comparison of hospital performance
based on the SMR.

capacity of multimodal variational methods using normalizing flows. It
approximates the joint posterior with a simple parametric distribution and
subsequently transforms into a more complex one. Through several experiments,
we demonstrate that the model improves on state-of-the-art multimodal methods

colorization, edge and mask detection, and weakly supervised learning. We also

  device geometry","5 figures, 1 table",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy harvesting from shadow-effect is the generation of electrical power
from a Schottky junction when a part of it is kept in shadow and the remaining
under illumination. It has been recently invented in Au/n-Si junctions, where
modulation of work function of the Au top electrode under contrasting
illumination has been invoked to explain the effect. In this paper, a different
physical mechanism for energy harvesting from shadow-effect in a Schottky
junction is proposed that does not assume change in work function of the top
electrode under illumination. The device, termed shadow-effect energy generator
(SEG), is modelled as two parallel Schottky junction solar cells, one at the
shadowed and the other at the illuminated part, connected with each other in a
closed loop circuit through the Si substrate and the top electrode. To test the
proposed mechanism, ITO/n-Si junction based SEGs have been fabricated. The
values of open circuit voltage in the SEGs have been found to be matching with
the difference of photovoltages of the two cells corrected for the potential
drop across the Si substrate, that validates the proposed mechanism. To further
corroborate the mechanism, the conventional SEG geometry has been modified by
applying a continuous ohmic coating at the back of the Si substrates that
bypasses the resistance of the Si substrate for current flow and results in
higher open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Moreover, ITO/n-Si based
SEGs have been found to produce higher output power density compared to that
reported in Au/n-Si devices in both the conventional and the new geometry.
Although the closed loop present in the equivalent circuit of the SEG devices
lead to wastage of harvested energy, the ITO/n-Si SEG devices can nevertheless
be used as self-powered sensor for light, object and movement detection as well
as for producing electricity from contrasting illumination.

approach reveals the molecular frame information encoded in the $b_{l,m}$
expansion coefficients of the PAD in a particularly clear way. Our approach
does not rely on explicit partial wave expansions of the scattering wave
function and the expressions we obtain are therefore interpreted in terms of
the vector field structure of the photoionization dipole $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$ as
a function of the photoelectron momentum $\vec{k}$. This provides very compact
expressions that reveal how molecular rotational invariants couple to the setup
(electric field polarization and detectors) rotational invariants. We rely
heavily on this approach in a companion paper on tensorial chiral setups. Here
we apply this approach to one-photon ionization and find that while $b_{0,0}$
depends only on the magnitude of $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$, $b_{1,0}$ (non-zero for
chiral molecules) is sensitive only to the components of $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$
perpendicular to $\vec{k}$ encoded in the propensity field
$\vec{B}(\vec{k})\equiv i\vec{D}^{*}(\vec{k})\times\vec{D}(\vec{k})$, and
$b_{2,0}$ is sensitive only to the the component of $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$ along
$\vec{k}$. We also analyze the resonantly enhanced two-photon case where we
show that $b_{0,0}$ and $b_{1,0}$ can be written in terms of an effectively
stretched $\vec{D}(\vec{k})$, and that $b_{1,0}$ and $b_{3,0}$ reveal
structural information of the field $\vec{B}(\vec{k})$ encoded in three of its

years ago by K G Budden has the capacity to explain the magnitude of circular
polarization seen in normal pulsars with rotation periods of the order of one
second under the assumption of a high-multiplicity electron-positron plasma.
However, a review of limiting polarization under the same assumption in
millisecond pulsars indicates that it is inapplicable there because the region
of limiting polarization lies far outside the light cylinder. The present
paper, using the ion-proton model, evaluates circular polarization both
generally and specifically for J2144-3933, and gives a fairly detailed
understanding of the observations in normal pulsars including the change of
sign as a function of frequency seen in J0908-4913. But it also fails to
explain circular polarization in millisecond pulsars owing to the smaller
particle number densities and birefringence of the magnetosphere in these
objects. However, the review of limiting polarization finds that, within the
ion-proton model, this distinct process can describe their circular
polarization. It is argued that certain features of millisecond pulsar Stokes

Specifically, the effect of carbon defects in wide-band gap metal oxides on

controversies and still elusive. Herein, the effect of various carbon defects
in m-ZrO2 was investigated using the density functional theory to probe the
thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties of the defective structures
against pristine m-ZrO2. The defect formation energies revealed that elevating
the temperature promotes and facilitates the formation of carbon defects.
Moreover, the binding energies confirmed the stability of all studied complex
carbon defects. Furthermore, the band edge positions against the redox
potentials of water species revealed that all the studied defective structures
can serve as photoanodes for water splitting. Additionally, CO3c (carbon atom
substituted O3c site) was the only defective structure that exhibited slight
straddling of the redox potentials of water. Importantly, all investigated
defective structures enhanced light absorption with different optical
activities. Finally, CO3cVO3c (carbon atom substituted O3c associated with O3c
vacancy) defective m-ZrO2 enjoyed low direct band gap (1.9 eV), low defect
formation energy, low exciton binding energy, high mobility of charge carriers,
fast charge transfer, and low recombination rate. Concurrently, its optical
properties were exceptional in terms of high absorption, low reflectivity and
improved static dielectric constant. Hence, the study recommends CO3cVO3c

inadequate and computationally inefficient for real-time risk quantification.
Thus, in this work, we develop algorithms to efficiently model and quantify

learning with graphs and have been increasingly applied in a multitude of
domains. Nevertheless, since most existing GNN models are based on flat
message-passing mechanisms, two limitations need to be tackled: (i) they are
costly in encoding long-range information spanning the graph structure; (ii)
they are failing to encode features in the high-order neighbourhood in the
graphs as they only perform information aggregation across the observed edges
in the original graph. To deal with these two issues, we propose a novel
Hierarchical Message-passing Graph Neural Networks framework. The key idea is
generating a hierarchical structure that re-organises all nodes in a flat graph
into multi-level super graphs, along with innovative intra- and inter-level
propagation manners. The derived hierarchy creates shortcuts connecting
far-away nodes so that informative long-range interactions can be efficiently
accessed via message passing and incorporates meso- and macro-level semantics
into the learned node representations. We present the first model to implement
this framework, termed Hierarchical Community-aware Graph Neural Network
(HC-GNN), with the assistance of a hierarchical community detection algorithm.
The theoretical analysis illustrates HC-GNN's remarkable capacity in capturing
long-range information without introducing heavy additional computation
complexity. Empirical experiments conducted on 9 datasets under transductive,
inductive, and few-shot settings exhibit that HC-GNN can outperform
state-of-the-art GNN models in network analysis tasks, including node
classification, link prediction, and community detection. Moreover, the model
analysis further demonstrates HC-GNN's robustness facing graph sparsity and the
flexibility in incorporating different GNN encoders.

above 99.9% in ideal situations. Besides, to address the experimental issue of
Rabi frequency fluctuation (Rabi error) in Rydberg atom and ensemble, we apply
the dynamical-invariant-based zero systematic-error sensitivity (ZSS) optimal
control theory to the proposed scheme. Our numerical simulations show that the
average fidelity could be 99.98% for single ensemble qubit gate and 99.94% for
two-qubit gate even when the Rabi frequency of the gate laser acquires 10%

the ground state and Rydberg levels in Rydberg ensemble, we introduce a
dispersive coupling regime between Rydberg and ground levels, based on which
the Rydberg state is adiabatically discarded. The numerical simulation
demonstrate that the quantum gate is enhanced. By combining strong Rydberg atom

transportation solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged to be the future
of transportation across the globe. However, currently, one of the biggest
bottlenecks of EVs is the battery. Small batteries limit the EVs driving range,
while big batteries are expensive and not environmentally friendly. One
potential solution to this challenge is the deployment of charging roads, i.e.,
dynamic wireless charging systems installed under the roads that enable EVs to
be charged while driving. In this paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry
to establish a framework that enables evaluating the performance of charging
roads deployment in metropolitan cities. We first present the course of actions
that a driver should take when driving from a random source to a random
destination in order to maximize dynamic charging during the trip. Next, we
analyze the distribution of the distance to the nearest charging road. This
distribution is vital for studying multiple performance metrics such as the
trip efficiency, which we define as the fraction of the total trip spent on
charging roads. Next, we derive the probability that a given trip passes
through at least one charging road. The derived probability distributions can
be used to assist urban planners and policy makers in designing the deployment
plans of dynamic wireless charging systems. In addition, they can also be used
by drivers and automobile manufacturers in choosing the best driving routes
given the road conditions and level of energy of EV battery.

activation function while using a fourth-order polynomial. We also adopt batch
normalization to normalize the inputs for the Swish function to fit the input

suspended graphene membrane as a response to a sucrose concentration
difference, providing evidence for its semi-permeability. This osmotic pressure
difference is detected via the deflection of the graphene membrane that is
measured by atomic force microscopy. Using this technique, the time dependence
of this deflection allows us to measure the water permeation rate of a single
3.4 $\mu$m diameter graphene membrane. Its value is close to the expected value
of a single nanopore in graphene. The method thus allows one to experimentally
study the semi-permeability of graphene membranes at the microscale when the
leakage rate is miniscule. It can therefore find use in the development of
graphene membranes for filtration, and can enable sensors that measure the

However, recent numerical solvers require manual discretization of the

increases the runtime as the simulations have to be cold-started for each
parameter configuration. Machine Learning based surrogate models denote
promising ways for learning complex relationship among input, parameter and
solution. However, recent generative neural networks require lots of training
data, i.e. full simulation runs making them costly. In contrast, we examine the
applicability of continuous, mesh-free neural solvers for partial differential
equations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) solely requiring
initial/boundary values and validation points for training but no simulation

decomposition that steers the number of neurons per unit volume and
significantly improves runtime. Distributed training on large-scale cluster

a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as

usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each
variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than one
hour are not used by the RETAIN model for the 30-minutes ahead of time
prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior
upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions.
In particular, it showed that the patient's state before the event is
particularily important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to
its interpretability, seems to be a very promissing model for regression or
classification tasks in healthcare.

outer layer of the self-assembled shell represents a layer from crosslinked
polymer. The procedure of encapsulation is simple and includes single
homogenization by ultrasound of the formulation that contains all ingredients
together. The produced capsules have mean radius in the range between 2 and 11
microns. By order of magnitude and trend, the capsule size follows the law of
limited coalescence with respect to the dependence on nanoparticle size and

on the concentrations of added polymer and surfactant. The produced

bin width correction (CBWC) using charged reference particle multiplicity with
CBWC done using impact parameter bins. It was found that at low energies the
centrality resolution for determining the collision centrality using charged
particle multiplicities is not good enough to reduce the initial volume
fluctuations effect for higher-order cumulant analysis. New methods need to be
developed to classify events with high centrality resolution for heavy-ion
collisions at low energies. Finally, we observed that the formation of deuteron
will suppress the higher-order cumulants and correlation functions of protons

noncritical baseline for the QCD critical point search at the high baryon

discrepancy in the magnetization reported among various methods. To resolve
this issue, in this work we revisit this model by the tensor-network state

the series expansion. The three-sublattice magnetic order is firmly confirmed
and the magnetization is determined as $M_0 = 0.161(5)$. It is about $32\%$ of
its classical value and slightly below the lower bound from the series
expansion. In comparison with the best estimated value by Monte Carlo and

for a given dynamical system. Recent developments in zeroing control barrier
functions (ZCBFs) have provided a framework for ensuring safety of a superlevel

real-world systems including robots and vehicles, which must abide by
safety-regulations, especially for use in human-occupied environments. These
safety regulations include state constraints (position and velocity) and input

satisfying system constraints for general nonlinear systems, however their
construction to satisfy state and input constraints is not straightforward.
Furthermore, the existing barrier function methods do not address the multiple

this paper, we propose a methodology to construct multiple, non-conflicting

constraints to satisfy safety regulations, while concurrently taking into

consists of a sampled-data controller and an algorithm for barrier function

federation agent. This type of learning has two main challenges: the agents
generally don't collect data over the same distribution, and the agents have
limited capabilities of storing and transmitting data. Therefore, it is
impractical for each agent to send the entire data over the network. Instead,
each agent must form a local model and decide what information is fundamental
to the learning problem, which will be sent to a central unit. The central unit
can then form the global model using only the information received from the
agents. We propose a method that tackles these challenges. First each agent
forms a local model using a low complexity reproducing kernel Hilbert space
representation. From the model the agents identify the fundamental samples
which are sent to the central unit. The fundamental samples are obtained by
solving the dual problem. The central unit then forms the global model. We show
that the solution of the federated learner converges to that of the centralized
learner asymptotically as the sample size increases. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments with both simulated data and
real data sets from an activity recognition task, for which the data is
collected from a wearable device. The experimentation results show that the
accuracy of our method converges to that of a centralized learner with
increasing sample size.

hadronic equations of state. For the inner core we employ the constant speed of
sound parametrization for quark matter. We analyze more than 3000 hybrid

temporal discretization, a two-stage fourth-order (S2O4) time marching strategy
is adopted for WENO5-AO-GKS scheme, and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4)
method is employed for WENO5-AO-HLLC scheme. For the viscous flow computation,
the GKS includes both inviscid and viscous fluxes in the evolution of a single
cell interface gas distribution function. While for the WENO5-AO-HLLC scheme,
the inviscid flux is provided by HLLC Riemann solver, and the viscous flux is
discretized by a sixth-order central difference method. Based on the tests of
forward Mach step and viscous shock tube, both schemes show outstanding shock
capturing property. From the Titarev-Toro and double shear layer tests,
WENO5-AO-GKS scheme seems to have a better resolution than WENO5-AO-HLLC
scheme. Both schemes show excellent robustness in extreme cases, such as the Le
Blanc problem. From the cases of the Noh problem and the compressible isotropic
turbulence, WENO5-AO-GKS scheme shows favorite robustness. In the compressible
isotropic turbulence and three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex problems,
WENO-AO-GKS can use a CFL number up to 0.5, instead of 0.3 for WENO5-AO-HLLC.
In terms of computational efficiency, WENO5-AO-HLLC scheme is about 27% more
expensive than WENO5-AO-GKS scheme in the two-dimensional viscous flow
problems, but is about 15% faster in the three-dimensional case. Due to the
multi-dimensionality, WENO5-AO-GKS scheme performs better than WENO5-AO-HLLC
scheme in the laminar boundary layer and the double shear layer test.

measured curtailment in Germany for the years 2013-2018 using an open model of
the transmission system, PyPSA-Eur. Our simulations include spatial and
temporal considerations, including congestion per line as well as curtailment
per control zone and quarter. Results indicate that curtailment at high network
resolution is significantly overestimated due to inaccurate allocation of
electricity demand and renewable capacities to overloaded sites. However, high
congestion rates of the transmission network decrease as the network is
clustered to a smaller number of nodes, thus reducing curtailment. A measure to
capture errors in the assignment of electricity demand and power plants is
defined and hints towards a preferable spatial resolution. Thus, we are able to
balance the effects of accurate node assignment and network congestion
revealing that a reduced model can capture curtailment from recent historical
data. This shows that it is possible to reduce the network to improve
computation times and capture the most important effects of network constraints
on variable renewable energy feed-in at the same time.

method (FDM) based on the nonlinear upwind schemes, e.g. WENO5, might violate
free-stream preserving (FP), due to the loss of the geometric conservation law
(GCL) identity when applied on the curvilinear grids. Although some techniques
on FP have been proposed previously, no general rule is given for this issue.
In this paper, by rearranging the upwind dissipation of the nonlinear schemes
as a combination of sub-stencil reconstructions (taking WENO5 as an example),
it can be proved that the upwind dissipation diminishes under the uniform flow
condition if the metrics yield an identical value under the same schemes with
these reconstructions, making the free-stream condition be preserved. According
to this sufficient condition, the novel FP metrics are constructed for WENO5
and WENO7. By this means the original forms of these WENO schemes can be kept.
In addition, the accuracy of these schemes can be retained as well with a
simple accuracy compensation by replacing the central part fluxes with a
high-order one. Various validations indicate that the present FP schemes retain
the great capability to resolve the smooth regions accurately and capture the
discontinuities robustly.

multi-scale structures in the compressible regime for Mach numbers at subsonic

aim at identifying similarities and differences that these interactions have
with corresponding interactions in the canonical incompressible flow problem.
To account for the geometrical complexity associated with the fractal
structures, we apply an immersed boundary method to model the no-slip boundary
condition at the solid surfaces, with adequate mesh resolution in the vicinity
of the small fractal features. We validate the numerical results through
extensive comparisons with experimental wind tunnel measurements at a low Mach
number. Similar to the incompressible flow case results, we find a break-up of
the flow structures by the fractal plate and an increase in turbulent mixing in
the downstream direction. As the Mach number increases, we observe noticeable
wake meandering and higher spread rate of the wake in the lateral direction
perpendicular to the streamwise-spanwise plane. Although not significant, we
quantify the difference between the square and the fractal plates using
two-point velocity correlations across the Mach number range. The wakes
generated by the fractal plate in the compressible regime showed lower
turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and energy spectra levels compared to those of
the square case. Moreover, results in terms of the near-field pressure spectra
seem to indicate that the fractal plate has the potential to reduce the
aerodynamic noise.

opportunities for large scale harassment. In particular, a phenomenon known as
zoombombing has emerged, in which aggressors join online meetings with the goal
of disrupting them and harassing their participants. In this paper, we conduct
the first data-driven analysis of calls for zoombombing attacks on social
media. We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts
containing meeting invitations to these platforms on a mainstream social
network, Twitter, and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated
attacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to
identify posts that are calling for zoombombing attacks, and apply thematic
analysis to develop a codebook to better characterize the discussion
surrounding calls for zoombombing. During the first seven months of 2020, we
identify over 200 calls for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze
these calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings indicate that
the vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made by attackers stumbling
upon meeting invitations or bruteforcing their meeting ID, but rather by
insiders who have legitimate access to these meetings, particularly students in
high school and college classes. This has important security implications,
because it makes common protections against zoombombing, such as password
protection, ineffective. We also find instances of insiders instructing
attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants in the class to avoid
detection, making countermeasures like setting up a waiting room and vetting
participants less effective. Based on these observations, we argue that the
only effective defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for

requires tedious evidence-collecting but lacks available comparative
information. Clues mined from user comments, as the wisdom of crowds, could be
of considerable benefit to this task. However, it is non-trivial to capture the
complex semantics from the contents and comments in consideration of their
implicit correlations. Although deep neural networks have good expressive
power, one major drawback is the lack of explainability. In this paper, we
focus on how to learn from the post contents and related comments in social

explainability. We thus propose a Quantum-probability based Signed Attention
Network (QSAN) that integrates the quantum-driven text encoding and a novel
signed attention mechanism in a unified framework. QSAN is not only able to
distinguish important comments from the others, but also can exploit the
conflicting social viewpoints in the comments to facilitate the detection.
Moreover, QSAN is advantageous with its explainability in terms of transparency
due to quantum physics meanings and the attention weights. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and can provide different kinds of user comments to
explain why a piece of information is detected as false.

solvers to optimize certain aspects of neural networks (NNs). However the
intriguing approach of training NNs with MIP solvers is under-explored.
State-of-the-art-methods to train NNs are typically gradient-based and require
significant data, computation on GPUs, and extensive hyper-parameter tuning. In
contrast, training with MIP solvers does not require GPUs or heavy
hyper-parameter tuning, but currently cannot handle anything but small amounts
of data. This article builds on recent advances that train binarized NNs using
MIP solvers. We go beyond current work by formulating new MIP models which
improve training efficiency and which can train the important class of
integer-valued neural networks (INNs). We provide two novel methods to further
the potential significance of using MIP to train NNs. The first method
optimizes the number of neurons in the NN while training. This reduces the need
for deciding on network architecture before training. The second method
addresses the amount of training data which MIP can feasibly handle: we provide
a batch training method that dramatically increases the amount of data that MIP
solvers can use to train. We thus provide a promising step towards using much
more data than before when training NNs using MIP models. Experimental results
on two real-world data-limited datasets demonstrate that our approach strongly
outperforms the previous state of the art in training NN with MIP, in terms of
accuracy, training time and amount of data. Our methodology is proficient at
training NNs when minimal training data is available, and at training with
minimal memory requirements -- which is potentially valuable for deploying to
low-memory devices.

Detailed observations with Fermi-LAT have shown that these interactions must be
strongly affected by solar magnetic fields in order to produce the wide range
of observational features, such as high flux and hard spectrum. However, the
detailed mechanisms behind these features are still a mystery. In this work, we
tackle this problem by performing particle-interaction simulations in the solar
atmosphere in the presence of coronal magnetic fields modeled using the
potential field source surface (PFSS) model. We find that the low-energy (~GeV)
gamma-ray production is significantly enhanced by the coronal magnetic fields,
but the enhancement decreases rapidly with energy. The enhancement is directly
correlated with the production of gamma rays with large deviation angles
relative to the input cosmic-ray direction. We conclude that coronal magnetic

the literature. Evaluation of the new scalar field postulated by SFDM according
to these criteria reveals that it is as much (dark) matter as anything could
possibly be, but also$-$below the critical temperature for superfluidity$-$as
much (of a modification of) spacetime as anything could possibly be. A sequel
paper examines possible interpretations of SFDM in light of this result, as
well as the consequences for our understanding of (the importance of) the
modified gravity/ dark matter distinction and the broader spacetime-matter

assuming a strict conceptual dichotomy between spacetime and matter. Our
approach proceeds via the more narrow distinction between modified
gravity/spacetime (MG) and dark matter (DM). A prequel paper argued that the
novel field $\Phi$ postulated by Berezhiani and Khoury's 'superfluid dark
matter theory' is as much (dark) matter as anything could possibly be, but
also$-$below the critical temperature for superfluidity$-$as much (of a
modification of) spacetime as anything could possibly be. Here we introduce and
critically evaluate three groups of interpretations that one should consider
for such Janus-faced theories. The consubstantiality interpretation holds that
$\Phi$ is both (dark) matter and a modification of spacetime, analogously to
the sense in which Jesus (according to catholicism) is both human and god. The
fundamendalist interpretations consider for each of these roles whether they
are instantiated fundamentally or emergently. The breakdown interpretations
focus on the question of whether $\Phi$ signals the breakdown, in some sense to
be specified, of the MG-DM dichotomy and perhaps even the broader
spacetime-matter distinction. More generally, it is argued that hybrid theories
urge a move towards a single space of theories, rather than two separate spaces
of spacetime theories and matter theories, respectively.

Neural-PDE can efficiently extract the dynamics within 20 epochs training, and

attracted for a few decades an increasing number of studies, notably in the
fields of Psychology, Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Biochemistry. However, since
our perception of emotions is not, so far, directly detectable nor recordable
by our measure instruments, Physics and Mathematics have not been so far used
academically to provide a precise description of the phenomenon of feeling an
emotion. Relying upon the works of O. Elahi and on the hypothesis that the
human soul and its psyche may manifest in ourselves (in both conscious and

a few mathematical descriptions consistent with the human personal experience,
of the feeling and cognition of emotions. As far as we know, such a
mathematical description has never been provided before. It allows a
quantitative (intensity) and qualitative (nature of feelings/frequency) of the
emotional phenomenon which provides a novel scientific approach of the nature
of the mind, complementary to the on going research of physiological
manifestation of emotions. We anticipate such an approach and the associated
mathematical modeling to become an important tool to describe emotions and
their subsequent behavior. In complement of the modeling of oscillations and

search space of binarized convolutions, is introduced to produce extremely
compressed models to reduce huge computational cost on embedded devices for
edge computing. The BNAS calculation is more challenging than NAS due to the
learning inefficiency caused by optimization requirements and the huge
architecture space, and the performance loss when handling the wild data in
various computing applications. To address these issues, we introduce operation
space reduction and channel sampling into BNAS to significantly reduce the cost
of searching. This is accomplished through a performance-based strategy that is
robust to wild data, which is further used to abandon less potential
operations. Furthermore, we introduce the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to solve
1-bit BNAS. Two optimization methods for binarized neural networks are used to
validate the effectiveness of our BNAS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed BNAS achieves a comparable performance to NAS on both CIFAR and
ImageNet databases. An accuracy of $96.53\%$ vs. $97.22\%$ is achieved on the
CIFAR-10 dataset, but with a significantly compressed model, and a $40\%$

Bayesian equilibria that use private beliefs in their strategies as sufficient
statistics for summarizing their observation history. The main difficulty in
finding the appropriate sufficient statistic (state) for the structured
strategies arises from the fact that players need to construct (private)
beliefs on other players' private beliefs on V, which in turn would imply that
an infinite hierarchy of beliefs on beliefs needs to be constructed, rendering
the problem unsolvable. We show that this is not the case: each player's belief
on other players' beliefs on V can be characterized by her own belief on V and
some appropriately defined public belief. We then specialize this setting to
the case of a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) non-zero-sum game and we
characterize linear structured PBE that can be found through a backward/forward
algorithm akin to dynamic programming for the standard LQG control problem.
Unlike the standard LQG problem, however, some of the required quantities for
the Kalman filter are observation-dependent and thus cannot be evaluated

show similar results for deterministic and non-deterministic PolylogTime as

model fusion algorithm for making long-term glucose predictions for diabetic
people. First, using the history of glucose predictions made by several models,
the future glucose variation at a given horizon is predicted. Then, by
accumulating the past predicted variations starting from a known glucose value,
the fused glucose prediction is computed. A new loss function is introduced to
make the DCP model learn to react faster to changes in glucose variations.
  The algorithm has been tested on 10 \textit{in-silico} type-1 diabetic
children from the T1DMS software. Three initial predictors have been used: a
Gaussian process regressor, a feed-forward neural network and an extreme
learning machine model. The DCP and two other fusion algorithms have been
evaluated at a prediction horizon of 120 minutes with the root-mean-squared
error of the prediction, the root-mean-squared error of the predicted
variation, and the continuous glucose-error grid analysis.
  By making a successful trade-off between prediction accuracy and
predicted-variation accuracy, the DCP, alongside with its specifically designed
loss function, improves the clinical acceptability of the predictions, and
therefore the safety of the model for diabetic people.

geophysical applications; incorporating theoretical guidance into DNNs has
improved the generalizability. However, most of such approaches define the loss
function based on the strong form of conservation laws (via partial
differential equations, PDEs), which is subject to deteriorated accuracy when
the PDE has high order derivatives or the solution has strong discontinuities.
Herein, we propose a weak form theory-guided neural network (TgNN-wf), which
incorporates the weak form formulation of the PDE into the loss function
combined with data constraint and initial and boundary conditions
regularizations to tackle the aforementioned difficulties. In the weak form,
high order derivatives in the PDE can be transferred to the test functions by
performing integration-by-parts, which reduces computational error. We use
domain decomposition with locally defined test functions, which captures local
discontinuity effectively. Two numerical cases demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed TgNN-wf over the strong form TgNN, including the hydraulic head
prediction for unsteady-state 2D single-phase flow problems and the saturation
profile prediction for 1D two-phase flow problems. Results show that TgNN-wf
consistently has higher accuracy than TgNN, especially when strong
discontinuity in the solution is present. TgNN-wf also trains faster than TgNN
when the number of integration subdomains is not too large (<10,000). Moreover,
TgNN-wf is more robust to noises. Thus, the proposed TgNN-wf paves the way for
which a variety of deep learning problems in the small data regime can be
solved more accurately and efficiently.

The data requirements of this information-theoretic approach to GSA are met by
replacing computationally intensive components of the physics-based model with
a deep neural network surrogate. Subsequently, the GSA is used to explain the
network predictions, and the surrogate is deployed to close design loops.
Viewed as an uncertainty quantification method for interrogating the surrogate,
this framework is compatible with a wide variety of black-box models. We
demonstrate that the surrogate-driven mutual information GSA provides useful

Consequently, our information-theoretic GSA provides an ""outer loop"" for
accelerated product design by identifying the most and least sensitive input
directions and performing subsequent optimization over appropriately reduced

critical point admits three boundary universality classes: the ordinary, the
extra-ordinary and the special. For the ordinary transition the bulk and the
boundary order simultaneously; the extra-ordinary fixed point corresponds to
the bulk transition occurring in the presence of an ordered boundary, while the
special fixed point corresponds to a boundary phase transition between the
ordinary and the extra-ordinary classes. While the ordinary fixed point
survives in $d = 3$, it is less clear what happens to the extra-ordinary and
special fixed points when $d = 3$ and $N \ge 2$. Here we show that formally
treating $N$ as a continuous parameter, there exists a critical value $N_c > 2$
separating two distinct regimes. For $N < N_c$ the extra-ordinary fixed point
survives in $d = 3$, albeit in a modified form: the long-range boundary order
is lost, instead, the order parameter correlation function decays as a power of
$\log r$. In particular, for $N=2$, starting in the surface phase with
quasi-long-range order and approaching the bulk phase transition, the stiffness
of the surface order parameter diverges logarithmically. For $N > N_c$ there is
no fixed point with order parameter correlations decaying slower than power
law; we discuss two scenarios for the evolution of the phase diagram past $N =
N_c$. Our findings appear to be consistent with recent Monte-Carlo studies of
classical models with $N = 2$ and $N = 3$. We also compare our results to

this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which
may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where
patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients
with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require
expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have
negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce
COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored
for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven
design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark
CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National
Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases.
Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an
explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the

COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both

COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that

process changes, in terms of detecting and localising changes and studying the

detection and management of changes, that is, whether to promote a change to
become part of an improved process, or to reject the change and make decisions

synthesized `lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from
which we learn a normalcy-converting network (NormNet) that turns an 'abnormal'
image back to normal. Our experiments on three different datasets validate the
effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.

understanding and prediction of the physical properties of complex materials.
For fluid flow in porous materials, characterizing the geometry of the pore
microstructure facilitates prediction of permeability, a key property that has
been extensively studied in material science, geophysics and chemical
engineering. In this work, we study the predictability of different structural
descriptors via both linear regressions and neural networks. A large data set
of 30,000 virtual, porous microstructures of different types is created for
this end. We compute permeabilities of these structures using the lattice
Boltzmann method, and characterize the pore space geometry using one-point
correlation functions (porosity, specific surface), two-point surface-surface,
surface-void, and void-void correlation functions, as well as the geodesic
tortuosity as an implicit descriptor. Then, we study the prediction of the
permeability using different combinations of these descriptors. We obtain
significant improvements of performance when compared to a Kozeny-Carman
regression with only lowest-order descriptors (porosity and specific surface).
We find that combining all three two-point correlation functions and tortuosity
provides the best prediction of permeability, with the void-void correlation
function being the most informative individual descriptor. Moreover, the
combination of porosity, specific surface, and geodesic tortuosity provides
very good predictive performance. This shows that higher-order correlation
functions are extremely useful for forming a general model for predicting
physical properties of complex materials. Additionally, our results suggest
that neural networks are superior to the more conventional regression methods
for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships.

  Methods",,,"10.1016/j.jsc.2022.01.004",,"cs.CG cs.LO cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present two characterizations of positive invariance of sets under the
flow of systems of ordinary differential equations. The first characterization
uses inward sets which intuitively collect those points from which the flow
evolves within the set for a short period of time, whereas the second
characterization uses the notion of exit sets, which intuitively collect those
points from which the flow immediately leaves the set. Our proofs emphasize the
use of the real induction principle as a generic and unifying proof technique
that captures the essence of the formal reasoning justifying our results and
provides cleaner alternative proofs of known results. The two characterizations
presented in this article, while essentially equivalent, lead to two rather
different decision procedures (termed respectively LZZ and ESE) for checking
whether a given semi-algebraic set is positively invariant under the flow of a
system of polynomial ordinary differential equations. The procedure LZZ
improves upon the original work by Liu, Zhan and Zhao (EMSOFT 2011). The
procedure ESE, introduced in this article, works by splitting the problem, in a
principled way, into simpler sub-problems that are easier to check, and is
shown to exhibit substantially better performance compared to LZZ on problems
featuring semi-algebraic sets described by formulas with non-trivial Boolean
structure.

performance in many computer vision tasks. The increasing size of CNN models,
however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited
computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of
model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important
neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss.
Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical
threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance
the trade-off between model size and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated
interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this
process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we
address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner.
It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability
and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans
according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner
integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users
understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning
plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we
validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner.
