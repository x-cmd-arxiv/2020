detection (CoKe). Keypoint detection differs from other visual tasks where
contrastive learning has been applied because the input is a set of images in
which multiple keypoints are annotated. This requires the contrastive learning
to be extended such that the keypoints are represented and detected
independently, which enables the contrastive loss to make the keypoint features
different from each other and from the background. Our approach has two
benefits: It enables us to exploit contrastive learning for keypoint detection,
and by detecting each keypoint independently the detection becomes more robust
to occlusion compared to holistic methods, such as stacked hourglass networks,
which attempt to detect all keypoints jointly. Our CoKe framework introduces
several technical innovations. In particular, we introduce: (i) A clutter bank
to represent non-keypoint features; (ii) a keypoint bank that stores
prototypical representations of keypoints to approximate the contrastive loss
between keypoints; and (iii) a cumulative moving average update to learn the
keypoint prototypes while training the feature extractor. Our experiments on a
range of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D) show that our approach
works as well, or better than, alternative methods for keypoint detection, even
for human keypoints, for which the literature is vast. Moreover, we observe
that CoKe is exceptionally robust to partial occlusion and previously unseen
object poses.

lineshape of photoexcited nickel can be described by a Gaussian broadening
($\sigma$) and a red shift ($\omega_{s}$) of the ground state absorption
spectrum. Theory predicts, and the experimental results verify that after
initial rapid carrier thermalization, the electron temperature increase
($\Delta T$) is linearly proportional to the Gaussian broadening factor
$\sigma$, providing quantitative real-time tracking of the relaxation of the
electron temperature. Measurements reveal an electron cooling time for 50 nm
thick polycrystalline nickel films of 640$\pm$80 fs. With hot thermalized
carriers, the spectral red shift exhibits a power-law relationship with the
change in electron temperature of $\omega_{s}\propto\Delta T^{1.5}$. Rapid
electron thermalization via carrier-carrier scattering accompanies and follows
the nominal 4 fs photoexcitation pulse until the carriers reach a quasi-thermal
equilibrium. Entwined with a <6 fs instrument response function, carrier
thermalization times ranging from 34 fs to 13 fs are estimated from
experimental data acquired at different pump fluences and it is observed that
the electron thermalization time decreases with increasing pump fluence. The
study provides an initial example of measuring electron temperature and
thermalization in metals in real time with XUV light, and it lays a foundation
for further investigation of photoinduced phase transitions and carrier
transport in metals with core-level absorption spectroscopy.

With ASL, we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple popular multi-label

study the convergence of this series (a preliminary step, to study Ramanujan

  Our first main result, the ""Finiteness convergence Theorem"", for $G$

  Our second main result, the ""Finite Euler product explicit formula"", for

particular, we have: $F(a)=R_G(a)$ converges absolutely, being finite (of
length depending on non-zero $p-$adic valuations of $a$).
  Our third main result, called the ""Multiplicative Ramanujan clouds"", studies
the important subsets of $<F>_M$; also giving, for all multiplicative $F$, the

no raw data sharing, the real-time statistics could still expose the data
privacy of crowd-sourcing participants. For mitigating the privacy concern,
while traditional differential privacy (DP) mechanism can be simply implemented

challenging, especially when uncertain input variables, such as the weather,
play a role. Since ensemble weather predictions aim to capture the uncertainty
in the weather system, they can be used to propagate this uncertainty through
to subsequent wind power forecasting models. However, as weather ensemble
systems are known to be biased and underdispersed, meteorologists post-process
the ensembles. This post-processing can successfully correct the biases in the
weather variables but has not been evaluated thoroughly in the context of
subsequent forecasts, such as wind power generation forecasts. The present
paper evaluates multiple strategies for applying ensemble post-processing to
probabilistic wind power forecasts. We use Ensemble Model Output Statistics
(EMOS) as the post-processing method and evaluate four possible strategies:
only using the raw ensembles without post-processing, a one-step strategy where
only the weather ensembles are post-processed, a one-step strategy where we
only post-process the power ensembles, and a two-step strategy where we
post-process both the weather and power ensembles. Results show that
post-processing the final wind power ensemble improves forecast performance
regarding both calibration and sharpness, whilst only post-processing the
weather ensembles does not necessarily lead to increased forecast performance.

Gaussian dynamic linear regression within a Bayesian framework. In particular,
we propose a novel method that allows for time-varying sparsity, based on an
extension of spike-and-slab priors for dynamic models. This is done by
assigning appropriate Markov switching priors for the time-varying
coefficients' variances, extending the previous work of Ishwaran and Rao
(2005). Furthermore, we investigate different priors, including the common
Inverted gamma prior for the process variances, and other mixture prior
distributions such as Gamma priors for both the spike and the slab, which leads
to a mixture of Normal-Gammas priors (Griffin ad Brown, 2010) for the
coefficients. In this sense, our prior can be view as a dynamic variable
selection prior which induces either smoothness (through the slab) or shrinkage
towards zero (through the spike) at each time point. The MCMC method used for
posterior computation uses Markov latent variables that can assume binary
regimes at each time point to generate the coefficients' variances. In that
way, our model is a dynamic mixture model, thus, we could use the algorithm of
Gerlach et al (2000) to generate the latent processes without conditioning on
the states. Finally, our approach is exemplified through simulated examples and
a real data application.

Neural Processing to synthesize fMRI data from electroencephalographic (EEG)
data. Given the distinct spatiotemporal nature of haemodynamic and
electrophysiological signals, this problem is formulated as the task of
learning a mapping function between multivariate time series with highly
dissimilar structures. A comparison of state-of-the-art synthesis approaches,
including Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Pairwise Learning,
is undertaken. Results highlight the feasibility of EEG to fMRI brain image
mappings, pinpointing the role of current advances in Machine Learning and
showing the relevance of upcoming contributions to further improve performance.
EEG to fMRI synthesis offers a way to enhance and augment brain image data, and
guarantee access to more affordable, portable and long-lasting protocols of
brain activity monitoring. The code used in this manuscript is available in
Github and the datasets are open source.

Given this starting point, we then build a cosmological perturbation theory on
top of it, study the gauge transformation properties related to this new set of
perturbations and show the connection with standard cosmological perturbation
theory. In particular, we obtain which gauge in standard perturbation theory
corresponds to the GLC gauge, and put in evidence how this is a useful
alternative to the standard Synchronous Gauge. Moreover, we exploit several
viable definitions for gauge invariant combinations. Among others, we build the
gauge invariant variables such that their values equal the ones of linearized
GLC gauge perturbations. This choice is motivated by two crucial properties of
the GLC gauge: i) it admits simple expressions for light-like observables, e.g.
redshift and angular distance, at fully non-linear level and ii) the GLC proper
time coincides with the one of a free-falling observer. Thanks to the first
property, exact expressions can then be easily expanded at linear order to
obtain linear gauge invariant expression for the chosen observable. Moreover,
the second feature naturally provides gauge invariant expressions for physical
observables in terms of the time as measured by such free-falling observer.
Finally, we explicitly show all these aspects for the case of the linearized
angular distance-redshift relation.

structural damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, in
Alzheimer's disease the formation of Amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins
neurofibrillary tangles follows from the accumulation of different proteins
into large aggregates through specific mechanisms such as nucleation and
elongation. These mechanisms have been studied in vitro where total protein
mass is conserved. However, in vivo, clearance mechanisms may play an important
role in limiting the formation of aggregates. Here, we generalise classical
models of protein aggregation to take into account both production of monomers
and the clearance of protein aggregates. Depending on the clearance model, we
show that there may be a critical clearance value above which aggregation does
not take place. Our result offers further evidence in support of the hypotheses
that clearance mechanisms play a potentially crucial role in neurodegenerative
disease initiation and progression; and as such, are a possible therapeutic
target.

$\simeq$$1$$-$$10$ au is still not fully understood because numerical studies
of Type II migration in protoplanetary disks often predict a decay of the
semi-major axis that is too fast. According to recent 2D simulations, inward
migration of a gap-opening planet can be slowed down or even reversed if the
outer gap edge becomes heated by irradiation from the central star, and puffed
up.
  Aims. Here we study how stellar irradiation reduces the disk-driven torque
and affects migration in more realistic 3D disks.
  Methods. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations with radiation transfer, we
investigated the static torque acting on a single gap-opening planet embedded
in a passively heated accretion disk.
  Results. Our simulations confirm that a temperature inversion is established
at the irradiated outer gap edge and the local increase of the scale height
reduces the magnitude of the negative outer Lindblad torque. However, the
temperature excess is smaller than assumed in 2D simulations and the torque
reduction only becomes prominent for specific parameters. For the viscosity
$\alpha=10^{-3}$, the total torque is reduced for planetary masses ranging from
$0.1$ to $0.7$ Jupiter mass, with the strongest reduction being by a factor of
$-0.17$ (implying outward migration) for a Saturn-mass planet. For a
Jupiter-mass planet, the torque reduction becomes stronger with increasing
$\alpha$ (the torque is halved when $\alpha=5\times10^{-3}$).
  Conclusions. We conclude that planets that open moderately wide and deep gaps
are subject to the largest torque modifications and their Type II migration can
be stalled due to gap edge illumination. We then argue that the torque
reduction can help to stabilize the orbits of giant planets forming at
$\gtrsim$$1$ au.

technique. From the variation of Gilbert damping with W and CoFeB thicknesses,
the spin diffusion length of W and spin-mixing conductances are extracted.
Subsequently, T is derived as 0.81 \pm 0.03 for the \beta-W/CoFeB interface. A
sharp variation of Geff and T with W thickness is observed in consonance with
the thickness-dependent structural phase transition and resistivity of W. The
spin memory loss and two-magnon scattering effects are found to have negligible
contributions to damping modulation as opposed to spin pumping effect which is
reconfirmed from the invariance of damping with Cu spacer layer thickness
inserted between W and CoFeB. The observation of giant interfacial spin
transparency and its strong dependence on crystal structures of W will be
important for pure spin current based spin-orbitronic devices.

prestellar core. In our model, as the core's density increases, it remains
immersed in a constant-density environment and so it accretes from this
environment, increasing its mass and reducing its Jeans length. Assuming a
power-law density profile $\rho \propto r^{-p}$, we compute the rate of change
of the slope $p$, and show that the value $p=2$ is stationary, and furthermore,
an attractor. The radial profile of the Jeans length scales as $r^{p/2}$,
implying that, for $p<2$, there is a radius below which the region is smaller
than its Jeans length, thus appearing gravitationally stable and in need of
pressure confinement, while, in reality, it is part of a larger-scale collapse
and is undergoing compression by the infalling material. In this region, the
infall speed decreases towards the center, eventually becoming subsonic, thus
appearing ""coherent"", without the need for turbulence dissipation. We present a
compilation of observational determinations of density profiles in dense cores
and show that the distribution of their slopes peaks at $p \sim 1.7$--1.9,
supporting the notion that the profile steepens over time. Finally, we discuss
the case of magnetic support in a core in which the field scales as $B \propto
\rho^\beta$. For the expected value of $\beta = 2/3$, this implies that the
mass to magnetic flux ratio also decreases towards the central parts of the
cores, making them appear magnetically supported, while in reality they may be
part of larger collapsing supercritical region. We conclude that local
signatures of either thermal or magnetic support are not conclusive evidence of
stability, that the gravitational instability of a region must be established
at the large scales, and that the prestellar stage of collapse is dynamic
rather than quasistatic.

with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom, which is a cylinder of 200 mm in
diameter and length. The prompt gamma rays generated in the phantom are
collimated with a multi-slat collimator and detected using a combination of
yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP) scintillators, installed in the collimator
apertures, and light sensors. Two scintillator packing schemes, with one and
with two scintillator plates per aperture, are considered. The collimator
configuration (the septal thickness, aperture and height), resulting in the
best precision, is determined using two methods of detector optimization.
Precision of 2.1 mm (full width at half maximum) in the edge position

explicitly considers external weather conditions, extreme temperatures in

rating changes are modeled due to temperature disturbance, the probabilities
for transmission line and generator outages are evaluated, and the timing for

external temperature changes, could together contribute to voltage instability.
Besides, we model undervoltage load shedding and operator re-dispatch as
control strategies for preventing the propagation of cascading failures. The
effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by simulation results on the
RTS-96 3-area system and it is found that temperature disturbances can lead to
correlated load change and line/generator tripping, which together will greatly
increase the risk of cascading and voltage instability. Critical temperature
change, critical area with temperature disturbance, identification of most
vulnerable buses, and comparison of different control strategies are also

fascinating subject to study in the field of biomimetic robotics. A Bat, in

presents the derivation of a multi-body dynamical system of a bio-inspired bat

degrees-of-freedom for flapping flight that is present in biological bats.
Then, the work attempts to manifest closed-loop aerial body reorientation and
preparation for landing through the manipulation of inertial dynamics and
aerodynamics by enforcing nonholonomic constraints onto the system. The
proposed design paradigm assumes for rapidly exponentially stable controllers
that enforce holonomic constraints in the joint space of the model. A model and

perspective of the status of this theoretical quest and the physics and
astrophysics upon which its resolution seems to depend. The delayed
neutrino-heating mechanism is emerging as a robust solution, but there remain
many issues to address, not the least of which involves the chaos of the
dynamics, before victory can unambiguously be declared. It is impossible to
review in detail all aspects of this multi-faceted, more-than-half-century-long
theoretical quest. Rather, we here map out the major ingredients of explosion
and the emerging systematics of the observables with progenitor mass, as we
currently see them. Our discussion will of necessity be speculative in parts,
and many of the ideas may not survive future scrutiny. Some statements may be
viewed as informed predictions concerning the numerous observables that rightly
exercise astronomers witnessing and diagnosing the supernova Universe.
Importantly, the same explosion in the inside, by the same mechanism, can look
very different in photons, depending upon the mass and radius of the star upon
explosion. A 10$^{51}$-erg (one ""Bethe"") explosion of a red supergiant with a
massive hydrogen-rich envelope, a diminished hydrogen envelope, no hydrogen
envelope, and, perhaps, no hydrogen envelope or helium shell all look very
different, yet might have the same core and explosion evolution.

completeness for reconstruction of clothed people is limited due to the large
variation in shape resulting from clothing, hair, body size, pose and camera
viewpoint. This paper introduces two advances to overcome this limitation:
firstly a new synthetic dataset of realistic clothed people, 3DVH; and
secondly, a novel multiple-view loss function for training of monocular
volumetric shape estimation, which is demonstrated to significantly improve
generalisation and reconstruction accuracy. The 3DVH dataset of realistic
clothed 3D human models rendered with diverse natural backgrounds is
demonstrated to allows transfer to reconstruction from real images of people.
Comprehensive comparative performance evaluation on both synthetic and real

outperforms the previous state-of-the-art learning-based single image 3D human

accuracy, completeness, and quality. An ablation study shows that this is due

discontinuous mass over time, i.e. have mass drop. It has long been conjectured
that the Brakke flow associated to a nonfattening level set flow has no mass
drop and achieves equality in the Brakke inequality. Under natural assumptions,
we show that a flow has no mass drop if and only if it satisfies the
multiplicity one conjecture $\mathcal{H}^n$-a.e. One application is that there
is no mass drop for level set flows with mean convex neighborhoods of

multiplicity planar tangent flow. Also, if a nonfattening flow has no higher
multiplicity planes as limit flows, then each limit flow has no mass drop. We
upgrade these results to equality in the Brakke inequality for certain

of an astronomical object. Yet, many published exoplanets lack a measurement of
their true mass, in particular those detected thanks to radial velocity (RV)
variations of their host star. For those, only the minimum mass, or $m\sin i$,
is known, owing to the insensitivity of RVs to the inclination of the detected
orbit compared to the plane-of-the-sky. The mass that is given in database is
generally that of an assumed edge-on system ($\sim$90$^\circ$), but many other
inclinations are possible, even extreme values closer to 0$^\circ$ (face-on).
In such case, the mass of the published object could be strongly underestimated
by up to two orders of magnitude. In the present study, we use GASTON, a tool
recently developed in Kiefer et al. (2019) & Kiefer (2019) to take advantage of
the voluminous Gaia astrometric database, in order to constrain the inclination
and true mass of several hundreds of published exoplanet candidates. We find 9
exoplanet candidates in the stellar or brown dwarf (BD) domain, among which 6
were never characterized. We show that 30 Ari B b, HD 141937 b, HD 148427 b, HD

periods shows of a void of BD detections below $\sim$100 days, while
eccentricity and metallicity distributions agree with a transition between BDs

years, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has risen as a leading
platform for the above applications. The current single-shot readout of the NV
electron spin relies on resonance fluorescence method at cryogenic temperature.
However, the the spin-flip process interrupts the optical cycling transition,
therefore, limits the readout fidelity. Here, we introduce a spin-to-charge
conversion method assisted by near-infrared (NIR) light to suppress the
spin-flip error. This method leverages high spin-selectivity of cryogenic
resonance excitation and high flexibility of photonionization. We achieve an
overall fidelity $>$ 95% for the single-shot readout of an NV center electron
spin in the presence of high strain and fast spin-flip process. With further
improvements, this technique has the potential to achieve spin readout fidelity
exceeding the fault-tolerant threshold, and may also find applications on
integrated optoelectronic devices.

pairwise into counter-propagating edge modes by a flux bias or voltage bias
applied to a Josephson junction. An unpaired edge mode carries zero electrical

calculate the shot noise power produced by a sequence of edge vortices and find
that it increases logarithmically with their spacing - even if the spacing is
much larger than the core size so the vortices do not overlap. This nonlocality
produces an anomalous V log V increase of the shot noise in a voltage-biased

closed-loop simulation can involve solving thousands of optimization problems).
The proposed BO framework seeks to quickly identify the optimal tuning
parameters by strategically exploring and exploiting the space of the tuning

MPC controller for a central HVAC plant using realistic data. Here, the BO
framework tunes back-off terms for thermal storage tanks to minimize year-long
closed-loop costs. Simulation results show that BO can find the optimal
back-off terms by conducting 13 year-long simulations, which significantly
reduces the computational burden of a naive grid search. We also find that the
back-off terms obtained with BO reduce the closed-loop costs.

present data suggest the possibility of an increase along the quasar main
sequence along with prominence of optical Fe II emission. Extreme Population A
sources with the strongest Fe II emission offer several advantages with respect
to the quasar general population, as their optical and UV emission lines can be
interpreted as the sum of a low-ionization component roughly at quasar rest
frame (from virialized gas), plus a blueshifted excess (a disk wind), in
different physical conditions. Specifically, in terms of ionization parameter,
cloud density, metallicity and column density. Capitalizing on these results,
we analyze the component at rest frame and the blueshifted one, exploiting the
dependence (of several intensity line ratios on metallicity $Z$). We find that
the validity of intensity line ratios as metallicity indicators depends on the
physical conditions. We apply the measured diagnostic ratios to estimate the
physical properties of sources such as density, ionization, and metallicity of
the gas. Our results confirm that the two regions (the low-ionization component

different physical conditions and suggest metallicity values that are high, and
probably the highest along the quasar main sequence, with $Z \gtrsim 10

presents a method to model the conformance to traffic rules for interactive

solved using Monte Carlo Tree Search, for which we contribute a new method to

physical phenomena, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, topological
defects, quantum criticality, and duality. Although the quasi-1D ferromagnet
CoNb$_2$O$_6$ has been put forward as the best material example of the
transverse field Ising model, it exhibits significant deviations from ideality.
Through a combination of THz spectroscopy and theory, we show that
CoNb$_2$O$_6$ in fact is well described by a different model with strong bond
dependent interactions, which we dub the {\it twisted Kitaev chain}, as these
interactions share a close resemblance to a one-dimensional version of the
intensely studied honeycomb Kitaev model. In this model the ferromagnetic
ground state of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ arises from the compromise between two distinct
alternating axes rather than a single easy axis. Due to this frustration, even
at zero applied field domain-wall excitations have quantum motion that is
described by the celebrated Su-Schriefer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. This
leads to rich behavior as a function of field. Despite the anomalous domain
wall dynamics, close to a critical transverse field the twisted Kitaev chain
enters a universal regime in the Ising universality class. This is reflected by
the observation that the excitation gap in CoNb$_2$O$_6$ in the ferromagnetic
regime closes at a rate precisely twice that of the paramagnet. This originates
in the duality between domain walls and spin-flips and the topological
conservation of domain wall parity. We measure this universal ratio `2' to high
accuracy -- the first direct evidence for the Kramers-Wannier duality in
nature.

computation of stable matchings is a core topic. While in the classic setting
the goal is to match up two agents (either from different ""gender"" (this is
Stable Marriage) or ""unrestricted"" (this is Stable Roommates)), Knuth [1976]
triggered the study of three- or multidimensional cases. Here, we focus on the
study of Multidimensional Stable Roommates, known to be NP-hard since the early
1990's. Many NP-hardness results, however, rely on very general input instances
that do not occur in at least some of the specific application scenarios. With
the quest for identifying islands of tractability for Multidimensional Stable
Roommates, we study the case of master lists. Here, as natural in applications
where agents express their preferences based on ""objective"" scores, one roughly
speaking assumes that all agent preferences are ""derived from"" a central master
list, implying that the individual agent preferences shall be similar. Master
lists have been frequently studied in the two-dimensional (classic) stable
matching case, but seemingly almost never for the multidimensional case. This
work, also relying on methods from parameterized algorithm design and
complexity analysis, performs a first systematic study of Multidimensional
Stable Roommates under the assumption of master lists.

excitation energy is a convolution of the Coulomb potential with a quantum
geometric tensor of the TBG bands. The neutral excitations are (high-symmetry

that the Cooper pair binding energy is zero in all such projected Coulomb
models, implying that either phonons and/or non-zero kinetic energy are needed
for superconductivity. Since the [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 246401] showed that the

5~high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations ($\sim~5\times10^6$ star
particles) of Milky Way-like galaxies taken from the NIHAO-UHD project, to
investigate the origin of low-metallicity stars ([Fe/H]$\leq-2.5$). The
simulations show a prominent population of low-metallicity stars confined to
the disk plane, as recently discovered in the Milky Way. The ubiquity of this
finding suggests that the Milky Way is not unique in this respect.
Independently of the accretion history, we find that $\gtrsim~90$ per cent of
the retrograde stars in this population are brought in during the initial
build-up of the galaxies during the first few Gyrs after the Big Bang. Our
results therefore highlight the great potential of the retrograde population as
a tracer of the early build-up of the Milky Way. The prograde planar
population, on the other hand, is accreted during the later assembly phase and
samples the full galactic accretion history. In case of a quiet accretion
history, this prograde population is mainly brought in during the first half of
cosmic evolution ($t\lesssim7$~Gyr), while, in the case of an on-going active
accretion history, later mergers on prograde orbits are also able to contribute
to this population. Finally, we note that the Milky Way shows a rather large
population of eccentric, very metal-poor planar stars. This is a feature not
seen in most of our simulations, with the exception of one simulation with an
exceptionally active early building phase.

inclusive process (at least one resolved jet) and the exclusive process
(exactly one resolved jet) are contrasted and discussed. The inclusion of QCD
corrections up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\text{s}}^3)$ leads to a clear
stabilisation of the predictions and contributes substantially to a reduction
of remaining theoretical uncertainties.

decreases with increasing galaxy mass. Locally, a similar trend is found when
analyzing the $Z_g$ and $D(4000)$ of the star-forming regions, as well as the
residuals resulting from removing the radial gradients of both parameters. The
local laws have systematically smaller slopes than the global one. We ascribe
this difference to random errors, that make the true slope of the
$Age_\star-Z_g$ relation to be systematically underestimated when performing a
least square fitting. The explored relation is intimately linked with the
already known relation between gas metallicity and star formation rate at fixed
mass, both presenting a common physical origin.

A key ingredient is a revision of our fundamental understanding of
multi-particle representations of the Poincar\'e group. Surprisingly, the
asymptotic states for electric-magnetic scattering transform with an additional
little group phase, associated with pairs of electrically and magnetically
charged particles. The corresponding ""pairwise helicity"" is identified with the
quantized ""cross product"" of charges, $e_1 g_2 - e_2 g_1$, for every
charge-monopole pair, and represents the extra angular momentum stored in the
asymptotic electromagnetic field. We define a new kind of pairwise
spinor-helicity variable, which serves as an additional building block for
electric-magnetic scattering amplitudes. We then construct the most general
3-point S-matrix elements, as well as the full partial wave decomposition for
the $2\to 2$ fermion-monopole S-matrix. In particular, we derive the famous
helicity flip in the lowest partial wave as a simple consequence of a
generalized spin-helicity selection rule, as well as the full angular

circumstellar material (CSM), indicating an axisymmetric outflow from the

classic evolution seen in luminous SNe~IIn: symmetric Lorentzian profiles from
pre-shock CSM lines broadened by electron scattering at early times,
transitioning at late times to multi-component, irregular profiles coming from
the SN ejecta and post-shock shell. As in many SNe~IIn, profiles show a
progressively increasing blueshift, with a clear flux deficit in red wings of
the intermediate and broad velocity components after day 200. This blueshift
develops after the continuum luminosity fades, and in the intermediate-width

the blueshift cannot be explained as occultation by the SN photosphere,
pre-shock acceleration of CSM, or a lopsided explosion or CSM. Instead, the
blueshift arises from dust formation in the post-shock shell and in the SN
ejecta. The effect has a wavelength dependence characteristic of dust,
exhibiting an extinction law consistent with large grains. Thus, SN2017hcc
experienced post-shock dust formation and had a mildly bipolar CSM shell,

either spectroscopic or photometric. We find the photometric indicators
demonstrate a stronger correlation with the dynamical relaxation of galaxy
groups compared to the spectroscopic probes.
  We take advantage of the Anderson Darling statistic ($A^2$) and the

use the luminosity gap ($\Delta m_{12}$) and the luminosity de-centring
($D_{\mathrm{off-set}}$) as photometric ones. Firstly, we find that a

  Secondly, by using the observational X-ray surface brightness map, we show
that the bivariant relation brings about some acceptable correlations with
X-ray proxies. These correlations are as well as the correlations between $A^2$
and X-ray proxies, offering reliable yet fast and economical method of
quantifying the relaxation of galaxy systems.
  This study demonstrates that using photometric data to determine the
relaxation status of a group will lead to some promising results that are

along with distance from galaxy centre, appears to be the dominant factor
influencing the MgII absorption around galaxies. With a sample that is 90%

more than one galaxy. The complex distribution of metals in these richer
environments adds substantial scatter to previously-reported correlations.
Multiple galaxy associations show on average five times stronger absorption and
three times higher covering fraction within twice the virial radius than
isolated galaxies. The dependence of MgII absorption on galaxy properties
disfavours the scenario in which a widespread intra-group medium dominates the

absorption strength and cross section in rich environments.

is incompatible with local hidden variables. There is an ongoing and vigorous
debate on whether he relied on an assumption of determinism, or instead, as he
later claimed, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect
correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples
and rigorous results. It is shown that the weak form of locality used in Bell's
1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for such a derivation,
whereas an independent form called outcome independence is sufficient even when
weak locality does not hold. It further follows that outcome independence, by
itself, implies that standard quantum mechanics is incomplete. It is also shown
that an appeal by Bell to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky argument to support his
claim fails, via examples that expose logical gaps in this argument. However,
replacing the reality criterion underpinning the argument by a stronger
criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both weak locality and determinism,
as required for Bell's 1964 paper. Consequences for quantum interpretations,
locality, and classical common causes are briefly discussed, with reference to
an example of local classical indeterminism.

statistics of matter. Specifically, we show that our implementation of a
baryonification algorithm jointly fits the changes induced by baryons on the
power spectrum and equilateral bispectrum on scales up to k < 5 h/Mpc and
redshifts z<2, as measured in six different cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. The accuracy of our fits are typically 1% for the power spectrum,
and for the equilateral and squeezed bispectra, which somewhat degrades to 3%
for simulations with extreme feedback prescriptions. Our results support the
physical assumptions underlying baryonification approaches, and encourage their
use in interpreting weak gravitational lensing and other cosmological
observables.

distance while retaining relatively low stabilizer weight. We show how to build
union-find decoders for these codes, using a union-find decoder for one of the
codes in the product and a brute force decoder for the other code. We apply
this construction to the specific case of the product of a surface code with a
small code such as a $[[4,2,2]]$ code, which we call an augmented surface code.
The distance of the augmented surface code is the product of the distance of
the surface code with that of the small code, and the union-find decoder, with
slight modifications, can decode errors up to half the distance. We present
numerical simulations, showing that while the threshold of these augmented
codes is lower than that of the surface code, the low noise performance is
improved.

(Sgr A*), is known to be fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF), inferred by its low accretion rate. Consequently, radiative cooling has
in general been overlooked in the study of Sgr A*. However, the radiative
properties of the plasma in RIAFs are poorly understood. In this work, using
full 3D general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the
impact of radiative cooling on the dynamical evolution of the accreting plasma,
presenting spectral energy distributions and synthetic sub-millimeter images
generated from the accretion flow around Sgr A*. These simulations solve the
approximated equations for radiative cooling processes self-consistently,
including synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton processes. We find
that radiative cooling plays an increasingly important role in the dynamics of
the accretion flow as the accretion rate increases: the mid-plane density grows
and the infalling gas is less turbulent as cooling becomes stronger. The
changes in the dynamical evolution become important when the accretion rate is
larger than $10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ ($\gtrsim 10^{-7} \dot{M}_{\rm
Edd}$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate). The
resulting spectra in the cooled models also differ from those in the non-cooled
models: the overall flux, including the peak values at the sub-mm and the
far-UV, is slightly lower as a consequence of a decrease in the electron
temperature. Our results suggest that radiative cooling should be carefully
taken into account in modelling Sgr A* and other low-luminosity active galactic
nuclei that have a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M} > 10^{-7}\,\dot{M}_{\rm

planetary systems. In this context, we develop a population synthesis code in
the pebble accretion scenario, to analyse the disk mass dependence on planet
formation around low mass stars. We base our model on the analytical sequential
model presented in Ormel et al. 2017 and analyse the populations resulting from
varying initial disk mass distributions. Starting out with seeds the mass of
Ceres near the ice-line formed by streaming instability, we grow the planets
using the Pebble Accretion process and migrate them inwards using Type-I
migration. The next planets are formed sequentially after the previous planet
crosses the ice-line. We explore different initial distributions of disk masses
to show the dependence of this parameter with the final planetary population.
Our results show that compact close-in resonant systems can be pretty common
around M-dwarfs between $0.09-0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ only when the disks considered
are more massive than what is being observed by sub-mm disk surveys. The
minimum disk mass to form a Mars-like planet is found to be about $2 \times
10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$. Small variation in the disk mass distribution also
manifest in the simulated planet distribution. The paradox of disk masses might
be caused by an underestimation of the disk masses in observations, by a rapid
depletion of mass in disks by planets growing within a million years or by
deficiencies in our current planet formation picture.

Using Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), we obtain a
medium-resolution FUV spectrum of the lensed QSO and identify numerous
absorption features from $\mathrm{H_2}$ in the lens ISM at projected distance
$d=4.6$ kpc. The $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density is $\log
N(\mathrm{H_2})/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}=17.8^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$ with a molecular gas
fraction of $f_\mathrm{H_2}=2-5\%$, roughly consistent with some local
quiescent galaxies. The new COS spectrum also reveals kinematically complex
absorption features from highly ionized species O VI and N V with column
densities log $N(\mathrm{O VI})/\mathrm{cm^{-2}} =15.2\pm0.1$ and log
$N(\mathrm{N V})/\mathrm{cm^{-2}} =14.6\pm0.1$, among the highest known in

in a transient warm ($T\sim10^5\,$K) phase undergoing radiative cooling from a
hot halo surrounding the galaxy, we infer a mass accretion rate of $\sim
0.5-1.5\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The lack of star formation in the lens
suggests the bulk of this flow is returned to the hot halo, implying a heating
rate of $\sim10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$. Continuous heating from evolved
stellar populations (primarily SNe Ia but also winds from AGB stars) may
suffice to prevent a large accumulation of cold gas in the ISM, even in the
absence of strong feedback from an active nucleus.

examine evidence ratios in a DES-Y1 simulated analysis, focusing on the
internal consistency between weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We study two
scenarios using simulated data in controlled experiments. First, we calibrate
the expected evidence ratio distribution given noise realizations around the
best fit DES-Y1 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Second, we show the behavior of
evidence ratios for noiseless fiducial data vectors simulated using a modified

$2$, $4$ and $6$ while the neutrino mass matrix with the modular forms of
weight $4$ through the Weinberg operator. Linear modular forms are obtained
approximately by performing Taylor expansion of modular forms around fixed
points. By using them, the flavor structure of the lepton and quark mass
matrices are examined at nearby fixed points. The hierarchical structure of
these mass matrices is clearly shown in the diagonal base of $S$, $T$ and $ST$.
The observed PMNS and CKM mixing matrices can be reproduced at nearby fixed
points in some cases of mass matrices. By scanning model parameters numerically
at nearby fixed points, our discussion are confirmed for both the normal
hierarchy and inverted one of neutrino masses. Predictions are given for the
sum of neutrino masses and the CP violating Dirac phase of leptons at each
nearby fixed point.

analog memristor-based temporal memories to design a such a state machine that

practical cases where labels for the target data are unavailable due to privacy

oftentimes underdetermined while the measurements are limited and/or
incomplete; 2) many combinations of parameters may yield responses that are
similar with respect to actual measurements; and 3) uncertainties inevitably
exist. The aim of this research is to leverage upon computational intelligence
through statistical inference to facilitate an enhanced, probabilistic finite
element model updating using incomplete modal response measurement. This new
framework is built upon efficient inverse identification through optimization,
whereas Bayesian inference is employed to account for the effect of
uncertainties. To overcome the computational cost barrier, we adopt Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to characterize the target function/distribution.
Instead of using single Markov chain in conventional Bayesian approach, we
develop a new sampling theory with multiple parallel, interactive and adaptive
Markov chains and incorporate into Bayesian inference. This can harness the
collective power of these Markov chains to realize the concurrent search of
multiple local optima. The number of required Markov chains and their
respective initial model parameters are automatically determined via Monte
Carlo simulation-based sample pre-screening followed by K-means clustering
analysis. These enhancements can effectively address the aforementioned
challenges in finite element model updating. The validity of this framework is
systematically demonstrated through case studies.

address the robust regression problem where heavy-tailed noise or outliers may
present in the response variable. The idea of EGM is to approximate the density
function of the noise distribution instead of approximating the truth function
directly as usual. Unlike the classical maximum likelihood estimation that
encourages equal importance of all observations and could be problematic in the
presence of abnormal observations, EGM schemes can be interpreted from a
minimum distance estimation viewpoint and allow the ignorance of those
observations. Furthermore, it is shown that several well-known robust nonconvex
regression paradigms, such as Tukey regression and truncated least square
regression, can be reformulated into this new framework. We then develop a
learning theory for EGM, by means of which a unified analysis can be conducted
for these well-established but not fully-understood regression approaches.
Resulting from the new framework, a novel interpretation of existing bounded
nonconvex loss functions can be concluded. Within this new framework, the two
seemingly irrelevant terminologies, the well-known Tukey's biweight loss for
robust regression and the triweight kernel for nonparametric smoothing, are
closely related. More precisely, it is shown that the Tukey's biweight loss can
be derived from the triweight kernel. Similarly, other frequently employed
bounded nonconvex loss functions in machine learning such as the truncated
square loss, the Geman-McClure loss, and the exponential squared loss can also
be reformulated from certain smoothing kernels in statistics. In addition, the
new framework enables us to devise new bounded nonconvex loss functions for
robust learning.

is postulated that the highest conductivity achievable may be much greater than
what is currently demonstrated. The conductivity is retained after cooling to
ambient temperatures as confirmed by Hall measurements, and subsequent
grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction and TEM measurements show the films to be
in the rutile phase. The exceptional conductivity in these films is
hypothesized to result from direct proton incorporation into the lattice
populating the conduction band with excess electrons, or from altering the
Titania lattice to form conductive Magneli phases. The films did not display
any evidence of transformations, however formation of Magneli phases was

shown that implanted transition metal, doped in BaO is stable as interstitial

close to VBM. Taking Nb as an example we show that single atom Au has its Fermi
level close to the VBM of BaO and hence is able to accept charge from the
dopant. This charge transfer process between Nb and Au helps Au atoms bind
strongly on the doped BaO support. We also show that these charged Au atoms
repel each other and prefer to remain atomically dispersed preventing cluster
formation. Substitutional doping of transition metals have earlier been
reported to bind Au atoms. However, if doped at interstitial sites, they can
bind more Au atoms; for example, 5 Au atoms can be anchored per Nb dopant
present in BaO interstitial, compared to 3 Au atoms when Nb is doped at

In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic (i.e., finite-time) analysis

answer important questions (e.g., Who is tested positive? What is the age of
the person? Where is he/she?). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Joint
Event Multi-task Learning (JOELIN) model. Through a unified global learning
framework, we make use of all the training data across different events to
learn and fine-tune the language model. Moreover, we implement a type-aware
post-processing procedure using named entity recognition (NER) to further
filter the predictions. JOELIN outperforms the BERT baseline by 17.2% in micro

  evidence from a novel EEG signal processing analysis",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Post-operative cognitive decline is a well-known phenomenon and of crucial
importance especially in the elderly. General anesthesia can be accomplished by
inhalation-based (volatile) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). While their
effects on post-operative symptoms have been investigated, little is known
about their influence on brain functionalities during the surgery itself. To
assess differences 17 patients were divided to receive either volatile
anesthesia (n=9), or TIVA (n=8). The level of anesthesia was kept to be equal
in both groups. A single bipolar EEG electrode (Neurosteer system) was placed
on the participants foreheads. It presented real-time activity and collected
their data during the surgery. The dependent variables included frequency bands
(delta, theta, alpha, and beta), and three features (VC9, ST4, and A0)
previously extracted with the device and provided by Neurosteer. All surgeries
were uneventful, and all patients showed bispectral index (BIS) score less than
60. Feature activity under volatile anesthesia (in comparison to TIVA) was
significantly lower for the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands and for the
three features. Further analysis showed that the largest difference between
anesthesia types was for feature A0. The EEG frequency bands and novel brain
activity features provide evidence that volatile anesthesia further reduces
components of brain activity in comparison to TIVA anesthesia. Specifically,
A0, which previously showed a correlation with cognitive decline severity and
cognitive load, exhibited the most prominent difference between anesthesia
types. Together, this study suggests that measuring brain activity during
anesthesia using sensitive features, enables revealing that different
anesthesia types may affect brain activity differently, which could affect the
recovery from anesthesia, and consequently reduce post-operative cognitive
decline

promise for estimating the lithium surface concentration of active material
particles, which is an important state for avoiding aging mechanisms such as
lithium plating. However, methods relying on voltage often lead to large
estimation errors when the model parameters change during aging. In this paper,
we utilize the in-situ measurement of the battery expansion to augment the
voltage and develop an observer to estimate the lithium surface concentration
distribution in each electrode particle. We demonstrate that the addition of
the expansion signal enables us to correct the negative electrode concentration
states in addition to the positive electrode. As a result, compared to a
voltage only observer, the proposed observer can successfully recover the
surface concentration when the electrodes' stoichiometric window changes, which
is a common occurrence under aging by loss of lithium inventory. With a 5%
shift in the electrodes' stoichiometric window, the results indicate a
reduction in state estimation error for the negative electrode surface
concentration. Under this simulated aged condition, the voltage based observer
had 9.3% error as compared to the proposed voltage and expansion observer which
had 0.1% error in negative electrode surface concentration.

phase conversions at the interface are slow. Hadronic matter is described by a
set of equations of state (EoS) based on the chiral effective field theory and
quark matter by a generic bag model. Due to slow conversions at the interface,
there is an extended region of stable hybrid stars with central densities above
the density of the maximum mass star. We explore systematically the role of the
transition pressure and the energy-density jump $\Delta \epsilon$ at the
interface on some global properties of hybrid stars. We find that for a given
transition pressure, the radius of the last stable hybrid star decreases as
$\Delta \epsilon$ raises resulting in a larger extended branch of stable hybrid
stars. Contrary to purely hadronic stars, the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ can
be either a decreasing or an increasing function of the stellar mass $M$ and
for large values of the transition pressure has a very weak dependence on $M$.
Finally, we analyze the tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ for a
binary system with the same chirp mass as GW170817. In the scenario where at
least one of the stars in the binary is hybrid, we find that models with low
enough transition pressure are inside the $90 \%$ credible region of GW170817.
However, these models have maximum masses below $2 \, M_{\odot}$, in
disagreement with observations. We also find that the LIGO/Virgo constrain (at
$90\%$ level) and the $2 \, M_{\odot}$ requirement can be simultaneously
fulfilled in a scenario where all hybrid configurations have masses larger than
$1.6 \, M_{\odot}$ and the hadronic EoS is not too stiff, such as several of
our hybrid models involving a hadronic EoS of intermediate stiffness. In such
scenario hybrid stars may exist in Nature but both objects in GW170817 were
hadronic stars.

FLOW portraits provide an intuitive map of dynamic calcium activity, including
regions of initiation and termination, as well as the direction and extent of
activity spread. To extract these structures, we use the finite-time Lyapunov

unsteady fluids. Importantly, our approach captures coherent structures that
are poorly represented by traditional modal decomposition techniques. We

error lower than the amount of noise in that data. arXiv:1906.11300
characterized for which covariance structure of the data such a phenomenon can
happen in linear regression if one considers the interpolating solution with
minimum $\ell_2$-norm and the data has independent components: they gave a
sharp bound on the variance term and showed that it can be small if and only if
the data covariance has high effective rank in a subspace of small
co-dimension. We strengthen and complete their results by eliminating the
independence assumption and providing sharp bounds for the bias term. Thus, our
results apply in a much more general setting than those of arXiv:1906.11300,
e.g., kernel regression, and not only characterize how the noise is damped but
also which part of the true signal is learned. Moreover, we extend the result
to the setting of ridge regression, which allows us to explain another
interesting phenomenon: we give general sufficient conditions under which the
optimal regularization is negative.

satellite. This operation is of paramount importance since it is virtually
impossible to nominally perform any other operation without some degree of
attitude control. Common methods used to detumble satellites usually involve
magnetic actuation, paired with different types of sensors which are used to
provide angular velocity feedback. This paper presents the adverse effects of
time-discretization on the stability of two detumbling algorithms. An extensive
literature review revealed that both algorithms achieve absolute stability for
systems involving continuous feedback and output. However, the physical
components involved impose limitations on the maximum frequency of the
algorithm, thereby making any such system inconceivable. This asserts the need
to perform a discrete-time stability analysis, as it is better suited to
reflect on the actual implementation and dynamics of these algorithms. The
paper starts with the current theory and views on the stability of these
algorithms. The next sections describe the continuous and discrete-time
stability analysis performed by the team and the conclusions derived from it.
Theoretical investigation led to the discovery of multiple conditions on
angular velocity and operating frequencies of the hardware, for which the
algorithms were unstable. These results were then verified through various
simulations on MATLAB and Python3.6.7. The paper concludes with a discussion on
the various instabilities posed by time-discretization and the conditions under
which the detumbling algorithm would be infeasible.

Chronic electrocorticography was used to record electrographic seizures, and
hidden Markov models decoded seizures into fluctuations in underlying risk.
State-dependent associations of RNS System stimulation parameters with changes
in risk were estimated. Higher charge density was associated with improved
outcomes, both for remaining in a low seizure risk state and for transitioning
from a high to a low seizure risk state. The effect of stimulation frequency
depended on initial seizure risk state: when starting in a low risk state,
higher stimulation frequencies were associated with remaining in a low risk
state, but when starting in a high risk state, lower stimulation frequencies
were associated with transition to a low risk state. Findings were consistent
across bipolar and monopolar stimulation configurations. The impact of RNS on
seizure frequency exhibits state-dependence, such that stimulation parameters
which are effective in one seizure risk state may not be effective in another.
These findings represent conceptual advances in understanding the therapeutic
mechanism of RNS, and directly inform current practices of RNS tuning and the
development of next-generation neurostimulation systems.

make recommendations in communication, we design an annotation scheme related
to recommendation strategies based on social science theories and annotate

frequently lead to successful recommendations. Based on our dataset, we train
end-to-end recommendation dialog systems with and without our strategy labels.

nonisothermal processes with irreversibly changing microstructure at large
strains. It outlines rate-type and incremental variational principles for the
full thermomechanical coupling in gradient-extended dissipative materials. It
is shown that these principles yield as Euler equations essentially the macro-
and micro-balances as well as the energy equation. Starting point is the
incorporation of the entropy and entropy rate as canonical arguments into
constitutive energy and dissipation functions, which additionally depend on the
gradient-extended mechanical state and its rate, respectively. By means of
(generalized) Legendre transformations, extended variational principles with
thermal as well as mechanical driving forces can be constructed. On the thermal
side, a rigorous distinction between the quantity conjugate to the entropy and
the quantity conjugate to the entropy rate is essential here. Formulations with
mechanical driving forces are especially suitable when considering possibly
temperature-dependent threshold mechanisms. With regard to variationally
consistent incrementations, we suggest an update scheme which renders the exact
form of the intrinsic dissipation and is highly suitable when considering
adiabatic processes. It is shown that this proposed numerical algorithm has the
structure of an operator split. To underline the broad applicability of the
proposed framework, we set up three model problems as applications:
Cahn-Hilliard diffusion coupled with temperature evolution, where we propose a
new variational principle in terms of the species flux vector, as well as
thermomechanics of gradient damage and gradient plasticity. In a numerical
example we study the formation of a cross shear band.

referred to as source localization, or source imaging, poses however a
high-dimensional statistical inference challenge. While sparsity promoting
regularizations have been proposed to address the regression problem, it
remains unclear how to ensure statistical control of false detections.
Moreover, M/EEG source imaging requires to work with spatio-temporal data and
autocorrelated noise. To deal with this, we adapt the desparsified Lasso
estimator -- an estimator tailored for high dimensional linear model that
asymptotically follows a Gaussian distribution under sparsity and moderate
feature correlation assumptions -- to temporal data corrupted with
autocorrelated noise. We call it the desparsified multi-task Lasso (d-MTLasso).
We combine d-MTLasso with spatially constrained clustering to reduce data
dimension and with ensembling to mitigate the arbitrary choice of clustering;
the resulting estimator is called ensemble of clustered desparsified multi-task
Lasso (ecd-MTLasso). With respect to the current procedures, the two advantages
of ecd-MTLasso are that i)it offers statistical guarantees and ii)it allows to
trade spatial specificity for sensitivity, leading to a powerful adaptive
method. Extensive simulations on realistic head geometries, as well as
empirical results on various MEG datasets, demonstrate the high recovery
performance of ecd-MTLasso and its primary practical benefit: offer a
statistically principled way to threshold MEG/EEG source maps.

associated to a unique value called weight. These networks are very suitable
for modeling real-world social networks in which there is an assessment of one
vertex toward other vertices. One of the main problems studied in this paper is
prediction of edge weights in such networks. We introduce, for the first time,
a metric geometry approach to studying edge weight prediction in WDNs. We
modify a usual notion of WDNs, and introduce a new type of WDNs which we coin
the term \textit{almost-weighted directed networks} (AWDNs). AWDNs can capture
the weight information of a network from a given training set. We then
construct a class of metrics (or distances) for AWDNs which equips such
networks with a metric space structure. Using the metric geometry structure of
AWDNs, we propose modified $k$ nearest neighbors (kNN) methods and modified
support-vector machine (SVM) methods which will then be used to predict edge
weights in AWDNs. In many real-world datasets, in addition to edge weights, one
can also associate weights to vertices which capture information of vertices;
association of weights to vertices especially plays an important role in graph
embedding problems. Adopting a similar approach, we introduce two new types of
directed networks in which weights are associated to either a subset of origin
vertices or a subset of terminal vertices . We, for the first time, construct
novel classes of metrics on such networks, and based on these new metrics
propose modified $k$NN and SVM methods for predicting weights of origins and
terminals in these networks. We provide experimental results on several

significant challenge in the field of molecular simulation. A recent implicit
solvent model, IS-SPA, based on approximating the mean solvent force using the
superposition approximation, provides a platform to achieve these goals. IS-SPA
was originally developed to handle non-polar solutes in the TIP3P water model
but can be extended to accurately treat polar solutes in other polar solvents.
In this manuscript, we demonstrate how to adapt IS-SPA to include the treatment
of solvent orientation and long ranged electrostatics in a solvent of
chloroform. The orientation of chloroform is approximated as that of an ideal
dipole aligned in a mean electrostatic field. The solvent--solute force is then
considered as an averaged radially symmetric Lennard-Jones component and a
multipole expansion of the electrostatic component through the octupole term.
Parameters for the model include atom-based solvent density and mean electric
field functions that are fit from explicit solvent simulations of independent
atoms or molecules. Using these parameters, IS-SPA accounts for asymmetry of
charge solvation and reproduces the explicit solvent potential of mean force of
dimerization of two oppositely charged Lennard-Jones spheres with high
fidelity. Additionally, the model more accurately captures the effect of
explicit solvent on the monomer and dimer configurations of alanine dipeptide
in chloroform than a generalized Born or constant density dielectric model. The
current version of the algorithm is expected to outperform explicit solvent
simulations for aggregation of small peptides at concentrations below 150 mM,
well above the typical experimental concentrations for these materials.

numerically verify these scaling behaviors and test a variety of approximations

cumulants $\kappa_n$ of the potential energy difference between the two

absolute free energies for {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces. The
series is formally a power series in $\beta=1/T$, suggesting that its
usefulness may be limited to high temperature. However, for smooth reference
potentials, the $T$-dependence of the $\kappa_n$ contributes to the
convergence. A closed form expression is derived for the $\kappa_n$ to all
orders for the case that both the system and reference potentials are harmonic.
In this case $\kappa_n \propto T^n$ for $n \ge 2$ and the convergence of the
series is independent of temperature. More realistic cases of liquid Cu and
solid Al, with a $1/r^{12}$ and harmonic reference potential, respectively, are
investigated numerically by evaluating the cumulants to third order using Monte
Carlo integration. In all cases, the ratio of the third order to the second
order term in the expansion is found to be $\sim 0.1$, indicating good
convergence. Third order contributions to the free energy are typically a few
meV/atom, and comparable to their statistical errors. The statistical error in
the second order free energy of Al is 0.4 meV/atom with only 100 evaluations of

iteration and combination of hybrid behaviour with other effects. A systematic
treatment of hybridness as a dedicated computational effect has emerged
recently. In particular, a generic idealized functional language HybCore with a

rules with uncountably many premises). We introduce an imperative counterpart
of HybCore, whose semantics is simpler and runnable, and yet intimately related

Here we treat the case of flexes and degenerate trisecants. The basic tool we
use is a theorem we prove asserting that the base locus of the linear system
associated to an effective line bundle on an abelian variety is reduced. This
result allows us to remove all the extra assumptions that were introduced in
the theorems by the first author, C. De Concini, G.Marini, and O. Debarre, in

big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) physics. These calculations incorporate all
relevant weak, electromagnetic, and strong nuclear reactions, including
charge-changing (isospin-changing) lepton capture and decay processes. They
reveal a rich interplay of dark photon production, decay, and associated
out-of-equilibrium transport of entropy into the decoupling neutrino seas. Most
importantly, the self-consistent nature of our simulations allows us to capture
the magnitude and phasing of entropy injection and dilution. Entropy
injection-induced alteration of the time-temperature-scale factor relation
during weak decoupling and BBN leads to changes in the light element abundance
yields and the total radiation content (as parametrized by $N_{\rm eff}$).
These changes suggest ways to extend previous dark photon BBN constraints.
However, our calculations also identify ranges of dark photon mass and
couplings not yet constrained, but perhaps accessible and probable, in future
Stage-4 cosmic microwave background experiments and future high precision
primordial deuterium abundance measurements.

downward-directed terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) detected by the
large-area Telescope Array cosmic ray observatory, obtained in conjunction with
broadband VHF interferometer and fast electric field change measurements of the
parent discharge. The results show that the TGFs occur during strong initial
breakdown pulses (IBPs) in the first few milliseconds of negative
cloud-to-ground and low-altitude intracloud flashes, and that the IBPs are
produced by a newly-identified streamer-based discharge process called fast
negative breakdown. The observations indicate the relativistic runaway electron
avalanches (RREAs) responsible for producing the TGFs are initiated by embedded
spark-like transient conducting events (TCEs) within the fast streamer system,
and potentially also by individual fast streamers themselves. The TCEs are
inferred to be the cause of impulsive sub-pulses that are characteristic
features of classic IBP sferics. Additional development of the avalanches would
be facilitated by the enhanced electric field ahead of the advancing front of
the fast negative breakdown. In addition to showing the nature of IBPs and
their enigmatic sub-pulses, the observations also provide a possible
explanation for the unsolved question of how the streamer to leader transition
occurs during the initial negative breakdown, namely as a result of strong
currents flowing in the final stage of successive IBPs, extending backward
through both the IBP itself and the negative streamer breakdown preceding the
IBP.

  on the Web","This paper is going to be published in IEEE Globecom 2020",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various in-browser privacy protection techniques have been designed to
protect end-users from third-party tracking. In an arms race against these
counter-measures, the tracking providers developed a new technique called CNAME
cloaking based tracking to avoid issues with browsers that block third-party
cookies and requests. To detect this tracking technique, browser extensions
require on-demand DNS lookup APIs. This feature is however only supported by
the Firefox browser.
  In this paper, we propose a supervised machine learning-based method to
detect CNAME cloaking-based tracking without the on-demand DNS lookup. Our goal
is to detect both sites and requests linked to CNAME cloaking-related tracking.
We crawl a list of target sites and store all HTTP/HTTPS requests with their
attributes. Then we label all instances automatically by looking up CNAME
record of subdomain, and applying wildcard matching based on well-known
tracking filter lists. After extracting features, we build a supervised
classification model to distinguish site and request related to CNAME
cloaking-based tracking. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach
outperforms well-known tracking filter lists: F1 scores of 0.790 for sites and
0.885 for requests. By analyzing the feature permutation importance, we
demonstrate that the number of scripts and the proportion of XMLHttpRequests
are discriminative for detecting sites, and the length of URL request is
helpful in detecting requests. Finally, we analyze concept drift by using the
2018 dataset to train a model and obtain a reasonable performance on the 2020
dataset for detecting both sites and requests using CNAME cloaking-based
tracking.

state-of-the-art performance on many graph representation learning tasks.
Currently, at every layer, attention is computed between connected pairs of
nodes and depends solely on the representation of the two nodes. However, such
attention mechanism does not account for nodes that are not directly connected
but provide important network context. Here we propose Multi-hop Attention
Graph Neural Network (MAGNA), a principled way to incorporate multi-hop context
information into every layer of attention computation. MAGNA diffuses the
attention scores across the network, which increases the receptive field for
every layer of the GNN. Unlike previous approaches, MAGNA uses a diffusion
prior on attention values, to efficiently account for all paths between the
pair of disconnected nodes. We demonstrate in theory and experiments that MAGNA
captures large-scale structural information in every layer, and has a low-pass
effect that eliminates noisy high-frequency information from graph data.
Experimental results on node classification as well as the knowledge graph
completion benchmarks show that MAGNA achieves state-of-the-art results: MAGNA
achieves up to 5.7 percent relative error reduction over the previous
state-of-the-art on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. MAGNA also obtains the best

photogalvanic (CPG) responses considering chiral Weyl semimetal (WSM) while a
quantized CPG response is guaranteed by broken of both inversion symmetry (IS)
and mirror symmetries. The TRS broken WSM yields one left and one right chiral
Weyl nodes (WNs) while there are two left and right chiral WNs for TRS
invariant WSM. We show that these features can potentially cause the
quantization of CPG response at higher values compared to the topological
charge of the underlying WSM. This is further supported by the fact that Berry
curvature and velocity behave differently whether the system preserves or
breaks the TRS. We find the CPG responses for TRS invariant type-II WSM to be
quantized at two and four times the topological charge of the activated WNs
while the chemical potential are respectively chosen in the vicinity of
energies associated with left and right chiral WNs. By contrast, irrespective
of the above choice of the chemical potential, the quantization in CPG response
is directly given by the topological charge of the activated WNs for TRS broken
case. Interestingly, we notice non-quantized peak in CPG response when energies
of WNs associated with opposite chiralities are close to each other as it is
the case for TRS invariant type-I WSM considered here. Moreover, we show that
the tilt can significantly modify the CPG response as velocity in the tilt
direction changes which enters into the CPG tensor through the Fermi
distribution function. Given these exciting outcomes, the second order CPG
response emerges as a useful indicator to characterize the system under
consideration. Furthermore, we investigate the momentum resolved structure of
CPG response to relate with the final results and strengthen our analysis from
the perspective of the lattice models.

attackers, without the need of knowing the underlying diffusion model. To this
end, we design a structured prediction framework, where the main idea is to
parameterize the scoring function using random features constructed through
distance functions on randomly sampled subgraphs, which leads to a kernelized
scoring function with weights learnable via the large margin method. Evidenced
by experiments, our method can produce near-optimal protectors without using
any information of the diffusion model, and it outperforms other possible
graph-based and learning-based methods by an evident margin.

Such a structure gives rise to a local diffeomorphism from the universal cover
of the manifold to affine space that is equivariant with respect to a
homomorphism from the fundamental group to the group of affine automorphisms.
The local diffeomorphism and homomorphism are referred to as the developing map

common vector, certain `large' open subsets upon which the developing map is a
diffeomorphism onto its image are constructed. A modified proof of the fact
that a radiant manifold cannot have its fixed point in the developing image is

bosonic quantum excitations to mediate the interactions. Important examples
include photon-mediated interactions between atoms, superconducting qubits, and
color centers in diamond, and phonon-mediated interactions between trapped ions

amplification of a boson-mediated interaction between two trapped-ion qubits by
parametric modulation of the trapping potential. The amplification provides up
to a 3.25-fold increase in the interaction strength, validated by measuring the
speedup of two-qubit entangling gates. This amplification technique can be used
in any quantum platform where parametric modulation of the boson channel is

capture the frequency shifts observed when the system is subjected to harmonic

Euclidean spaces under the perturbation stability assumption. An instance is
$\alpha$-stable if the underlying optimal clustering continues to remain
optimal even when all pairwise distances are arbitrarily perturbed by a factor
of at most $\alpha$. Our main contribution is in presenting efficient exact
algorithms for $\alpha$-stable clustering instances whose running times depend
near-linearly on the size of the data set when $\alpha \ge 2 + \sqrt{3}$. For
$k$-center and $k$-means problems, our algorithms also achieve polynomial
dependence on the number of clusters, $k$, when $\alpha \geq 2 + \sqrt{3} +
\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$ in any fixed dimension. For
$k$-median, our algorithms have polynomial dependence on $k$ for $\alpha > 5$
in any fixed dimension; and for $\alpha \geq 2 + \sqrt{3}$ in two dimensions.
Our algorithms are simple, and only require applying techniques such as local

with careful choice of data structures.

Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) carry out various tasks over urban airspaces, is a
transportation concept of the future that is gaining prominence. UAM missions
with complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements can be succinctly
represented using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a behavioral specification
language. However, planning and control of systems with STL specifications is
computationally intensive, usually resulting in planning approaches that do not
guarantee dynamical feasibility, or control approaches that cannot handle
complex STL specifications. Here, we present an approach to co-design the
planner and control such that a given STL specification (possibly over multiple
UAVs) is satisfied with trajectories that are dynamically feasible and our
controller can track them with a bounded tracking-error that the planner
accounts for. The tracking controller is formulated for the non-linear dynamics
of the individual UAVs, and the tracking error bound is computed for this
controller when the trajectories satisfy some kinematic constraints. We also
augment an existing multi-UAV STL-based trajectory generator in order to
generate trajectories that satisfy such constraints. We show that this
co-design allows for trajectories that satisfy a given STL specification, and
are also dynamically feasible in the sense that they can be tracked with
bounded error. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through
simulations of multi-UAV missions.

neighbor embedding (t-SNE), from non-parametric to parametric by training
neural networks. The main advantage of a parametric technique is the
generalization of handling new data, which is particularly beneficial for
streaming data exploration. However, training a neural network to optimize the
t-SNE objective function frequently fails. Previous methods overcome this
problem by pre-training and then fine-tuning the network. We found that the
training failure comes from the gradient exploding problem, which occurs when
data points distant in high-dimensional space are projected to nearby embedding
positions. Accordingly, we applied the gradient clipping method to solve the
problem. Since the networks are trained by directly optimizing the t-SNE
objective function, our method achieves an embedding quality that is compatible
with the non-parametric t-SNE while enjoying the ability of generalization. Due
to mini-batch network training, our parametric dimension reduction method is
highly efficient. We further extended other non-parametric state-of-the-art
approaches, such as LargeVis and UMAP, to the parametric versions. Experiment
results demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Considering its

polarized alternating magnetic field with quadrupole interaction presents is
investigated in detail in this paper. The conventional way to employ the
rotating wave approximation is to assume the dynamics being restricted in the
reduced Hilbert space. However, when the driving strength is relatively strong
or the driving is off resonant, the leakage from the target resonance subspace
along with the effects from the counter-rotating terms cannot be neglected
anymore. We propose the rotating wave approximation applied in the full Hilbert
space to take the leakage from the target resonance subspace into account. To
include the effects from the counter-rotating terms, we utilize the
counterrotating hybridized rotating wave method in the reduced Hilbert space.
The performance of these rotating wave approximation methods is compared by
estimating the state fidelity as well as the operator fidelity and the results
reveal that different methods may be employed for different practical
circumstances.

customized computing, but the fact that FPGAs are hard to program creates a
steep learning curve for software programmers. Even with the help of high-level
synthesis (HLS), accelerator designers still have to manually perform code
reconstruction and cumbersome parameter tuning to achieve the optimal
performance. While many learning models have been leveraged by existing work to
automate the design of efficient accelerators, the unpredictability of modern
HLS tools becomes a major obstacle for them to maintain high accuracy. To
address this problem, we propose an automated DSE framework-AutoDSE- that
leverages a bottleneck-guided coordinate optimizer to systematically find a
better design point. AutoDSE detects the bottleneck of the design in each step
and focuses on high-impact parameters to overcome it. The experimental results
show that AutoDSE is able to identify the design point that achieves, on the
geometric mean, 19.9x speedup over one CPU core for Machsuite and Rodinia
benchmarks. Compared to the manually optimized HLS vision kernels in Xilinx
Vitis libraries, AutoDSE can reduce their optimization pragmas by 26.38x while
achieving similar performance. With less than one optimization pragma per
design on average, we are making progress towards democratizing customizable
computing by enabling software programmers to design efficient FPGA
accelerators.

by learning from a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system, that is called TTS-VC

with sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder
extracts robust linguistic representations of text, and the decoder,
conditioned on target speaker embedding, takes the context vectors and the
attention recurrent network cell output to generate target acoustic features.
We take advantage of the fact that TTS system maps input text to speaker
independent context vectors, and reuse such a mapping to supervise the training
of latent representations of an encoder-decoder voice conversion system. In the
voice conversion system, the encoder takes speech instead of text as input,
while the decoder is functionally similar to TTS decoder. As we condition the
decoder on speaker embedding, the system can be trained on non-parallel data
for any-to-any voice conversion. During voice conversion training, we present
both text and speech to speech synthesis and voice conversion networks
respectively. At run-time, the voice conversion network uses its own
encoder-decoder architecture. Experiments show that the proposed approach
outperforms two competitive voice conversion baselines consistently, namely

structures embedded in two dimensional crystals, where the dislocations
themselves form one-dimensional lattices. In particular, pileups exemplify a
new class of inhomogeneous crystals characterized by spatially varying lattice
spacings. By analytically formulating key statistical quantities and comparing
our theory to numerical experiments using an intriguing mapping of dislocation
positions onto the eigenvalues of recently studied random matrix ensembles, we
uncover two types of one-dimensional phase transitions in dislocation pileups:
a thermal depinning transition out of long-range translational order from the
pinned-defect phase, due to a periodic Peierls potential, to a floating-defect
state, and finally the melting out of a quasi-long range ordered floating
defect-solid phase to a defect-liquid. We also find the set of transition
temperatures at which these transitions can be directly observed through the
one-dimensional structure factor, where the delta function Bragg peaks, at the
pinned-defect to floating-defect transition, broaden into algebraically
diverging Bragg peaks, which then sequentially disappear as one approaches the
two-dimensional melting transition of the host crystal. We calculate a set of
temperature-dependent critical exponents for the structure factor and radial
distribution function, and obtain their exact forms for both uniform and
inhomogeneous pileups using random matrix theory.

reliable and accurate modeling of linac beam data applicable to the processes
of linac commissioning and QA. Materials and methods: We hypothesize that the
beam data is a function of inherent linac features and percentage depth doses
(PDDs) and profiles of different field sizes are correlated with each other.
The correlation is formulated as a multivariable regression problem using a
machine learning framework. Varian TrueBeam beam data sets (n=43) acquired from
multiple institutions were used to evaluate the framework. The data sets
included PDDs and profiles across different energies and field sizes. A
multivariate regression model was trained for prediction of beam specific PDDs
and profiles of different field sizes using a 10x10cm$^2$ field as input.
Results: Predictions of PDDs were achieved with a mean absolute percent
relative error (%RE) of 0.19-0.35% across the different beam energies
investigated. The maximum mean absolute %RE was 0.93%. For profile prediction,
the mean absolute %RE was 0.66-0.93% with a maximum absolute %RE of 3.76%. The
largest uncertainties in the PDD and profile predictions were found at the
build-up region and at the field penumbra, respectively. The prediction
accuracy increased with the number of training sets up to around 20 training
sets. Conclusions: Through this novel machine learning-based method we have
shown accurate and reproducible generation of beam data for linac commissioning
for routine radiation therapy. This method has the potential to simplify the
linac commissioning procedure, save time and manpower while increasing the
accuracy of the commissioning process.

tunable reflective elements, is capable of enhancing the wireless propagation
environment in a cellular network by intelligently reflecting the
electromagnetic waves from the base-station (BS) toward the users. The optimal
tuning of the phase shifters at the IRS is, however, a challenging problem,
because due to the passive nature of reflective elements, it is difficult to
directly measure the channels between the IRS, the BS, and the users. Instead
of following the traditional paradigm of first estimating the channels then
optimizing the system parameters, this paper advocates a machine learning
approach capable of directly optimizing both the beamformers at the BS and the
reflective coefficients at the IRS based on a system objective. This is
achieved by using a deep neural network to parameterize the mapping from the
received pilots (plus any additional information, such as the user locations)
to an optimized system configuration, and by adopting a permutation
invariant/equivariant graph neural network (GNN) architecture to capture the
interactions among the different users in the cellular network. Simulation
results show that the proposed implicit channel estimation based approach is
generalizable, can be interpreted, and can efficiently learn to maximize a
sum-rate or minimum-rate objective from a much fewer number of pilots than the
traditional explicit channel estimation based approaches.

delay (or, if possible, avoid) capture by any of the pursuers whereas each
pursuer tries to capture the latter only if this is to his best interest. Our
approach resembles in principle the so-called relay pursuit strategy introduced
in [1], in which only the pursuer that can capture the evader faster than the
others is active. In sharp contrast with the latter approach, the active
pursuer herein is not determined by a reactive ad-hoc rule but from the
solution of a corresponding potential game. We assume that each pursuer has
different capabilities and his decision whether to go after the evader or not
is based on the maximization of his individual utility (conditional on the
choices and actions of the other pursuers). The pursuers' utilities depend on
both the rewards that they will receive by capturing the evader and the time of
capture (cost of capturing the evader) so that a pursuer should only seek
capture when the incurred cost is relatively small. The determination of the
active pursuer-evader assignments (in other words, which pursuers should be
active) is done iteratively by having the pursuers exchange information and
updating their own actions by executing a learning algorithm for games known as
Spatial Adaptive Play (SAP). We illustrate the performance of our algorithm by

suboptimal since they predetermine the order by which attention heads are
pruned. In order to overcome such a limitation, we propose AUBER, an effective
regularization method that leverages reinforcement learning to automatically
prune attention heads from BERT. Instead of depending on heuristics or
rule-based policies, AUBER learns a pruning policy that determines which
attention heads should or should not be pruned for regularization. Experimental
results show that AUBER outperforms existing pruning methods by achieving up to
10% better accuracy. In addition, our ablation study empirically demonstrates

accelerate modern neural networks. Existing pruning methods can be grouped into
two categories: filter pruning (FP) and weight pruning (WP). FP wins at
hardware compatibility but loses at the compression ratio compared with WP. To
converge the strength of both methods, we propose to prune the filter in the
filter. Specifically, we treat a filter $F \in \mathbb{R}^{C\times K\times K}$
as $K \times K$ stripes, i.e., $1\times 1$ filters $\in \mathbb{R}^{C}$, then
by pruning the stripes instead of the whole filter, we can achieve finer
granularity than traditional FP while being hardware friendly. We term our
method as SWP (\emph{Stripe-Wise Pruning}). SWP is implemented by introducing a
novel learnable matrix called Filter Skeleton, whose values reflect the shape
of each filter. As some recent work has shown that the pruned architecture is
more crucial than the inherited important weights, we argue that the
architecture of a single filter, i.e., the shape, also matters. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SWP is more effective compared to
the previous FP-based methods and achieves the state-of-art pruning ratio on

learning. Given a large model (i.e., teacher model), it aims to improve the
performance of a compact model (i.e., student model) by transferring the
information from the teacher. Various information for distillation has been
studied. Recently, a number of works propose to transfer the pairwise
similarity between examples to distill relative information. However, most of
efforts are devoted to developing different similarity measurements, while only
a small matrix consisting of examples within a mini-batch is transferred at
each iteration that can be inefficient for optimizing the pairwise similarity
over the whole data set. In this work, we aim to transfer the full similarity
matrix effectively. The main challenge is from the size of the full matrix that
is quadratic to the number of examples. To address the challenge, we decompose
the original full matrix with Nystr{\""{o}}m method. By selecting appropriate
landmark points, our theoretical analysis indicates that the loss for transfer
can be further simplified. Concretely, we find that the difference between the
original full kernel matrices between teacher and student can be well bounded
by that of the corresponding partial matrices, which only consists of
similarities between original examples and landmark points. Compared with the
full matrix, the size of the partial matrix is linear in the number of
examples, which improves the efficiency of optimization significantly. The
empirical study on benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the

basic cosmological parameters at the $\sim 1\%$ level from CMB power spectra,
galaxy correlation and lensing, luminosity distance measurements of supernovae,
as well as other cosmological probes. A basic consistency check of the standard
cosmological model is an independent inference of $T$ at recombination. In this
work we first use the recent Planck data, supplemented by either the first year
data release of the dark energy survey (DES), baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) data, and the Pantheon SNIa catalog, to extract $T$ at the $\sim 1\%$
precision level. We then explore correlations between $T$, the Hubble
parameter, $H_{0}$, and the global spatial curvature parameter, $\Omega_{k}$.
Our parameter estimation indicates that imposing the local constraint from the
SH0ES experiment on $H_{0}$ results in significant statistical preference for
departure at recombination from the locally inferred $T$. However, only
moderate evidence is found in this analysis for tension between local and
cosmological estimates of $T$, if the local constraint on $H_{0}$ is relaxed.
All other dataset combinations that include the CMB with either BAO, SNIa, or
both, disfavor the addition of a new free temperature parameter even in the
presence of the local constraint on $H_{0}$. Analysis limited to the Planck
dataset suggests the temperature at recombination was higher than expected at
recombination at the $\gtrsim 95\%$ confidence level if space is globally flat.

substation-level topology optimization framework is developed by expanding
traditional line switching decisions by breaker-level bus splitting, which can
further reduce grid congestion and generation costs. A tight McCormick

another person to defuse a bomb. Varying levels of difficulties in solving a
puzzle and time pressures will result in different stress levels that can be
measured in terms of errors, response time lengths, and other physiological
measurements. The game was developed using 3D programming tools including
Blender and virtual reality development kit (VRTK). To measure response times
accurately, we added LSL (Lab Stream Layer) Markers to collect and synchronize
physiological signals, behavioral data, and the timing of game events. We
recorded Electrocardiogram (ECG) data during gameplay to assess heart rate and
heart-rate variability (HRV) that have been shown as reliable indicators of
stress. Our empirical results showed that heart rate increased significantly
while HRV reduced significantly when the participants under high stress, which
are consistent with the prior mainstream stress research. We further
experimented with other tools to enhance communication between two players
under adverse conditions and found that an automatic speech recognition
software effectively enhanced the communication between the players by
displaying keywords into the player's headset that lead to the facilitation of
finding the solution of the puzzles or modules. This VR game framework is

which are autonomous and cooperative with one another to achieve a goal and it

theoretically and practically. In the field of computer science, programmable
matter can be theoretically modeled as a distributed system consisting of
simple and small robots equipped with limited capabilities, e.g., no memory

these two problems, respectively. In both algorithms, it is assumed that the
visibility range is one (every robot can observe only its neighboring robots)

the introduction of the stochastic approximation. It is now understood that
convergence theory amounts to establishing robustness of Euler approximations
for ODEs, while theory of rates of convergence requires finer analysis. This
paper sets out to extend this theory to quasi-stochastic approximation, based
on algorithms in which the ""noise"" is based on deterministic signals. The main
results are obtained under minimal assumptions: the usual Lipschitz conditions
for ODE vector fields, and it is assumed that there is a well defined
linearization near the optimal parameter $\theta^*$, with Hurwitz linearization
matrix $A^*$.
  The main contributions are summarized as follows:
  (i) If the algorithm gain is $a_t=g/(1+t)^\rho$ with $g>0$ and
$\rho\in(0,1)$, then the rate of convergence of the algorithm is $1/t^\rho$.
There is also a well defined ""finite-$t$"" approximation: \[
a_t^{-1}\{\Theta_t-\theta^*\}=\bar{Y}+\Xi^{\mathrm{I}}_t+o(1) \] where
$\bar{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector identified in the paper, and
$\{\Xi^{\mathrm{I}}_t\}$ is bounded with zero temporal mean.
  (ii) With gain $a_t = g/(1+t)$ the results are not as sharp: the rate of
convergence $1/t$ holds only if $I + g A^*$ is Hurwitz.
  (iii) Based on the Ruppert-Polyak averaging of stochastic approximation, one
would expect that a convergence rate of $1/t$ can be obtained by averaging: \[
\Theta^{\text{RP}}_T=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^T \Theta_t\,dt \] where the estimates
$\{\Theta_t\}$ are obtained using the gain in (i). The preceding sharp bounds
imply that averaging results in $1/t$ convergence rate if and only if
$\bar{Y}=\sf 0$. This condition holds if the noise is additive, but appears to
fail in general.
  (iv) The theory is illustrated with applications to gradient-free
optimization and policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning.

prepared single crystals with the (0 0 1) surface and applied biaxial and

which evidences that the tetragonal deformation switches at Ts2 between c > a

expensive and time consuming, and this becomes a critical bottleneck while
building such models in practice. In such scenarios, active learning (AL)
strategies are used to achieve faster convergence in terms of labeling efforts.
Existing active learning employ a variety of heuristics based on uncertainty
and diversity to select query samples. Despite their wide-spread use, in
practice, their performance is limited by a number of factors including
non-calibrated uncertainties, insufficient trade-off between data exploration
and exploitation, presence of confirmation bias etc. In order to address these
challenges, we propose Ask-n-Learn, an active learning approach based on
gradient embeddings obtained using the pesudo-labels estimated in each

applications, post-hoc explainability tools that do not require access to the
model internals are often used to enable humans understand and trust these
models. In particular, we focus on the class of methods that can reveal the
influence of input features on the predicted outputs. Despite their wide-spread
adoption, existing methods are known to suffer from one or more of the
following challenges: computational complexities, large uncertainties and most
importantly, inability to handle real-world domain shifts. In this paper, we
propose PRoFILE, a novel feature importance estimation method that addresses
all these challenges. Through the use of a loss estimator jointly trained with
the predictive model and a causal objective, PRoFILE can accurately estimate
the feature importance scores even under complex distribution shifts, without
any additional re-training. To this end, we also develop learning strategies
for training the loss estimator, namely contrastive and dropout calibration,
and find that it can effectively detect distribution shifts. Using empirical
studies on several benchmark image and non-image data, we show significant
improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, both in terms of fidelity and

performance degradation. In this work, we propose Uncertainty Matching GNN
(UM-GNN), that is aimed at improving the robustness of GNN models, particularly
against poisoning attacks to the graph structure, by leveraging epistemic
uncertainties from the message passing framework. More specifically, we propose
to build a surrogate predictor that does not directly access the graph
structure, but systematically extracts reliable knowledge from a standard GNN
through a novel uncertainty-matching strategy. Interestingly, this uncoupling
makes UM-GNN immune to evasion attacks by design, and achieves significantly
improved robustness against poisoning attacks. Using empirical studies with
standard benchmarks and a suite of global and target attacks, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of UM-GNN, when compared to existing baselines including the

via a combination of transformer power rating satisfaction and voltage
management asset control. To maintain reliable operation under this paradigm,
however, future grids with deep DER penetrations would require costly equipment
upgrades. These upgrades can be mitigated via judicious coordination of DER
operation. Earlier work has assumed a hierarchical control architecture in
which a global controller (GC) uses detailed power injection and DER data and
knowledge of DER owners' objectives to determine setpoints that local
controllers should follow in order to achieve reliable and cost effective grid
operation. Having such data and assuming knowledge of DER owners' objectives,
however, are often not desirable or possible. In an earlier work, a 2-layer DER
coordination architecture was shown to achieve close to optimal performance
despite infrequent communication to a global controller. Motivated by this
work, this paper proposes a day-ahead coordination scheme that uses forecasted
power profile ranges to generate day-ahead dynamic power rating bounds at each
transformer. Novel features of this scheme include: (i) the GC knows only past
node power injection data and does not impose or know DER owner objectives,
(ii) we use bounds that ensure reliable operation to guide the local

consisting of two nuisance functions: nonparametric component in the logistic
model and conditional mean of the exposure on the other covariates and with the
response fixed. To estimate the nuisance models, we separately consider the use
of high dimensional (HD) sparse parametric models and more general (typically
nonparametric) machine learning (ML) methods. In the HD case, we derive certain
moment equations to calibrate the first-order bias of the nuisance models and
grant our method a model double robustness property in the sense that our
estimator achieves the desirable rate when at least one of the nuisance models
is correctly specified and both of them are ultra-sparse. In the ML case, the
non-linearity of the logit link makes it substantially harder than the
partially linear setting to use an arbitrary conditional mean learning
algorithm to estimate the nuisance component of the logistic model. We handle
this obstacle through a novel full model refitting procedure that is
easy-to-implement and facilitates the use of nonparametric ML algorithms in our

multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) in mixed formulation applied to
parabolic equations with heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. The construction
of the method is based on two multiscale spaces: pressure multiscale space and
velocity multiscale space. The pressure space is constructed via a set of
well-designed local spectral problems, which can be solved independently. Based
on the computed pressure multiscale space, we will construct the velocity
multiscale space by applying constrained energy minimization. The convergence
of the proposed method is proved.In particular, we prove that the convergence
of the method depends only on the coarse grid size, and is independent of the
heterogeneities and contrast of thediffusion coefficient. Four typical types of
permeability fields are exploited in the numerical simulations, and the results
indicate that our proposed method works well and gives efficient and accurate
numerical solutions.

some constant $\alpha>1$ called the distance-power gradient.
  We introduce the online version of the range-assignment problem, where the

following.
  - For $d=1$, a 1-competitive algorithm does not exist. In particular, for
$\alpha=2$ any online algorithm has competitive ratio at least 1.57.
  - For $d=1$ and $d=2$, we analyze two natural strategies: Upon the arrival of
a new point $p_j$, Nearest-Neighbor increases the range of the nearest point to
cover $p_j$ and Cheapest Increase increases the range of the point for which
the resulting cost increase to be able to reach $p_j$ is minimal.

surprisingly fast $O(n^\omega)$ time algorithms for $\omega<2.373$. On the
other hand, the $(\min,+)$ matrix product which is at the heart of many
fundamental graph problems such as APSP, has received only minor improvements
over its brute-force cubic running time and is widely conjectured to require
$n^{3-o(1)}$ time. There is a plethora of matrix products and graph problems
whose complexity seems to lie in the middle of these two problems. For
instance, the Min-Max matrix product, the Minimum Witness matrix product, APSP
in directed unweighted graphs and determining whether an edge-colored graph
contains a monochromatic triangle, can all be solved in $\tilde
O(n^{(3+\omega)/2})$ time. A similar phenomenon occurs for convolution
problems, where analogous intermediate problems can be solved in $\tilde
O(n^{1.5})$ time.
  Can one improve upon the running times for these intermediate problems, in
either the matrix product or the convolution world? Or, alternatively, can one
relate these problems to each other and to other key problems in a meaningful
way?
  This paper makes progress on these questions by providing a network of
fine-grained reductions. We show for instance that APSP in directed unweighted
graphs and Minimum Witness product can be reduced to both the Min-Max product
and a variant of the monochromatic triangle problem. We also show that a
natural convolution variant of monochromatic triangle is fine-grained
equivalent to the famous 3SUM problem. As this variant is solvable in
$O(n^{1.5})$ time and 3SUM is in $O(n^2)$ time (and is conjectured to require
$n^{2-o(1)}$ time), our result gives the first fine-grained equivalence between
natural problems of different running times.

substantially alter the conclusions from the analysis, specifically on node

memory effects by constructing a lumped-state memory network, which we then use
to identify overlapping communities of wards. We find that these communities of
wards display a quasi-hierarchical structure at different levels of granularity

estimate the channel state information (CSI) by leveraging the uplink-downlink
channel reciprocity, which is no longer valid when the mismatch arises from the
asymmetric uplink and downlink radio frequency (RF) chains. Existing works
treat the reciprocity mismatch as constant for simplicity. However, the
practical RF chain consists of nonlinear components, which leads to nonlinear
reciprocity mismatch. In this work, we examine the impact and the calibration
approach of the nonlinear reciprocity mismatch in massive MIMO systems. To
evaluate the impact of the nonlinear mismatch, we first derive the closed-form
expression of the ergodic achievable rate. Then, we analyze the performance
loss caused by the nonlinear mismatch to show that the impact of the mismatch
at the base station (BS) side is much larger than that at the user equipment
side. Therefore, we propose a calibration method for the BS. During the
calibration, polynomial function is applied to approximate the nonlinear
mismatch factor, and over-the-air training is employed to estimate the
polynomial coefficients. After that, the calibration coefficients are computed
by maximizing the downlink achievable rate. Simulation results are presented to
verify the analytical results and to show the performance of the proposed

Rather than being exploited by defectors, exiters exit the game in favour of a
small payoff. We find that this simple extension of the game allows cooperation
to flourish in well-mixed populations when iterations or reputation are added.
In networked populations, however, the exit option is less conducive to
cooperation. Instead, it enables the coexistence of cooperators, defectors, and
exiters through cyclic dominance. Other outcomes are also possible as the exit
payoff increases or the network structure changes, including network-wide
oscillations in actor abundances that may cause the extinction of exiters and
the domination of defectors, although game parameters should favour exiting.
The complex dynamics that emerges in the wake of a simple option to exit the

microwave field is introduced to drive the two excited states of the atom and
results in photon conversion between two transitions. By adjusting the Rabi
frequency and the phase of the external driving field, the transport behaviors
of incident photons with specific frequencies can be optimized to complete
transmission or reflection. Based on the constructive interferences between
photons from different traveling paths, the transmission probabilities of the

establish that their conjunction can identify a causal effect even with an

advantageous in presence of pervasive heterogeneity of pleiotropic effects on
additive scale, a setting in which two recently proposed robust estimation

end-members which compose the Ceres surface (using the antigorite as
Mg-phyllosilicate, the NH4-montmorillonite as NH4-phyllosilicate, the dolomite
as carbonate and the graphite as dark component), were mixed, obtaining
mixtures with different relative abundance, and identifying the mixture with
the reflectance spectrum most similar to the average Ceres spectrum. The
mixtures were obtained with grain size of 0-25 {\mu}m, 25-50 mic and 50-100
mic, were heated and spectrally analysed at T= 300 K and T=200 K (typical for
surface Ceres temperature during VIR observations). The most similar Ceres
analogue mixture is composed of dolomite (18%), graphite (27%), antigorite
(32%) and NH4-montmorillonite (29%) and the results of this work suggest that
this mixture is more similar to the Ceres youngest region than to the Ceres
average, in particular for the negative slope of spectrum. Small variation in
the composition and grain size of end-members need to be considered, in
addition to the occurrence of a dark component dispersed in fine size.
Furthermore, the positive spectral slope that characterizes the mean Ceres
spectrum can be obtained by the application of some processes simulating the
space weathering on Ceres (as micro-meteoritic impacts and solar wind
irradiation), i.e. laser and ion irradiation. As conclusion, youngest ccps on
Ceresare probably composed by fresher and weakly processed mixture with fine
dark material intimately dispersed: as a result, the reflectance spectra of
youngest material show a negative slope in the 1.2-1.9 mic range. The redder

main components: 1) encoding visual data, 2) assigning $k$ different vectors in

images are often represented in RGB colour space, the specific organisation of
colours in other spaces also offer interesting features, e.g. CIE L*a*b*
decorrelates chromaticity into opponent axes. In this article, we propose
colour space conversion, a simple quasi-unsupervised task, to enforce a network
learning structured representations. To this end, we trained several instances
of VQ-VAE whose input is an image in one colour space, and its output in
another, e.g. from RGB to CIE L*a*b* (in total five colour spaces were
considered). We examined the finite embedding space of trained networks in
order to disentangle the colour representation in VQ-VAE models. Our analysis
suggests that certain vectors encode hue and others luminance information. We
further evaluated the quality of reconstructed images at low-level using
pixel-wise colour metrics, and at high-level by inputting them to image
classification and scene segmentation networks. We conducted experiments in
three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, COCO and CelebA. Our results show, with
respect to the baseline network (whose input and output are RGB), colour
conversion to decorrelated spaces obtains 1-2 Delta-E lower colour difference
and 5-10% higher classification accuracy. We also observed that the learnt

new sources in the Galaxy and to study fundamental physics of X-ray binaries
from 1\,keV to 250\,keV. It has three collimated telescopes, the High Energy
X-ray telescope (HE), the Medium Energy X-ray telescope (ME) and the Low Energy
X-ray telescope (LE). Before the launch, in-orbit backgrounds of these three
telescopes had been estimated through Geant4 simulation, in order to
investigate the instrument performance and the achievement of scientific goals.
In this work, these simulated backgrounds are compared with in-orbit
observations. Good agreement is shown for all three telescopes. For HE, 1) the
deviation of the simulated background rate after two years of operation in
space is $\sim5\%$ from the observation; 2) the total background spectrum and
the relative abundance of the $\sim$67\,keV line show long-term increases both
in simulations and observations. For ME, 1) the deviation of simulated
background rate is within $\sim15\%$ from the observation, and 2) there are no
obvious long-term increase features in the background spectra of simulations
and observations. For LE, the background level given by simulations is also
consistent with observations. The consistencies of these comparisons validate
that the Insight-HXMT mass model, i.e. space environment components and models
adopted, physics processes selected and detector constructions built, is
reasonable. However, the line features at $\sim$7.5\,keV and 8.0\,keV, which
are obvious in the observed spectra of LE, are not evident in simulations. This
might result from uncertainties in the LE constructions.

to gain specificity on the imaged biological samples. In this work, we show how
an original polarization imaging technique, implementing micro-wave photonics

informative polarization images from a single scan of the cell sample in a fast
and sensitive way. For OB imaging, the sample is probed with a laser setup
simultaneously generating two orthogonal polarizations shifted in frequency by
a few tens of MHz. If the imaged samples display some polarimetric properties,
the orthogonality between the two polarizations is broken, leading to a
beatnote interference signal that can be detected with a fast detector. The
comparison of the images of various cell lines at different cell-cycle stages
obtained by OB polarization microscopy and fluorescence confocal images shows
that an endogenous polarimetric contrast arizes on compacted chromosomes during
cell division. This technique paves the way to label-free real-time
polarization imaging of mitotic chromosomes with further potential applications
in histology and cancer diagnosis.

the radio spectra with a gyrosynchrotron model, we derive the magnetic field

observations are indicative of multiple, co-temporal acceleration episodes

sources likely originate from separate electron distributions in different

study the PLS of an AN assisted C-V2X network, where the locations of
legitimate vehicular nodes, malicious vehicular nodes and road side units
(RSUs) are modeled by Cox processes driven by a common Poisson line process
(PLP), and the locations of cellular base stations (BSs) are modeled by a

The cosine similarity loss is employed, instead of the KL-divergence, for KD
training. As the teacher model changes continuously by random bit-precision

promising performances for a number of classic optimization problems, including
satisfiability, AI planning, and TSP. The techniques often rely on a set of
features that measure some characteristics of the problem instance at hand. In
the context of black-box optimization, these features have to be derived from a
set of $(x,f(x))$ samples. A number of different features have been proposed in
the literature, measuring, for example, the modality, the separability, or the
ruggedness of the instance at hand. Several of the commonly used features,
however, are highly correlated. While state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques can routinely filter such correlations, they hinder explainability
of the derived algorithm design techniques.
  We therefore propose in this work to pre-process the measured (raw) landscape
features through representation learning. More precisely, we show that a linear
dimensionality reduction via matrix factorization significantly contributes
towards a better detection of correlation between different problem instances
-- a key prerequisite for successful automated algorithm design.

a variational generative module from expert demonstrations. We then propose
predicting static collision in advance, as an auxiliary task to improve safety

of termination action prediction, we also introduce a target checking module to
differentiate from augmenting navigation policy with a termination action. The

static collision avoidance, and navigation generalization performance,

elliptic pair potential that interpolates between the Heisenberg and
Haldane-Shastry (HS) spin chains while admitting an exact solution throughout,
based on a connection with the elliptic quantum Calogero-Sutherland model.
Though Inozemtsev's spin chain is widely believed to be quantum integrable, the
underlying algebraic reason for its exact solvability is not yet well
understood. As a step in this direction we refine Inozemtsev's `extended
coordinate Bethe ansatz' and clarify various aspects of the model's exact
spectrum and its limits.
  We identify quasimomenta in terms of which the $M$-particle energy is close
to being (functionally) additive, as one would expect from the limiting models;
our expression is additive iff the energy of the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland
system is so. This enables us to rewrite the energy and Bethe-ansatz equations
on the elliptic curve, turning the spectral problem into a rational problem as
might be expected for an isotropic spin chain.
  We treat the $M=2$ particle sector and its limits in detail. We identify an
$S$-matrix that is independent of positions. We show that the Bethe-ansatz
equations reduce to those of Heisenberg in one limit and give rise to the
`motifs' of HS in the other limit. We show that, as the interpolation parameter
changes, the `scattering states' from Heisenberg become Yangian highest-weight
states for HS, while bound states become ($\mathfrak{sl}_2$-highest weight
versions of) affine descendants of the magnons from $M=1$. For bound states we
find a generalisation of the known equation for the `critical length' for the
Heisenberg spin chain. We discuss completeness for $M=2$ by passing to the
elliptic curve.
  Our review of the two-particle sectors of the Heisenberg and HS spin chains
may be of independent interest.

readily parallelizable block-based approach, different regions of the fluid are
assigned differing time steps and solved at different rates to minimize
computational cost. Our approach for WCSPH scheme extends an asynchronous SPH
technique from compressible flow of astrophysical phenomena to the
incompressible free surface setting, and further accelerates it by entirely
decoupling the time steps of widely spaced particles. Similarly, our approach
to PCISPH adjusts the the number of iterations of density correction applied to
different regions, and asynchronously updates the neighborhood regions used to
perform these corrections; this sharply reduces the computational cost of
slowly deforming regions while preserving the standard density invariant. We
demonstrate our approaches on a number of highly dynamic scenarios,

In order to keep the platform safe for all users, as well as to keep it
compliant with local laws, OSNs typically create a set of community standards
organized into policy groups, and use Machine Learning (ML) models to identify
and remove content that violates any of the policies. However, out of the
billions of content that is uploaded on a daily basis only a small fraction is
so unambiguously violating that it can be removed by the automated models.
Prevalence estimation is the task of estimating the fraction of violating
content in the residual items by sending a small sample of these items to human
labelers to get ground truth labels. This task is exceedingly hard because even
though we can easily get the ML scores or features for all of the billions of
items we can only get ground truth labels on a few thousands of these items due
to practical considerations. Indeed the prevalence can be so low that even
after a judicious choice of items to be labeled there can be many days in which
not even a single item is labeled violating. A pragmatic choice for such low
prevalence, $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$, regimes is to report the upper bound, or
$97.5\%$ confidence interval, prevalence (UBP) that takes the uncertainties of
the sampling and labeling processes into account and gives a smoothed estimate.

Bucketed-Gaussian Process for this UBP task and demonstrate on real and

difficult for a machine to interpret. Middleware systems such as complex event
processing (CEP) mine patterns from data streams and send notifications to
users in a timely fashion. Presently, CEP systems have inherent limitations to
process multimedia streams due to its data complexity and the lack of an
underlying structured data model. In this work, we present a visual event
specification method to enable complex multimedia event processing by creating
a semantic knowledge representation derived from low-level media streams. The
method enables the detection of high-level semantic concepts from the media
streams using an ensemble of pattern detection capabilities. The semantic model
is aligned with a multimedia CEP engine deep learning models to give
flexibility to end-users to build rules using spatiotemporal event calculus.
This enhances CEP capability to detect patterns from media streams and bridge
the semantic gap between highly expressive knowledge-centric user queries to
the low-level features of the multi-media data. We have built a small traffic
event ontology prototype to validate the approach and performance. The paper
contribution is threefold: i) we present a knowledge graph representation for
multimedia streams, ii) a hierarchical event network to detect visual patterns
from media streams and iii) define complex pattern rules for complex multimedia

dynamics and planet formation in binaries. In order to measure the abundance
and physical characteristics of wide-orbit giant exoplanets in binary systems,
we have designed the 'VIsual Binary Exoplanet survey with Sphere' (VIBES) to
search for planets in visual binaries. It uses the SPHERE instrument at VLT to
search for planets in 23 visual binary and four visual triple systems with ages
of <145 Myr and distances of <150 pc. We used the IRDIS dual-band imager on
SPHERE to acquire high-contrast images of the sample targets. For each binary,
the two components were observed at the same time with a coronagraph masking
only the primary star. For the triple star, the tight components were treated
as a single star for data reduction. This enabled us to effectively search for
companions around 50 individual stars in binaries and four binaries in triples.
We derived upper limits of $<$13.7\% for the frequency of sub-stellar
companions around primaries in visual binaries, $<$26.5\% for the fraction of
sub-stellar companions around secondaries in visual binaries, and an occurrence
rate of $<$9.0\% for giant planets and brown dwarfs around either component of
visual binaries. We have combined our observations with literature measurements
to astrometrically confirm, for the first time, that 20 binaries and two triple
systems, which were previously known, are indeed physically bound. Finally, we
discovered a third component of the binary HD~121336. The upper limits we
derived are compatible with planet formation through the core accretion and the
gravitational instability processes in binaries. These limits are also in line
with limits found for single star and circumbinary planet search surveys.

a pronounced difference in the thermal conductivity between SLs with $m/n = 1$,
and SLs with $m/n = 2$. State-of-the art electron microscopy techniques and
ab-initio density functional calculations enables us to assign the origin of
this difference to the absence ($m/n = 1$) or presence ($m/n = 2$) of spatially
periodic, static oxygen octahedral rotation (OOR) inside the LMO layers. The
experimental data analysis shows that the effective thermal conductance of the
LMO/SMO interfaces strongly changes from $0.3$ GW/m$^2$K for $m/n = 2$ SLs with
OOR to a surprisingly large value of $1.8$ GW/m$^2$K for $m/n = 1$ SLs without
OOR. An instructive lattice dynamical model rationalizes our experimental
findings as a result of coherent phonon transmission for $m/n = 1$ versus
coherent phonon blocking in SLs with $m/n = 2$. We briefly discuss the
possibilities to exploit these results for atomic-scale engineering of a

vorticity field is recovered by the difference between the theoretical and the

Biot-Savart integrals, a stream function, which is easier and more efficient to
solve, is used to relate the vorticity field to the velocity field. We obtain
turbulence effects of different intensity levels by changing an adjustable
parameter. Since the vorticity field is enhanced according to the curl field,
our method can not only amplify existing vortices, but also capture additional
turbulence. Our VR solver is straightforward to implement and can be easily

the convergence in the fast-reaction limit $\epsilon\to0$.

of both the concentration at each node and the flux over each edge (the
level-2.5 rate function). The limiting system is again described by a
functional, and characterizes both fast and slow fluxes in the system.
  This method of proof has three advantages. First, no condition of detailed

resonance sliding velocities, friction is maximal. When sliding off-resonance,
partially thermalized states are possible, whereby only a small number of
vibrational modes becomes excited, but whose kinetic energies are already
Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed. Anharmonicity and defects typically destroy
partial thermalization, and instead lead to full thermalization, implying much
higher friction. For sliders with periodic boundaries, thermalization begins
with vibrational modes whose spatial modulation is compatible with the
incommensurate lattice. For a disc-shaped slider, modes corresponding to
modulations compatible with the slider radius are initially the most dominant.
By tuning the mechanical properties of the slider's edge, this effect can be
controlled, resulting in significant changes in the sliding distance covered.

contains the unique signature of primordial metric perturbations produced
during the inflation. The separation of the weak CMB B-mode signal from strong
foreground contamination in observed maps is a complex task, and proposed new
generation low noise satellite missions compete with the weak signal level of
this gravitational background. In this article, for the first time, we employ a
foreground model-independent internal linear combination (ILC) method to
reconstruct the CMB B mode signal using simulated observations over large
angular scales of the sky of 6 frequency bands of future generation CMB mission
Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO). We estimate the joint CMB B mode
posterior density following the interleaving Gibbs steps of B mode angular
power spectrum and cleaned map samples using the ILC method. We extend and
improve the earlier reported Bayesian ILC method to analyze weak CMB B mode
reconstruction by introducing noise bias corrections at two stages during the
ILC weight estimation. By performing $200$ Monte Carlo simulations of the
Bayesian ILC method, we find that our method can reconstruct the CMB signals
and the joint posterior density accurately over large angular scales of the
sky. We estimate Blackwell-Rao statistics of the marginal density of CMB B mode
angular power spectrum and use them to estimate the joint density of scalar to
tensor ratio $r$ and a lensing power spectrum amplitude $A^{\textrm{lens}}$.
Using $200$ Monte Carlo simulations of the delensing approach, we find that our
method can achieve an unbiased detection of the primordial gravitational wave
signal $r$ with more than 8$\sigma$ significance for levels of $r \geqslant
0.01$.

vector fields occurs in diverse areas ranging from the polarization of the
cosmic microwave background to liquid crystals to fingerprint recognition and
bio-medical imaging. Due to their discrete nature, defects and their
topological charge cannot depend continuously on each single vector, but they
discontinuously change as soon as a vector changes by more than a threshold.
Considering this threshold of admissible change at the level of vectors, we
develop a robustness measure for discrete defect estimators. Here, we compare
different template paths for defect estimation in discretized vector or
orientation fields. Sampling prototypical vector field patterns around defects
shows that the robustness increases with the length of template path, but less
so in the presence of noise on the vectors. We therefore find an optimal
trade-off between resolution and robustness against noise for relatively small
templates, except for the ""single pixel"" defect analysis, which cannot exclude
zero robustness. The presented robustness measure paves the way for uncertainty
quantification of defects in discretized vector fields.

residual-based model that incorporates the non-vanishing fine scales at the

adoption of more sophisticated tree building algorithms has been lacking. We
examine under what circumstances an implementation of less greedy decision
trees actually yields outperformance. To this end, a ""stepwise lookahead""
variation of the random forest algorithm is presented for its ability to better
uncover binary feature interdependencies. In contrast to the greedy approach,
the decision trees included in this random forest algorithm, each
simultaneously consider three split nodes in tiers of depth two. It is
demonstrated on synthetic data and financial price time series that the
lookahead version significantly outperforms the greedy one when (a) certain
non-linear relationships between feature-pairs are present and (b) if the
signal-to-noise ratio is particularly low. A long-short trading strategy for
copper futures is then backtested by training both greedy and stepwise
lookahead random forests to predict the signs of daily price returns. The
resulting superior performance of the lookahead algorithm is at least partially
explained by the presence of ""XOR-like"" relationships between long-term and
short-term technical indicators. More generally, across all examined datasets,
when no such relationships between features are present, performance across
random forests is similar. Given its enhanced ability to understand the
feature-interdependencies present in complex systems, this lookahead variation
is a useful extension to the toolkit of data scientists, in particular for
financial machine learning, where conditions (a) and (b) are typically met.

focuses on shifts in the MT responses arising from variations in the focus

calculated by changing the center of the Sq current. Slight variations in the
focus latitude cause large shifts in the apparent resistivity and phase. During
periods of quiet geomagnetic activity, the center varies within a wide range of

this study considers only a limited case, the results demonstrate the
instability of the impedances in periods of quiet geomagnetic activity and a

example, by checking the ionospheric current conditions and their dependence on

there is some long-range force between them, there can be Sommerfeld effect for
the final state particles. We study this effect on DM relic abundance in the
thermal freeze-out scenario. As a proof of concept, we consider the case of a
DM pair annihilation into a final state pair, assuming that the mutual
interactions between the two final state particles give rise to a Coulomb-like
potential, and that the masses of the initial and final state particles are
similar, so that both the initial and final state particles are
non-relativistic. The size of the final state Sommerfeld (FSS) effect depends
on the strength of the potential, as well as on the mass ratio of the final and
initial state particles. We find that the impact of the FSS effect on DM relic
abundance can be significant, and an electroweak sized long-range interaction
is large enough to make a correction well beyond the observational accuracy.
Another feature of the FSS effect is that it could be suppressed when its time
scale is longer than the lifetime of the final state particles. As a corollary,
we also study in the DM coannihilation scenario where the initial state
Sommerfeld effect between two coannihilators could be reduced due to their
instability, which may need to be taken into account for an accurate
calculation of the DM relic abundance.

remedy this, we propose isomorphism-aware synthetic benchmarks for model

atmosphere-interior coupling mechanism namely the redox evolution of the mantle
which strongly affects the outgassing of species. We simulate the volatile
outgassing and chemical speciation at the surface for various redox states of
the mantle by employing a C-H-O based chemical speciation model combined with
an interior outgassing model. We then apply a line-by-line radiative transfer
model to study the remote appearance of the planet in terms of the infrared
emission and transmission. Finally, we use a parameterized diffusion-limited
and XUV energy-driven atmospheric escape model to calculate the loss of H$_2$
to space. We have simulated the thermal emission and transmission spectra for
reduced or oxidized atmospheres present during the magma ocean period of Earth.
Reduced or thin atmospheres consisting of H$_2$ in abundance emit more
radiation to space and have larger effective height as compared to oxidized or
thick atmospheres which are abundant in H$_2$O and CO$_2$. We obtain the
outgassing rates of H2 from the mantle into the atmosphere to be a factor of

the charge neutrality point, thus tuning between electron and hole doping. For
2D Superconductors, this means that one may potentially achieve the
strongly-coupled superconducting regime described by Bose Einstein Condensation
physics of small bosonic tightly bound electron pairs. Furthermore, it should
be possible to access both electron and hole based superconductivity in a

the charge neutrality point, thus preventing approach to this regime. Graphene
is unique in this sense since it is a true semi-metal in which the un-gapped

The
observable CO luminosity is translated to H_2 mass via a conversion factor,
X_CO, which is a source of uncertainty and bias. Despite variations in X_CO,
the empirically-determined solar neighborhood value is often applied across
different galactic environments. To improve understanding of X_CO, we employ 3D
magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic
disks with a large range of gas surface densities, allowing for varying
metallicity, far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, and cosmic ray ionization rate
(CRIR). With the TIGRESS simulation framework we model the three-phase ISM with
self-consistent star formation and feedback, and post-process outputs with
chemistry and radiation transfer to generate synthetic CO(1--0) and (2--1)
maps. Our models reproduce the observed CO excitation temperatures,
line-widths, and line ratios in nearby disk galaxies. X_CO decreases with
increasing metallicity, with a power-law slope of -0.8 for the (1--0) line and
-0.5 for the (2--1) line. X_CO also decreases at higher CRIR, and is
insensitive to the FUV radiation. As density increases, X_CO first decreases
due to increasing excitation temperature, and then increases when the emission
is fully saturated. We provide fits between X_CO and observable quantities such
as the line ratio, peak antenna temperature, and line brightness, which probe
local gas conditions. These fits, which allow for varying beam size, may be
used in observations to calibrate out systematic biases. We also provide
estimates of the CO-dark H_2 fraction at different gas surface densities,
observational sensitivities, and beam sizes.

the resulting piezoelectric field at the dislocation outcrop. Near the surface,
this field establishes an exciton dead zone around the dislocation, the extent
of which is not related to the carrier diffusion length. However, reliable
values of the carrier diffusion length can be extracted from the dipole-like
energy shift observed in hyperspectral cathodoluminescence maps recorded around
the dislocation outcrop at low acceleration voltages. For high acceleration

offers an optimal approach to compare theory and experiment according to the
Neyman-Pearson lemma. However, until recently its usage has been limited by the
fact that only leading-order predictions could be employed. The imperfect
approximation of the underlying probability distribution can introduce a
significant bias into the analysis which requires a major calibration for the
method when applied to parameter determination. Moreover, estimating
theoretical uncertainties by scale variation may yield unreliable results. We
present the extension of the Matrix Element Method to next-to-leading order in
QCD applicable to LHC data defined by common jet algorithms. The accuracy gain
is illustrated by simulating a top-quark mass determination from single
top-quark events generated with POWHEG+PYTHIA. Additionally, the method's
potential for BSM parameter determination is demonstrated by simulating the
extraction of a CP-violating Top-Yukawa coupling from events of single
top-quarks in association with a Higgs boson.

estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system. The availability of a
timely estimate of the health status of the system will allow for an informed

addresses the three phases of the prognostic flow - namely (1) signal

for real-time, on-board execution. To achieve this goal, we propose to combine
information from physical models of different fidelity with machine learning
techniques to obtain efficient representations (surrogate models) suitable for
nearly real-time applications. Additionally, we propose an importance sampling

codes. A three-level modelling approach was adopted for runaway electron
simulations within the EU-IM. Recently, a number of runaway electron modelling
modules have been integrated into this framework. The first level of modelling
(Runaway Indicator) is limited to the indication if runaway electron generation
is possible or likely. The second level (Runaway Fluid) adopts an approach
similar to e.g. the GO code, using analytical formulas to estimate changes in
the runaway electron current density. The third level is based on the solution
of the electron kinetics. One such code is LUKE that can handle the
toroidicity-induced effects by solving the bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck
equation. Another approach is used in NORSE, which features a fully nonlinear
collision operator that makes it capable of simulating major changes in the
electron distribution, for example slide-away. Both codes handle the effect of
radiation on the runaway distribution. These runaway-electron modelling codes
are in different stages of integration into the EU-IM infrastructure, and into
the European Transport Simulator (ETS), which is a fully capable modular 1.5D
core transport simulator. ETS with Runaway Fluid was benchmarked to the GO code
implementing similar physics. Coherent integration of kinetic solvers requires
more effort on the coupling, especially regarding the definition of the
boundary between runaway and thermal populations, and on consistent calculation
of resistivity. Some of these issues are discussed.

framework to transplant SKGE models to TKGs and to enhance the performance of

ignores the continuity of states of TKG in time evolution, we treat the
sequence of graphs as a Markov chain, which transitions from the previous state
to the next state. RTFE takes the SKGE to initialize the embeddings of TKG.
Then it recursively tracks the state transition of TKG by passing updated
parameters/features between timestamps. Specifically, at each timestamp, we
approximate the state transition as the gradient update process. Since RTFE
learns each timestamp recursively, it can naturally transit to future
timestamps. Experiments on five TKG datasets show the effectiveness of RTFE.

because it facilitates dissemination of traffic-related information to vehicles
through Vehicle-to-External (V2X) communication. Onboard sensing equipment
including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize the traffic environment
in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited by
their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful
for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously
coalescing the short- and long-range information, the CAV can construct
comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed,
safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions
including lane change) and long-term (route choice). In this paper, we describe
a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected
through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in
the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use
the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In
addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the
performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual
driving environment, the paper carried out a case study. The case study
demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the
appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected
that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and
mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective,
its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers
and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the
recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.

Capital of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, dates to the mid of the 18th century.
Initially, the use of a low building on a high ground was proposed, and the
hill of Arcetri suggested as a proper location. At the end of the century, the
Florence Observatory - or Specola - was built instead on a tower at the same
level as the city's centre. As soon as astronomers started to use this
observatory, they recognized all its flaws and struggled to search for a better
location. Giovanni Battista Donati, director of the Specola of Florence from
the eve of the Italian Unification in 1859, finally succeeded in creating a new
observatory: first, he obtained funds from the Parliament of the Kingdom of
Italy to build an equatorial mount for the Amici 28-cm refractor, which could
not be installed conveniently in the tower of the Specola; then, he went
through the process of selecting a proper site, seeking funds and finally
building Arcetri Observatory. Although Donati was a pioneer of spectroscopy and
astrophysics, his intent was to establish a modern observatory for classical
astronomy, as the Italian peninsula did not have a national observatory like
those located in many foreign capitals - Florence was the capital of the
Kingdom of Italy from 1865 to 1871. To promote the project, Donati made use of
writings by one of the most authoritative European astronomers, Otto Wilhelm
Struve. The paper describes all these steps, eventually leading to the final
inauguration of the Arcetri Observatory in 1872, almost 150 years ago.

cross-lingual VC without any transcription or language-specific knowledge for

dependence of mass accretion efficiency on the gas metallicity $Z$ and mass
injection at super-Eddington accretion rates from the outer galactic disk
$\dot{M}_{\rm in}$, and find that the central BH can be fed at rates exceeding
the Eddington rate only when the dusty disk becomes sufficiently optically
thick to ionizing radiation. In this case, mass outflows from the disk owing to
photoevaporation is suppressed and thus a large fraction ($\gtrsim 40\%$) of
the mass injection rate can feed the central BH. The conditions are expressed
as $\dot{M}_{\rm in} > 2.2\times 10^{-1}~M_\odot ~{\rm yr}^{-1}
(1+Z/10^{-2}~Z_\odot)^{-1}(c_{\rm s}/10~{\rm km~s}^{-1})$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is
the sound speed in the gaseous disk. With increasing numerical resolution,
vigorous disk fragmentation reduces the disk surface density and dynamical
heating by formed clumps makes the disk thickness higher. As a result, the
photoevaorative mass-loss rate rises and thus the critical injection rate
increases for fixed metallicity. This process enables super-Eddington growth of
BHs until the BH mass reaches $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, depending on
the properties of the host dark-matter halo and metal-enrichment history. In
the assembly of protogalaxies, seed BHs that form in overdense regions with a
mass variance of 3-4$\sigma$ at $z\sim 15-20$ are able to undergo short periods

metal-insulator transitions. Harnessing and controlling these effects is a
major challenge, on which key advances are being made through lattice and
strain engineering in thin films and heterostructures, leveraging the complex
interplay between electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we show
that the electronic structure of LaNiO3 can be tuned by means of lattice
engineering. We use different substrates to induce compressive and tensile
biaxial epitaxial strain in LaNiO3 thin films. Our measurements reveal
systematic changes of the optical spectrum as a function of strain and,
notably, an increase of the low-frequency free carrier weight as tensile strain
is applied. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that
this apparently counter-intuitive effect is due to a change of orientation of
the oxygen octahedra.The calculations also reveal drastic changes of the
electronic structure under strain, associated with a Fermi surface Lifshitz
transition. We provide an online applet to explore these effects. The
experimental value of integrated spectral weight below 2 eV is significantly
(up to a factor of 3) smaller than the DFT results, indicating a transfer of
spectral weight from the infrared to energies above 2 eV. The suppression of
the free carrier weight and the transfer of spectral weight to high energies
together indicate a correlation-induced band narrowing and free carrier mass
enhancement due to electronic correlations. Our findings provide a promising
avenue for the tuning and control of quantum materials employing lattice
engineering.

is assigned to a subproblem based on its objective vector, i.e., its location
in the objective space. The child is compared with its neighbors in the

this tremendous rise in deep learning adoption comes questions about the
trustworthiness of the deep neural networks that power these applications.
Motivated to answer such questions, there has been a very recent interest in
trust quantification. In this work, we introduce the concept of trust matrix, a
novel trust quantification strategy that leverages the recently introduced
question-answer trust metric by Wong et al. to provide deeper, more detailed
insights into where trust breaks down for a given deep neural network given a
set of questions. More specifically, a trust matrix defines the expected
question-answer trust for a given actor-oracle answer scenario, allowing one to
quickly spot areas of low trust that needs to be addressed to improve the
trustworthiness of a deep neural network. The proposed trust matrix is simple
to calculate, humanly interpretable, and to the best of the authors' knowledge
is the first to study trust at the actor-oracle answer level. We further extend
the concept of trust densities with the notion of conditional trust densities.
We experimentally leverage trust matrices to study several well-known deep
neural network architectures for image recognition, and further study the trust
density and conditional trust densities for an interesting actor-oracle answer
scenario. The results illustrate that trust matrices, along with conditional
trust densities, can be useful tools in addition to the existing suite of trust
quantification metrics for guiding practitioners and regulators in creating and
certifying deep learning solutions for trusted operation.

identify an important aspect of programming for persistent memory: the
persistent data retention model.
  A Persistent Data Retention Model describes what happens to persistent data
when code that uses it is modified. We identify two models present in prior
work but not described as such, the Reset and Manual Model, and we propose a
new one called the Automatic Model. The Reset model discards all persistent
data when a program changes leading to performance overheads and write
amplification. In contrast, if data is to be retained, the Manual Model relies
on the programmer to implement code that upgrades data from one version of the
program to the next. This reduces overheads but places a larger burden on the
programmer.
  We propose the Automatic Model to assist a programmer by automating some or
all of the conversion. We describe one such automatic approach, Lazily
Extendible Data Structures, that uses language extensions and compiler support
to reduce the effort and complexity associated with updating persistent data.
We evaluate our PDRMs in the context of the Persistent Memory Development Kit

of 2.90% to 4.10% on average, and LEDS shows overhead of 0.45% to 10.27% on

reconstruction paradigm with widespread application prospects in science,
engineering and cybernetic systems. However, state-of-the-art block-based image
compressive sensing (BCS) methods generally suffer from two issues. The
sparsifying domain and the sensing matrices widely used for image acquisition
are not data-driven, and thus both the features of the image and the
relationships among subblock images are ignored. Moreover, doing so requires
addressing high-dimensional optimization problems with extensive computational
complexity for image reconstruction. In this paper, we provide a deep learning
strategy for BCS, called AutoBCS, which takes the prior knowledge of images
into account in the acquisition step and establishes a subsequent
reconstruction model for performing fast image reconstruction with a low
computational cost. More precisely, we present a learning-based sensing matrix
(LSM) derived from training data to accomplish image acquisition, thereby
capturing and preserving more image characteristics than those captured by
existing methods. In particular, the generated LSM is proven to satisfy the
theoretical requirements of compressive sensing, such as the so-called
restricted isometry property. Additionally, we build a noniterative
reconstruction network, which provides an end-to-end BCS reconstruction
framework to eliminate blocking artifacts and maximize image reconstruction
accuracy, in our AutoBCS architecture. Furthermore, we investigate
comprehensive comparison studies with both traditional BCS approaches and newly
developed deep learning methods. Compared with these approaches, our AutoBCS
framework can not only provide superior performance in terms of image quality
metrics (SSIM and PSNR) and visual perception, but also automatically benefit
reconstruction speed.

analyzed two spectra of Gaia18aen and collected the available photometry of the
object covering the brightenings in 2018 and also the preceding and following
periods of quiescence. Based on this observational data, we have derived the
parameters of Gaia18aen and discussed the nature of the object. Gaia18aen is
the first symbiotic star discovered by the Gaia satellite. The system is an
S-type symbiotic star and consists of an M giant of a slightly super-solar
metallicity, with Teff ~3500 K, a radius of ~230 R$\odot$, and a high
luminosity L ~7400 L$\odot$. The hot component is a hot white dwarf. We
tentatively determined the orbital period of the system ~487 days. The main
outburst of Gaia18aen in 2018 was accompanied by a decrease in the temperature
of the hot component. The first phase of the outburst was characterized by the
high luminosity L ~27000 L$\odot$, which remained constant for about three
weeks after the optical maximum, later followed by the gradual decline of
luminosity and increase of temperature. Several re-brightenings have been
detected on the timescales of hundreds of days.

the crossover of two characteristic time scales, namely the average period of
oscillation of the liquid configuration in a minimum of the potential energy
surface, and the average time separating transits between potential energy
minima as a result of the continuous dynamical rearrangement of particles. When
entering the undercooled regime, the transit time becomes smaller than the
period of oscillation, and the delicate balance between the disordering effects
of thermal agitation and the ordering effects of interactions can be
destabilized in favor of the periodic order. Finally, we demonstrate that the

overlapped adversarial vulnerabilities: adversarial attacks can mislead CNN
models with small perturbations, which can effectively transfer between
different models trained on the same dataset. Adversarial training, as a
general robustness improvement technique, eliminates the vulnerability in a
single model by forcing it to learn robust features. The process is hard, often
requires models with large capacity, and suffers from significant loss on clean
data accuracy. Alternatively, ensemble methods are proposed to induce
sub-models with diverse outputs against a transfer adversarial example, making
the ensemble robust against transfer attacks even if each sub-model is
individually non-robust. Only small clean accuracy drop is observed in the
process. However, previous ensemble training methods are not efficacious in
inducing such diversity and thus ineffective on reaching robust ensemble. We
propose DVERGE, which isolates the adversarial vulnerability in each sub-model
by distilling non-robust features, and diversifies the adversarial
vulnerability to induce diverse outputs against a transfer attack. The novel
diversity metric and training procedure enables DVERGE to achieve higher
robustness against transfer attacks comparing to previous ensemble methods, and
enables the improved robustness when more sub-models are added to the ensemble.

orbital stability and tidal migration to the six candidate KOI systems proposed
by Fox & Wigert (2020) to identify whether these systems can potentially host
exomoons. The host planets orbit close to their respective stars and the
orbital stability extent of exomoons is limited to only $\sim$40% of the host
planet's Hill radius ($\sim$20 R$_{\rm p}$). Using plausible tidal parameters
from the solar system, we find that four out of six systems would either
tidally disrupt their exomoons or lose them to outward migration within the
system lifetimes. The remaining two systems (KOI 268.01 and KOI 1888.01) could
host exomoons that are within 25 R$_{\rm p}$ and less than $\sim$3% of the host
planet's mass. However, a recent independent transit timing analysis by Kipping

them as candidates. Overall, we find the presence of exomoons in these systems

increase communication range. If the dominant communication direction is
blocked by an obstacle, an alternative and reliable spatial communication path
should be quickly identified to maintain connectivity. In this paper, we
introduce a new metric to quantify the effective multipath richness (EMR) of a
directional communication channel by considering the strength and spatial
diversity of the resolved paths, while also taking into account beamwidth and
blockage characteristics. The metric is defined as a weighted sum of the number
of multipath component (MPC) clusters, where clustering is performed based on
the cosine-distance between the MPCs that have power above a certain threshold.
This process returns a single scalar value for a transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX)
location pair in a given environment. It is also possible to represent the EMR
of the whole environment with a probability distribution function of the metric
by considering a set of TX/RX locations. Using this proposed metric, one can
assess the scattering richness of different communication environments to
achieve a particular quality of service (QoS). This metric is especially
informative and useful at higher frequencies, such as mmWave and terahertz
(THz), where the propagation path loss and penetration loss are high, and
directional non-light-of-sight (NLOS) communication is critical for the success
of the network. We evaluate the proposed metric using our channel measurements

become increasingly reliant on natural gas-fired power plants as fast ramping
sources for meeting fluctuating bulk power demands. This dependence has
introduced new vulnerabilities to the power grid, including disruptions to gas
transmission networks from natural and man-made disasters. To address the
operational challenges arising from these disruptions, we consider the task of
determining a feasible steady-state operating point for a damaged gas pipeline
network while ensuring the maximal delivery of load. We formulate the
mixed-integer nonconvex maximal load delivery (MLD) problem, which proves
difficult to solve on large-scale networks. To address this challenge, we
present a mixed-integer convex relaxation of the MLD problem and use it to
determine bounds on the transport capacity of a gas pipeline system. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the relaxation, the exact and relaxed
formulations are compared across a large number of randomized damage scenarios
on nine natural gas pipeline network models ranging in size from 11 to 4197
junctions. A proof of concept application, which assumes network damage from a
set of synthetically generated earthquakes, is also presented to demonstrate
the utility of the proposed optimization-based capacity evaluation in the
context of risk assessment for natural disasters. For all but the largest
network, the relaxation-based method is found to be suitable for use in
evaluating the impacts of multi-contingency network disruptions, often
converging to the optimal solution of the relaxed formulation in less than ten
seconds.

  Approach","39 pages, 1 figure",,"10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2021.78",,"cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize agents to truthfully report their
signals even in the absence of verification by comparing agents' reports with
those of their peers. In the detail-free multi-task setting, agents respond to
multiple independent and identically distributed tasks, and the mechanism does
not know the prior distribution of agents' signals. The goal is to provide an
$\epsilon$-strongly truthful mechanism where truth-telling rewards agents
""strictly"" more than any other strategy profile (with $\epsilon$ additive
error), and to do so while requiring as few tasks as possible. We design a
family of mechanisms with a scoring function that maps a pair of reports to a
score. The mechanism is strongly truthful if the scoring function is ""prior
ideal,"" and $\epsilon$-strongly truthful as long as the scoring function is
sufficiently close to the ideal one. This reduces the above mechanism design
problem to a learning problem -- specifically learning an ideal scoring
function. We leverage this reduction to obtain the following three results. 1)
We show how to derive good bounds on the number of tasks required for different
types of priors. Our reduction applies to myriad continuous signal space
settings. This is the first peer-prediction mechanism on continuous signals
designed for the multi-task setting. 2) We show how to turn a soft-predictor of
an agent's signals (given the other agents' signals) into a mechanism. This
allows the practical use of machine learning algorithms that give good results
even when many agents provide noisy information. 3) For finite signal spaces,
we obtain $\epsilon$-strongly truthful mechanisms on any stochastically
relevant prior, which is the maximal possible prior. In contrast, prior work
only achieves a weaker notion of truthfulness (informed truthfulness) or
requires stronger assumptions on the prior.

estimated the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) from the Ha fluxes, corrected
for Galaxy foreground extinction and [N II] contamination. Ha+[N II] emission
has been detected in all galaxies. HII regions clearly emerge in late-type
galaxies (LTGs) , while in early-type galaxies (ETGs) the Ha+[N II] emission is
dominated by [N II], especially in the central regions. However, HII complexes
are also revealed in four ETGs. Considering the Dorado group as a whole, we
notice that the Ha+[N II] equivalent width, a measure of the specific SF,
increases with the morphological type, from early to late-type members,
although it remains lower that what observed in similar surveys of spiral
galaxies. The SFR of the spiral members is in the range of what observed in
similar galaxies surveys James+ (2004), although, in three spirals the SFR is
well below the median for their morphological classes. The SFR of some
early-type members tends, at odds, to be higher than the average derived from
Ha+[N II] surveys of this morphological family. We detected in Ha+[N II] all
the ETGs observed and half of them show HII regions. These findings suggest
that ETGs in this group are not dead galaxies: their SF has not shut down yet.
Mechanisms such as gas stripping and gas accretion, through galaxy-galaxy
interaction, seem relevant in modifying the SF in this evolutionary phase of
Dorado.

evict+reload for recovering an RSA key and Spectre variants for data leaked due
to speculative accesses. The key insight in this paper is the importance of the
first access to the shared data after a victim brings the data into the cache.
To eliminate the timing side channel, we ensure that the first access by a
process to any cache line loaded by another process results in a miss. We
accomplish this goal by using a combination of timestamps and a novel hardware
design to allow efficient parallel comparisons of the timestamps. The solution
works at all the cache levels and defends against an attacker process running
on another core, same core, or another hyperthread. Our design retains the
benefits of a shared cache: allowing processes to utilize the entire cache for
their execution and retaining a single copy of shared code and data (data
deduplication). Our implementation in the GEM5 simulator demonstrates that the
system is able to defend against RSA key extraction. We evaluate performance
using SPECCPU2006 and observe overhead due to first access delay to be 2.17%.
The overhead due to the security context bookkeeping is of the order of 0.3%.

astrophysical Keplerian disks with zero net magnetic flux using standard
shearing box simulations. We focus on the turbulence dynamics in Fourier space,
capturing specific/noncanonical anisotropy of nonlinear processes due to disk
flow shear. This is a new type of nonlinear redistribution of modes over
wavevector orientations in Fourier space -- the nonlinear transverse cascade --
which is generic to shear flows and fundamentally different from usual
direct/inverse cascade. The zero flux MRI has no exponentially growing modes,
so its growth is transient, or nonmodal. Turbulence self-sustenance is governed
by constructive cooperation of the transient growth of MRI and the nonlinear
transverse cascade. This cooperation takes place at small wavenumbers (on the
flow size scales) referred to as the vital area in Fourier space. The direct
cascade transfers mode energy from the vital area to larger wavenumbers. At
large ${\rm Pm}$, the transverse cascade prevails over the direct one, keeping
most of modes' energy contained in small wavenumbers. With decreasing ${\rm
Pm}$, however, the action of the transverse cascade weakens and can no longer
oppose the action of direct cascade which more efficiently transfers energy to
higher wavenumbers, leading to increased resistive dissipation. This undermines
the sustenance scheme, resulting in the turbulence decay. Thus, the decay of
zero net flux MRI-turbulence with decreasing ${\rm Pm}$ is attributed to
topological rearrangement of the nonlinear processes when the direct cascade
begins to prevail over the transverse cascade.

temperatures decreases the overall PL yield and UV intensity at nearly the same
rates, indicating the increase in formation of at least one non-radiative
defect type. Simultaneously, the PL yield ratios of blue/UV and green/UV
increase, suggesting that defects associated with these emissions increase in
concentration with O2 annealing. Utilizing the different absorption
coefficients of 240 and 266 nm polarization-dependent excitation, we find an
overall activation energy for the generation of non-radiative defects of 0.69

0.89-0.92 eV through the films, whereas the blue-related defects have
activation energy in the range 0.43-0.62 eV for all depths. Lastly, we observe
hillock surface morphologies and Cr diffusion from the substrate into the film

formation and diffusion of VGa and its complexes as a dominant process during

calculus. Bohr-Mollerup's theorem was then adopted by Nicolas Bourbaki as the
starting point for his exposition of the gamma function.
  This open access book develops a far-reaching generalization of
Bohr-Mollerup's theorem to higher order convex functions, along lines initiated
by Wolfgang Krull, Roger Webster, and some others but going considerably
further than past work. In particular, this generalization shows using
elementary techniques that a very rich spectrum of functions satisfy analogues
of several classical properties of the gamma function, including
Bohr-Mollerup's theorem itself, Euler's reflection formula, Gauss'
multiplication theorem, Stirling's formula, and Weierstrass' canonical
factorization.
  The scope of the theory developed in this work is illustrated through various
examples, ranging from the gamma function itself and its variants and
generalizations (q-gamma, polygamma, multiple gamma functions) to important
special functions such as the Hurwitz zeta function and the generalized

recognition is still challenged by the change of pose, illumination, make-up,
and expression. On the other hand, the geometric information contained in
three-dimensional (3D) face data has the potential to overcome the fundamental
limitations of 2D face data.
  We propose a multi-Channel deep 3D face network for face recognition based on
3D face data. We compute the geometric information of a 3D face based on its
piecewise-linear triangular mesh structure and then conformally flatten
geometric information along with the color from 3D to 2D plane to leverage the
state-of-the-art deep CNN architectures. We modify the input layer of the
network to take images with nine channels instead of three only such that more
geometric information can be explicitly fed to it. We pre-train the network
using images from the VGG-Face \cite{Parkhi2015} and then fine-tune it with the
generated multi-channel face images. The face recognition accuracy of the
multi-Channel deep 3D face network has achieved 98.6. The experimental results
also clearly show that the network performs much better when a 9-channel image
is flattened to plane based on the conformal map compared with the orthographic
projection.

research can be divided into three categories: a learnable codec, a
postprocessing network, and a compact representation network. The learnable
codec has been designed for an end-to-end learning beyond the conventional
compression modules. The postprocessing network increases the quality of
decoded images using an example-based learning. The compact representation
network is learned to reduce the capacity of an input image to reduce the
bitrate while keeping the quality of the decoded image. However, these
approaches are not compatible with the existing codecs or not optimal to
increase the coding efficiency. Specifically, it is difficult to achieve
optimal learning in the previous studies using the compact representation
network, due to the inaccurate consideration of the codecs. In this paper, we
propose a novel standard compatible image compression framework based on
Auxiliary Codec Networks (ACNs). ACNs are designed to imitate image degradation
operations of the existing codec, which delivers more accurate gradients to the
compact representation network. Therefore, the compact representation and the
postprocessing networks can be learned effectively and optimally. We
demonstrate that our proposed framework based on JPEG and High Efficiency Video

noisy labels), which will significantly degrade the network performance. In
this paper, the attention-aware noisy label learning approach ($A^2NL$) is
proposed to improve the discriminative capability of the network trained on
datasets with potential label noise. Specifically, a Noise-Attention model,
which contains multiple noise-specific units, is designed to better capture
noisy information. Each unit is expected to learn a specific noisy distribution
for a subset of images so that different disturbances are more precisely
modeled. Furthermore, a recursive learning process is introduced to strengthen
the learning ability of the attention network by taking advantage of the
learned high-level knowledge. To fully evaluate the proposed method, we conduct
experiments from two aspects: manually flipped label noise on large-scale image

protostar's optically thick disc, polarisation is likely to arise from dust
self-scattering. In material to the south of Source I - previously identified
as a region of 'anomalous' polarisation emission - we observe a polarisation
geometry concentric around Source I. We demonstrate that Source I's extreme
luminosity may be sufficient to make the radiative precession timescale shorter
than the Larmor timescale for moderately large grains ($> 0.005-0.1\,\mu$m),
causing them to precess around the radiation anisotropy vector (k-RATs) rather
than the magnetic field direction (B-RATs). This requires relatively unobscured
emission from Source I, supporting the hypothesis that emission in this region
arises from the cavity wall of the Source I outflow. This is one of the first
times that evidence for k-RAT alignment has been found outside of a
protostellar disc or AGB star envelope. Alternatively, the grains may remain
aligned by B-RATs and trace gas infall onto the Main Ridge. Elsewhere, we
largely find the magnetic field geometry to be radial around the BN/KL

larger-scale magnetic field, perhaps indicative of the ability of the dense

construction of buildings. The existing crowd simulators require fully-modeled
3D environments and enough time to prepare and simulate scenarios, where the
distribution and behavior of the crowd needs to be controlled. In addition, its
population, routes or even doors and passages may change, so the 3D model and
configurations have to be updated accordingly. This is a time-consuming task
that commonly has to be addressed within the crowd simulators. With that in
mind, we present a novel approach to estimate the resulting data of a given
evacuation scenario without actually simulating it. For such, we divide the
environment into smaller modular rooms with different configurations, in a
divide-and-conquer fashion. Next, we train an artificial neural network to
estimate all required data regarding the evacuation of a single room. After
collecting the estimated data from each room, we develop a heuristic capable of
aggregating per-room information so the full environment can be properly
evaluated. Our method presents an average error of 5% when compared to
evacuation time in a real-life environment. Our crowd estimator approach has
several advantages, such as not requiring to model the 3D environment, nor
learning how to use and configure a crowd simulator, which means any user can
easily use it. Furthermore, the computational time to estimate evacuation data
(inference time) is virtually zero, which is much better even when compared to
the best-case scenario in a real-time crowd simulator.

time after becoming infected. The studies show that carriers with mild or no
symptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the
population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in
the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on
the disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the
time-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably
different in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide
outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus
has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the
effect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the
meta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In
this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the
underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties,
and symptom development duration are investigated to establish a
centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A convex traffic volume
optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak. The control
process is done by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality
and then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume
(motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level. The
numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the
impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case
scenarios in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.

points. One of the main contributions of our paper is to introduce a new
topological structure to hypergraph data which bears a resemblance to a usual
metric space structure. Using this new topological space structure of
hypergraph data, we propose several approaches to study community detection
problem, detecting persistent features arising from homological structure of
hypergraph data. Also based on the topological space structure of hypergraph
data introduced in our paper, we introduce a modified nearest neighbors methods
which is a generalization of the classical nearest neighbors methods from
machine learning. Our modified nearest neighbors methods have an advantage of
being very flexible and applicable even for discrete structures as in
hypergraphs. We then apply our modified nearest neighbors methods to study sign
prediction problem in hypegraph data constructed using our method.

depending on whether the support set is bounded or not. In the first case, the
probability density function has a bounded support and is bounded away from

probability density function can approach zero and is smooth everywhere.
Moreover, the Hessian is assumed to decay with the density values. For this

based on a compatible set of natural constants with fixed values. An example is
the Boltzmann constant k which defines the thermal energy content kT. To
express the base unit T, the absolute temperature in kelvin, an international
agreement for the temperature scale is needed. The scale is defined using fixed
points, which are temperatures of various phase transitions. Especially
important has been the triple point of water at 273.1600 K. These fixed point
temperatures determine the international temperature scale ITS within the Si

properties of appropriate thermometric materials selected to determine the
temperature scale. For determining the Boltzmann constant, new precision
techniques have been developed during the last two decades. Examples are
different types of gas thermometry, which ultimately are based on the ideal gas
law, and thermal noise of electric charge carriers in conductors. With these
means it has become possible to fix the value of the Boltzmann constant with a
relative uncertainty of < 1 ppm. As of 2019, the value of k has been agreed to

pond collapses, the villages nearby will be destroyed and the harmful chemicals

especial nonlinear data processing method to impute the missing value with the
numerical inversion (NI) method, which combines correlation analysis,
sensitivity analysis, and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Secondly, a new
forecasting model was proposed to monitor the saturation line, which is the
lifeline of the tailings pond and can directly reflect the stability of the
tailings pond. After using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose
the original saturation line data into 4-layer wavelets and de-noise the data,
the CNN was used to identify and learn the spatial structures in the time
series, followed by LSTM cells for detecting the long-short-term dependence.
Finally, different experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
our model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results
show that Wavelet-CNN-LSTM achieves the best score both in mean absolute

1) The decorrelation length of the backward-propagating Elsasser field $z^-$ is
larger in the NSB intervals than the one in the SB intervals; 2) the magnetic
power spectrum in SB intervals is steeper, with spectral index close to -5/3,
than in NSB intervals, which have a spectral index close to -3/2; 3) both SB

4) the residual energy is larger in the SB intervals than in NSB, and 5) the
analyzed fluctuations are dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations that are
propagating in the \emph{sunward} (\emph{anti-sunward}) direction for the SB

revealed the strong dependence of the cross section of the 2D dipolar

wall potential and by the more realistic Lennard-Jones potential, and on the
mutual orientations of the dipoles. We defined the critical (magic) tilt angle

extend the single-output QR technique to multivariate probabilistic targets. QS
efficiently models dependencies in multivariate target variables and represents
probability distributions through discrete quantile levels. Therefore, we

we model the prediction uncertainty using QS involving neural networks called

spread across countries worldwide infecting thousands and millions of people.
The virus is deadly, and people who are suffering from prior illnesses or are
older than the age of 60 are at a higher risk of mortality. Medicine and
Healthcare industries have surged towards finding a cure, and different
policies have been amended to mitigate the spread of the virus. While Machine
Learning (ML) methods have been widely used in other domains, there is now a
high demand for ML-aided diagnosis systems for screening, tracking, and
predicting the spread of COVID-19 and finding a cure against it. In this paper,
we present a journey of what role ML has played so far in combating the virus,
mainly looking at it from a screening, forecasting, and vaccine perspectives.
We present a comprehensive survey of the ML algorithms and models that can be
used on this expedition and aid with battling the virus.

self-organization of active protein structures including flagella, cilia, and
cytoskeletal networks. In active structures individual proteins consume
chemical energy to generate force and motion at molecular length scales.
Self-organization of protein components enables the control and modulation of
fluid flow fields on micron scales. The physical principles underlying the
organization and control of active-matter driven fluid flows are poorly
understood. Here, we apply an optically-controlled active-matter system
composed of microtubule filaments and light-switchable kinesin motor proteins
to analyze the emergence of persistent flow fields in a model active matter
system. Using light, we form contractile microtubule networks of varying shape.
We analyze the fluid flow fields generated by a wide range of microtubule
network geometries and explain the resulting flow fields within a unified
theoretical framework. We specifically demonstrate that the geometry of
microtubule flux at the boundary of contracting microtubule networks predicts
the steady-state fluid flow fields across polygonal network geometries through
finite-element simulations. Our work provides a foundation for programming
microscopic fluid-flows with controllable active matter and could enable the
engineering of versatile and dynamic microfluidic devices.

sequential, non-stationary and non-homogeneous observations? Through trading
bots, we illustrate how Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this
challenge. Our contributions are threefold: (i) the use of contextual
information also referred to as augmented state in DRL, (ii) the impact of a
one period lag between observations and actions that is more realistic for an
asset management environment, (iii) the implementation of a new repetitive
train test method called walk forward analysis, similar in spirit to cross
validation for time series. Although our experiment is on trading bots, it can
easily be translated to other bot environments that operate in sequential
environment with regime changes and noisy data. Our experiment for an augmented
asset manager interested in finding the best portfolio for hedging strategies
shows that AAMDRL achieves superior returns and lower risk.

techniques based on financial and risk planning techniques like Markowitz
efficient frontier, minimum variance, maximum diversification or equal risk
parity, in parallel, another community in machine learning has started working
on reinforcement learning and more particularly deep reinforcement learning to
solve other decision making problems for challenging task like autonomous
driving, robot learning, and on a more conceptual side games solving like Go.
This paper aims to bridge the gap between these two approaches by showing Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques can shed new lights on portfolio
allocation thanks to a more general optimization setting that casts portfolio
allocation as an optimal control problem that is not just a one-step
optimization, but rather a continuous control optimization with a delayed
reward. The advantages are numerous: (i) DRL maps directly market conditions to
actions by design and hence should adapt to changing environment, (ii) DRL does
not rely on any traditional financial risk assumptions like that risk is
represented by variance, (iii) DRL can incorporate additional data and be a
multi inputs method as opposed to more traditional optimization methods. We
present on an experiment some encouraging results using convolution networks.

generated by a finite number of antisymmetric functions called shapes.
Physically, each shape is a many-body vacuum, whose excitations are described
by symmetric functions (bosons). The infinity of bosonic excitations accounts
for the infinity of Hilbert space, while all shapes can be generated
algorithmically in closed form. The shapes are geometric objects in
wave-function space, such that any given many-body vacuum is their
intersection. Correlation effects in laboratory space are geometric constraints
in wave-function space. Algebraic geometry is the natural mathematical
framework for the particle picture of quantum mechanics. Simple examples of
this scheme are given, and the current state of the art in generating shapes is
described from the viewpoint of treating very large function spaces.

  Master of Science in Cognitive Systems",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The internal workings of modern deep learning models stay often unclear to an
external observer, although spatial attention mechanisms are involved. The idea
of this work is to translate these spatial attentions into natural language to
provide a simpler access to the model's function. Thus, I took a neural image
captioning model and measured the reactions to external modification in its
spatial attention for three different interface methods: a fixation over the
whole generation process, a fixation for the first time-steps and an addition
to the generator's attention. The experimental results for bounding box based
spatial attention vectors have shown that the captioning model reacts to method
dependent changes in up to 52.65% and includes in 9.00% of the cases object
categories, which were otherwise unmentioned. Afterwards, I established such a
link to a hierarchical co-attention network for visual question answering by
extraction of its word, phrase and question level spatial attentions. Here,
generated captions for the word level included details of the question-answer
pairs in up to 55.20% of the cases. This work indicates that spatial attention
seen as an external interface for image caption generators is an useful method
to access visual functions in natural language.

cultures -- the personal spaces -- in two Countries: Brazil and Germany. In
order to coherently compare Germany and Brazil evolutions with same population
applying same task, we performed the pedestrian Fundamental Diagram experiment
in Brazil, as performed in Germany. We use CNNs to detect and track people in
video sequences. With this data, we use Voronoi Diagrams to find out the
neighbor relation among people and then compute the walking distances to find
out the personal spaces. Based on personal spaces analyses, we found out that
people behavior is more similar, in terms of their behaviours, in high dense
populations and vary more in low and medium densities. So, we focused our study
on cultural differences between the two Countries in low and medium densities.
Results indicate that personal space analyses can be a relevant feature in
order to understand cultural aspects in video sequences. In addition to the
cultural differences, we also investigate the personality model in crowds,
using OCEAN. We also proposed a way to simulate the FD experiment from other
countries using the OCEAN psychological traits model as input. The simulated
countries were consistent with the literature.
