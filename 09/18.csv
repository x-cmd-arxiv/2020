stationary for the action of the group $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{R}^d$ or
$\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{Z}^d$. By combining two-scale convergence and Palm theory
for $\mathbb{G}$-stationary random measures and by developing a cut-off
procedure, under suitable second moment conditions we prove for almost all

associated Markov generators. In addition, we obtain the quenched convergence
of the $L^2$-Markov semigroup and resolvent of the diffusively rescaled random
walk to the corresponding ones of the Brownian motion with covariance matrix
$2D$. For symmetric jump rates, the above convergence plays a crucial role in
the derivation of hydrodynamic limits when considering multiple random walks
with site-exclusion or zero range interaction. We do not require any
ellipticity assumption, neither non-degeneracy of the homogenized matrix $D$.

derive single-shot results in (quantum) information theory. We show that it
gives genuine sufficient and necessary conditions for approximate
state-transitions between pairs of quantum states in the single-shot setting,
without the need for further optimization. We also clarify its relation to

production in random processes. We establish certain properties of the variance
of relative surprisal which will be useful for further investigations, such as
uniform continuity and upper bounds on the violation of sub-additivity.
Motivated by our results, we further derive a simple and physically appealing
axiomatic single-shot characterization of (relative) entropy which we believe
to be of independent interest. We illustrate our results with several

spectrum is hard and the detection of photons up to hundreds of GeV points
towards an emission from a dynamically young SNR. The lack of X-ray emission
gives a tight constraint on the ambient density $n_0 \leq 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$
cm$^{-3}$. Since G150.3+4.5 is not reported as a historical SNR, we impose a

liberating a tremendous amount of energy which is partitioned into various

of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from the mid-infrared interstellar
extinction to the thermalization of starlight to generate the cosmic microwave
background. These suggestions rely on the amplitude and the wavelength
dependence of the absorption cross sections of metallic needles. On the absence
of an exact solution to the absorption properties of metallic needles, their
absorption cross sections are often derived from the antenna approximation.
However, it is shown here that the antenna approximation is not an appropriate
representation since it violates the Kramers-Kronig relation. Stimulated by the
recent discovery of iron whiskers in asteroid Itokawa and graphite whiskers in
carbonaceous chondrites, we call for rigorous calculations of the absorption
cross sections of metallic needle-like particles, presumably with the discrete
dipole approximation. We also call for experimental studies of the formation
and growth mechanisms of metallic needle-like particles as well as experimental
measurements of the absorption cross sections of metallic needles of various

Flares are the first component of the SEE to impact our atmosphere, which can
set the stage for the arrival of the associated SEPs and CME. Magnetic
reconnection drives SEEs by restructuring the solar coronal magnetic field,
liberating a tremendous amount of energy which is partitioned into various
physical manifestations: particle acceleration, mass and magnetic-field
eruption, atmospheric heating, and the subsequent emission of radiation as
solar flares. To explain and ultimately predict these geoeffective events, the
heliophysics community requires a comprehensive understanding of the processes
that transform and distribute stored magnetic energy into other forms,
including the broadband radiative enhancement that characterises flares. This
white paper, submitted to the Heliophysics 2050 Workshop, discusses the flare
gradual phase part of SEEs, setting out the questions that need addressing via
a combination of theoretical, modelling, and observational research. In short,
the flare gradual phase persists much longer than predicted so, by 2050, we
must identify the characteristics of the significant energy deposition
sustaining the gradual phase, and address the fundamental processes of
turbulence and non-local heat flux.

the accuracy of the full order model, which is in contrast to elliptic and

reversal symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium systems. It can be defined either
at particle level or at the level of coarse-grained fields such as density; the
EPR for the latter quantifies the extent to which these coarse-grained fields
behave irreversibly. In this work, we first develop a general method to compute
the EPR of scalar Langevin field theories with additive noise. This large class
of theories includes active versions of Model A (non-conserved density
dynamics) and Model B (conserved) and also models where both types of dynamics
are simultaneously present (such as Model AB). Treating the scalar field $\phi$
(and its time derivative $\dot\phi$) as the sole observable(s), we arrive at an
expression for the EPR that is non-negative for every field configuration and
is quadratic in the time-antisymmetric component of the dynamics. Our general
expression is a function of the quasipotential, which determines the full
probability distribution for configurations, and is not generally calculable.
To alleviate this difficulty, we present a small-noise expansion of the EPR,
which only requires knowledge of the deterministic (mean-field) solution for
the scalar field in steady state, which generally is calculable, at least
numerically. We demonstrate this calculation for the case of Model AB. We then
present a similar EPR calculation for Model AB with the conservative and
non-conservative contributions to $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm A} + \dot\phi_{\rm
B}$ viewed as separately observable quantities. The results are qualitatively
different, confirming that the field-level EPR depends on the choice of
coarse-grained information retained within the dynamical description.

  We show the first efficient decremental algorithm for maintaining hopsets

decrementally maintain $(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs shortest
paths (for any constant $k \geq 2)$, in $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ amortized update

the amortized update time is
$n^{1/k}\cdot(\frac{1}{\epsilon})^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})}$. For sparse

  We also obtain near-optimal bounds for maintaining approximate multi-source
shortest paths and distance sketches, and get improved bounds for approximate
single-source shortest paths. Our algorithms are randomized and our bounds hold

at perihelion of `Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov from the values of the
nongravitational parameters.
  Results. We find that the equatorial obliquity of `Oumuamua could be about 93
deg, if it has a very prolate (fusiform) shape, or close to 16 deg, if it is
very oblate (disk-like). Different orbit determinations of 2I/Borisov gave
obliquity values of 59 deg and 90 deg. The distributions of cometocentric
longitudes were in general multimodal.
  Conclusions. The most probable spin-axis direction of `Oumuamua in equatorial
coordinates is (280 degrees, +46 degrees) if very prolate or (312 deg, -50 deg)
if very oblate. For the orbit determinations of 2I/Borisov used here, we find
most probable poles pointing near (275 deg, +65 deg) and (231 deg, +30 deg),
respectively. Although our analysis favors an oblate shape for 2I/Borisov, a
prolate one cannot be ruled out.

  Zero-Shot MEG Prediction","accepted at NeurIPS 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How meaning is represented in the brain is still one of the big open
questions in neuroscience. Does a word (e.g., bird) always have the same
representation, or does the task under which the word is processed alter its
representation (answering ""can you eat it?"" versus ""can it fly?"")? The brain
activity of subjects who read the same word while performing different semantic
tasks has been shown to differ across tasks. However, it is still not
understood how the task itself contributes to this difference. In the current
work, we study Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recordings of participants
tasked with answering questions about concrete nouns. We investigate the effect
of the task (i.e. the question being asked) on the processing of the concrete
noun by predicting the millisecond-resolution MEG recordings as a function of
both the semantics of the noun and the task. Using this approach, we test
several hypotheses about the task-stimulus interactions by comparing the
zero-shot predictions made by these hypotheses for novel tasks and nouns not
seen during training. We find that incorporating the task semantics
significantly improves the prediction of MEG recordings, across participants.
The improvement occurs 475-550ms after the participants first see the word,
which corresponds to what is considered to be the ending time of semantic
processing for a word. These results suggest that only the end of semantic
processing of a word is task-dependent, and pose a challenge for future
research to formulate new hypotheses for earlier task effects as a function of
the task and stimuli.

elusive phenomenon. For an integrable quantum model invariant under a global
non-abelian simple Lie group $G$, we find that finite-temperature transport of
Noether charges associated with symmetry $G$ in thermal states that are
invariant under $G$ is universally superdiffusive and characterized by
dynamical exponent $z = 3/2$. This conclusion holds regardless of the Lie
algebra symmetry, local degrees of freedom (on-site representations), Lorentz
invariance, or particular realization of microscopic interactions: we
accordingly dub it as superuniversal. The anomalous transport behavior is
attributed to long-lived giant quasiparticles dressed by thermal fluctuations.
We provide an algebraic viewpoint on the corresponding dressing transformation
and elucidate formal connections to fusion identities amongst the quantum-group
characters. We identify giant quasiparticles with nonlinear soliton modes of
classical field theories that describe low-energy excitations above
ferromagnetic vacua. Our analysis of these field theories also provides a
complete classification of the low-energy (i.e., Goldstone-mode) spectra of
quantum isotropic ferromagnetic chains.

robust classifiers can be achieved using neural networks, and an adversarially
robust neural network can have an arbitrarily large Lipschitz constant. For
this reason, enforcing small norms on CNN layers may be neither necessary nor

  Relocation and Caching","To appear in the MICRO 2020 conference proceedings",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DRAM Main memory is a performance bottleneck for many applications due to the
high access latency. In-DRAM caches work to mitigate this latency by augmenting
regular-latency DRAM with small-but-fast regions of DRAM that serve as a cache
for the data held in the regular-latency region of DRAM. While an effective
in-DRAM cache can allow a large fraction of memory requests to be served from a
fast DRAM region, the latency savings are often hindered by inefficient
mechanisms for relocating copies of data into and out of the fast regions.
Existing in-DRAM caches have two sources of inefficiency: (1) the data
relocation granularity is an entire multi-kilobyte row of DRAM; and (2) because
the relocation latency increases with the physical distance between the slow
and fast regions, multiple fast regions are physically interleaved among slow
regions to reduce the relocation latency, resulting in increased hardware area
and manufacturing complexity. We propose a new substrate, FIGARO, that uses
existing shared global buffers among subarrays within a DRAM bank to provide
support for in-DRAM data relocation across subarrays at the granularity of a
single cache block. FIGARO has a distance-independent latency within a DRAM
bank, and avoids complex modifications to DRAM. Using FIGARO, we design a
fine-grained in-DRAM cache called FIGCache. The key idea of FIGCache is to
cache only small, frequently-accessed portions of different DRAM rows in a
designated region of DRAM. By caching only the parts of each row that are
expected to be accessed in the near future, we can pack more of the
frequently-accessed data into FIGCache, and can benefit from additional row
hits in DRAM. Our evaluations show that FIGCache improves the average
performance of a system using DDR4 DRAM by 16.3% and reduces average DRAM
energy consumption by 7.8% for 8-core workloads, over a conventional system
without in-DRAM caching.

predicting the results of non-commuting measurements with a precision that
seems to violate the uncertainty principle. This apparent contradiction to
complementarity is made possible by nonclassical correlations stronger than
entanglement, called steering. Quantum information recognises steering as an
essential resource for a number of tasks but, contrary to entanglement, its
role for metrology has so far remained unclear. Here, we formulate the EPR
paradox in the framework of quantum metrology, showing that it enables the
precise estimation of a local phase shift and of its generating observable.
Employing a stricter formulation of quantum complementarity, we derive a
criterion based on the quantum Fisher information that detects steering in a
larger class of states than well-known uncertainty-based criteria. Our result
identifies useful steering for quantum-enhanced precision measurements and
allows one to uncover steering of non-Gaussian states in state-of-the-art

  conjecture for three dimensions",,,,"math.NT math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The three distance theorem (also known as the three gap theorem or Steinhaus
problem) states that, for any given real number $\alpha$ and integer $N$, there
are at most three values for the distances between consecutive elements of the
Kronecker sequence $\alpha, 2\alpha,\ldots, N\alpha$ mod 1. In this paper we
consider a natural generalisation of the three distance theorem to the higher
dimensional Kronecker sequence $\vec\alpha, 2\vec\alpha,\ldots, N\vec\alpha$
modulo an integer lattice. We prove that in two dimensions there are at most
five values that can arise as a distance between nearest neighbors, for all
choices of $\vec\alpha$ and $N$. Furthermore, for almost every $\vec\alpha$,
five distinct distances indeed appear for infinitely many $N$ and hence five is
the best possible general upper bound. In higher dimensions we have similar
explicit, but less precise, upper bounds. For instance in three dimensions our
bound is 13, though we conjecture the truth to be 9. We furthermore study the
number of possible distances from a point to its nearest neighbor in a
restricted cone of directions. This may be viewed as a generalisation of the
gap length in one dimension. For large cone angles we use geometric arguments
to produce explicit bounds directly analogous to the three distance theorem.
For small cone angles we use ergodic theory of homogeneous flows in the space
of unimodular lattices to show that the number of distinct lengths is (a)
unbounded for almost all $\vec\alpha$ and (b) bounded for $\vec\alpha$ that
satisfy certain Diophantine conditions.

  Classification Tasks","To appear in EMNLP 2020, camera-ready, link to code added",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Self-supervised pre-training of transformer models has revolutionized NLP
applications. Such pre-training with language modeling objectives provides a
useful initial point for parameters that generalize well to new tasks with
fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning is still data inefficient -- when there are
few labeled examples, accuracy can be low. Data efficiency can be improved by
optimizing pre-training directly for future fine-tuning with few examples; this
can be treated as a meta-learning problem. However, standard meta-learning
techniques require many training tasks in order to generalize; unfortunately,
finding a diverse set of such supervised tasks is usually difficult. This paper
proposes a self-supervised approach to generate a large, rich, meta-learning
task distribution from unlabeled text. This is achieved using a cloze-style
objective, but creating separate multi-class classification tasks by gathering
tokens-to-be blanked from among only a handful of vocabulary terms. This yields
as many unique meta-training tasks as the number of subsets of vocabulary
terms. We meta-train a transformer model on this distribution of tasks using a
recent meta-learning framework. On 17 NLP tasks, we show that this
meta-training leads to better few-shot generalization than language-model
pre-training followed by finetuning. Furthermore, we show how the
self-supervised tasks can be combined with supervised tasks for meta-learning,
providing substantial accuracy gains over previous supervised meta-learning.

critical for understanding the physical processes that govern the interstellar
medium (ISM) in galaxies. Aims. To study the morpho-kinematic properties of the
ionized and molecular gas in three dusty starburst galaxies at $z = 0.12-0.17$
to explore the relation between molecular ISM gas phase dynamics and the
star-formation activity. Methods. We analyse $\sim$kpc-scale ALMA CO(1--0) and
seeing limited SINFONI Paschen-$\alpha$ observations. We use a dynamical mass
model, which accounts for beam-smearing effects, to constrain the CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor. Results. One starburst galaxy shows irregular morphology
which may indicate a major merger, while the other two systems show disc-like
morpho-kinematics. The two disc-like starbursts show molecular gas velocity
dispersion values comparable with that seen in local LIRG/ULIRGs, but in an ISM
with molecular gas fraction and surface density values consistent to that
reported for local star-forming galaxies. These molecular gas velocity
dispersion values can be explained by assuming vertical pressure equilibrium.
The star-formation activity is correlated with the molecular gas content
suggesting depletion times of the order of $\sim 0.1-1$ Gyr. The star formation
rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) correlates with the ISM pressure set
by self-gravity ($P_{\rm grav}$) following a power law with an exponent close
to 0.8. Conclusions. In dusty disc-like starburst galaxies, our data support
the scenario in which the molecular gas velocity dispersion values are driven
by the ISM pressure set by self-gravity, responsible to maintain the vertical
pressure balance. The correlation between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $P_{\rm grav}$
suggests that, in these dusty starbursts galaxies, the star formation activity
arises as a consequence of the ISM pressure balance.

We construct such a framework through analyzing the problems in the existing

distillation via discriminators by: (1) adopting the similarity loss and
discriminator only on the final outputs and (2) using the average of softmax
probabilities from all teacher ensembles as the stronger supervision.
Intriguingly, three novel perspectives are presented for distillation: (1)
weight decay can be weakened or even completely removed since the soft label
also has a regularization effect; (2) using a good initialization for students
is critical; and (3) one-hot/hard label is not necessary in the distillation
process if the weights are well initialized. We show that such a
straight-forward framework can achieve state-of-the-art results without
involving any commonly-used techniques, such as architecture modification;
outside training data beyond ImageNet; autoaug/randaug; cosine learning rate;
mixup/cutmix training; label smoothing; etc. Our method obtains 80.67% top-1

baseline using knowledge distillation, and to our best knowledge, this is also

approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at generating
realistic samples, but seek to generate typical samples, rather than extreme
samples. Hence, in this work, we propose ExGAN, a GAN-based approach to
generate realistic and extreme samples. To model the extremes of the training

(EVT), a probabilistic approach for modelling the extreme tails of

both the desired extremeness measure, as well as the desired extremeness

show that our method generates realistic samples, based on visual inspection
and quantitative measures, in an efficient manner. Moreover, generating
increasingly extreme examples using ExGAN can be done in constant time (with
respect to the extremeness probability $\tau$), as opposed to the
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\tau})$ time required by the baseline approach.

that BAO gives exquisite constraints on the product $r_{\rm d}H_0$. We show
here that imposing a moderate prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$ breaks the
degeneracy between $r_{\rm d}$ and $H_0$. Using the latest BAO data, including
the recently released eBOSS DR16, along with a $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$ prior based
on the Planck best fit $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $r_{\rm d} =143.7 \pm 2.7$
Mpc and $H_0 = 69.6 \pm 1.8$ km/s/Mpc. BAO data therefore prefers somewhat
lower $r_{\rm d}$ and higher $H_0$ than those inferred from Planck data in a
$\Lambda$CDM model. We find similar values when combing BAO with the Pantheon
supernovae, DES galaxy weak lensing, Planck or SPTPol CMB lensing and the
cosmic chronometers data. We perform a forecast for DESI and find that, when
aided with a moderate prior on $\Omega_{\rm m} h^2$, DESI will measure $r_{\rm
d}$ and $H_0$ without assuming a recombination model with an accuracy
surpassing the current best estimates from Planck.

images of 48 source galaxies at 0.9<z<6.2. Within those galaxies, we securely
identify 182 multiple images of 66 galaxy components that we use to constrain
our lens model. We identify 116 clumps belonging to background high-z galaxies;
the majority of them are multiple images and span magnitude, size and redshift

most magnified ones probing possible single gravitationally bound star

extremely faint high-z sources;(2) peer into their internal clumps (down to

to incorrect inference of cosmological parameters, including the nature of dark

inference covers a novel family of methods to rigorously estimate posterior
distributions of parameters using forward modelling of mock data. We present
likelihood-free cosmological parameter inference using weak lensing maps from
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SV data, using neural data compression of weak
lensing map summary statistics. We explore combinations of the power spectra,
peak counts, and neural compressed summaries of the lensing mass map using deep
convolution neural networks. We demonstrate methods to validate the inference
process, for both the data modelling and the probability density estimation
steps. Likelihood-free inference provides a robust and scalable alternative for
rigorous large-scale cosmological inference with galaxy survey data (for DES,
Euclid and LSST). We have made our simulated lensing maps publicly available.

spin particles, when coupled to gravity, are in conflict with causality. This
tension can be avoided only if the gravitational interaction is accompanied by
interactions involving other higher spin states well below the Planck scale
$M_{\rm pl}$. These higher spin states can come from either the QCD sector or
the gravity sector, but both these resolutions have some surprising
implications. For example, QCD states can resolve the problem since there is a
non-trivial mixing between the QCD sector and the gravity sector, requiring all
particles to interact with glueballs at tree-level. If gravity sector states
restore causality, any weakly coupled UV completion of the gravity-sector must
have many stringy features, with an upper bound on the string scale. Under the
assumption that gravity is weakly coupled, both scenarios imply that the theory
has a stringy description above $N\gtrsim \frac{M_{\rm pl}}{\Lambda_{\rm

this is the third with a measured host mass. All three of these host stars have
masses of 0.5 $\leq$ M_host/M_Sun $\leq$ 0.7, which implies that this predicted
mass ratio gap is filled with planets that have host stars within a factor of
two of 1M_Sun. This suggests that runaway gas accretion does not play a major
role in determining giant planet masses for stars somewhat less massive than
the Sun. Our analysis has been accomplished with a modified DAOPHOT code that
has been designed to measure the brightness and positions of closely blended

The Q-ball profiles are determined by a nonlinear differential equation, and so
generally require solution by numerical methods. In this work, we derive
analytical approximations for the Q-ball profile in a polynomial potential and
obtain simple expressions for the important Q-ball properties of charge,

an improved phase calibration method that reduces the differential phase
uncertainty to 0.05 degree per baseline across the spectrum, we detect a
differential phase signal that reaches a maximum of ~0.5 degree between the

the BLR and the centroid of the hot dust distribution traced by the 2.3 $\mu$m
continuum. The offset is well within the dust sublimation region, which matches
the measured ~0.6 mas (0.7 pc) diameter of the continuum. A clear velocity
gradient, almost perpendicular to the offset, is traced by the reconstructed
photocentres of the spectral channels of the Br$\gamma$ line. We infer the
radius of the BLR to be ~65 $\mu$as (0.075 pc), which is consistent with the
radius-luminosity relation of nearby active galactic nuclei derived based on
the time lag of the H$\beta$ line from reverberation mapping campaigns. Our

we estimate the dust depletion from a method which consists in solving for the
depletion from multiple singly ionized ions (e.g. MnII, CrII, ZnII) since each
ion depletes on dust grains at different rates. We find a positive correlation
between the azimuthal angle and [Zn/Fe] with a Pearson's r = 0.70 +/- 0.14. The
sightlines along the major axis show [Zn/Fe] < 0.5, whereas the [Zn/Fe] is >
0.8 along the minor axis. These results suggest that the CGM along the minor

information about the star's equation of state in their tidal signatures. A
major issue in the inference of the tidal parameters (or directly of the
equation of state) is the systematic error introduced by the waveform
approximants. We use a bottom-up approach based on gauge-invariant phase
analysis and the Fisher information matrix to investigate waveform systematics
and help identifying biases in parameter estimation. A mock analysis of 15
different binaries indicates that systematics in current waveform models
dominate over statistical errors at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ${\gtrsim} 80$.
This implies biases in the inference of the reduced tidal parameter that are
are larger than the statistical $90\%$ credible-intervals. For example, while
the neutron-star radius could be constrained at ${\sim} 5\%$ level at SNR 80,
systematics can be at the ${\sim} 10\%$ level. We apply our approach to
GW170817 (SNR ${\sim}30$) and confirm that no significant systematic effects
are present. Using an optimal frequency range for the analysis, we estimate a
neutron-star radius of $12.5^{+1.1}_{-1.8}\,$km. The latter is consistent with
an electromagnetic-informed prior and the recent NICER measurement. Exploring
SNR ${\gtrsim}100$ in view of third-generation detectors, we find that all the
current waveform models lead to differences of at least 1-sigma in the
inference of the reduced tidal parameter (for any value of the latter). We
conclude that current waveform models, including those from numerical
relativity, are insufficient to infer the equation of state in the loudest (and
potentially most informative) events that will be observed by advanced and
third generation detectors.

binary-mediated interactions in the cores of globular clusters. In some of
these triples, the tertiary companion can drive the inner binary to merger
following large eccentricity oscillations, as a result of the eccentric
Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this paper, we study the dynamics and merger rates of
black hole (BH) hierarchical triples, formed via binary--binary encounters in
the CMC Cluster Catalog, a suite of cluster simulations with present-day
properties representative of the Milky Way's globular clusters. We compare the
properties of the mergers from triples to the other merger channels in dense
star clusters, and show that triple systems do not produce significant
differences in terms of mass and effective spin distribution. However, they
represent an important pathway for forming eccentric mergers, which could be
detected by LIGO--Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), and future missions such as LISA and
DECIGO. We derive a conservative lower limit for the merger rate from this
channel of $0.35$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ in the local Universe and up to $\sim9\%$
of these events may have a detectable eccentricity at LVK design sensitivity.
Additionally, we find that triple systems could play an important role in
retaining second-generation BHs, which can later merge again in the core of the

ground-based low- and high-resolution observations did not. We use equilibrium

near-IR observations. Our best-fit model is that with a scattering slope
consistent with a Rayleigh slope (alpha=5.3+2.9-3.1), high-altitude clouds at a

We find that our observations support other ground-based claims of no K I.
Clouds are likely why signals like H2O are extremely muted and Na or K cannot
be detected. We then juxtapose our Magellan/IMACS transmission spectrum with
existing VLT/FORS2, HST/WFC3, HST/STIS, and Spitzer observations to further
constrain the optical-to-infrared atmospheric features of the planet. We find

its harmonic coefficients between bin pairs are considered---a procedure
referred to as `tomography'. However, the unparalleled quality of data from
oncoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys for cosmology will render this method
computationally unfeasible, given the increasing number of bins. Here, we put
to test against synthetic data a novel method proposed in a previous study to
save computational time. According to this method, the whole galaxy redshift
distribution is subdivided into thick bins, neglecting the cross-bin
correlations among them; each of the thick bin is, however, further subdivided
into thinner bins, considering in this case all the cross-bin correlations. We
create a simulated data set that we then analyse in a Bayesian framework. We
confirm that the newly proposed method saves computational time and gives
results that surpass those of the standard approach.

we propose a novel framework for modeling the fine-grained latent variables,
considering the dependence on an input text, a hierarchical linguistic

consists of a multi-grained variational autoencoder, a conditional prior, and a
multi-level auto-regressive latent converter to obtain the different

from the coarser-level ones by taking into account the input text. Experimental
results indicate an appropriate method of sampling fine-grained latent

challenging task in biomedical text mining research. Previous works that
address the task typically use dictionary-based matching methods, which can
achieve high precision but suffer from lower recall. Recently, machine
learning-based methods have been proposed to identify biomedical concepts,
which can recognize more unseen concept synonyms by automatic feature learning.
However, most methods require large corpora of manually annotated data for
model training, which is difficult to obtain due to the high cost of human
annotation. In this paper, we propose PhenoTagger, a hybrid method that
combines both dictionary and machine learning-based methods to recognize Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts in unstructured biomedical text. We first use
all concepts and synonyms in HPO to construct a dictionary, which is then used
to automatically build a distantly supervised training dataset for machine
learning. Next, a cutting-edge deep learning model is trained to classify each
candidate phrase (n-gram from input sentence) into a corresponding concept
label. Finally, the dictionary and machine learning-based prediction results
are combined for improved performance. Our method is validated with two HPO
corpora, and the results show that PhenoTagger compares favorably to previous
methods. In addition, to demonstrate the generalizability of our method, we
retrained PhenoTagger using the disease ontology MEDIC for disease concept
recognition to investigate the effect of training on different ontologies.
Experimental results on the NCBI disease corpus show that PhenoTagger without
requiring manually annotated training data achieves competitive performance as
compared with state-of-the-art supervised methods.

an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges undergoing edge
deletions, together with a fixed source vertex $s\in V$. The goal is to
maintain a data structure that supports shortest-path queries: given a vertex
$v\in V$, quickly return an (approximate) shortest path from $s$ to $v$. The
decremental all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem is defined similarly, but
now the shortest-path queries are allowed between any pair of vertices of $V$.
Both problems have been studied extensively since the 80's, and algorithms with
near-optimal total update time and query time have been discovered for them.
Unfortunately, all these algorithms are randomized and, more importantly, they
need to assume an oblivious adversary.
  Our first result is a deterministic algorithm for the decremental SSSP
problem on weighted graphs with $O(n^{2+o(1)})$ total update time, that
supports $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest-path queries, with query time
$O(|P|\cdot n^{o(1)})$, where $P$ is the returned path. This is the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm against an adaptive adversary that
supports shortest-path queries in time below $O(n)$, that breaks the $O(mn)$
total update time bound of the classical algorithm of Even and Shiloah from
1981.
  Our second result is a deterministic algorithm for the decremental APSP
problem on unweighted graphs that achieves total update time
$O(n^{2.5+\delta})$, for any constant $\delta>0$, supports approximate distance
queries in $O(\log\log n)$ time; the algorithm achieves an
$O(1)$-multiplicative and $n^{o(1)}$-additive approximation on the path length.
All previous algorithms for APSP either assume an oblivious adversary or have
an $\Omega(n^{3})$ total update time when $m=\Omega(n^{2})$.

cold molecular outflow in the local LIRG ESO320-G030 (d=48 Mpc, log
LIR/Lsun=11.3). ESO320-G030 is a double-barred isolated spiral, but its compact
and obscured nuclear starburst (SFR~15 Msun/yr; Av~40 mag) resembles those of
more luminous ULIRGs. In the outflow, the 1-0/2-1 ratio is enhanced with
respect to the rest of the galaxy and the CO(4-3) transition is undetected.
This indicates that the outflowing molecular gas is less excited than the gas
in the nuclear starburst (launching site) and the galaxy disk. Non-LTE
radiative transfer modeling reveals that the properties of the outflow
molecular clouds differ from those of the nuclear and disk clouds: The kinetic
temperature is lower (~9 K) in the outflow, and the outflowing clouds have
lower column densities. Assuming a 10^-4 CO abundance, the large internal
velocity gradients, 60^+250_-45 km/s/pc, imply that the outflowing molecular
clouds are not bound by self-gravity. All this suggests that the life-cycle
(formation, collapse, dissipation) of the disk clouds might differ from that of
the outflowing clouds which might not be able to form stars. The low Tkin of
the molecular outflow remains constant up to 1.7 kpc. This indicates that the
heating by the hotter ionized outflow phase is not efficient and may favor the
survival of the outflow molecular phase. The velocity structure of the outflow
shows a 0.8 km/s/pc velocity gradient between 190-560 pc and then a constant
maximum velocity (~750 km/s) up to 1.7 kpc. This is compatible with a pure
gravitational evolution of the outflow under certain mass outflow rate and
launching velocity variations. Alternatively, ram pressure acceleration and
cloud evaporation could explain the observed kinematics and size of the
molecular phase.

hypermineralized tissue in the neck across various length scales. Synchrotron
radiation micro-CT found larger but less densely distributed cellular lacunae
in hypermineralized tissue than in lamellar bone. When examined under FIB-SEM,
the hypermineralized tissue was mainly composed of mineral globules with sizes
varying from submicron to a few microns. Nano-sized channels were present
within the mineral globules and oriented with the surrounding organic matrix.
Transmission electron microscopy showed the apatite inside globules were poorly
crystalline, while those at the boundaries between the globules had
well-defined lattice structure with crystallinity similar to the apatite
mineral in lamellar bone. No preferred mineral orientation was observed both
inside each globule and at the boundaries. Collectively, we conclude based on
these new observations that the hypermineralized tissue is non-lamellar and has
less organized mineral, which may contribute to the high brittleness of the
tissue.

traditional client-server to access-aggregation-core architectures. Recently
there is a new shift in the data center architecture due to the increasing need
for low latency and high throughput between server-to-server communications,
load balancing and, loop-free environment. This new architecture, known as leaf
and spine architecture, provides low latency and minimum packet loss by
enabling the addition and deletion of network nodes on demand. Network nodes
can be added or deleted from the network based on network statistics like link
speed, packet loss, latency, and throughput.
  With the maturity of Open Virtual Switch (OvS) and OpenFlow based Software
Defined Network (SDN) controllers, network automation through programmatic
extensions has become possible based on network statistics. The separation of
the control plane and data plane has enabled automated management of network
and Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to learn and optimize the network.
  In this publication, we propose the design of an ML-based approach to gather
network statistics and build a knowledge plane. We demonstrate that this
knowledge plane enables data center optimization using southbound APIs and SDN
controllers. We describe the design components of this approach - using a
network simulator and show that it can maintain the historical patterns of
network statistics to predict future growth or decline. We also provide an
open-source software that can be utilized in a leaf and spine data center to
provide elastic capacity based on load forecasts.

the dependence on curated, labelled data sets and to leverage the vast
quantities of unlabelled data available recently triggered renewed interest in
unsupervised learning algorithms. Despite a significantly improved performance
due to approaches such as the identification of disentangled latent
representations, contrastive learning, and clustering optimisations, the
performance of unsupervised machine learning still falls short of its
hypothesised potential. Machine learning has previously taken inspiration from
neuroscience and cognitive science with great success. However, this has mostly
been based on adult learners with access to labels and a vast amount of prior
knowledge. In order to push unsupervised machine learning forward, we argue
that developmental science of infant cognition might hold the key to unlocking
the next generation of unsupervised learning approaches. Conceptually, human
infant learning is the closest biological parallel to artificial unsupervised
learning, as infants too must learn useful representations from unlabelled
data. In contrast to machine learning, these new representations are learned
rapidly and from relatively few examples. Moreover, infants learn robust
representations that can be used flexibly and efficiently in a number of
different tasks and contexts. We identify five crucial factors enabling
infants' quality and speed of learning, assess the extent to which these have
already been exploited in machine learning, and propose how further adoption of
these factors can give rise to previously unseen performance levels in
unsupervised learning.

an excellent basis for exploratory analysis, while in more complex systems

be used as a basis for automated experiment workflows based on Bayesian
optimization, as demonstrated on the ex situ data. We further demonstrate the
use of non-linear autoencoders (AE) combined with clustering in the latent

reflected by the IRS to Eve in order to improve the wiretapping capability of

the limitations of classical support hardware, and develop mitigation

three key bottlenecks in near-term quantum computers: bandwidth restrictions
arising from data transfer between central processing units (CPUs) and quantum
processing units (QPUs), latency delays in the hardware for round-trip
communication, and timing restrictions driven by high error rates. In each case
we consider a near-term quantum algorithm to highlight the bottleneck:
randomised benchmarking to showcase bandwidth limitations, adaptive noisy,
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ)-era algorithms for the latency bottleneck and
quantum error correction techniques to highlight the restrictions imposed by
qubit error rates. In all three cases we discuss how these bottlenecks arise in
the current paradigm of executing all the classical computation on the CPU, and
how these can be mitigated by providing access to local classical computational
resources in the QPU.

dynamics (also known as the contact process) on populations modelled by
homogeneous Poisson point processes of the Euclidean plane, where the infection
rate of a susceptible individual is proportional to the number of infected
individuals in a disc around it. The main focus of the paper is a model where
points are also subject to some random motion. Conservation equations for
moment measures are leveraged to analyze the stationary regime of the point
processes of infected and susceptible individuals. A heuristic factorization of
the third moment measure is then proposed to obtain simple polynomial equations
allowing one to derive closed form approximations for the fraction of infected
individuals in the steady state. These polynomial equations also lead to a
phase diagram which tentatively delineates the regions of the space of
parameters (population density, infection radius, infection and recovery rate,
and motion rate) where the epidemic survives and those where there is
extinction. A key take-away from this phase diagram is that the extinction of
the epidemic is not always aided by a decrease in the motion rate. These
results are substantiated by simulations on large two dimensional tori. These
simulations show that the polynomial equations accurately predict the fraction
of infected individuals when the epidemic survives. The simulations also show
that the proposed phase diagram accurately predicts the parameter regions where
the mean survival time of the epidemic increases (resp. decreases) with motion
rate.

injected in a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical jet subject
to current driven kink instability (CDKI), which drives turbulence and fast
magnetic reconnection. Test protons injected in the nearly stationary snapshots
of the jet, experience an exponential acceleration up to a maximum energy. For
a background magnetic field of $B \sim 0.1$ G, this saturation energy is $\sim
10^{16}$ eV, while for $B \sim 10$ G it is $\sim 10^{18}$ eV. The simulations
also reveal a clear association of the accelerated particles with the regions
of fast reconnection. In the early stages of the development of the non-linear
growth of CDKI in the jet, when there are still no sites of fast reconnection,
injected particles are also efficiently accelerated, but by magnetic curvature
drift in the wiggling jet spine. However, they have to be injected with an
initial energy much larger than that required for particles to accelerate in
reconnection sites. Finally, we have also obtained from the simulations an
acceleration time due to reconnection with a weak dependence on the particles
energy $E$, $t_A \propto E^{0.1}$. The energy spectrum of the accelerated
particles develops a high energy tail with a power law index $p \sim$ -1.2 in
the beginning of the acceleration, in agreement with earlier works. Our results
provide an appropriate multi-dimensional framework for exploring this process
in real systems and explain their complex emission patterns, specially in the
very high energy bands and the associated neutrino emission recently detected

behaviour in horizonless microstate geometries. This question is complicated by
the fact that Lyapunov growth of OTOCs requires nonzero temperature, whereas
constructions of microstate geometries have been mostly restricted to extremal
black holes.
  In this paper, we compute OTOCs for a class of extremal black holes, namely
maximally rotating BTZ black holes, and show that on average they display ""slow

Superposed on this average power-law growth is a sawtooth pattern, whose steep
parts correspond to brief periods of Lyapunov growth associated to the nonzero
temperature of the right-moving degrees of freedom in a dual conformal field
theory.
  Next we study the extent to which these OTOCs are modified in certain
""superstrata"", horizonless microstate geometries corresponding to these black
holes. Rather than an infinite throat ending on a horizon, these geometries
have a very deep but finite throat ending in a cap. We find that the
superstrata display the same slow scrambling as maximally rotating BTZ black
holes, except that for large enough time intervals the growth of the OTOC is
cut off by effects related to the cap region, some of which we evaluate
explicitly.

this problem by means of theoretical analysis and simulations of elastoplastic

the usually assumed form $P(x)\sim x^\theta$ (with $\theta$ being the so-called

tends to a system-size-dependent \textit{finite} limit as $x\to 0$. We work out

random-walks and disclosing an alternative interpretation of the mechanical
noise felt by a reference site. We test our predictions in two- and
three-dimensional elastoplastic models, showing the crucial influence of the

which restricts the degree of delocalization of the eigenstates and leads to

repressing each other unidirectionally resulting in the emergence of a limit

bacteria creating the synthetic genetic oscillator known as the Repressilator.
Here, we consider the main collective modes produced when two identical
Repressilators are mean-field coupled via the quorum sensing (QS) mechanism
which is realized via production of diffusive signal molecules. Using the rate
of the repressor's production and the value of coupling strength as the
bifurcation parameters, we performed analysis of dynamical regimes starting
from the two Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of unstable homogeneous steady state,
which generate in-phase and anti-phase limit cycles. Pitchfork bifurcation of
the unstable in-phase cycle leads to creation of inhomogeneous limit cycles
with very different amplitudes in contrast to well-known asymmetrical limit
cycles arising from oscillation death. Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of the
anti-phase cycle determines the border of an island in two-parameter space
containing almost all the interesting regimes including the set of resonant
limit cycles, the area with stable inhomogenous cycle, and very large areas
with chaotic regimes resulting from torus destruction, period doubling of
resonant cycles and inhomogenous cycles. We discuss the structure of chaos
skeleton to show the role of inhomogeneous cycles in its formation. Many
regions of multistability and transitions between regimes are presented. These
results provide new insights into the coupling-dependent mechanisms of
multistability and collective regime symmetry breaking in populations of

Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based self remedy approach,
named SREC-DRL, is proposed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction
scores for a certain period within which at least one UAV will quit the
network. To handle the continuous state and action space in the problem, the

the Scorpius-Centaurus OB2 association. Our observations utilized VLT/SPHERE
between 2015$-$2019, enabling low-resolution spectroscopy (0.95$-$1.65 $\mu
m$), dual-band imaging (2.1$-$2.25 $\mu m$), and relative astrometry over a
four-year baseline. HIP 75056Ab is consistent with spectral types in the range
of M6$-$L2 and $T_{\rm eff}\sim$ 2000$-$2600 K. A comparison of the companion's
brightness to evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of $\sim$20$-$30 M$_{Jup}$.
The astrometric measurements are consistent with an orbital semi-major axis of
$\sim$15$-$45 au and an inclination close to face-on (i$\lesssim$35$^o$). In
this range of mass and orbital separation, HIP 75056Ab is likely at the
low-mass end of the distribution of companions formed via disk instability,
although a formation of the companion via core accretion cannot be excluded.
The orbital constraints are consistent with the modest eccentricity values
predicted by disk instability, a scenario that can be confirmed by further
astrometric monitoring. HIP 75056Ab may be utilized as a low-mass atmospheric
comparison to older, higher-mass brown dwarfs, and also to young giant planets.
Finally, the detection of HIP 75056Ab at 0.125 arcsec represents a milestone in
detecting low-mass companions at separations corresponding to the habitable
zones of nearby Sun-like stars.

periodicities in two dimensions (2D) are of interest to crystallographers and
practitioners of computer vision studies alike. Currently, these
classifications are typically made by both communities in a subjective manner
that relies on arbitrary thresholds for judgments, and are reported under the
pretense of being definitive, which is impossible. Moreover, the computer
vision community tends to use direct space methods to make such classifications
instead of more powerful and computationally efficient Fourier space methods.
This is because the proper functioning of those methods requires more periodic
repeats of a unit cell motif than are commonly present in images analyzed by
the computer vision community. We demonstrate a novel approach to plane
symmetry group classifications that is enabled by Kenichi Kanatani's Geometric
Akaike Information Criterion and associated Geometric Akaike weights. Our
approach leverages the advantages of working in Fourier space, is well suited
for handling the hierarchic nature of crystallographic symmetries, and yields
probabilistic results that are generalized noise level dependent. The latter
feature means crystallographic symmetry classifications can be updated when
less noisy image data and more accurate processing algorithms become available.
We demonstrate the ability of our approach to objectively estimate the plane
symmetry and pseudosymmetries of sets of synthetic 2D-periodic images with
varying amounts of red-green-blue and spread noise. Additionally, we suggest a
simple solution to the problem of too few periodic repeats in an input image
for practical application of Fourier space methods. In doing so, we effectively
solve the decades-old and heretofore intractable problem from computer vision
of symmetry detection and classification from images in the presence of noise.

the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for compressed sensing,
where we reconstruct an unknown structured signal from its underdetermined
linear measurements. The derivation of the proposed method is based on the
recently developed convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT), which can be applied
to various convex optimization problems to obtain its asymptotic error
performance. Our main idea is to analyze the convex subproblem in the update of
ADMM iteratively and characterize the asymptotic distribution of the tentative
estimate obtained at each iteration. However, since the original CGMT cannot be
used directly for the analysis of the iterative updates, we intuitively assume
an extended version of CGMT in the derivation of the proposed method. Under the
assumption, the result shows that the update equations in ADMM can be decoupled
into a scalar-valued stochastic process in the asymptotic regime with the large
system limit. From the asymptotic result, we can predict the evolution of the
error (e.g., mean-square-error (MSE) and symbol error rate (SER)) in ADMM for
large-scale compressed sensing problems. Simulation results show that the
empirical performance of ADMM and its prediction are close to each other in
sparse vector reconstruction and binary vector reconstruction.

performance, and is an alternative to high-complexity (CRC)-aided SC-List
(CA-SCL) decoding. However, the performance improvement of SCF is limited since
it can correct up to only one channel error ($\omega=1$). Dynamic SCF (DSCF)
algorithm tackles this problem by tackling multiple errors ($\omega \geq 1$),
but it requires logarithmic and exponential computations, which make it
infeasible for practical applications. In this work, we propose simplifications
and approximations to make DSCF practically feasible. First, we reduce the
transcendental computations of DSCF decoding to a constant approximation. Then,
we show how to incorporate special node decoding techniques into DSCF
algorithm, creating the Fast-DSCF decoding. Next, we reduce the search span
within the special nodes to further reduce the computational complexity.
Following, we describe a hardware architecture for the Fast-DSCF decoder, in
which we introduce additional simplifications such as metric normalization and
sorter length reduction. All the simplifications and approximations are shown
to have minimal impact on the error-correction performance, and the reported
Fast-DSCF decoder is the only SCF-based architecture that can correct multiple
errors. The Fast-DSCF decoders synthesized using TSMC $65$nm CMOS technology
can achieve a $1.25$, $1.06$ and $0.93$ Gbps throughput for $\omega \in

with equivalent FER performance, the proposed decoders are up to $5.8\times$
more area-efficient. Finally, observations at energy dissipation indicate that
the Fast-DSCF is more energy-efficient than its CA-SCL-based counterparts.

such HR-graphs of level 3 exist.
  In this paper we show how the theory of Coxeter groups, and abstract regular
polytopes and their generalisations, can lead to such graphs. Given a Coxeter
system $(W,S)$ and a subset $M$ of $S$, we construct highly regular quotients
of the 1-skeleton of the associated Wythoffian polytope $\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$,
which form an infinite family of expander graphs when $(W,S)$ is indefinite and
$\mathcal{P}_{W,M}$ has finite vertex links. The regularity of the graphs in
this family can be deduced from the Coxeter diagram of $(W,S)$. The expansion
stems from applying superapproximation to the congruence subgroups of the
linear group $W$.
  This machinery gives a rich collection of families of HR-graphs, with various
interesting properties, and in particular answers affirmatively the question
asked by Chapman, Linial and Peled.

resolved overdensity of old ($\tau > 13.3\text{ Gyr}$) and metal-poor (${\rm
[Fe/H]} = -2.0_{-0.5}^{+0.2}$ dex) stars with a projected half-light radius of
$r_{1/2} = 21^{+4}_{-3}\text{ pc}$ and an absolute magnitude of $M_V =
-2.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\text{ mag}$. The size and luminosity of DELVE 2 are
consistent with both the population of recently discovered ultra-faint globular
clusters and the smallest ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. However, its age and
metallicity would place it among the oldest and most metal-poor globular
clusters in the Magellanic system. DELVE 2 is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear
proper motion signal, with multiple blue horizontal branch stars near the
centroid of the system with proper motions consistent with the systemic mean.
We measure the system proper motion to be $(\mu_{\alpha} \cos \delta,
\mu_{\delta})= (1.02_{-0.25}^{+0.24}, -0.85_{-0.19}^{+0.18})$ mas yr$^{-1}$. We

dialogues is a crucial but challenging task in computational linguistics.
Advancement made in this area is critical for dialogue system design and
discourse analysis. It can also be extended to solve grammatical inference. In
this work, we propose to incorporate structured attention layers into a
Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) model with discrete latent states
to learn dialogue structure in an unsupervised fashion. Compared to a vanilla
VRNN, structured attention enables a model to focus on different parts of the
source sentence embeddings while enforcing a structural inductive bias.
Experiments show that on two-party dialogue datasets, VRNN with structured
attention learns semantic structures that are similar to templates used to
generate this dialogue corpus. While on multi-party dialogue datasets, our
model learns an interactive structure demonstrating its capability of
distinguishing speakers or addresses, automatically disentangling dialogues
without explicit human annotation.

10~nm. Here, we demonstrate polariton-mediated coupling and energy transfer
between excitonic states over a distance exceeding 2~$\mu$m. We accomplish this
by coupling quantum well-confined excitons through the delocalized mode of two
coupled optical microcavities. Use of magnetically doped quantum wells enables
us to tune the confined exciton energy by the magnetic field and in this way to
control the spatial direction of the transfer. Such controlled, long-distance

imaging and structured binary imaging via the Walsh--Hadamard transform -- we
derive uniform recovery guarantees asserting stable and robust recovery for
arbitrary random sampling strategies. Using this, we then derive a class of
theoretically-optimal sampling strategies. For Fourier sampling, we show
recovery of an image with approximately $s$-sparse gradient from $m \gtrsim_d s
\cdot \log^2(s) \cdot \log^4(N)$ measurements, in $d \geq 1$ dimensions. When
$d = 2$, this improves the current state-of-the-art result by a factor of

For Walsh sampling, we prove that $m \gtrsim_d s \cdot \log^2(s) \cdot

the best of our knowledge, this is the first recovery guarantee for structured

exhibit a nondegenerate Majorana bound state at the Fermi level at its boundary
with an insulator (where the latter could be an actual insulator material or
vacuum, for a terminated sample). Previous explicit theoretical demonstrations
of this property were done for specific microscopic models of the bulk
Hamiltonian and, most importantly, of the boundary. In this work, we
theoretically demonstrate that this property holds for the whole class of
systems, using the symmetry-based formalism of low-energy continuum models and
general boundary conditions. We derive the general form of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes low-energy Hamiltonian that is subject only to charge-conjugation
symmetry $\mathcal{C}_+$ of the type $\mathcal{C}_+^2=+1$ and a few minimal
assumptions. Crucially, we also derive the most general form of the boundary
conditions describing the boundary with an insulator, subject only to the
fundamental principle of the probability-current conservation and
$\mathcal{C}_+$ symmetry. Such {\em normal-reflection} boundary conditions do
not contain scattering between electrons and holes. We find that for odd number
of Fermi surfaces a Majorana bound state always exists as long as the bulk is
in the gapped superconducting state, irrespective of the parameters of the bulk
Hamiltonian and boundary conditions. Importantly, our general model includes a
possible {\em Fermi-point mismatch}, when the two Fermi points are not at
exactly opposite momenta, which disfavors superconductivity. We find that the
Fermi-point mismatch does {\em not} have a direct destructive effect on the
Majorana bound state, in the sense that once the bulk gap is opened the bound
state is always present.

approach to the analysis of high-resolution synthetic mammograms from digital
breast tomosynthesis screening cases, and to assess the effect on accuracy of
image resolution and training set size. Materials and Methods: In a
retrospective study, 21,264 screening digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) exams
obtained at our institution were collected along with associated radiology
reports. The 2D synthetic mammographic images from these exams, with varying
resolutions and data set sizes, were used to train a multi-view deep
convolutional neural network (MV-CNN) to classify screening images into BI-RADS
classes (BI-RADS 0, 1 and 2) before evaluation on a held-out set of exams.
  Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for
BI-RADS 0 vs non-BI-RADS 0 class was 0.912 for the MV-CNN trained on the full
dataset. The model obtained accuracy of 84.8%, recall of 95.9% and precision of
95.0%. This AUC value decreased when the same model was trained with 50% and
25% of images (AUC = 0.877, P=0.010 and 0.834, P=0.009 respectively). Also, the
performance dropped when the same model was trained using images that were
under-sampled by 1/2 and 1/4 (AUC = 0.870, P=0.011 and 0.813, P=0.009

  Conclusion: This deep learning model classified high-resolution synthetic
mammography scans into normal vs needing further workup using tens of thousands
of high-resolution images. Smaller training data sets and lower resolution
images both caused significant decrease in performance.

used in modern energy conversion devices. The realization of high coercivity at
finite temperatures is a burning issue. One of the important ingredients for
controlling the coercive force is the surface property of magnetic grains. It
has been reported by first-principles studies that the Nd atoms in the first
(001) surface layer facing the vacuum have in-plane anisotropy perpendicular to
the $c$ axis, which may decrease the coercivity. Focusing on the surface
anisotropy effect on the coercivity, we examine the coercivity at zero and
finite temperatures by using an atomistic model reflecting the lattice
structure of the Nd magnet with a stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
method. We study general three cases, in which the Nd atoms in surface layers
have (1) no anisotropy, (2) in-plane anisotropy, and (3) reinforced anisotropy
for two types of surfaces, (001) and (100) surfaces. We find that in contrast
to the zero-temperature case, due to the thermal fluctuation effect, the
modification of only the first surface layer has little effect on the
coercivity at finite temperatures. However, the modification of a few layers
results in significant effects. We discuss the details of the dependence of the
coercivity on temperature, type of surface, and modified layer depth, and also
the features of domain growth in magnetization reversal.

piecewise constant signals, few methods are available to capture these changes

detection method, PRUTF, based on trend filtering. By providing a comprehensive
dual solution path for trend filtering, PRUTF allows us to discover change
points of the underlying signal for either a given value of the regularization
parameter or a specific number of steps of the algorithm. We demonstrate that
the dual solution path constitutes a Gaussian bridge process that enables us to
derive an exact and efficient stopping rule for terminating the search
algorithm. We also prove that the estimates produced by this algorithm are
asymptotically consistent in pattern recovery. This result holds even in the
case of staircases (consecutive change points of the same sign) in the signal.
Finally, we investigate the performance of our proposed method for various

generalized mirror descent (GMD), a generalization of mirror descent with a
possibly time-dependent mirror. GMD subsumes popular first order optimization

extended naturally from GMD to stochastic GMD, we present a Taylor-series based

existence of an interpolating solution and convergence of GMD to this solution.

the planet 47 Uma b, using the to-date most realistic simulator SISTER to
estimate the uncertainties due to residual starlight, solar glint, and
exozodiacal light. We then use the Bayesian retrieval algorithm ExoReL$^\Re$ to
determine the constraints on the atmospheric properties from observations using
a Roman- or HabEx-like telescope, comparing the strategies to observe at
multiple orbital phases or in multiple wavelength bands. With a $\sim20\%$
bandwidth in 600 - 800 nm on a Roman-like telescope, the retrieval finds a
degenerate scenario with a lower gas abundance and a deeper or absent cloud
than the truth. Repeating the observation at a different orbital phase or at a
second $20\%$ wavelength band in 800 - 1000 nm, with the same integration time
and thus degraded S/N, would effectively eliminate this degenerate solution.
Single observation with a HabEx-like telescope would yield high-precision
constraints on the gas abundances and cloud properties, without the degenerate
scenario. These results are also generally applicable to high-contrast
spectroscopy with a coronagraph with a similar wavelength coverage and S/N, and
can help design the wavelength bandwidth and the observation plan of exoplanet

generation by photon number measurement in one mode of arbitrary two-mode
Gaussian states, which is a generalization of conventional photon subtraction,
and derive the conditions to generate high-fidelity and large-amplitude cat
states. Our method relaxes the constraints on experimental parameters, allowing
us to optimize them and attain a high generation rate. Supposing realistic
experimental conditions, the generation rate of cat states with large
amplitudes ($|\alpha| \ge 2)$ can exceed megacounts per second, about $10^3$ to
$10^6$ times better than typical rates of conventional photon subtraction. This
rate would be improved further by the progress of related technologies. Ability
to generate non-Gaussian states at a high rate is important in quantum
computing using optical continuous variables, where scalable computing
platforms have been demonstrated but preparation of non-Gaussian states of

the limited zonal extent of the AEJ is an impediment to AEW development. We
construct a series of basic states using global reanalysis fields and
initialize waves via transient heating over West Africa. The dominant response
is a localized wavepacket that disperses upstream and downstream. The inclusion
of a crude representation of boundary layer damping stabilizes the waves in
most cases. In some basic states, however, exponential growth occurs even in
the presence of damping. This shows that AEWs can occasionally emerge
spontaneously. The key result is that the wavepacket in almost all cases
remains within the AEJ instead of being swept away. Drawing from other studies,
this also suggests that even the damped waves can grow if coupled with
additional sources of energy such as moist convection and dust radiative
feedback. The wavepacket in the localized AEJ appears to satisfy a condition
for absolute instability, a form of spatial hydrodynamic instability. However,
this needs to be verified more rigorously. Our results also suggest that the
intermittent nature of AEWs is mediated, not by transitions between convective
and absolute instability, but likely by external sources such as propagating
equatorial wave modes

studied due to the low cost of the pixel-level annotation for synthetic data.
The most common approaches try to generate images or features mimicking the
distribution in the target domain while preserving the semantic contents in the
source domain so that a model can be trained with annotations from the latter.
However, such methods highly rely on an image translator or feature extractor
trained in an elaborated mechanism including adversarial training, which brings
in extra complexity and instability in the adaptation process. Furthermore,
these methods mainly focus on taking advantage of the labeled source dataset,
leaving the unlabeled target dataset not fully utilized. In this paper, we
propose a bidirectional style-induced domain adaptation method, called BiSIDA,
that employs consistency regularization to efficiently exploit information from
the unlabeled target domain dataset, requiring only a simple neural style
transfer model. BiSIDA aligns domains by not only transferring source images
into the style of target images but also transferring target images into the
style of source images to perform high-dimensional perturbation on the
unlabeled target images, which is crucial to the success in applying
consistency regularization in segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments show

compact binaries, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, X-ray binaries, pulsars, novae,
cataclysmic variables, hot subdwarf stars, barium stars, and blue stragglers.
To study the evolution of binary populations and the consequent formation of
these objects, many methods have been developed over the years, of which a
robust approach named binary population synthesis (BPS) warrants special
attention. This approach has seen widespread use in many areas of astrophysics,
including but not limited to analyses of the stellar content of galaxies,
research on galactic chemical evolution, and studies concerning star formation
and cosmic re-ionization. In this review, we discuss the role of BPS, its
general picture, and the various components that comprise it. We pay special
attention to the stability criteria for mass transfer in binaries, as this
stability largely determines the fate of binary systems. We conclude with our
perspectives regarding the future of this field.

Using nice properties of the permutations of Carlitz form, we present the
complete list of permutations of Carlitz rank 3 having the boomerang uniformity

of permutations of Carlitz rank 3. We also provide, up to affine equivalence,

accesses to coarse video-level language description annotation without temporal
boundary, which is more consistent with reality as such weak labels are more
readily available in practice. In this paper, we propose a \emph{Boundary
Adaptive Refinement} (BAR) framework that resorts to reinforcement learning

the best of our knowledge, we offer the first attempt to extend RL to temporal
localization task with weak supervision. As it is non-trivial to obtain a
straightforward reward function in the absence of pairwise granular
boundary-query annotations, a cross-modal alignment evaluator is crafted to
measure the alignment degree of segment-query pair to provide tailor-designed
rewards. This refinement scheme completely abandons traditional sliding window
based solution pattern and contributes to acquiring more efficient,
boundary-flexible and content-aware grounding results. Extensive experiments on
two public benchmarks Charades-STA and ActivityNet demonstrate that BAR
outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised method and even beats some

intermediate n-heptane droplets (e.g. 20 um) are consumed in or behind the
detonation wave, with the escaped ones be continuously evaporated and
deflagrated. The droplet distributions in the RDE combustor are significantly
affected by the droplet evaporation behaviors. Mixed premixed and non-premixed
combustion modes are seen in two-phase RDC. The detonated fuel fraction is high
when the droplet diameters are small or large, reaching its minimal value with
diameter being 20 um. The detonation propagation speed decreases with increased
droplet diameter and is almost constant when the diameter is larger (> 30 um).
The velocity deficits are 2-18% compared to the respective gaseous cases.
Moreover, the propagation speed increases as the total equivalence ratio
increases for the same droplet diameter. It is also found that the detonation
propagation speed and detonated fuel fraction are considerably affected by the
pre-vaporized gas equivalence ratio. The specific impulse first decreases for
cases with initial diameter less than 5 {\mu}m, then increases with droplet
diameter between 5 {\mu}m and 20 {\mu}m, and finally decreases with droplet

magnitude, $\delta$V, between the component stars to be 1.07 mag, the late-type
component being the brighter; we could thence calculate radii and luminosities

tracks. The best-fitting tracks indicated masses of 2.9\,\msun~for the giant

given by the SB2 orbit. The track for the dwarf star confirms that this
component has begun to evolve away from the ZAMS. Fitting the corresponding
isochrone to those H--R diagram positions indicated a log\,(age) of the system
of approximately 8.60 Gyr since the cool star evolved from the ZAMS, which is a
little younger than the ages deduced for many cool giants. We also detected the

(QSL)-like state is stabilized in certain frustrated quantum magnets in two and
three dimensions. In order to clarify the nature of this gapless QSL-like
state, we investigate both zero- and finite-temperature properties of the
random-bond one-dimensional (1D) $s=12$ Heisenberg model with the competing
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions,
$J_1$ and $J_2$, by means of the exact diagonalization, density-matrix
renormalization-group and Hams--de Raedt methods. We find that, on increasing
the frustration $J_2$, the gapless nonmagnetic state stabilized in the
unfrustrated model with $J_2=0$, the {\it unfrustrated\} random-singlet (RS)
state, exhibits a phase transition into different gapless nonmagnetic state,
the {\it frustrated\} RS state. This frustrated RS state in 1D has properties
quite similar to the randomness-induced QSL-like state recently identified in
2D and 3D frustrated magnets exhibiting the $T$-linear low-temperature ($T$)
specific heat, while the unfrustrated RS state is more or less specific to the
unfrustrated 1D system exhibiting the $\sim 1(\log T)^3$ low-$T$ specific heat.
Universal features and the robustness against perturbations of the frustrated

energy sharing"" is a new form of P2P economy in the energy sector, which allows
users to establish longer-term sharing arrangements of their local energy
resources (e.g., rooftop PVs, home batteries) with joint optimized energy
management. In such a P2P setting, a coalition of users is formed for sharing
resources in a decentralized manner by self-interested users based on their
individual preferences. A likely outcome of decentralized coalition formation
will be a stable coalition structure, where no group of users could
cooperatively opt out to form another coalition that induces higher preferences
to all its members. Remarkably, there exist a number of fair cost-sharing
mechanisms (e.g., equal-split, proportional-split, egalitarian and Nash
bargaining solutions of bargaining games) that model practical cost-sharing
applications with desirable properties, such as the existence of a stable
coalition structure with a small strong price-of-anarchy (SPoA) to approximate
the social optimum. In this paper, we provide general results of decentralized
coalition formation: (1) We establish a logarithmic lower bound on SPoA, and
hence, show several previously known fair cost-sharing mechanisms are the best
practical mechanisms with minimal SPoA. (2) We show that the SPoA of
egalitarian and Nash bargaining cost-sharing mechanisms to match the lower
bound. (3) We derive the SPoA of a mix of different cost-sharing mechanisms.
(4) We present a decentralized algorithm to form a stable coalition structure.
(5) Finally, we apply our general results to P2P energy sharing and present an
empirical study of decentralized coalition formation in a real-world project.
We study the empirical SPoA, which is observed within 95% of the social optimal
cost with coalitions of 2 and 3 users, via fair cost-sharing mechanisms.

explanations of common machine learning models can be computed efficiently. In
this paper, we establish the complexity of computing the SHAP explanation in
three important settings. First, we consider fully-factorized data
distributions, and show that the complexity of computing the SHAP explanation
is the same as the complexity of computing the expected value of the model.
This fully-factorized setting is often used to simplify the SHAP computation,
yet our results show that the computation can be intractable for commonly used
models such as logistic regression. Going beyond fully-factorized
distributions, we show that computing SHAP explanations is already intractable
for a very simple setting: computing SHAP explanations of trivial classifiers
over naive Bayes distributions. Finally, we show that even computing SHAP over
the empirical distribution is #P-hard.

high frequency, and to check if nulling is caused by a global change of pulsar
magnetosphere. 20 bright pulsars are observed at 2250~MHz with unprecedented
lengths of time by using Jiamusi 66m telescope. Nulling fractions of these
pulsars are estimated, and the null and emission states of pulses are
identified. Nulling degrees and scales of the emission-null pairs are
calculated to describe the distributions of emission and null lengths. Three
pulsars, PSRs J0248+6021, J0543+2329 and J1844+00, are found to null for the
first time. The details of null-to-emission and emission-to-null transitions
within pulse window are first observed for PSR J1509+5531, which is a small
probability event. A complete cycle of long nulls for hours is observed for PSR
J1709-1640. For most of these pulsars, the K-S tests of nulling degrees and
nulling scales reject the hypothesis that null and emission are of random
processes at high significance levels. Emission-null sequences of some pulsars
exhibit quasi-periodic, low-frequency or featureless modulations, which might
be related to different origins. During transitions between emission and null
states, pulse intensities have diverse tendencies for variations. Significant
correlations are found for nulling fraction, nulling cadence and nulling scales
with the energy loss rate of the pulsars. Combined with the nulling fractions
reported in literatures for 146 nulling pulsars, we found that statistically
large nulling fractions are more tightly related to pulsar period than to
characteristic age or energy loss rate.

of elements whose distances are shorter than some distance variable, termed
cutoff distance, are taken into account in the computation of transfer
entropies. The prediction performance in capturing the underlying interaction
domain is subject to noise level exerted on the elements and the sufficiency of
statistics of the interaction events. In this paper, the dependence of the
prediction performance is scrutinized systematically on noise level and the
length of trajectories by using a modified Vicsek model. The larger the noise
level and the shorter the time length of trajectories, the more the derivative
of average transfer entropy fluctuates, which makes it difficult to identify
the interaction domain in terms of the position of global minimum of the
derivative of average transfer entropy. A measure to quantify the degree of
strong convexity at coarse-grained level is proposed. It is shown that the
convexity score scheme can identify the interaction distance fairly well even
while the position of global minimum of the derivative of average transfer
entropy does not. We also derive an analytical model to explain the
relationship between the interaction domain and the change of transfer entropy

transmission takes place over a binary-input memoryless output-symmetric
channel. Our study stems from the consideration of constructing universal
capacity-achieving codes under low-complexity decoding algorithms, where
universality refers to the fact that we are considering a family of channels
with equal capacity. Consider, e.g., the right-regular sequence by Shokrollahi
and the heavy-tail Poisson sequence by Luby $\textit{et al}$. Both sequences
are provably capacity-achieving under belief propagation (BP) decoding when
transmission takes place over the binary erasure channel (BEC).
  In this paper we show that many existing capacity-achieving sequences of LDPC
codes are not universal under BP decoding. We reveal that the key to showing
this non-universality result is determined by the stability of the underlying
codes. More concretely, for an ordered and complete channel family and a
sequence of LDPC code ensembles, we determine a stability threshold associated
with them, which further gives rise to a sufficient condition such that the
sequence is not universal under BP decoding. Furthermore, we show that the same
stability threshold applies to blockwise or bitwise MAP decoding as well. We
present how stability can determine an upper bound on the corresponding

while the approaching jet shows the small ring-image inside them. The synthetic
observation image assuming the EHT 2017 array is consistent with that observed
in M87, because the array is a bit sparse to detect the inner ring image. This
indicates that the ring image in M87 might contain the important feature of the

is converted to the Langevin equation in the presence of the fluctuation

about the internal structure of the stars. This is especially true for twin
binaries consisting of two nearly identical stars. We make use of the tidally
induced apsidal motion in the twin binary HD152248 to infer constraints on the
internal structure of the O7.5 III-II stars composing this system. We build
stellar evolution models with the code Cl\'es assuming different prescriptions
for the internal mixing occurring inside the stars. We identify the models that
best reproduce the observationally determined present-day properties of the
components of HD152248, as well as their $k_2$, and the apsidal motion rate of
the system. We analyse the impact of some poorly constrained input parameters,
including overshooting, turbulent diffusion, and metallicity. We further build
'single' and 'binary' GENEC models that account for stellar rotation to
investigate the impacts of binarity and rotation. We discuss some effects that
could bias our interpretation of the apsidal motion in terms of the internal
structure constant. Reproducing the observed $k_2$ value and rate of apsidal
motion simultaneously with the other stellar parameters requires a significant
amount of internal mixing or enhanced mass-loss. The results suggest that a
single-star evolution model is sufficient to describe the physics inside this
binary system. Qualitatively, the high turbulent diffusion required to
reproduce the observations could be partly attributed to stellar rotation.
Higher-order terms in the apsidal motion are negligible. Only a very severe
misalignment of the rotation axes could significantly impact the rate of
apsidal motion, but such a high misalignment is highly unlikely in such a
binary system. We infer an age estimate of $5.15\pm0.13$ Myr for the binary and
initial masses of $32.8\pm0.6$ M$_\odot$ for both stars.

in various speech processing tasks. Particularly, it has been shown that a
monaural speech separation task can be successfully solved with a DNN-based
method called deep clustering (DC), which uses a DNN to describe the process of
assigning a continuous vector to each time-frequency (TF) bin and measure how
likely each pair of TF bins is to be dominated by the same speaker. In DC, the
DNN is trained so that the embedding vectors for the TF bins dominated by the
same speaker are forced to get close to each other. One concern regarding DC is
that the embedding process described by a DNN has a black-box structure, which
is usually very hard to interpret. The potential weakness owing to the
non-interpretable black-box structure is that it lacks the flexibility of
addressing the mismatch between training and test conditions (caused by
reverberation, for instance). To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we
propose the concept of explainable deep clustering (X-DC), whose network
architecture can be interpreted as a process of fitting learnable spectrogram
templates to an input spectrogram followed by Wiener filtering. During
training, the elements of the spectrogram templates and their activations are
constrained to be non-negative, which facilitates the sparsity of their values
and thus improves interpretability. The main advantage of this framework is
that it naturally allows us to incorporate a model adaptation mechanism into
the network thanks to its physically interpretable structure. We experimentally
show that the proposed X-DC enables us to visualize and understand the clues
for the model to determine the embedding vectors while achieving speech
separation performance comparable to that of the original DC models.

simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many
types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic
cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times.
Synapses therefore require continuous information to update their strength
which a priori necessitates a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The
latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and
relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for
archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern
simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically
contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze
advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference
implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two
prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the
Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms
significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of
data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a
strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of
information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency
related to archiving of information provide guidelines for the design of
learning rules in order to make them practically usable in large-scale

finance products initially consisted of idiosyncratic assets issued by local

increasingly centralized and credit instruments were standardized through the
diffusion of the local standards of consecutive leading trading centres

standardization culminated in the nineteenth century when London became the

are reconstructed starting from the vessel source using the learned

mixing and transport processes in the solar accretion disk. These anomalies
have been interpreted to indicate either disk-wide transport of chondrules or
local heterogeneities of chondrule precursors. However, all previous studies
relied on isotopic data for a single element (either Cr, Ti, or O), which does
not allow distinguishing between source and precursor signatures as the cause
of the chondrules isotope anomalies. Here we obtained the first combined O, Ti,
and Cr isotope data for individual chondrules from enstatite, ordinary, and
carbonaceous chondrites. We find that chondrules from non-carbonaceous (NC)
chondrites have relatively homogeneous {\Delta}17O, {\epsilon}50Ti, and
{\epsilon}54Cr, which are similar to the compositions of their host chondrites.
By contrast, chondrules from carbonaceous chondrites (CC) have more variable
compositions. Although the compositions of the analyzed CC and NC chondrules
may overlap for either {\epsilon}50Ti, {\epsilon}54Cr, or {\Delta}17O, in
multi-isotope space none of the CC chondrules plot in the compositional field
of NC chondrites, and no NC chondrule plots within the field of CC chondrites.
As such, our data reveal a fundamental isotopic difference between NC and CC
chondrules, which is inconsistent with a disk-wide transport of chondrules
across and between the NC and CC reservoirs. Instead, the isotopic variations
among CC chondrules reflect local precursor heterogeneities, which most likely
result from mixing between NC-like dust and a chemically diverse dust component
that was isotopically similar to CAIs and AOAs.The same mixing processes, but
on a larger, disk-wide scale, were likely responsible for establishing the
distinct isotopic compositions of the NC and CC reservoirs, which represent in
inner and outer disk, respectively.

geometrically self-similar in terms of height, and the associated turbulence
intensity follows the logarithmic variation in all three flows. Moreover, the
corresponding two-dimensional energy spectra are aligned along a linear
relationship between the streamwise and spanwise wavelengths ($\lambda_x$ and

Thus, we present to regard the discrete weights in an arbitrary quantized

However, these attacks mainly adopted sophisticated fine-tuning techniques,
which have certain fatal drawbacks or unrealistic assumptions. In this paper,

Instead of just fine-tuning the watermarked models, we design a simple yet

the memorization of watermarked models to the watermark samples. We also
introduce a lightweight fine-tuning strategy to preserve the model performance.
Our solution requires much less resource or knowledge about the watermarking

transformation framework, named PSFR-GAN, for face restoration. Specifically,
instead of using an encoder-decoder framework as previous methods, we formulate
the restoration of LQ face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration
procedure through semantic-aware style transformation. Given a pair of LQ face
image and its corresponding parsing map, we first generate a multi-scale
pyramid of the inputs, and then progressively modulate different scale features
from coarse-to-fine in a semantic-aware style transfer way. Compared with
previous networks, the proposed PSFR-GAN makes full use of the semantic
(parsing maps) and pixel (LQ images) space information from different scales of
input pairs. In addition, we further introduce a semantic aware style loss
which calculates the feature style loss for each semantic region individually
to improve the details of face textures. Finally, we pretrain a face parsing
network which can generate decent parsing maps from real-world LQ face images.
Experiment results show that our model trained with synthetic data can not only
produce more realistic high-resolution results for synthetic LQ inputs and but
also generalize better to natural LQ face images compared with state-of-the-art
methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/chaofengc/PSFRGAN.

our universe. They can also trigger the formation of primordial black holes
(PBHs). Such objects could provide the progenitors of the recently detected
black-hole mergers, and constitute part or all of the dark matter. Their
observation would give invaluable access to parts of the inflationary sector
that are unconstrained by the CMB. Since PBHs require large inhomogeneities to
form, they are produced in scenarios where quantum fluctuations substantially
modify the dynamics of the universe. In this habilitation thesis, this
""backreaction"" effect is investigated using the stochastic inflation formalism,
an effective theory for the long-wavelengths of quantum fields during
inflation, which can be described in a classical but stochastic way once the
small wavelengths have been integrated out. It describes an inflating
background that gets randomly corrected by the vacuum quantum fluctuations as
they get stretched to large distances. After a brief review of the stochastic
inflation formalism, we explain how it can be combined with standard techniques
of cosmological perturbation theory (the $\delta N$ formalism) to provide the
full probability density function of curvature perturbations in the presence of
non-perturbative quantum diffusion. These results are then applied to PBHs,
where we show that quantum diffusion can change the expected abundance by
several orders of magnitude. Finally, since inflationary models giving rise to
cosmologically relevant PBHs often feature violations of slow roll, the
stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is generalised to non slow-roll dynamics. We
conclude by highlighting several research directions that remain to be
explored.

bottlenecks that capture context: we want attributes to be in groups of a few
meaningful elements and participate jointly to the final decision. We use a
two-layer semantic bottleneck that gathers attributes into interpretable,

instrument to spectrally resolve (0.24 MHz) these FIR structure lines. With an
observing time of 96h, we will cover $\sim$6700 arcmin$^2$ at 14.1$''$ angular
resolution for the CII line and 6.3$''$ for the OI line. The observations
started in spring 2019 (Cycle 7). Our aim is to understand the dynamics in
regions dominated by different feedback processes from massive stars such as
stellar winds, thermal expansion, and radiation pressure, and to quantify the
mechanical energy injection and radiative heating efficiency. The CII line
provides the kinematics of the gas and is one of the dominant cooling lines of
gas for low to moderate densities and UV fields. The OI line traces warm and
high-density gas, excited in photodissociations regions with a strong UV field
or by shocks. The source sample spans a broad range in stellar characteristics
from single OB stars, to small groups of O stars, to rich young stellar
clusters, to ministarburst complexes. It contains well-known targets such as
Aquila, the Cygnus X region, M16, M17, NGC7538, NGC6334, Vela, and W43 as well
as a selection of HII region bubbles, namely RCW49, RCW79, and RCW120. These
CII maps, together with the less explored OI 63 $\mu$m line, provide an
outstanding database for the community. They will be made publically available

conditions under which quantum contextuality is observed. It is also important
to determine how one can find maximally contextual qutrits. In this work, we
revisit the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario where we
observe a five-measurement state-dependent contextuality. We investigate
possible symmetries of the KCBS pentagram, i.e., the conservation of the
contextual characteristic of a qutrit-system. For this purpose, the KCBS
operator including five cyclic measurements is rotated around the Z-axis. We
then check a set of rotation angles to determine the contextuality and
non-contextuality regions for the eigenstates of the spin-1 operator for an
arbitrary rotation. We perform the same operation for the homogeneous linear

work on the real subgroup of the three dimensional Hilbert space to determine
the set of (non-)contextual states under certain rotations in the physical

superposed with its time-reversal. Unlike the classical homogeneous Green's
function representation, our approach requires no receivers on an enclosing

We demonstrate that in 3D, the single-sided representation is an improvement

a double-couple radiation pattern and compare the results to a directly modeled

of a superposition of double-couple point sources. This is achieved by
obtaining the homogeneous Green's function for each source separately, before
they are transformed to the causal Green's function, time-shifted and
superposed. The single-sided representation is also used to monitor the
complete wavefield that is caused by a numerically modeled rupture. However,
the source signal of an actual rupture is not symmetric in time and the
single-sided represenation can therefore only be used to obtain the causal

attackers can degrade or even manipulate their predictions thorough poisoning

Specifically, we prove that the random selection schemes that satisfy certain

analytical form of the certified radius for the qualified random selection
schemes. The certified radius of bagging derived by our framework is tighter
than the previous work. Our framework allows users to improve robustness by
leveraging prior knowledge about the training set and the poisoning model.
Given higher level of prior knowledge, we can achieve higher certified accuracy

characterize their envelopes and identify the most promising sources that could
be bona fide FHSCs. We identify two candidates which are consistent with an
extremely young evolutionary state (L1451-mm and Cha-MMS1), with L1451-mm being
the most promising FHSC candidate. Although our envelope observations cannot
rule out Cha-MMS1 as a FHSC yet, the properties of its CO outflow and SED
published in recent studies are in better agreement with the predictions for a
young protostar. For the remaining three sources, our observations favor a
prestellar nature for Per-bolo 45 and rule out the rest as FHSC candidates.
Per-bolo 58 is fully consistent with being a Class 0, while L1448 IRS2E shows
no emission of high-density tracers (NH2D and N2H+) at the location of the
previously identified compact continuum source, which is also undetected in our
observations. Thus we argue that there is no embedded source at the presumptive
location of the FHSC candidate L1448 IRS2E. We propose instead, that what was
thought to be emission from the presumed L1448 IRS2E outflow corresponds to
outflow emission from a nearby Class 0 system, deflected by the dense ambient

General Relativity with new light degrees of freedom and hence screened fifth
forces between masses. These forces produce observable signatures in galaxy
morphology, caused by a violation of the weak equivalence principle due to a
differential impact of screening among galaxies' mass components. We compile
statistical datasets of two morphological indicators -- offsets between stars
and gas in galaxies and warping of stellar disks -- and use them to constrain
the strength and range of a thin-shell-screened fifth force. This is achieved
by applying a comprehensive set of upgrades to past work (Desmond et al
2018a,b): we construct a robust galaxy-by-galaxy Bayesian forward model for the
morphological signals, including full propagation of uncertainties in the input
quantities and marginalisation over an empirical model describing astrophysical
noise. Employing more stringent data quality cuts than previously we find no
evidence for a screened fifth force of any strength $\Delta G/G_\text{N}$ in
the Compton wavelength range $0.3-8$ Mpc, setting a $1\sigma$ bound of $\Delta
G/G_\text{N}<0.8$ at $\lambda_C=0.3$ Mpc that strengthens to $\Delta
G/G_\text{N}<3\times10^{-5}$ at $\lambda_C=8$ Mpc. These are the tightest
bounds to date beyond the Solar System by over an order of magnitude. For the
Hu-Sawicki model of $f(R)$ with $n=1$ we require a background scalar field
value $f_{R0} < 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$, forcing practically all astrophysical

systems. Design and optimization of such structures can be carried out by
nonlocal continuum mechanics which is computationally convenient when compared
to atomistic strategies. Bishop's kinematics is able to describe small-scale
thick rods if a proper mathematical model of nonlocal elasticity is formulated
to capture size effects. In all papers on the matter, nonlocal contributions
are evaluated by replacing Eringen's integral convolution with the consequent
(but not equivalent) differential equation governed by Helmholtz's differential
operator. As notorious in integral equation theory, this replacement is
possible for convolutions, defined in unbounded domains, governed by averaging
kernels which are Green's functions of differential operators. Indeed, Eringen
himself, in order to study nonlocal problems defined in unbounded domains, such
as screw dislocations and wave propagations, suggested to replace
integro-differential equations with differential conditions. A different
scenario appears in Bishop rod mechanics where nonlocal integral convolutions
are defined in bounded structural domains, so that Eringen's nonlocal
differential equation has to be supplemented with additional boundary
conditions. The objective is achieved by formulating the governing nonlocal
equations by a proper variational statement. The new methodology provides an
amendment of previous contributions in literature and is illustrated by
investigating the elastostatic behavior of simple structural schemes. Exact
solutions of Bishop rods are evaluated in terms of nonlocal parameter and
cross-section gyration radius. Both hardening and softening structural
responses are predictable with a suitable tuning of the parameters.

  based on occlusion accumulation","7 pages","ICRA 2020 published",,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detection of moving objects is an essential capability in dealing with
dynamic environments. Most moving object detection algorithms have been
designed for color images without depth. For robotic navigation where real-time
RGB-D data is often readily available, utilization of the depth information
would be beneficial for obstacle recognition.
  Here, we propose a simple moving object detection algorithm that uses RGB-D
images. The proposed algorithm does not require estimating a background model.
Instead, it uses an occlusion model which enables us to estimate the camera
pose on a background confused with moving objects that dominate the scene. The
proposed algorithm allows to separate the moving object detection and visual
odometry (VO) so that an arbitrary robust VO method can be employed in a
dynamic situation with a combination of moving object detection, whereas other
VO algorithms for a dynamic environment are inseparable. In this paper, we use
dense visual odometry (DVO) as a VO method with a bi-square regression weight.
Experimental results show the segmentation accuracy and the performance
improvement of DVO in the situations. We validate our algorithm in public
datasets and our dataset which also publicly accessible.

specialisation of the general results to three strain-energy functions which

fire outbreak on a single zone (i.e., on a vertex) with the main consequence of
modifying evacuation paths in two ways. First, an evacuation path cannot pass

modelling a variety of soft biological tissues. Such materials can be regarded
as incompressible, and when the incompressibility condition is adopted the
strain energy \Psi of the HGO model is a function of one isotropic and two
anisotropic deformation invariants. A compressible form (HGO-C model) is widely
used in finite element simulations whereby the isotropic part of \Psi is
decoupled into volumetric and isochoric parts and the anisotropic part of \Psi
is expressed in terms of isochoric invariants. Here, by using three simple
deformations (pure dilatation, pure shear and uniaxial stretch), we demonstrate
that the compressible HGO-C formulation does not correctly model compressible
anisotropic material behaviour, because the anisotropic component of the model
is insensitive to volumetric deformation due to the use of isochoric
anisotropic invariants. In order to correctly model compressible anisotropic
behaviour we present a modified anisotropic (MA) model, whereby the full
anisotropic invariants are used, so that a volumetric anisotropic contribution
is represented. The MA model correctly predicts an anisotropic response to
hydrostatic tensile loading, whereby a sphere deforms into an ellipsoid. It
also computes the correct anisotropic stress state for pure shear and uniaxial
deformation. To look at more practical applications, we developed a finite
element user-defined material subroutine for the simulation of stent deployment
in a slightly compressible artery. Significantly higher stress triaxiality and
arterial compliance are computed when the full anisotropic invariants are used
(MA model) instead of the isochoric form (HGO-C model).

realizations at the receivers is enlarged by the presence of causal noiseless

only passive noisy feedback, when the GBC has identical noise variances at the
receivers. The last fact remains true even when the feedback noise variance is
very high, and available only from one of the receivers. While such capacity
enlargements are feasible for several other feedback models in the Gaussian BC
setting, it is also known that feedback does not change the capacity region for
physically degraded broadcast channels. In this paper, we consider a two user
GBC with independent noise realizations at the receivers, where the feedback
links from the receivers are corrupted by independent additive Gaussian noise
processes. We investigate the set of four noise variances, two forward and two
feedback, for which no capacity enlargement is possible. A sharp
characterization of this region is derived, i.e., any quadruple outside the
presented region will lead to a capacity enlargement, whereas quadruples inside
will leave the capacity region unchanged. Our results lead to the conclusion
that when the forward noise variances are different, too noisy a feedback from
one of the receivers alone is not always beneficial for enlarging the capacity
region, be it from the stronger user or the weaker one, in sharp contrast to
the case of equal forward noise variances.

prove the identity of servers, applications, or users. To be trusted by
operating systems and browsers, a CA has to undergo lengthy and costly
validation processes. Alternatively, trusted CAs can cross-sign other CAs to
extend their trust to them. In this paper, we systematically analyze the
present and past state of cross-signing in the Web PKI. Our dataset (derived
from passive TLS monitors and public CT logs) encompasses more than 7 years and
225 million certificates with 9.3 billion trust paths. We show benefits and
risks of cross-signing. We discuss the difficulty of revoking trusted CA
certificates where, worrisome, cross-signing can result in valid trust paths to
remain after revocation; a problem for non-browser software that often blindly
trusts all CA certificates and ignores revocations. However, cross-signing also
enables fast bootstrapping of new CAs, e.g., Let's Encrypt, and achieves a
non-disruptive user experience by providing backward compatibility. In this
paper, we propose new rules and guidance for cross-signing to preserve its
positive potential while mitigating its risks.

demonstrate impressively that interstellar objects (ISOs) must be common in the

through interstellar space. While often imagined as empty, interstellar space
contains gas and dust most prominent in the form of molecular clouds.
Performing numerical simulations, we test how often ISOs cross such molecular
clouds. We find that the ISOs pass amazingly often through molecular clouds. In
the solar neighbourhood, ISOs typically spend 0.1-0.2% of their journey inside
molecular clouds, for relative slow ISOs ($<$ 5 km/s) this can increase to
1-2%, equivalent to 10 - 20 Myr per Gyr. Thus the dynamically youngest ISOs
spend the longest time in molecular clouds. In other words, molecular clouds
must mainly contain relatively young ISOs ($<$ 1-2 Gyr). Thus the half-life of
the seeding process by ISOs is substantially shorter than a stellar lifetime.
The actual amount of time spent in MCs decreases with distance to the Galactic
Centre. We find that ISOs pass so often through MCs that backtracing their path
to find their parent star beyond 250 Myr seems beyond the point. Besides, we
give a first estimate of the ISO density depending on the galactic centre

alternatives to address point forces, that is, whether to treat the region
covered by the cells that exert forces as part of the computational domain or
as 'holes' in the computational domain. The formalisms develop into the
immersed boundary approach and the 'hole approach', respectively. Consistency
between these approaches is verified in a theoretical setting, but also
confirmed computationally. However, the 'hole approach' is much more expensive
and complicated for its need of mesh adaptation in the case of migrating cells
while it increases the numerical accuracy, which makes it hard to adapt to the
multi-cell model. Therefore, for multiple cells, we consider the polygon that
is used to approximate the boundary of cells that exert contractile forces. It
is found that a low degree of polygons, in particular triangular or square
shaped cell boundaries, already give acceptable results in engineering
precision, so that it is suitable for the situation with a large amount of

investigated three detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs; V2032, V4, and V5) for

stars for which we determined their effective temperatures, surface gravities,
and metallicities. Three of the stars in the DEBs have masses close to the
cluster turn-off mass, allowing for extremely precise age determination.
Comparing the values for the masses and radii of the binaries to BaSTI
isochrones we estimated a cluster age of $2.01 \pm 0.10$ Gyr. This does depend
on the models used in the comparison, where we have found that the inclusion of
convective core-overshooting is necessary to properly model the cluster. From
red giant branch stars we determined values for the effective temperatures, the
surface gravities, and the metallicities. From these we find a cluster
metallicity of $-0.36 \pm 0.10$ dex. Using this value and the values for the
effective temperatures we determine the reddening to be E$(b - y) = 0.057 \pm
0.004$ mag. Furthermore, we derived the distance to the cluster from Gaia
parallaxes and found $3.101 \pm 0.017$ kpc, and we have performed a radial

connect to an additive model on a tangent space. This connection not only
entails an efficient algorithm to estimate the component functions but also
allows to generalize the proposed additive model to general Riemannian
manifolds that might not have a Lie group structure. Optimal asymptotic
convergence rates and normality of the estimated component functions are also
established. Numerical studies show that the proposed model enjoys superior

treat forces that are directed normal to the cell boundary and that are
directed toward the cell centre. Since it can be shown that there exists no
smooth solution, at least not in $H^1$ for solutions to the governing momentum
balance equation, we analyse the convergence and quality of the approximation.
Furthermore, the expected finite element problems that we get necessitate
scrutinizing alternative model formulations, such as the use of smoothed Dirac
distributions, or the so-called smoothed particle approach as well as the
so-called 'hole' approach where cellular forces are modelled through the use of
(natural) boundary conditions. In this paper, we investigate and attempt to
quantify the conditions for consistency between the various approaches. This
has resulted in error analyses in the $H^1$-norm of the numerical solution

also addresses well-posedness in terms of existence and uniqueness. The current
analysis has been performed for the linear steady-state (hence neglecting
inertia and damping) momentum equations under the assumption of Hooke's law.

Cross-entropy and Center loss functions are commonly used to increase the
discriminating power of learned functions and increase the generalization
performance of the model. Center loss minimizes the class intra-class variance
and at the same time penalizes the long distance between the deep features
inside each class. However, the total error of the center loss will be heavily
influenced by the majority of the instances and can lead to a freezing state in
terms of intra-class variance. To address this, we introduce a new loss
function called sigma squared reduction loss ($\sigma^2$R loss), which is
regulated by a sigmoid function to inflate/deflate the error per instance and
then continue to reduce the intra-class variance. Our loss has clear intuition
and geometric interpretation, furthermore, we demonstrate by experiments the

of the Alfven velocity with distance to the disk leads to an efficient generic
mechanism of the turbulent redshift, enhancing CR scattering by the
self-generated MHD waves. As a result, the calculated size of the CR halo at
lower energies is determined by the halo sheath, an energy-dependent region
around the disk beyond which the CR escape becomes purely advective. At
sufficiently high energies, the halo size is set by the characteristic

The main contribution lies in the integration of concepts from the areas of
Bayesian optimization and derivative-free optimization. The proposed schemes
embed a physical model and rely on trust-region ideas to minimize risk during
the exploration, while employing Gaussian process regression to capture the
plant-model mismatch in a non-parametric way and drive the exploration by means
of acquisition functions. The benefits of using an acquisition function,
knowing the process noise level, or specifying a nominal process model are
illustrated on numerical case studies, including a semi-batch photobioreactor

natural language processing (NLP) which encapsulates many fundamental aspects

deep learning methods in NLP tasks, a great amount of effort has been devoted
to develop more diverse datasets for different languages. In this paper, we
present a new dataset for the NLI task in the Persian language, also known as
Farsi, which is one of the dominant languages in the Middle East. This dataset,
named FarsTail, includes 10,367 samples which are provided in both the Persian
language as well as the indexed format to be useful for non-Persian
researchers. The samples are generated from 3,539 multiple-choice questions
with the least amount of annotator interventions in a way similar to the
SciTail dataset. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure
the quality of the dataset. We also present the results of traditional and
state-of-the-art methods on FarsTail including different embedding methods such
as word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as different modeling
approaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT to provide a solid
baseline for the future research. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%
which shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be
useful for real-world NLP applications in different languages. We also
investigate the extent to which the models exploit superficial clues, also
known as dataset biases, in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and
hard subsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is

accurate mathematical models on real-world problems. A promising approach to
overcome this difficulty is to \emph{enumerate} multiple small solutions rather

  In this expository work, we investigate the role of the uniformity of the
random binning distribution from the perspective of the trade-off between the
reliability (defined in terms of the error exponent) and the compression
performance (measured from the viewpoint of the source coding exponent). To
this end, we study a much wider class of random-binning distributions, which
includes the ensemble of VRSW codes as a special case, but it also goes
considerably beyond. We first show that, with the exception of some
pathological cases, the smaller ensemble, of VRSW codes, is as good as the
larger ensemble in terms the trade-off between the error exponent and the
source coding exponent. Notwithstanding this finding, the wider class of
ensembles proposed is motivated in two ways. The first is that it outperforms
VRSW codes in the above-mentioned pathological cases, and the second is that it
allows robustness: in the event of a system failure that causes unavailability
of the compressed bit-stream from one of the sources, it still allows
reconstruction of the other source within some controllable distortion.

which we can only apply as a black-box. In general it is an exponentially-hard
task to decide whether $\tilde{U}$ equals the intended $U$, or is significantly
different in a worst-case norm. In this paper we consider two special cases
where relatively efficient and lightweight procedures exist for this task.
  First, we give an efficient procedure under the assumption that $U$ and
$\tilde{U}$ (both of which we can now apply as a black-box) are either equal,
or differ significantly in only one $k$-qubit gate, where $k=O(1)$ (the $k$
qubits need not be contiguous). Second, we give an even more lightweight
procedure under the assumption that $U$ and $\tilde{U}$ are Clifford circuits
which are either equal, or different in arbitrary ways (the specification of
$U$ is now classically given while $\tilde{U}$ can still only be applied as a
black-box). Both procedures only need to run $\tilde{U}$ a constant number of
times to detect a constant error in a worst-case norm. We note that the
Clifford result also follows from earlier work of Flammia and Liu, and da
Silva, Landon-Cardinal, and Poulin.
  In the Clifford case, our error-detection procedure also allows us
efficiently to learn (and hence correct) $\tilde{U}$ if we have a small list of
possible errors that could have happened to $U$; for example if we know that
only $O(1)$ of the gates of $\tilde{U}$ are wrong, this list will be
polynomially small and we can test each possible erroneous version of $U$ for
equality with $\tilde{U}$.

computation in networks of finite-state agents communicating through pairwise

motivated the adaptation of the original population protocol framework to
better model these chemical systems. In this paper, we further the study of two
such adaptations in the context of solving approximate majority:
persistent-state agents (or catalysts) and spontaneous state changes (or
leaks).
  Based on models considered in recent protocols for populations with
persistent-state agents, we assume a population with $n$ catalytic input agents
and $m$ worker agents, and the goal of the worker agents is to compute some
predicate over the states of the catalytic inputs. We call this model the
Catalytic Input (CI) model. For $m = \Theta(n)$, we show that computing the
exact majority of the input population with high probability requires at least
$\Omega(n^2)$ total interactions, demonstrating a strong separation between the
CI model and the standard population protocol model. On the other hand, we show
that the simple third-state dynamics of Angluin et al. for approximate majority
in the standard model can be naturally adapted to the CI model: we present such
a constant-state protocol for the CI model that solves approximate majority in
$O(n \log n)$ total steps w.h.p. when the input margin is $\Omega(\sqrt{n \log
n})$.
  We then show the robustness of third-state dynamics protocols to the
transient leaks events introduced by Alistarh et al. In both the original and

probability in the presence of leaks occurring at each step with probability
$\beta \leq O\left(\sqrt{n \log n}/n\right)$, exhibiting a resilience to leaks

strength of forensic match evidence. When a forensic expert determines a high
LR for DNA found at a crime scene matching the DNA profile of a suspect they
typically report that 'this provides strong support for the prosecution
hypothesis that the DNA comes from the suspect'. However, even with a high LR,
the evidence might not support the prosecution hypothesis if the defence
hypothesis used to determine the LR is not the negation of the prosecution
hypothesis (such as when the alternative is 'DNA comes from a person unrelated
to the defendant' instead of 'DNA does not come from the suspect'). For DNA
mixture profiles, especially low template DNA (LTDNA), the value of a high LR
for a 'match' - typically computed from probabilistic genotyping software - can
be especially questionable. But this is not just because of the use of
non-exhaustive hypotheses in such cases. In contrast to single profile DNA
'matches', where the only residual uncertainty is whether a person other than
the suspect has the same matching DNA profile, it is possible for all the
genotypes of the suspect's DNA profile to appear at each locus of a DNA
mixture, even though none of the contributors has that DNA profile. In fact, in
the absence of other evidence, we show it is possible to have a very high LR
for the hypothesis 'suspect is included in the mixture' even though the
posterior probability that the suspect is included is very low. Yet, in such
cases a forensic expert will generally still report a high LR as 'strong
support for the suspect being a contributor'. Our observations suggest that, in
certain circumstances, the use of the LR may have led lawyers and jurors into
grossly overestimating the probative value of a LTDNA mixed profile 'match'

very fragile to percolation and first-neighbor failure propagation, but little
is known about how they respond to non-local disruptions, as it occurs in
failures induced by flow redistribution, for example. Acknowledging that many
socio-technical and biological systems sustain a flow of some physical
quantity, such as energy or information, across the their components, it
becomes crucial to understand when the flow redistribution can cause global
cascades of failures in order to design robust systems,to increase their
resilience or to learn how to efficiently dismantle them. In this paper we
study the impact that different multiplex topological features have on the
robustness of the system when subjected to non-local cascade propagation. We
first numerically demonstrate that this dynamics has a critical value at which
a small initial perturbation effectively dismantles the entire network, and
that the transition appears abruptly. Then we identify that the excess of flow
caused by a failure is, in general, more homogeneously distributed the networks
in which the average distance between nodes is small.Using this information we
find that aggregated versions of multiplex networks tend to overestimate
robustness, even though to make the system more robust can be achieved by
increasing the number of layers. Our predictions are confirmed by simulated

three different dynamical models taken from literature: Quasi-Equilibrium
Bonnor-Ebert Sphere (QE-BES), Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS), and
Larson-Penston (LP) flow. Our analysis provides an updated picture of the
physical structure of prestellar cores. We find that the SIS model can be
clearly excluded in explaining the gas emission towards the cores, but a larger
sample is required to differentiate clearly between the LP flow, the QE-BES and
the static models. All models of collapse underestimate the intensity of the
gas emission by up to several factors towards the only protostellar core in our
sample, indicating that different dynamics take place in different evolutionary
core stages. If the LP model is confirmed towards a larger sample of prestellar
cores, it would indicate that they may form by compression or accretion of gas
from larger scales. If the QE-BES model is confirmed, it means that quasi

  2020). 5 pages, 2 figures",,,,"nucl-th hep-ex hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on a benchmark calculation of the in-medium radiative energy loss
of low-virtuality jet partons within the EPOS3-Jet framework. The radiative
energy loss is based on an extension of the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element for a
massive projectile and a massive radiated gluon. On top of that, the coherence
(LPM effect) is implemented by assigning a formation phase to the trial
radiated gluons in a fashion similar to the approach in JHEP 07 (2011), 118, by
Zapp, Stachel and Wiedemann. In a calculation with a simplified radiation
kernel, we reproduce the radiation spectrum reported in the approach above. The
radiation spectrum produces the LPM behaviour $dI/d\omega\propto\omega^{-1/2}$
up to an energy $\omega=\omega_c$, when the formation length of radiated gluons
becomes comparable to the size of the medium. Beyond $\omega_c$, the radiation
spectrum shows a characteristic suppression due to a smaller probability for a
gluon to be formed in-medium.
  Next, we embed the radiative energy loss of low-virtuality jet partons into a
more realistic ""parton gun"" calculation, where a stream of hard partons at high
initial energy $E_\text{ini}=100$ GeV and initial virtuality $Q^2=E^2$ passes
through a box of QGP medium with a constant temperature. At the end of the box
evolution, the partons are hadronized using Pythia 8, and the jets are
reconstructed with the FASTJET package. We find that the full jet energy loss
in such scenario approaches a ballpark value reported by the ALICE
collaboration. However, the calculation uses a somewhat larger value of the
coupling constant $\alpha_s$ to compensate for the missing collisional energy
loss of the low-virtuality jet partons.

layers. In contrast to conventional thermoelectric measurements, where a heater
is placed on one side of a sample, we use the InAs NW (diameter $\sim 50$ nm)
as a local heater placed in the middle of the graphene channel. We measure the
thermoelectric voltage induced in graphene due to Joule heating in the NW as a
function of temperature (1.5K - 50K) and carrier concentration. The
thermoelectric voltage in bilayer graphene (BLG)- NW heterostructures shows
sign change around the Dirac point, as predicted by Mott's formula. In
contrast, the thermoelectric voltage measured across monolayer graphene
(MLG)-NW heterostructures shows anomalous large-amplitude oscillations around
the Dirac point, not seen in the Mott response derived from the electrical
conductivity measured on the same device. The anomalous oscillations are a
signature of the modified density of states in MLG by the electrostatic
potential of the NW, which is much weaker in the NW-BLG devices. Thermal
calculations of the heterostructure stack show that the temperature gradient is
dominant in the graphene region underneath the NW, and thus sensitive to the
modified density of states resulting in anomalous oscillations in the
thermoelectric voltage. Furthermore, with the application of a magnetic field,
we detect modifications in the density of states due to the formation of Landau
levels in both MLG and BLG.

embodying both superiorities of BCNN simultaneously. To mitigate the unfair
training issue of BNAS, we employ continuous relaxation strategy to make each
edge of cell in BCNN relevant to all candidate operations for
over-parameterized BCNN construction. Moreover, the continuous relaxation
strategy relaxes the choice of a candidate operation as a softmax over all
predefined operations. Consequently, BNAS-v2 employs the gradient-based
optimization algorithm to simultaneously update every possible path of
over-parameterized BCNN, rather than the single sampled one as BNAS. However,
continuous relaxation leads to another issue named performance collapse, in
which those weight-free operations are prone to be selected by the search
strategy. For this consequent issue, two solutions are given: 1) we propose
Confident Learning Rate (CLR) that considers the confidence of gradient for
architecture weights update, increasing with the training time of
over-parameterized BCNN; 2) we introduce the combination of partial channel
connections and edge normalization that also can improve the memory efficiency
further. Moreover, we denote differentiable BNAS (i.e. BNAS with continuous
relaxation) as BNAS-D, BNAS-D with CLR as BNAS-v2-CLR, and partial-connected
BNAS-D as BNAS-v2-PC. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that
1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05
GPU days that is 4x faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days); and 2) the
proposed CLR is effective to alleviate the performance collapse issue in both

simple procedure to calculate the latent heat of the material. We also perform
simulations of the homogeneous freezing process, i.e. in the absence of a

in the cloud, gives a considerable amount of an enhanced CR energy density and
it shows a significant deviation in spectral shapes compared to the average
AMS-02 CR spectrum between 30 GeV and 10 TeV. We suggest that this variation in
the CR spectrum of Cepheus could be accounted for by an efficient acceleration
in the shocks of winds of OB associations, while in Rho Oph, similar
acceleration can be provided by multiple T-Tauri stars populated in the whole

related to an additional acceleration of CRs by supernova remnants or

pressure-temperature range. We have applied it to a number of real liquids in
both the subcritical regime and the supercritical regime, in which the liquid
state is demarcated by the Frenkel line. Our fitting to experimental data in a
wide pressure-temperature range has allowed us to test the new theoretical
model with hitherto unprecedented rigour. We have quantified the degree to
which the prediction of internal energy and heat capacity is constrained by the
different input parameters: The liquid relaxation time (initially obtained from
the viscosity), the Debye wavenumber and the infinite-frequency shear modulus.
The model is successfully applied to output the internal energy and heat
capacity data for several different fluids (Ar, Ne, $N_2$, Kr) over a range of
densities and temperatures. We find that the predicted heat capacities are
extremely sensitive to the values used for the liquid relaxation time. If these

predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks.
Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal
length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However,
real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of
observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of
predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model
for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly
observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed
model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative
adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that
receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The
discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed
values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing
elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps
(prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for
time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art
methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and

contaminants from flue gases. With small mass loss the model reduces to a
simpler form which is appropriate to describe the removal of
contaminants/pollutants from liquids. A case study is carried out for the
removal of CO2 from a gas mixture passing over activated carbon. Using the
experimental parameter values it is shown, via non-dimensionalisation, that
certain terms may be neglected from the governing equations, resulting in a
form which may be solved analytically using a travelling wave substitution.
From this all important quantities throughout the column may be described;
concentration of gaseous materials, amount of material available for mass

comes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training a
specific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit may
forgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of a

  Less-Than-Single-Pass Optimization with Nearly Optimal Generalization",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithms have been shown to
work favorably in solving large-scale learning problems. Despite the remarkable
success, the stochastic gradient complexity of SVRG-type algorithms usually
scales linearly with data size and thus could still be expensive for huge data.
To address this deficiency, we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic
minibatch proximal gradient (HSDMPG) algorithm for strongly-convex problems
that enjoys provably improved data-size-independent complexity guarantees. More
precisely, for quadratic loss $F(\theta)$ of $n$ components, we prove that
HSDMPG can attain an $\epsilon$-optimization-error
$\mathbb{E}[F(\theta)-F(\theta^*)]\leq\epsilon$ within
$\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{0.75}\log^{1.5}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})+1}{\epsilon}\wedge\Big(\kappa
\sqrt{n}\log^{1.5}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)+n\log\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)\Big)\Big)$
stochastic gradient evaluations, where $\kappa$ is condition number. For
generic strongly convex loss functions, we prove a nearly identical complexity
bound though at the cost of slightly increased logarithmic factors. For
large-scale learning problems, our complexity bounds are superior to those of
the prior state-of-the-art SVRG algorithms with or without dependence on data
size. Particularly, in the case of $\epsilon=\mathcal{O}\big(1/\sqrt{n}\big)$
which is at the order of intrinsic excess error bound of a learning model and
thus sufficient for generalization, the stochastic gradient complexity bounds
of HSDMPG for quadratic and generic loss functions are respectively
$\mathcal{O} (n^{0.875}\log^{1.5}(n))$ and $\mathcal{O}
(n^{0.875}\log^{2.25}(n))$, which to our best knowledge, for the first time
achieve optimal generalization in less than a single pass over data. Extensive
numerical results demonstrate the computational advantages of our algorithm

UAVs. The proposed approach discusses level-homogeneous deployment and
maintenance of a homogeneous fleet of fixed-wing UAVs given the boundary
information and the minimum loitering radius. The UAVs are deployed at
different altitude levels to provide heterogeneous coverage and sensing. We use
an efficient square packing method to deploy the UAVs, given the minimum loiter
radius and the area boundary. The UAVs loiter over the circles inscribed over
these packing squares in a synchronized motion to fulfill the full coverage
objective. An top-down hierarchy of the square packing, where each outer square
(super-square) is partitioned into four equal-sized inner squares (sub-square),
is exploited to introduce resilience in the deployed UAV-network. For a failed
sub-square UAV, a replacement neighbor is chosen considering the effective
coverage and deployed to the corresponding super-square at a higher altitude to
recover full coverage, trading-off with the quality of coverage of the
sub-area. This is a distributed approach as all the decision making is done
within close range of the loss region, and it can be scaled and adapted to
various large scale area and UAV configurations. Simulation results have been

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 are thought to originate in bats and then
spread to humans through intermediate hosts. Identifying intermediate host
species is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms
of COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains
a key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that
reflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial
mutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study
investigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different
species, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human
and monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the
highest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.
In terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and
human. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live
poultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection
in these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether
mouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals
closely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be
closely monitored.

quasi-stationary, are actually metastable. After extremely long times, they
randomly switch to new configurations with a different number of jets. The
genericity of this phenomenon suggests that most quasi-stationary turbulent
planetary atmospheres might have many climates and attractors for fixed values
of the external forcing parameters. A key message is that this situation will
usually not be detected by simply running the numerical models, because of the
extremely long mean transition time to change from one climate to another. In
order to study such phenomena, we need to use specific tools: rare event
algorithms and large deviation theory. With these tools, we make a full
statistical mechanics study of a classical barotropic beta-plane
quasigeostrophic model. It exhibits robust bimodality with abrupt transitions.
We show that new jets spontaneously nucleate from westward jets. The
numerically computed mean transition time is consistent with an Arrhenius law
showing an exponential decrease of the probability as the Ekman dissipation
decreases. This phenomenology is controlled by rare noise-driven paths called
{\it instantons}. Moreover, we compute the saddles of the corresponding
effective dynamics. For the dynamics of states with three alternating jets, we
uncover an unexpectedly rich dynamics governed by the symmetric group ${\cal

The present study is thus devoted to the derivation and validation of a new
framework to determine the drag, lift, rotational and pitching torque
coefficients for different non-spherical particles in a fluid flow. The
motivation for the study arises from medical applications, where particles may
have an arbitrary and complex shape. Here, it is usually not possible to derive
accurate analytical models for predicting the different hydrodynamic forces.
However, considering for example the various components of blood, their shape
takes an important role in controlling several body functions such as control
of blood viscosity or coagulation. Therefore, the presented model is designed
to be applicable to a broad range of shapes. Another important feature of the
suspensions occurring in medical and biological applications is the high number
of particles. The modelling approach we propose can be efficiently used for
simulations of solid-liquid suspensions with numerous particles. Based on
resolved numerical simulations of prototypical particles we generate data to
train a neural network which allows us to quickly estimate the hydrodynamic
forces experienced by a specific particle immersed in a fluid.

achieve the competitive results. Here, depending on the L2 error we construct
the objective function to control the performance of the approximation

behaviour in real world. Each rational individual can get a more reasonable

we here propose a mechanism with individual time cost heterogeneity whose core
lies in two aspects: 1. The individuals in the rule network are divided into 2
groups: high-time cost and low-time cost. 2. Each individual is endowed with a
time cost parameter, and the individuals take into account the effect of time
cost on the benefit when they interact with a neighbour. The synchronous
updating algorithm is used to study the evolution of cooperation with time cost
on a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism
effectively promotes cooperation in the snowdrift game. Moreover, it is
revealed that the following reasons lead to a higher level of cooperation: The
higher time cost, the more individuals of high-time cost in the group, and the
more differences of time cost between groups when low-time cost remains
unchanged.

observations of the Coma cluster. In this paper, the theory is now shown to be
consistent with a geometrically flat universe. Using a model of the
distribution of superclusters, the overall density parameter of the universe,

of great importance for high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. In the
terahertz frequency range, electrically pumped semiconductor quantum cascade
lasers (QCLs) are suitable candidates for frequency comb and dual-comb
operation. For a single laser frequency comb, the repetition rate can be locked
using a microwave injection locking and the carrier frequency can be locked to
a highly stable source. However, for the locking of two laser combs, four
frequencies (two repetition rates and two carrier offset frequencies) should be
simultaneously locked; If one only refers to the dual-comb signal, two relative
frequencies, i.e., the offset frequency and repetition frequency of one laser
against those of the other laser, should be locked. Although the locking
techniques that have been successfully used for a single laser comb can be, in
principle, applied to a dual-comb laser source, the complete locking
considerably complicates the implementation of such a system. Here, we propose
a method to stabilize a terahertz QCL dual-comb source by phase locking one of
the dual-comb lines to a radio frequency (RF) synthesizer. This technique
forces one of the lasers to follow the tone of the other one (keeping the sum
of the carrier offset frequency difference and repetition frequency difference
between the two laser combs as a constant) by exploiting a laser self-detection
that avoids the use of an external detector. Through the demonstration of this
locking technique, we demonstrate that the dual-comb can generate periodic
pulses over a 2 us time scale, showing that the terahertz QCL comb without a
control of the repetition rate can produce pulsed-type waveforms.
