approaches to observe the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract, generally the

the nature of this imaging system, which causes some issues to prognosticate by
physicians and computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, a novel technique is
proposed to improve the quality of images captured by the WCE. More
specifically, it enhanced the brightness, contrast, and preserve the color
information while reducing its computational complexity. Furthermore, the
experimental results of PSNR and SSIM confirm that the error rate in this

improves intensity restricted average local entropy (IRMLE) by 22%, color

Brown","Interactive White Balancing for Camera-Rendered Images","To appear in Color and Imaging Conference (CIC28), 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White balance (WB) is one of the first photo-finishing steps used to render a
captured image to its final output. WB is applied to remove the color cast
caused by the scene's illumination. Interactive photo-editing software allows
users to manually select different regions in a photo as examples of the
illumination for WB correction (e.g., clicking on achromatic objects). Such
interactive editing is possible only with images saved in a RAW image format.
This is because RAW images have no photo-rendering operations applied and
photo-editing software is able to apply WB and other photo-finishing procedures
to render the final image. Interactively editing WB in camera-rendered images
is significantly more challenging. This is because the camera hardware has
already applied WB to the image and subsequent nonlinear photo-processing
routines. These nonlinear rendering operations make it difficult to change the
WB post-capture. The goal of this paper is to allow interactive WB manipulation
of camera-rendered images. The proposed method is an extension of our recent
work \cite{afifi2019color} that proposed a post-capture method for WB
correction based on nonlinear color-mapping functions. Here, we introduce a new
framework that links the nonlinear color-mapping functions directly to
user-selected colors to enable {\it interactive} WB manipulation. This new
framework is also more efficient in terms of memory and run-time (99\%
reduction in memory and 3$\times$ speed-up). Lastly, we describe how our
framework can leverage a simple illumination estimation method (i.e.,
gray-world) to perform auto-WB correction that is on a par with the WB
correction results in \cite{afifi2019color}. The source code is publicly

mass of at least of 1500 kg, so that it would enable all kind of missions, from
scientific observation to in-situ operations. For each mission a
thrust-coast-thrust profile is considered. For this reason, each mission is
divided into 3 phases: i. the spiral trajectory to escape Earth gravity; ii.
the interplanetary travel, from the exit of Earth sphere of influence to the
end of the coasting phase; iii. maneuvers to rendezvous with the dwarf planet.
Propellant mass consumption, initial and final masses, velocities and $\Delta

number of languages and applications. However this abstraction can often result
in the programmer having to rely on some in built choices and with this
implicit parallelism, with little assistance by the programmer, the scalability
and performance of the code heavily depends on the compiler and choice of
application.
  We propose an approach, type oriented programming, where all aspects of
parallelism are encoded via types and the type system. The type information
associated by the programmer will determine, for instance, how an array is
allocated, partitioned and distributed. With this rich, high level of
information the compiler can generate an efficient target executable. If the
programmer wishes to omit detailed type information then the compiler will rely
on well documented and safe default behaviour which can be tuned at a later
date with the addition of types.
  The type oriented parallel programming language Mesham, which follows the
PGAS memory model, is presented. We illustrate how, if so wished, with the use
of types one can tune all parameters and options associated with this PGAS
model in a clean and consistent manner without rewriting large portions of
code. An FFT case study is presented and considered both in terms of
programmability and performance - the latter we demonstrate by a comparison
with an existing FFT solver.

widely used in many HPC applications. Extreme scaling of these methods can be
difficult, however, since global communication to form dot products is
typically required at every iteration.
  To try to overcome this limitation we propose a hybrid approach, where the
matrix is partitioned into blocks. Within each block, we use a highly optimised
(parallel) conventional solver, but we then couple the blocks together using
block Jacobi or some other multisplitting technique that can be implemented in
either a synchronous or an asynchronous fashion. This allows us to limit the
block size to the point where the conventional iterative methods no longer
scale, and to avoid global communication (and possibly synchronisation) across
all processes.
  Our block framework has been built to use PETSc, a popular scientific suite
for solving sparse linear systems, as the synchronous intra-block solver, and
we demonstrate results on up to 32768 cores of a Cray XE6 system. At this
scale, the conventional solvers are still more efficient, though trends suggest
that the hybrid approach may be beneficial at higher core counts.

tested on medical imaging problems. The performance of attribution methods is
compared on standard machine learning datasets and not on medical images. In
this study, we perform a comparative analysis to determine the most suitable
explainability method for retinal OCT diagnosis.
  Methods: A commonly used deep learning model known as Inception v3 was
trained to diagnose 3 retinal diseases - choroidal neovascularization (CNV),
diabetic macular edema (DME), and drusen. The explanations from 13 different
attribution methods were rated by a panel of 14 clinicians for clinical
significance. Feedback was obtained from the clinicians regarding the current
and future scope of such methods.
  Results: An attribution method based on a Taylor series expansion, called
Deep Taylor was rated the highest by clinicians with a median rating of 3.85/5.
It was followed by two other attribution methods, Guided backpropagation and
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
  Conclusion: Explanations of deep learning models can make them more
transparent for clinical diagnosis. This study compared different explanations
methods in the context of retinal OCT diagnosis and found that the best
performing method may not be the one considered best for other deep learning
tasks. Overall, there was a high degree of acceptance from the clinicians

${\mathcal N}=1$. The global SU(2) acting between two gluinos in the original
theory becomes graded. Exact results in thus deformed theory allows one to
obtain insights in certain aspects of non-supersymmetric gluodynamics. In
particular, it becomes clear how the splitting of the $\beta$ function
coefficients in pure gluodynamics, $\beta_1 =(4 -\frac 13 )N$ and $\beta_2=
(6-\frac 13)N^2$, occurs. Here the first terms in the braces (4 and 6, always

adjQCD$_{N_f=2}$ with supersymmetric theories. (Of course, in both cases we
loose all features related to flat directions and Higgs/Coulomb branches in

process. In this article we restrict attention to $MM$s on finite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces. Suppose we want to measure an observable $A$ whose outcomes
$A_x$ are represented by positive operators (effects) on a Hilbert Space $H$.
We call $H$ the base or object system. We interact $H$ with a probe system on
another Hilbert space $K$ by means of a quantum channel. The probe system
contains a probe (or meter or pointer) observable $F$ whose outcomes $F_x$ are
measured by an apparatus that is frequently (but need not be) classical in

an outcome $A_x$ for any state of $H$ in terms of the outcome $F_x$. The
interaction channel usually entangles this state with an initial probe state of
$K$ that can be quite complicated. However, if the channel is nondisturbing in
a sense that we describe, then the entanglement is considerably simplified. In
this article, we give formulas for observables and instruments measured by
nondisturbing $MM$s. We begin with a general discussion of nondisturbing
operators relative to a quantum context. We present two examples that

domain-invariant representation, it also utilizes a novel alignment loss to
ensure that the distance between pairs of class centroids, computed after
adding the unlabeled samples, is preserved across different domains. DGSML is
trained by a meta learning approach to mimic the distribution shift between the

orbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket
engine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun. Employing
the so-called Oberth effect, a second, prograde, impulse at closest approach
will raise the final velocity further. Here I investigate how a fixed total
impulse ({\Delta}v) can best be distributed in this procedure to maximize the
sail's velocity at infinity. Once {\Delta}v exceeds a threshold that depends on
the lightness number of the sail (a measure of its sun-induced acceleration),
the best strategy is to use all of the {\Delta}v in the retrograde impulse to
dive as close as possible to the Sun. Below the threshold the best strategy is
to use all of the {\Delta}v in the prograde impulse and thus not to dive at
all. Although larger velocities can be achieved with multi-stage impulsive
transfers, this study shows some interesting and perhaps counter-intuitive
consequences of combining impulses with solar sails.

randomized singular value decomposition towards a low-rank approximation of the

this solution efficient and memory-affordable even for large-scale inversions.

structure that can be used to study simplicial homotopy theory. Our main
motivation is to make simplicial homotopy theory suitable for homotopy type
theory. Effective Kan fibrations are maps of simplicial sets equipped with a
structured collection of chosen lifts that satisfy certain non-trivial
properties. This contrasts with the ordinary, unstructured notion of a Kan
fibration. We show that fundamental properties of Kan fibrations can be
extended to explicit constructions on effective Kan fibrations. In particular,
we give a constructive (explicit) proof showing that effective Kan fibrations
are stable under push forward, or fibred exponentials. This is known to be
impossible for ordinary Kan fibrations. We further show that effective Kan
fibrations are local, or completely determined by their fibres above
representables. We also give an (ineffective) proof saying that the maps which
can be equipped with the structure of an effective Kan fibration are precisely
the ordinary Kan fibrations. Hence implicitly, both notions still describe the
same homotopy theory. By showing that the effective Kan fibrations combine all
these properties, we solve an open problem in homotopy type theory. In this way
our work provides a first step in giving a constructive account of Voevodsky's
model of univalent type theory in simplicial sets.

known as few-shot classification, has attracted considerable attention.
Initialization based methods, such as the gradient-based model agnostic
meta-learning (MAML), tackle the few-shot learning problem by ""learning to
fine-tune"". The goal of these approaches is to learn proper model
initialization, so that the classifiers for new classes can be learned from a
few labeled examples with a small number of gradient update steps. Few shot
meta-learning is well-known with its fast-adapted capability and accuracy
generalization onto unseen tasks. Learning fairly with unbiased outcomes is
another significant hallmark of human intelligence, which is rarely touched in
few-shot meta-learning. In this work, we propose a Primal-Dual Fair
Meta-learning framework, namely PDFM, which learns to train fair machine
learning models using only a few examples based on data from related tasks. The
key idea is to learn a good initialization of a fair model's primal and dual
parameters so that it can adapt to a new fair learning task via a few gradient
update steps. Instead of manually tuning the dual parameters as hyperparameters
via a grid search, PDFM optimizes the initialization of the primal and dual
parameters jointly for fair meta-learning via a subgradient primal-dual
approach. We further instantiate examples of bias controlling using mean
difference and decision boundary covariance as fairness constraints to each
task for supervised regression and classification, respectively. We demonstrate
the versatility of our proposed approach by applying our approach to various

incremental discrete steps that sequentially move a virtual 3D rendering
towards the correct solution. A neural network estimates likely moves from a
single RGB image iteratively and determines so an acceptable final pose. In
comparison to other approaches that train object-specific pose models, we learn
a decision process. This allows for a lightweight architecture while it
naturally generalizes to unseen objects. A coherent stop action for process
termination enables dynamic reduction of the computation cost if there are
insignificant changes in a video sequence. Instead of a static inference time,
we thereby automatically increase the runtime depending on the object motion.

Existing probabilistic generative model-based relation extraction methods work
by extracting sentence features and using these features as inputs to train a

However, these methods do not consider correlations between sentences with the
same entity pair during training, which can negatively impact model
performance. To address this issue, we propose a Clustering-based Unsupervised
generative Relation Extraction (CURE) framework that leverages an
""Encoder-Decoder"" architecture to perform self-supervised learning so the
encoder can extract relation information. Given multiple sentences with the
same entity pair as inputs, self-supervised learning is deployed by predicting
the shortest path between entity pairs on the dependency graph of one of the
sentences. After that, we extract the relation information using the
well-trained encoder. Then, entity pairs that share the same relation are
clustered based on their corresponding relation information. Each cluster is
labeled with a few words based on the words in the shortest paths corresponding
to the entity pairs in each cluster. These cluster labels also describe the
meaning of these relation clusters. We compare the triplets extracted by our
proposed framework (CURE) and baseline methods with a ground-truth Knowledge
Base. Experimental results show that our model performs better than

for several variations of the method. The actual running time can still be
exponential in the worst case (when the condition number is exponential). We

shielded by the body of the Moon from terrestrial sources of radio frequency

radio astronomy, the possible spectral similarity between human and
alien-generated radio emission makes the abundance of artificial radio emission
on and around the Earth a significant complicating factor for SETI. A
Moon-based telescope would avoid this challenge. In this paper, we review
existing literature on Moon-based radio astronomy, discuss the benefits of
lunar SETI, contrast possible surface- and orbit-based telescope designs, and

solve this problem only depending on the Warehouse system configurations and
not on the number of packages processed, which is appropriate for Big Data

  Computational Analysis of the Roles of Kinase Feedback Pathways and Synaptic

proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)? One
likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently
including persistent activation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated
synthesis of protein kinase M zeta (PKM). Recent studies also suggest positive
feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or
engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these
feedback mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each
mechanism is necessary or sufficient, we simulated LTP maintenance with a
simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging,
and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of
recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one
feedback loop: self-activated PKM synthesis (variant I); self-activated CamKII
(variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (variant
III). Variant I requires and predicts that PKM must contribute to synaptic
tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation
could maintain PKM activity, a feedforward interaction not previously
considered. However we note data challenging this feedback loop. In variant III
synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent
activity elevations of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly
contributing to empirically persistent elevation of PKM levels. Reactivation is
thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and
incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant
IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could
synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate
these maintenance mechanisms.

X-ray (CXR) image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few
hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor
grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies
proposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain
inaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for
clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization,
severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the
so-called infection maps. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest

several developments rather than a single breakthrough (and without these, our
tests demonstrate that AA fails catastrophically). To begin, we ensure the
monotonicity of the likelihood function (a the key feature of the standard EM
algorithm) with a recently proposed monotonicity-control algorithm (Henderson

We propose nimble strategies for AA to preserve the positive definiteness of

the second moments of the observed data set exactly. Finally, we employ a
K-means clustering algorithm using the gap statistic to avoid excessively
overestimating the initial number of components, thereby maximizing
performance. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm with
several synthetic data sets that are mixtures of Gaussians distributions of

deep convolutional architecture. Acquisition of speech has recently been
modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in
Begu\v{s} (2020b; arXiv:2006.03965), who models learning of a simple local
allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and
non-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological
processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral
experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the
GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful
information for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a
comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii)
local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches
both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages.
This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's
progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning
representations by keeping latent space constant across different training
steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the
presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this
variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological
process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has
general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous
speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data
are represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent
space.

high-performance active material such as Silicon (Si) with two-dimensional
materials such as transition metal carbides (MXenes) for prolonged cycle
stability and enhanced electrochemical performance. More so, it is the
interface between these materials, which is the nexus for their applicatory
success. Herein, the interface strength variations between amorphous Si and
Ti3C2Tx MXene are determined as the MXene surface functional groups (Tx) are
changed using first principle calculations. Si is interfaced with three Ti3C2
MXene substrates having surface -OH, -OH and -O mixed, and -F functional
groups. Density functional theory (DFT) results reveal that completely
hydroxylated Ti3C2 has the highest interface strength of 0.6 J/m2 with
amorphous Si. This interface strength value drops as the proportion of surface
-O and -F groups increases. Additional analysis of electron redistribution and
charge separation across the interface is provided for a complete understanding
of underlying physico-chemical factors affecting the surface chemistry and
resultant interface strength values. The presented comprehensive analysis of
the interface aims to develop sophisticated MXene based electrodes by their
targeted surface engineering.

convergence result that requires weakening many of the order conditions,
resulting in schemes whose stages must be implemented in a sequential way. In
this work, after showing a stronger convergence result, we are able to derive
two new families of fourth- and fifth-order exponential Runge--Kutta methods,

independent of one another and share the same format, thereby allowing them to
be implemented in parallel or simultaneously, and making the methods to behave
like using with much less stages. Moreover, all of their stages involve only
one linear combination of the product of $\varphi$-functions (using the same

much more efficient to implement when compared to the existing methods of the

we study the free swimming of a pair of in-line swimmers driven with identical
heaving or pitching motions. We find that, independent of the flapping mode,
the follower passively stabilizes at discrete locations in the wake of the

exhibit tighter and more cohesive formations. Further, in comparison to
swimming alone, pitching motions increase the energetic efficiency of the group

densities that suffer phase transitions. Fluctuations entering the horizon

distinctive bump in the power spectrum relative to a model with no phase
transition. In this work, we study the non-linear evolution of such signatures
in the matter power spectrum and correlation function using N-body simulations,
perturbation theory and HMcode - a halo-model based method. We focus on
modelling the response, computed as the ratio of statistics between a model
containing a bump and one without it, rather than in the statistics themselves.
Instead of working with a specific theoretical model, we inject a parametric
family of Gaussian bumps into otherwise standard $\Lambda$CDM spectra. We find
that even when the primordial bump is located at linear scales, non-linearities
tend to produce a second bump at smaller scales. This effect is understood
within the halo model due to a more efficient halo formation. In redshift space
these nonlinear signatures are partially erased because of the damping along
the line-of-sight direction produced by non-coherent motions of particles at
small scales. In configuration space, the bump modulates the correlation
function reflecting as oscillations in the response, as it is clear in linear
Eulerian theory; however, they become damped because large scale coherent flows
have some tendency to occupy regions more depleted of particles. This mechanism
is explained within Lagrangian Perturbation Theory and well captured by our
simulations.

velocity. They were also mapped with KaVA (KVN and VERA Combined Array) in 2019

system than other high velocity components (50--200~km~s$^{-1}$) that have been
confirmed to be associated with the known bipolar outflow. The new components
would flash in the fast collimated jet at a speed over 300~km~s$^{-1}$ (soon)

seem to indicate rapid deceleration in these spectra, however our present
monitoring is still too sparse to unambiguously confirm it (up to
50~km~s$^{-1}$yr$^{-1}$) and too short to reveal their terminal expansion
velocity, which will be equal to the expansion velocity that has been observed

components may provide a good opportunity to investigate possible recurrent

Beneficial Perturbation Network (BPN) - to defend against adversarial attacks
by fixing the distribution drift. During training, BPN generates and leverages
beneficial perturbations (somewhat opposite to well-known adversarial
perturbations) by adding new, out-of-network biasing units. Biasing units
influence the parameter space of the network, to preempt and neutralize future
adversarial perturbations on input data samples. To achieve this, BPN creates
reverse adversarial attacks during training, with very little cost, by
recycling the training gradients already computed. Reverse attacks are captured
by the biasing units, and the biases can in turn effectively defend against
future adversarial examples. Reverse attacks are a shortcut, i.e., they affect
the network's parameters without requiring instantiation of adversarial
examples that could assist training. We provide comprehensive empirical
evidence showing that 1) BPN is robust to adversarial examples and is much more
running memory and computationally efficient compared to classical adversarial
training. 2) BPN can defend against adversarial examples with negligible
additional computation and parameter costs compared to training only on clean

which brings certain difficulties to the study of the thermodynamic

hole is the sum of the corresponding entropy of the two horizons plus an extra
term from the correlation of the two horizons. By comparing the entropic force
of interaction between black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon with
Lennard-Jones force between two particles, we find that the change rule of

function in terms of L2 normof the residual of the Stokes equation. Three forms
of loss functions are investigated based on vorticity-velocity-pressure,
velocity-stress-pressure, and velocity-gradient of velocity-pressure
formulations of the Stokes equation. We first conduct a systematic study of the
MscaleDNN methods with various loss functions on the Kovasznay flow in
comparison with normal fully connected DNNs. Then, Stokes flows with highly
oscillatory solutions in a 2-D domain with six randomly placed holes are
simulated by the MscaleDNN. The results show that MscaleDNN has faster
convergence and consistent error decays in the simulation of Kovasznay flow for
all four tested loss functions. More importantly, the MscaleDNN is capable of
learning highly oscillatory solutions when the normal DNNs fail to converge.

a class of nonlinear large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence

that guarantees the attack-free subsystems to achieve the output consensus
which minimizes the sum of their objective functions, while the attacked
subsystems converge to preset secure states. A two-layer DOC structure is
established with emphasis on the interactions between cyber and physical
layers, where a command-driven control law is designed that generates provable
optimal output consensus. Differing from the existing fault diagnosis methods
which are generally applicable to given failure types, the focus of the attack
diagnosis is to achieve detection and isolation for arbitrary malicious
behaviors. To this end, double coupling residuals are generated by a
carefully-designed distributed filter. The adaptive thresholds with prescribed
performance are designed to enhance the detectability and isolability. It is
theoretically guaranteed that any attack signal cannot bypass the designed
attack diagnosis methodology to destroy the convergence of the DOC algorithm,
and the locally-occurring detectable attack can be isolated from the
propagating attacks from neighboring subsystems. Simulation results for the
motion coordination of multiple remotely operated underwater vehicles
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

kinetic freedom of the colloids. In aqueous suspensions of charged colloids,
the role of inter-particle electrostatics interactions on the aging dynamics is
well debated. Despite water being the dispersion medium, the influence of water
structure on the physicochemical properties of aging colloids has never been
considered before. Laponite, a model hectorite clay, could be used to evaluate
the relative contributions of medium structure and electrostatics in
determining the physicochemical properties of aging colloidal suspensions.
  Experiments: The structure of the dispersion medium is modified either by
incorporating uncharged/charged kosmotropic (structure-inducing) or chaotropic
(structure-disrupting) molecules or by changing suspension temperature. A new
protocol, wherein the medium is heated before adding clay particles, is also
introduced to evaluate the effects of hydrogen bond disruptions on suspension
aging. Dynamic light scattering, rheological measurements and particle-scale
imaging are employed to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the
suspensions.
  Findings: A strong influence of medium structure is evident when
inter-particle electrostatic interactions are weak. Enhancement and disruption
of hydrogen bonds in the medium are, respectively, strongly correlated with
acceleration and delay of suspension aging dynamics. The physicochemical
properties of charged clay colloidal suspensions are therefore controlled by
altering hydrogen bonding in the dispersion medium.

non-Markovian characteristics, and non-stationary noise of temporal signals.
Handwriting prediction is also challenging because of uncertainty arising from
inter-class bifurcation structures, in addition to the above problems. For
example, the classes '0' and '6' are very similar in terms of their beginning
parts; therefore it is nearly impossible to predict their subsequent parts from
the beginning part. In other words, '0' and '6' have a bifurcation structure
due to ambiguity between classes, and we cannot make a long-term prediction in
this context. In this paper, we propose a temporal prediction model that can
deal with this bifurcation structure. Specifically, the proposed model learns
the bifurcation structure explicitly as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for each
class as well as the posterior probability of the classes. The final result of
prediction is represented as the weighted sum of GMMs using the class
probabilities as weights. When multiple classes have large weights, the model
can handle a bifurcation and thus avoid an inaccurate prediction. The proposed
model is formulated as a neural network including long short-term memories and
is thus trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model was evaluated on

More specifically, the dynamics of the players are supposed to be first-order

are parametric uncertainties. To achieve Nash equilibrium seeking in a
distributed way, Nussbaum function based strategies are proposed through
separately designing an optimization module and a state regulation module. The
optimization module generates a reference trajectory, that can search for the
Nash equilibrium, for the state regulation module. The state regulator is
designed to steer the players' actions to the reference trajectory. An adaptive
law is included in the state regulation module to compensate for the uncertain

address the unavailability of the control directions. Fully distributed

Through our analytical explorations, we show that the proposed seeking

asymptotically without requiring the homogeneity of the players' unknown

assumption, we prove that the power is equal to $2-d$ at non-zero low
temperatures, while it is equal to $1-d$ at zero temperature. The method is
applied also to a quantum XY model and a classical Heisenberg model at non-zero
low temperatures in three or higher dimensions. The resulting power is given by
the same $2-d$ at non-zero low temperatures.

IPv6 address space enhances security by making scanning infeasible, however,
with recent advances of IPv6 scanning technologies, network scanning is again
threatening server security. In this paper, we propose a new model named
addressless server, which separates the server into an entrance module and a
main service module, and assigns an IPv6 prefix instead of an IPv6 address to
the main service module. The entrance module generates a legitimate IPv6
address under this prefix by encrypting the client address, so that the client
can access the main server on a destination address that is different in each
connection. In this way, the model provides isolation to the main server,
prevents network scanning, and minimizes exposure. Moreover it provides a novel
framework that supports flexible load balancing, high-availability, and other
desirable features. The model is simple and does not require any modification
to the client or the network. We implement a prototype and experiments show
that our model can prevent the main server from being scanned at a slight

plays an important role in robust inference and estimation. It has also been
finding a great variety of applications in machine learning. In a parametric
setup, it has been extensively studied. However, in the statistical learning
context where a function is typically learned in a nonparametric way, there is
still a lack of theoretical understanding of how Huber regression estimators
learn the conditional mean function and why it works in the absence of
light-tailed noise assumptions. To address these fundamental questions, we
conduct an assessment of Huber regression from a statistical learning
viewpoint. First, we show that the usual risk consistency property of Huber
regression estimators, which is usually pursued in machine learning, cannot
guarantee their learnability in mean regression. Second, we argue that Huber
regression should be implemented in an adaptive way to perform mean regression,
implying that one needs to tune the scale parameter in accordance with the
sample size and the moment condition of the noise. Third, with an adaptive
choice of the scale parameter, we demonstrate that Huber regression estimators
can be asymptotic mean regression calibrated under $(1+\epsilon)$-moment
conditions ($\epsilon>0$). Last but not least, under the same moment
conditions, we establish almost sure convergence rates for Huber regression
estimators. Note that the $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions accommodate the
special case where the response variable possesses infinite variance and so the
established convergence rates justify the robustness feature of Huber
regression estimators. In the above senses, the present study provides a
systematic statistical learning assessment of Huber regression estimators and
justifies their merits in terms of robustness from a theoretical viewpoint.

interference between waves scattered by the electron density irregularities of
interstellar plasma, often leading to parabolic arcs in the two-dimensional
power spectrum of the recorded dynamic spectrum. The degree of arc curvature
depends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity
with respect to the line-of-sight. We report the observation of annual and
orbital variations in the curvature of scintillation arcs over a period of 16
years for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations are
the signature of the relative transverse motions of the Earth, pulsar, and
scattering medium, which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters
of the pulsar's binary orbit and the scattering medium itself. We observe two
clear scintillation arcs in most of our $>$5000 observations and we show that
they originate from scattering by thin screens located at distances $D_1 = 89.8
\pm 0.4$ pc and $D_2 = 124 \pm 3$ pc from Earth. The best-fit scattering model
we derive for the brightest arc yields the pulsar's orbital inclination angle
$i = 137.1 \pm 0.3^\circ$, and longitude of ascending node,
$\Omega=206.3\pm0.4^\circ$. Using scintillation arcs for precise astrometry and
orbital dynamics can be superior to modelling variations in the diffractive
scintillation timescale, because the arc curvature is independent of variations
in the level of turbulence of interstellar plasma. This technique can be used
in combination with pulsar timing to determine the full three-dimensional
orbital geometries of binary pulsars, and provides parameters essential for
testing theories of gravity and constraining neutron star masses.

generative model for low-dose CT. At the stage of prior learning, the gradient
of data density is directly learned from normal-dose CT images as a prior. Then
at the iterative reconstruction stage, the stochastic gradient descent is
employed to update the trained prior with annealed and conditional schemes. The
distance between the reconstructed image and the manifold is minimized along
with data fidelity during reconstruction. Experimental comparisons demonstrated
the noise reduction and detail preservation abilities of the proposed method.

classifies end-user questions/queries and then incorporates a query-specific
approach for answer prediction. We refer our proposed approach as Hierarchical
Question Segregation based Visual Question Answering, in short HQS-VQA. Our
contributions are three-fold, viz. firstly, we propose a question segregation
(QS) technique for VQAMed; secondly, we integrate the QS model to the
hierarchical deep multi-modal neural network to generate proper answers to the
queries related to medical images; and thirdly, we study the impact of QS in
Medical-VQA by comparing the performance of the proposed model with QS and a
model without QS. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on two
benchmark datasets, viz. RAD and CLEF18. Experimental results show that our
proposed HQS-VQA technique outperforms the baseline models with significant
margins. We also conduct a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of
the obtained results and discover potential causes of errors and their

past 10 Myr. The brightness and spectroscopic characteristics of red
supergiants make it easy to identify them and build up a virtually complete
sample of such stars at the distance of the Cygnus region, thus providing a
record of massive star formation extending several tens of Myr into the past, a
period inaccessible through the O and early B stars observable at present. We
have made a selection of a sample of bright, red stars in an area of 84 square
degrees covering the whole present extension of the Cygnus region. We have
obtained spectroscopy in the red visible range allowing an accurate,
homogeneous spectral classification as well as a reliable separation between
supergiants and other cool stars. Our data are complemented with Gaia Data
Release 2 astrometric data. We have identified 29 red supergiants in the area,
17 of which had not been previously classified as supergiants. Twenty-four of
the 29 most likely belong to the Cygnus region and four of the remaining to the
Perseus arm. We have used their derived luminosities and masses to infer the
star formation history of the region. Intense massive star formation activity
is found to have started approximately 15 Myr ago, and we find evidence for two
other episodes, one taking place between 20 and 30 Myr ago and another one
having ended approximately 40 Myr ago. There are small but significant
differences between the kinematic properties of red supergiants younger or
older then 20 Myr, hinting that stars of the older group were formed outside
the precursor of the present Cygnus complex, possibly in the Sagittarius-Carina

present the Repeated Elastic Net Technique (RENT) for Feature Selection. RENT
uses an ensemble of generalized linear models with elastic net regularization,
each trained on distinct subsets of the training data. The feature selection is
based on three criteria evaluating the weight distributions of features across
all elementary models. This fact leads to the selection of features with high
stability that improve the robustness of the final model. Furthermore, unlike
established feature selectors, RENT provides valuable information for model
interpretation concerning the identification of objects in the data that are
difficult to predict during training. In our experiments, we benchmark RENT
against six established feature selectors on eight multivariate datasets for
binary classification and regression. In the experimental comparison, RENT
shows a well-balanced trade-off between predictive performance and stability.
Finally, we underline the additional interpretational value of RENT with an
exploratory post-hoc analysis of a healthcare dataset.

small disks around its endpoints. As an application of the invariants we prove
two theorems: a sharp lower bound of the crossing number of a knotoid (the
estimate differs from its prototype for classical knots proved by M.Polyak and
O.Viro in 2001) and a sufficient condition for a knotoid in $S^2$ to be a
proper knotoid (or pure knotoid with respect to Turaev's terminology). Finally
we give a table containing values of our invariants computed for all spherical

paper, we focus on over-the-air (OTA) FL, which has been suggested recently to
reduce the communication overhead of FL due to the repeated transmissions of
the model updates by a large number of users over the wireless channel. In OTA
FL, all users simultaneously transmit their updates as analog signals over a
multiple access channel, and the server receives a superposition of the analog
transmitted signals. However, this approach results in the channel noise
directly affecting the optimization procedure, which may degrade the accuracy
of the trained model. We develop a Convergent OTA FL (COTAF) algorithm which
enhances the common local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) FL algorithm,
introducing precoding at the users and scaling at the server, which gradually
mitigates the effect of the noise. We analyze the convergence of COTAF to the
loss minimizing model and quantify the effect of a statistically heterogeneous
setup, i.e. when the training data of each user obeys a different distribution.
Our analysis reveals the ability of COTAF to achieve a convergence rate similar
to that achievable over error-free channels. Our simulations demonstrate the
improved convergence of COTAF over vanilla OTA local SGD for training using
non-synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we numerically show that the precoding
induced by COTAF notably improves the convergence rate and the accuracy of

One promising approach for understanding quality indicators is the use of the

quality indicator, especially when its theoretical property is unknown. Thus,
optimal distributions for most quality indicators have not been well
investigated. To address these issues, first, we propose a problem formulation
of finding the optimal distribution for each quality indicator on an arbitrary
Pareto front. Then, we approximate the optimal distributions for nine quality
indicators using the proposed problem formulation. We analyze the nine quality

Pareto fronts of three-objective problems. Our analysis demonstrates that
uniformly-distributed objective vectors over the entire Pareto front are not
optimal in many cases. Each quality indicator has its own optimal distribution
for each Pareto front. We also examine the consistency among the nine quality

for supervised learning. Traditionally, this question has been tackled using
the Information Bottleneck, which compresses the inputs while retaining
information about the targets, in a decoder-agnostic fashion. In machine
learning, however, our goal is not compression but rather generalization, which
is intimately linked to the predictive family or decoder of interest (e.g.
linear classifier). We propose the Decodable Information Bottleneck (DIB) that
considers information retention and compression from the perspective of the
desired predictive family. As a result, DIB gives rise to representations that
are optimal in terms of expected test performance and can be estimated with
guarantees. Empirically, we show that the framework can be used to enforce a
small generalization gap on downstream classifiers and to predict the
generalization ability of neural networks.

developed for the Pixel Processing Array and captured images are then processed
directly on the vision sensor acquiring target information for controlling the

fuel sprays is theoretically investigated in this work. A general theory is
developed to describe flame propagation speed, flame temperature, droplet
evaporation onset and completion locations. The influences of liquid fuel and
gas mixture properties on spherical spray flame propagation are studied. The
results indicate that the spray flame propagation speed is enhanced with
increased droplet mass loading and/or evaporation heat exchange coefficient (or
evaporation rate). Opposite trends are found when the latent heat is high, due
to strong evaporation heat absorption. Fuel vapor and temperature gradients are
observed in the post-flame evaporation zone of heterogeneous flames.
Evaporation completion front location considerably changes with flame radius,
but the evaporation onset location varies little relative to the flame front
when the flame propagates. For larger droplet loading and smaller evaporation
rate, the fuel droplet tends to complete evaporation behind the flame front.
Flame bifurcation occurs with high droplet mass loading under large latent
heat, leading to multiplicity of flame propagation speed, droplet evaporation
onset and completion fronts. The flame enhancement or weakening effects by the
fuel droplet sprays are revealed by enhanced or suppressed heat and mass
diffusion process in the pre-flame zone. Besides, for heterogeneous flames,
heat and mass diffusion in the post-flame zone also exists. The mass diffusion
for both homogeneous and heterogeneous flames is enhanced with decreased Lewis
number. The magnitude of Markstein length is considerably reduced with
increased droplet loading. Moreover, post-flame droplet burning behind
heterogeneous flame influences the flame propagation speed and Markstein length
when the liquid fuel loading is relatively low.

intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is employed to enhance the connectivity
between the access point (AP) and robotic users. Both single-user and
multiple-user scenarios are considered. In the single-user scenario, one mobile
robotic user (MRU) communicates with the AP. In the multiple-user scenario, the
AP serves one MRU and one static robotic user (SRU) employing either
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) or orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
transmission. The considered system is optimized for minimization of the
travelling time/distance of the MRU from a given starting point to a predefined
final location, while satisfying constraints on the communication quality of
the robotic users. To this end, a radio map based approach is proposed to
exploit location-dependent channel propagation knowledge. For the single-user
scenario, a channel power gain map is constructed, which characterizes the
spatial distribution of the maximum expected effective channel power gain of
the MRU for the optimal IRS phase shifts. Based on the obtained channel power
gain map, the communication-aware robot path planing problem is solved by
exploiting graph theory. For the multiple-user scenario, a communication rate
map is constructed, which characterizes the spatial distribution of the maximum
expected rate of the MRU for the optimal power allocation at the AP and the
optimal IRS phase shifts subject to a minimum rate requirement for the SRU. The
joint optimization problem is efficiently solved by invoking bisection search
and successive convex approximation methods. Then, a graph theory based
solution for the robot path planning problem is derived by exploiting the
obtained communication rate map. Our numerical results verify the effectiveness

decreases the efficiency of functionalization and makes it poorly controlled.
Here, we report a novel approach to generate, monitor with time resolution, and
functionalize the defects $\textit{in situ}$ without ever exposing them to the
ambient. The defects are generated by an energetic Argon plasma and their
properties are monitored using $\textit{in situ}$ Raman spectroscopy. We find
that these defects are functional, very reactive, and strongly change their
density from $\approx 1\cdot10^{13} cm^{-2}$ to $\approx 5\cdot10^{11} cm^{-2}$
upon exposure to air. We perform the proof of principle $\textit{in situ}$
functionalization by generating defects using the Argon plasma and
functionalizing them $\textit{in situ}$ using Ammonia functional. The
functionalization induces the n-doping with a carrier density up to
$5\cdot10^{12} cm^{-2}$ in graphene and remains stable in ambient conditions.

to a 1D quasi-periodic system with a potential given by the
Andr\'e-Aubry-Harper (AAH) model and its generalized versions (GAAH model) is
sensitive to the nature of the single particle eigenstates (SPEs). More
specifically, we can use the non-markovianity of the qubit dynamics as
quantified by the backflow of information to clearly distinguish the localized,
delocalized, and mixed regimes with a mobility edge of the AAH and GAAH model
and evidence the transition between them. By attaching two qubits at distinct
sites of the system, we demonstrate that the transport property of the
quasi-periodic system is encoded in the scaling of the threshold time to
develop correlations between the qubits with the distance between the qubits.
This scaling can also be used to distinguish and infer different regimes of
transport such as ballistic, diffusive and no transport engendered by SPEs that
are delocalized, critical and localized respectively. When there is a mobility
edge allowing the coexistence of different kinds of SPEs in the spectrum, such
as the coexistence of localized and delocalized states in the GAAH models, we
find that the transport behaviour and the scaling of the threshold time with

set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Here, we present a new
approach to these solutions by studying Hopf algebras in the category,
$\mathrm{SupLat}$, of complete lattices and join-preserving morphisms. We
connect the two methods by showing that any Hopf algebra, $\mathcal{H}$ in
$\mathrm{SupLat}$, has a corresponding group, $R(\mathcal{H})$, which we call
its remnant and a co-quasitriangular structure on $\mathcal{H}$ induces a YBE
solution on $R(\mathcal{H})$, which is compatible with its group structure.
Conversely, any group with a compatible YBE solution can be realised in this
way. Additionally, it is well-known that any such group has an induced
secondary group structure, making it a skew left brace. By realising the group
as the remnant of a co-quasitriangular Hopf algebra, $\mathcal{H}$, this
secondary group structure appears as the projection of the transmutation of
$\mathcal{H}$. Finally, for any YBE solution, we obtain a FRT-type Hopf algebra
in $\mathrm{SupLat}$, whose remnant recovers the universal skew brace of the
solution.

is attractive for its great advantages in terms of speed and energy efficiency
for information storage applications. However, the heating and helicity effects
induced by circularly polarized laser excitation are entangled in the
helicity-dependent all-optical switching (HD-AOS), which hinders the
understanding of magnetization dynamics involved. Here, by applying a dual-pump
laser excitation, first with a linearly polarized (LP) laser pulse followed by
a circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse, we identify the timescales and
contribution from heating and helicity effects in HD-AOS with a Pt/Co/Pt triple
layer. When the sample is preheated by the LP laser pulses to a nearly fully
demagnetized state, CP laser pulses with a much-reduced power switches the
sample's magnetization. By varying the time delay between the two pump pulses,
we show that the helicity effect, which gives rise to the deterministic
helicity induced switching, onsets instantly upon laser excitation, and only
exists for less than 0.2 ps close to the laser pulse duration of 0.15 ps. The
results reveal that that the transient magnetization state upon which CP laser
pulses impinge is the key factor for achieving HD-AOS, and importantly, the
tunability between heating and helicity effects with the unique dual-pump laser
excitation approach will enable HD-AOS in a wide range of magnetic material
systems for the potential ultrafast spintronics applications.

evolutionary game which is considered as a paradigm to portray competition

updating rule base on aspiration, has been proved to be an effective model to
promote cooperation in spatial prisoner's dilemma game, which leads aspiration
to receive lots of attention. But in many research the assumption that
individual's aspiration is fixed is inconsistent with recent results from
psychology. In this paper, according to Expected Value Theory and Achievement
Motivation Theory, we propose a dynamic aspiration model based on
Win-Stay-Lose-Learn rule in which individual's aspiration is inspired by its
payoff. It is found that dynamic aspiration has a significant impact on the
evolution process, and different initial aspirations lead to different results,
which are called Stable Coexistence under Low Aspiration, Dependent Coexistence
under Moderate aspiration and Defection Explosion under High Aspiration
respectively. Furthermore, a deep analysis is performed on the local structures
which cause cooperator's existence or defector's expansion, and the evolution
process for different parameters including strategy and aspiration. As a
result, the intrinsic structures leading to defectors' expansion and
cooperators' survival are achieved for different evolution process, which
provides a penetrating understanding of the evolution. Compared to fixed
aspiration model, dynamic aspiration introduces a more satisfactory explanation
on population evolution laws and can promote deeper comprehension for the
principle of prisoner's dilemma.

on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data.
However, since access to large volumes of labeled data is often limited or
expensive, it is desirable to alleviate this bottleneck by carefully curating
the training set. Optimal experimental design is a well-established paradigm
for selecting data point to be labeled so to maximally inform the learning
process. Unfortunately, classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses
on selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized (and thus,
non-interpolative) models, while modern machine learning models such as deep
neural networks are overparameterized, and oftentimes are trained to be
interpolative. As such, classical experimental design methods are not
applicable in many modern learning setups. Indeed, the predictive performance
of underparameterized models tends to be variance dominated, so classical
experimental design focuses on variance reduction, while the predictive
performance of overparameterized models can also be, as is shown in this paper,
bias dominated or of mixed nature. In this paper we propose a design strategy
that is well suited for overparameterized regression and interpolation, and we
demonstrate the applicability of our method in the context of deep learning by
proposing a new algorithm for single shot deep active learning.

samples of star-forming galaxies: LBG galaxies with an LAE counterpart (92
galaxies), LBG galaxies without LAE counterpart (408 galaxies) and LAE galaxies
without an LBG counterpart (46 galaxies). All these galaxies are intrinsically
faint due to the lensing nature of the sample (Muv $\ge$ -20.5). The fraction
of LAEs among all selected SFGs increases with redshift up to z $\sim$ 6 and
decreases for higher redshifts. The evolution of LAE/LBG populations with UV
magnitude and Lya luminosity shows that the LAE selection is able to identify
intrinsically UV faint galaxies with Muv $\ge$ -15 that are typically missed in
the deepest lensing photometric surveys. The LBG population seems to fairly
represent the total population of SFGs down to Muv$\sim$-15. Galaxies with
Muv$<-17$ tend to have SFRLya$<$SFRuv, whereas the opposite trend is observed
within our sample for faint galaxies with Muv$>-17$, including galaxies only
detected by their Lya emission, with a large scatter. These trends, previously
observed in other samples of SFGs at high-$z$, are seen here for very faint
Muv$\sim -15$ galaxies, much fainter than in previous studies. There is no
clear evidence, based on the present results, for an intrinsic difference on
the properties of the two populations selected as LBG and/or LAE. The observed

resilient protocol for solving Byzantine Agreement in partial synchrony with
information theoretic security guarantees. In particular, IT-HS does not depend
on any PKI or common setup assumptions and is resilient to computationally
unbounded adversaries. IT-HS is based on the Primary-Backup view-based
paradigm. In IT-HS, in each view, and in each view change, each party sends
only a constant number of words to every other party. This yields an $O(n^2)$
word and message complexity in each view. In addition, IT-HS requires just
$O(1)$ persistent local storage and $O(n)$ transient local storage. Finally,
like all Primary-Backup view-based protocols in partial synchrony, after the
system becomes synchronous, all nonfaulty parties decide on a value in the
first view a nonfaulty leader is chosen. Moreover, like PBFT and HotStuff,
IT-HS is optimistically responsive: with a nonfaulty leader, parties decide as
quickly as the network allows them to do so, without regard for the known upper
bound on network delay. Our work improves in multiple dimensions upon the
information theoretic version of PBFT presented by Miguel Castro, and can be
seen as an information theoretic variant of the HotStuff paradigm.

  Kot","Domain Generalization for Medical Imaging Classification with
  Linear-Dependency Regularization","Accepted by NeurIPS, 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, we have witnessed great progress in the field of medical imaging
classification by adopting deep neural networks. However, the recent advanced
models still require accessing sufficiently large and representative datasets
for training, which is often unfeasible in clinically realistic environments.
When trained on limited datasets, the deep neural network is lack of
generalization capability, as the trained deep neural network on data within a
certain distribution (e.g. the data captured by a certain device vendor or
patient population) may not be able to generalize to the data with another
distribution.
  In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective approach to improve the
generalization capability of deep neural networks in the field of medical
imaging classification. Motivated by the observation that the domain
variability of the medical images is to some extent compact, we propose to
learn a representative feature space through variational encoding with a novel
linear-dependency regularization term to capture the shareable information
among medical data collected from different domains. As a result, the trained
neural network is expected to equip with better generalization capability to
the ""unseen"" medical data. Experimental results on two challenging medical
imaging classification tasks indicate that our method can achieve better
cross-domain generalization capability compared with state-of-the-art
baselines.

shorter than one day: an ultra-short-period planet (Sanchis-ojeda et al. 2014;

either hot Jupiters, with sizes above 10 Earth radii (Re), or apparently rocky
planets smaller than 2 Re. Such lack of planets of intermediate size (the ""hot

retain any hydrogen/helium (H/He) envelope in the face of strong stellar
irradiation. Here, we report the discovery of an ultra-short-period planet with
a radius of 4.6 Re and a mass of 29 Me, firmly in the hot Neptune desert. Data

transits of the bright Sun-like star \starname\, every 0.79 days. The planet's
mean density is similar to that of Neptune, and according to thermal evolution

been an increasing number of learning platforms that provide students with
multi-step questions to cultivate their problem-solving skills. To guarantee
the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect
how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether
students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to
compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different
grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge.
The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement
trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze
problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret,
summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In
this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question
designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different
student groups, distill insights for design improvements. In particular, QLens
models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and
visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects
students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We
conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the
usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of
problem-solving traces.

map is estimated to mitigate performance degeneration by inaccurate pseudo
depth maps. To cope with the prediction error of the confidence map itself, we
also leverage the threshold network that learns the threshold dynamically

the thresholded confidence map are used to supervise the monocular depth
network. Furthermore, we propose the probabilistic framework that refines the
monocular depth map with the help of its uncertainty map through the
pixel-adaptive convolution (PAC) layer. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods.

for Bayesian clustering models, such as mixture models, the output is typically
a sample of clusterings (partitions) drawn from the posterior distribution. In
practice, a key challenge is how to summarise this output. Here we build upon
the notion of the posterior similarity matrix (PSM) in order to suggest new
approaches for summarising the output of MCMC algorithms for Bayesian
clustering models. A key contribution of our work is the observation that PSMs
are positive semi-definite, and hence can be used to define
probabilistically-motivated kernel matrices that capture the clustering
structure present in the data. This observation enables us to employ a range of
kernel methods to obtain summary clusterings, and otherwise exploit the
information summarised by PSMs. For example, if we have multiple PSMs, each
corresponding to a different dataset on a common set of statistical units, we
may use standard methods for combining kernels in order to perform integrative
clustering. We may moreover embed PSMs within predictive kernel models in order
to perform outcome-guided data integration. We demonstrate the performances of
the proposed methods through a range of simulation studies as well as two real
data applications. R code is available at

detection of these mergers by ground-based or space-based GW interferometers
can provide invaluable insights on astrophysical black holes, but it requires
precise predictions and dedicated waveform models for the analysis. We present
a state-of-the-art effective-one-body (EOB) model for the multipolar
merger-ringdown waveform from dynamical capture black-hole mergers with
arbitrary mass-ratio and nonprecessing spins. The model relies on analytical
descriptions of the radiation reaction and waveform along generic orbits that
are obtained by incorporating generic Newtonian prefactors in the expressions
used in the quasi-circular case. It provides a tool for generating waveforms
for generic binary black hole coalescences and for GW data analysis. We
demonstrate that the model reliably accounts for the rich phenomenology of
dynamical captures, from direct plunge to successive close encounters up to
merger. The parameter space is fully characterized in terms of the initial
energy and angular momentum. Our model reproduces to few percent the scattering
angle from ten equal-mass, nonspinning, hyperbolic encounter
numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. The agreement can be further improved to
the by incorporating 6PN-results in one of the EOB potentials and tuning
currently unknown analytical parameters. Our results suggest that NR

High mode densities of microwave photons from $300\,$K blackbody radiation
(BBR) significantly enhance decay rates of Rydberg states to neighbouring
states, enabling superradiance that is not possible with bare vacuum induced
spontaneous decay. Here we report observations of the superradiance of
ultracold Rydberg atoms embedded in a bath of room-temperature photons. The
temporal evolution of the Rydberg $|nD\rangle$ to $|(n+1)P\rangle$ superradiant
decay of Cs atoms ($n$ the principal quantum number) is measured directly in

large Rydberg ensembles. We demonstrate that the van der Waals interactions
between Rydberg atoms change the superradiant dynamics and modify the scaling
of the superradiance. In the presence of static electric fields, we find that
the superradiance becomes slow, potentially due to many-body interaction
induced dephasing. Our study provides insights into many-body dynamics of

systems by means of Non-equilibrium Green's function and Dynamical Mean Field
Theory. We firstly establish a ""minimum model"" to formulate the strong-field
transport in non-interacting dissipative electron lattice. This model is
exactly soluble and convenient for discussing energy dissipation and
steady-state properties. The formalism is then combined with Dynamical Mean
Field Theory to provide a systematic framework describing the nonequilibrium
steady-state of correlated materials. We use the formalism to study the
strong-field transport properties of correlated materials, Mott insulators and
Dirac electrons in graphene. We concentrate on the microscopic description of
resistive switching. Of particular interest is the filament formation during
the dynamical phase transition, which has been interpreted as a result of the
delicate interplay between dissipation and Mott physics. We will also examine
$IV$ characteristics and particularly the current saturation of Dirac electrons
in graphene. The arXiv version has been updated with minor modifications and
corrections.

free-flow costs (informally their lengths) are within a small multiplicative
$(1+\theta)$ constant of the optimal free-flow cost path connecting their

of tight bounds on PoA($\theta$) for arbitrary classes of cost functions, both
in the case of general congestion/routing games as well as in the special case
of path-disjoint networks. Second, by using a large mobility dataset in
Singapore, we inspect minute-by-minute decision-making of thousands of

(pre)selection mechanism. In contrast, in Pigou networks, the ratio of the
free-flow costs of the routes, and thus $\theta$, is \textit{infinite}; so,
although such worst case networks are mathematically simple, they correspond to
artificial routing scenarios with little resemblance to real world conditions,
opening the possibility of proving much stronger Price of Anarchy guarantees by
explicitly studying their dependency on $\theta$. For example, in the case of
the standard Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) cost model, where$c_e(x)= a_e
x^4+b_e$, and for quartic cost functions in general, the standard PoA bound for

correlations in them with current physical understanding. We train an
encoder-decoder architecture on the self-supervised auxiliary task of
reconstruction to allow it to learn general representations without bias

bottleneck of the network, we implicitly enforce interpretability in the

However, they suffer from two major shortcomings: First, a quadratic-size
coefficient matrix is learned directly, preventing these methods from scaling
beyond small datasets. Secondly, the trained models are transductive and thus
cannot be used to cluster out-of-sample data unseen during training. Instead of
learning self-expression coefficients directly, we propose a novel metric
learning approach to learn instead a subspace affinity function using a siamese
neural network architecture. Consequently, our model benefits from a constant
number of parameters and a constant-size memory footprint, allowing it to scale
to considerably larger datasets. In addition, we can formally show that out
model is still able to exactly recover subspace clusters given an independence
assumption. The siamese architecture in combination with a novel geometric
classifier further makes our model inductive, allowing it to cluster
out-of-sample data. Additionally, non-linear clusters can be detected by simply
adding an auto-encoder module to the architecture. The whole model can then be
trained end-to-end in a self-supervised manner. This work in progress reports
promising preliminary results on the MNIST dataset. In the spirit of

the total number of bits transmitted over the networks. In this paper, we
propose to distribute the computation load in stationary networks, and
formulate a flow-based delay minimization problem that jointly captures the
aspects of communications and computation. We exploit the distributed
compression scheme of Slepian-Wolf that is applicable under any protocol
information where nodes can do compression independently using different
codebooks. We introduce the notion of entropic surjectivity as a measure to
determine how sparse the function is and to understand the limits of functional
compression for computation. We leverage Little's Law for stationary systems to
provide a connection between surjectivity and the computation processing factor
that reflects the proportion of flow that requires communications. This
connection gives us an understanding of how much a node (in isolation) should
compute to communicate the desired function within the network without putting
any assumptions on the topology. Our results suggest that to effectively
compute different function classes that have different entropic surjectivities,
the networks can be re-structured with the transition probabilities being
tailored for functions, i.e., task-based link reservations, which can enable
mixing versus separately processing of a diverse function classes. They also
imply that most of the available resources are reserved for computing low
complexity functions versus fewer resources for processing of high complexity
ones. We numerically evaluate our technique for search, MapReduce, and
classification functions, and infer how sensitive the processing factor for
each computation task to the entropic surjectivity is.

corresponding single particle Schr\""odinger equation. For smooth potentials the
method allows a simple alternative derivation of the local density
approximation for the density and of the sine kernel in the bulk part of the
trap in the large $N$ limit. It also recovers the density and the kernel of the
so-called {\em Airy gas} at the edge. This method allows to analyse the quantum
correlations in the ground state when the potential has a singular part with a
fast variation in space. For the square step barrier of height $V_0$, we derive
explicit expressions for the density and for the kernel. For large Fermi energy
$\mu>V_0$ it describes the interpolation between two regions of different
densities in a Fermi gas, each described by a different sine kernel. Of
particular interest is the {\em critical point} of the square well potential
when $\mu=V_0$. In this critical case, while there is a macroscopic number of
fermions in the lower part of the step potential, there is only a finite $O(1)$
number of fermions on the shoulder, and moreover this number is independent of
$\mu$. In particular, the density exhibits an algebraic decay $\sim 1/x^2$,
where $x$ is the distance from the jump. Furthermore, we show that the critical
behaviour around $\mu = V_0$ exhibits universality with respect with the shape
of the barrier. This is established (i) by an exact solution for a smooth
barrier (the Woods-Saxon potential) and (ii) by establishing a general relation

$\mathcal{O}^{\star}(2.7^k)$. In the Parameterized Complexity literature,
several problems around Feedback Vertex Set have been studied. Some of these
include Independent Feedback Vertex Set (where the set $S$ should be an
independent set in $G$), Almost Forest Deletion and Pseudoforest Deletion. In
Pseudoforest Deletion, each connected component in $G-S$ has at most one cycle
in it. However, in Almost Forest Deletion, the input is a graph $G$ and
non-negative integers $k,\ell \in \mathbb{N}$, and the objective is to test
whether there exists a vertex subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $G-S$
is $\ell$ edges away from a forest. In this paper, using the methodology of Li
and Nederlof [SODA, 2020], we obtain the current fastest algorithms for all
these problems. In particular we obtain following randomized algorithms.
  1) Independent Feedback Vertex Set can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^{\star}(2.7^k)$.
  2) Pseudo Forest Deletion can be solved in time
$\mathcal{O}^{\star}(2.85^k)$.
  3) Almost Forest Deletion can be solved in $\mathcal{O}^{\star}(\min\{2.85^k
\cdot 8.54^\ell,2.7^k \cdot 36.61^\ell,3^k \cdot 1.78^\ell\})$.

It not only can
learn and benefit from experience, but also can adapt to new situations. In
contrast, deep neural networks only learn one sophisticated but fixed mapping
from inputs to outputs. This limits their applicability to more dynamic
situations, where input to output mapping may change with different contexts. A
salient example is continual learning - learning new independent tasks
sequentially without forgetting previous tasks. Continual learning of multiple
tasks in artificial neural networks using gradient descent leads to
catastrophic forgetting, whereby a previously learned mapping of an old task is
erased when learning new mappings for new tasks. Here, we propose a new
biologically plausible type of deep neural network with extra, out-of-network,
task-dependent biasing units to accommodate these dynamic situations. This
allows, for the first time, a single network to learn potentially unlimited
parallel input to output mappings, and to switch on the fly between them at
runtime. Biasing units are programmed by leveraging beneficial perturbations
(opposite to well-known adversarial perturbations) for each task. Beneficial
perturbations for a given task bias the network toward that task, essentially
switching the network into a different mode to process that task. This largely
eliminates catastrophic interference between tasks. Our approach is
memory-efficient and parameter-efficient, can accommodate many tasks, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and domains.

central and most challenging problems in materials science and computational
chemistry. This problem can be formulated as a global optimization problem in
which global search algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) and particle
swarm optimization have been combined with first principle free energy
calculations to predict crystal structures given only a material composition or
only a chemical system. These DFT based ab initio CSP algorithms are
computationally demanding and can only be used to predict crystal structures of
relatively small systems. The vast coordinate space plus the expensive DFT free
energy calculations limits their efficiency and effectiveness. On the other
hand, a similar structure prediction problem has been intensively investigated
in parallel in the protein structure prediction community of bioinformatics, in
which the dominating predictors are knowledge based approaches including
homology modeling and threading that exploit known protein structures. Herein
we explore whether known geometric constraints such as the pairwise atomic
distances of a target crystal material can help predict/reconstruct its
structure given its space group and lattice information. We propose DMCrystal,
a genetic algorithm based crystal structure reconstruction algorithm based on
predicted atomic pairwise distances. Based on extensive experiments, we show
that the predicted distance matrix can dramatically help to reconstruct the
crystal structure and usually achieves much better performance than CMCrystal,
an atomic contact map based crystal structure prediction algorithm. This
implies that knowledge of atomic interaction information learned from existing
materials can be used to significantly improve the crystal structure prediction
in terms of both speed and quality.

the classical discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLSE). In its simplest
version, the DNLSE is made up of two terms -- a nearest-neighbor hopping term
and an on-site cubic nonlinear term. Each of the terms is preceded by a
coefficient that can take on either a positive or a negative sign. Each of the
DNLSE versions is derived from a corresponding equivalent Hamiltonian. The
result is a small family of four versions of the DNLSE Hamiltonian, each with
its own associated ground state, all indeed scattered in myriad of scientific
publications. Here we present a comprehensive picture for the ground states of
DNLSE systems, summarize existing results and provide new insights. First, we
classify the four DNLSE Hamiltonians into two pairs according to the sign of
the nonlinear term -- a ""positive/negative Hamiltonian pair"" if the sign of the
nonlinear term is positive/negative respectively. Ground states of the positive
Hamiltonian pair are discrete plane waves in either a ferromagnetic-like or an
antiferromagnetic-like configuration, depending on the sign of the hopping
term. Ground states of the negative Hamiltonian pair are either unstaggered or
staggered site-centered discrete breathers. Next, we discuss some properties of
the ground states associated with the positive-Hamiltonian pair -- entropy,
temperature, correlations and stability. We extend our ground state stability
discussion to include excited plane waves. We propose to engineer a
density-energy conserving perturbation and show that under such perturbation,
all excited plane waves are entropy-unstable. For site-centered discrete
breathers -- the ground states of the negative-Hamiltonian pair -- we have
divided system nonlinearity into two ranges and wrote very good analytic
approximations for the breathers in each range.

experimentally realize non-Hermitian space-time varying metamaterials for
efficient and asymmetric frequency conversion by allowing material gain and
loss to be tailor-made and balanced in the time domain. In the application of
frequency conversion, the combination of space-time varying capability and
non-Hermiticity allows us to diminish the main band through gain-loss balance
and to increase the efficiency of side band conversion at the same time. In
addition, our approach of software-defined metamaterials is flexible to realize
the analogy of quantum interference in an acoustic system with design
capability. Applying an additional modulation phase delay between different
atoms allows to control such interference to get asymmetric amplification in
frequency conversion.

optimization to maintain the average power constraint. We demonstrate that a
slight modification of the learning algorithm allows tracking of time varying

simultaneously learn the optimal queueing strategy along with power control. We
