These results are discussed in the wide context of problems arising in the

metallic and dielectric bodies. After a brief treatment of different approaches
to theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of graphene, we
concentrate on the derivation of response function in the framework of thermal
quantum field theory in the Matsubara formulation using the polarization tensor
in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The asymptotic expressions for the
Casimir-Polder and Casimir free energy and entropy at low temperature, obtained
with the polarization tensor, are presented for a pristine graphene as well as
for graphene sheets possessing some nonzero energy gap $\Delta$ and chemical
potential $\mu$ under different relationships between the values of $\Delta$
and $\mu$. Along with reviewing the results obtained in the literature, we
present some new findings concerning the case of zero gap and nonzero chemical
potential. The conclusion is made that the Lifshitz theory of the Casimir and
Casimir-Polder forces in graphene systems using the quantum field theoretical
description of a pristine graphene, as well as real graphene sheets with
$\Delta>2\mu$ or $\Delta<2\mu$, is consistent with the requirements of
thermodynamics. The case of graphene with $\Delta=2\mu\neq 0$ leads to an
entropic anomaly, but is argued to be physically unrealistic. The way to a
resolution of thermodynamic problems in the Lifshitz theory based on the
results obtained for graphene is discussed.

in the presence of buoyancy on the drag of a spatially fixed heated spherical
particle at low Reynolds numbers ($Re$) in the range $10^{-3} \le Re \le 10$ in
a variable property fluid. The amount of heat addition from the sphere
encompasses both, the heating regime where the Boussinesq approximation holds
and the regime where it breaks down. The particle is assumed to have a low Biot
number which means that the particle is uniformly at the same temperature and
has no internal temperature gradients. Scaling buoyancy with inertial and
viscous forces yields two related non-dimensional quantities, called Buoyancy
Induced Viscous Reynolds Number ($Re_{BV}$) and Buoyancy Induced Inertial
Reynolds Number ($Re_{BI}$). For ideal gases, $Re_{BV}$ is analogous to the
Grashof number ($Gr$). No assumptions are made on the magnitude of $Re_{BI}$
(or equivalently $Re_{BV}$). The effects of the orientation of gravity relative
to the free-stream velocity are examined. Large deviations in the value of the
drag coefficient are observed when the Froude number ($Fr$) decreases and/or
the temperature of the sphere increases. Under appropriate constraints on
$Re_{BI}$ and $Re$, the total drag on a heated sphere in a low $Re$ flow in the
presence of buoyancy (mixed convection) is shown to be, within 10% error, the
linear superposition of the drag computed in two canonical setups: one being
the drag on a steadily moving heated sphere in the absence of buoyancy (forced
convection) and the other being natural convection. However, the effect of
temperature variation on the drag of a sphere in both, forced and natural
convection, is significant.

goal is to identify arms whose expected rewards deviate substantially from the

the outlier threshold using the median and median absolute deviation of the

the mean and standard deviation, since it can identify outlier arms even in the
presence of extreme outlier values. Our setting is different from existing pure
exploration problems where the threshold is pre-specified as a given value or
rank. This is useful in applications where the goal is to identify the set of
promising items but the cardinality of this set is unknown, such as finding
promising drugs for a new disease or identifying items favored by a population.
We propose two $\delta$-PAC algorithms for ROAI, which includes the first
UCB-style algorithm for outlier detection, and derive upper bounds on their
sample complexity. We also prove a matching, up to logarithmic factors, worst
case lower bound for the problem, indicating that our upper bounds are
generally unimprovable. Experimental results show that our algorithms are both

structure recursively where every node splits the feature space into two
sub-regions, sending examples into the left or right branch as a result. In
axis-aligned decision forests, the ""decision"" to route an input example is the
result of the evaluation of a condition on a single dimension in the feature
space. Such conditions are learned using efficient, often greedy algorithms
that optimize a local loss function. For example, a node's condition may be a
threshold function applied to a numerical feature, and its parameter may be
learned by sweeping over the set of values available at that node and choosing
a threshold that maximizes some measure of purity. Crucially, whether an
algorithm exists to learn and evaluate conditions for a feature type determines
whether a decision forest algorithm can model that feature type at all. For
example, decision forests today cannot consume textual features directly --
such features must be transformed to summary statistics instead. In this work,
we set out to bridge that gap. We define a condition that is specific to
categorical-set features -- defined as an unordered set of categorical
variables -- and present an algorithm to learn it, thereby equipping decision
forests with the ability to directly model text, albeit without preserving
sequential order. Our algorithm is efficient during training and the resulting
conditions are fast to evaluate with our extension of the QuickScorer inference
algorithm. Experiments on benchmark text classification datasets demonstrate
the utility and effectiveness of our proposal.

upon this field by providing a generic methodology that was
investigation-agnostic and interpretable to a financial markets practitioner,
thus enhancing their efficiency, reducing barriers to entry, and increasing the
reproducibility of experiments. The proposed methodology is showcased on two
automated trading platform components. Namely, price levels, a well-known
trading pattern, and a novel 2-step feature extraction method. The methodology
relies on hypothesis testing, which is widely applied in other social and
scientific disciplines to effectively evaluate the concrete results beyond
simple classification accuracy. The main hypothesis was formulated to evaluate
whether the selected trading pattern is suitable for use in the machine
learning setting. Across the experiments we found that the use of the
considered trading pattern in the machine learning setting is only partially
supported by statistics, resulting in insignificant effect sizes (Rebound 7 -
$0.64 \pm 1.02$, Rebound 11 $0.38 \pm 0.98$, and rebound 15 - $1.05 \pm 1.16$),

methodology on a US futures market instrument and provided evidence that with
this methodology we could easily obtain informative metrics beyond the more
traditional performance and profitability metrics. This work is one of the
first in applying this rigorous statistically-backed approach to the field of

and the constraints on the instrument are stringent, whether the experiment is
a space-based platform or a ground-based telescope. The latter are usually
deployed in remote and harsh environments such as the South Pole, where
maintenance needs to be kept minimal. CEA-SBT has acquired a strong heritage in
the development of vibration-free multistage helium-sorption coolers, which can
provide cooling down to 200 mK when mounted on a cold stage at temperatures
<5K. In this paper, we focus on the development of a three-stage cooler
dedicated to the BICEP Array project led by Caltech/JPL, which aims to study
the birth of the Universe and specifically the unique B-mode pattern imprinted
by primordial gravitational waves on the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
Background. Several cryogenic receivers are being developed, each featuring one
such helium-sorption cooler operated from a 4K stage cooled by a Cryomech
pulse-tube with heat lifts of >1.35W at 4.2K and >36W at 45K. The major
challenge of this project is the large masses to be cooled to sub-kelvin
temperatures (26 kg at 250mK) and the resulting long cool-down time, which in
this novel cooler design is kept to a minimum with the implementation of
passive and active thermal links between different temperature stages. A first
unit has been sized to provide 230, 70 and 2{\mu}W of net heat lifts at the
maximum temperatures of 2.8K, 340 and 250mK, respectively, for a minimum
duration of 48 hours.

ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) based stress-strain thermodynamic

obtained. The entropy that stabilizes the dynamically disordered cubic phase is
captured by the behavior of the stress on the deformation path. We also show

Specifically, we integrate the target session and its neighbor (similar)

usually introduce some drawbacks in explainability (explicit mapping) and
cost-effectiveness (linearization), generalization capability (out-of-sample),
and representability (spatial-spectral discrimination). To overcome these
shortcomings, a novel linearized subspace analysis technique with
spatial-spectral manifold alignment is developed for a semi-supervised
hyperspectral dimensionality reduction (HDR), called joint and progressive
subspace analysis (JPSA). The JPSA learns a high-level, semantically
meaningful, joint spatial-spectral feature representation from hyperspectral
data by 1) jointly learning latent subspaces and a linear classifier to find an
effective projection direction favorable for classification; 2) progressively
searching several intermediate states of subspaces to approach an optimal
mapping from the original space to a potential more discriminative subspace; 3)
spatially and spectrally aligning manifold structure in each learned latent
subspace in order to preserve the same or similar topological property between
the compressed data and the original data. A simple but effective classifier,
i.e., nearest neighbor (NN), is explored as a potential application for
validating the algorithm performance of different HDR approaches. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of
the proposed JPSA on two widely-used hyperspectral datasets: Indian Pines

arrival, an item is matched with a compatible item according to the First Come
First Served discipline and leave the system immediately, whereas it is
enqueued with other items of the same class, if any. We show that such a model
may exhibit a non intuitive behavior: increasing the services ability by adding
new edges in the matching graph may lead to a larger average population. This
is similar to a Braess paradox. We first consider a quasicomplete graph with
four nodes and we provide values of the probability distribution of the

Then, we consider an arbitrary matching graph and we show sufficient conditions

has focused on representing a stream of timestamped edges using a time-series
of graphs based on a specific time-scale (e.g., 1 month), we propose the notion
of an $\epsilon$-graph time-series that uses a fixed number of edges for each
graph, and show its superiority over the time-scale representation used in
previous work. In addition, we propose a number of new temporal models based on
the notion of temporal reachability graphs and weighted temporal summary
graphs. These temporal models are then used to generalize existing base
(static) embedding methods by enabling them to incorporate and appropriately
model temporal dependencies in the data. From the 6 temporal network models
investigated (for each of the 7 base embedding methods), we find that the top-3

outbreaks) include: where did the disease start, how is it spreading, who is at
risk, and how to control the spread. There are a large number of complex
factors driving the spread of pandemics, and, as a result, multiple modeling
techniques play an increasingly important role in shaping public policy and
decision making. As different countries and regions go through phases of the
pandemic, the questions and data availability also changes. Especially of
interest is aligning model development and data collection to support response
efforts at each stage of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been
unprecedented in terms of real-time collection and dissemination of a number of
diverse datasets, ranging from disease outcomes, to mobility, behaviors, and
socio-economic factors. The data sets have been critical from the perspective
of disease modeling and analytics to support policymakers in real-time. In this
overview article, we survey the data landscape around COVID-19, with a focus on
how such datasets have aided modeling and response through different stages so
far in the pandemic. We also discuss some of the current challenges and the
needs that will arise as we plan our way out of the pandemic.

dynamics for population games over networks. The basic assumption of this
learning mechanism -- encompassing the replicator dynamics -- is that players
belonging to a single population exchange information through pairwise
interactions, whereby they get aware of the actions played by the other players
and the corresponding rewards. Using this information, they can revise their
current action, imitating the one of the players they interact with. The
pattern of interactions regulating the learning process is determined by a
community structure. First, the set of equilibrium points of such network
imitation dynamics is characterized. Second, for the class of potential games
and for undirected and connected community networks, global asymptotic
convergence is proved. In particular, our results guarantee convergence to a
Nash equilibrium from every fully supported initial population state in the
special case when the Nash equilibria are isolated and fully supported.
Examples and numerical simulations are offered to validate the theoretical
results and counterexamples are discussed for scenarios when the assumptions on
the community structure are not verified.

manipulation and eavesdropping by unauthorized parties is an important task for
network administrators. Many cyber attacks rely on a lack of network-level
information flow controls to successfully compromise a victim network. Once an
adversary exploits an initial entry point, they can eavesdrop and move
laterally within the network (e.g., scan and penetrate internal nodes) to
further their malicious goals. In this paper, we propose a novel multilevel
security (MLS) framework to enforce a secure inter-node information flow policy
within the network and therein vastly reduce the attack surface available to an
adversary who has penetrated it. In contrast to prior work on multilevel
security in computer networks which relied on enforcing the policy at network
endpoints, we leverage the centralization of software-defined networks (SDNs)
by moving the task to the controller and providing this service transparently
to all nodes in the network. Our framework, MLSNet, formalizes the generation
of a policy compliant network configuration (i.e., set of flow rules on the SDN
switches) as network optimization problems, with the objectives of (1)
maximizing the number of flows satisfying all security constraints and (2)
minimizing the security cost of routing any remaining flows to guarantee
availability. We demonstrate that MLSNet can securely route flows that satisfy
the security constraints (e.g., >80% of flows in a performed benchmark) and
route the remaining flows with a minimal security cost.

also connect this question with the residual finite-dimensionality of the

variations in the form of patterns among certain elements, e.g. N correlates

been observed in massive star clusters that are significantly younger than old
GCs, down to an age of $\sim$2 Gyr. However, so far N has been the only element
found to vary in such young objects. We report here the presence of Na
abundance variations in the intermediate age massive star clusters NGC 416
($\sim$6.5 Gyr old) and Lindsay 1 ($\sim$7.5 Gyr old) in the Small Magellanic
Cloud, by combining HST and ESO-VLT MUSE observations. Using HST photometry we
were able to construct ''chromosome maps'' and separate sub-populations with
different N content, in the red giant branch of each cluster. MUSE spectra of
individual stars belonging to each population were combined, resulting in high
signal-to-noise spectra representative of each population, which were compared
to search for mean differences in Na. We find a mean abundance variation of
$\Delta$[Na/Fe]$=0.18\pm0.04$ dex for NGC 416 and $\Delta$[Na/Fe]$=0.24\pm0.05$
dex for Lindsay 1. In both clusters we find that the population that is
enhanced in N is also enhanced in Na, which is the same pattern to the one
observed in ancient GCs. Furthermore, we detect a bimodal distribution of
core-helium burning Red Clump (RC) giants in the UV colour magnitude diagram of
NGC 416. A comparison of the stacked MUSE spectra of the two RCs shows the same
mean Na abundance difference between the two populations. The results reported
in this work are a crucial hint that star clusters of a large age range share
the same origin: they are the same types of objects, but only separated in age.

framework used in multi-agent motion planning, for the purpose of creating game

results suggest that among the behavior models evaluated, modeling driving
behavior as pure strategy NE with quantal errors at the level of maneuvers with
bounds sampling of actions at the level of trajectories provides the best fit

(ac-STEM) analysis of the perovskite (LaFeO3) and pyrochlore (Yb2Ti2O7 and

atomic columns in annular dark-field (ADF) images are sensitive to the presence
of nearby atoms of low atomic number (e.g. oxygen). We show that point defects
(e.g. oxygen vacancies), which are invisible - or difficult to observe due to
limited sensitivity - in X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements, are the
origin of the complex magnetic ground state of pyrochlore oxides. In addition,
we present, for the first time, a method by which light atoms can be resolved
in quantitative ADF-STEM images. Using this method, we resolved oxygen atoms in
perovskite and pyrochlore oxides.

Stirling cycle used as a quantum heat engine. We consider specifically the case
in which the working substance (WS) is a two-level system. The Stirling cycle
is made of two isochoric transformations separated by a compression and an
expansion stroke during which the working substance is in contact with a
thermal reservoir. To describe these two strokes we derive a non-Markovian
master equation which allows to study the dynamics of a driven open quantum
system with arbitrary fast driving. We found that the finite-time dynamics and
thermodynamics of the cycle depend non-trivially on the different time scales
at play. In particular, driving the WS at a time scale comparable to the
resonance time of the bath enhances the performance of the cycle and allows for
an efficiency higher than the efficiency of the slow adiabatic cycle, but still
below the Carnot bound. Interestingly, performance of the cycle is dependent on
the compression and expansion speeds asymmetrically. This suggests new freedom
in optimizing quantum heat engines. We further show that the maximum output
power and the maximum efficiency can be achieved almost simultaneously,
although the net extractable work declines by speeding up the drive.

death. Surprisingly, we find that the inhomogeneous oscillation suppression

discover an oscillation death-like state which is manifested in the phase space
through the symmetry-breaking bifurcation of Wigner function. Our results also

architecture for geo-distributed systems that leverages the availability
characteristics of today's public-cloud infrastructures to minimize complexity
and reduce latency. Spider models a system as a collection of loosely coupled
replica groups whose members are hosted in different cloud-provided fault

structural organization makes it possible to achieve low response times by
placing replica groups in close proximity to clients while still enabling the
replicas of a group to interact over short-distance links. To handle the
inter-group communication necessary for strong consistency Spider uses a
reliable group-to-group message channel with first-in-first-out semantics and
built-in flow control that significantly simplifies system design.

mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the
efficacy of combined therapy in treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions
considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF) and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions when
administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral
load. Four scenarios involving administration of single drug intervention, two
drug interventions, three drug interventions and all the four have been
discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on
two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled as
control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal
control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is
proposed. Later using the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug
regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and viral load. The
average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four
interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible
cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered. The basic
reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when all the four
interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in
the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision
making in treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

we need to know both what justice is and how to tell whether one system is more

justice. Theories of distributive justice hold that justice can be measured (in
part) in terms of the fair distribution of benefits and burdens across people
in society. Recently, the field known as fair machine learning has turned to
John Rawls's theory of distributive justice for inspiration and
operationalization. However, philosophers known as capability theorists have
long argued that Rawls's theory uses the wrong measure of justice, thereby
encoding biases against people with disabilities. If these theorists are right,
is it possible to operationalize Rawls's theory in machine learning systems
without also encoding its biases? In this paper, I draw on examples from fair
machine learning to suggest that the answer to this question is no: the
capability theorists' arguments against Rawls's theory carry over into machine
learning systems. But capability theorists don't only argue that Rawls's theory
uses the wrong measure, they also offer an alternative measure. Which measure
of justice is right? And has fair machine learning been using the wrong one?

evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art VQA models to five different
anomalies, including worst-case scenarios, the most frequent scenarios, and the
current limitation of VQA models. Different from the results in unimodal tasks,
the maximum confidence of answers in VQA models cannot detect anomalous inputs,
and post-training of the outputs, such as outlier exposure, is ineffective for
VQA models. Thus, we propose an attention-based method, which uses confidence
of reasoning between input images and questions and shows much more promising
results than the previous methods in unimodal tasks. In addition, we show that
a maximum entropy regularization of attention networks can significantly
improve the attention-based anomaly detection of the VQA models. Thanks to the
simplicity, attention-based anomaly detection and the regularization are
model-agnostic methods, which can be used for various cross-modal attentions in
the state-of-the-art VQA models. The results imply that cross-modal attention
in VQA is important to improve not only VQA accuracy, but also the robustness

  Registration",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image registration is a widely-used technique in analysing large scale
datasets that are captured through various imaging modalities and techniques in
biomedical imaging such as MRI, X-Rays, etc. These datasets are typically
collected from various sites and under different imaging protocols using a
variety of scanners. Such heterogeneity in the data collection process causes
inhomogeneity or variation in intensity (brightness) and noise distribution.
These variations play a detrimental role in the performance of image
registration, segmentation and detection algorithms. Classical image
registration methods are computationally expensive but are able to handle these
artifacts relatively better. However, deep learning-based techniques are shown
to be computationally efficient for automated brain registration but are
sensitive to the intensity variations. In this study, we investigate the effect
of variation in intensity distribution among input image pairs for deep
learning-based image registration methods. We find a performance degradation of
these models when brain image pairs with different intensity distribution are
presented even with similar structures. To overcome this limitation, we
incorporate a structural similarity-based loss function in a deep neural
network and test its performance on the validation split separated before
training as well as on a completely unseen new dataset. We report that the deep
learning models trained with structure similarity-based loss seems to perform

  Password Cracking","17 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce password strength information signaling as a novel, yet
counter-intuitive, defense mechanism against password cracking attacks. Recent
breaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous threat of
offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker can quickly check
millions (or sometimes billions/trillions) of password guesses by comparing
their hash value with the stolen hash from a breached authentication server.
The attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest. Our key
idea is to have the authentication server store a (noisy) signal about the
strength of each user password for an offline attacker to find. Surprisingly,
we show that the noise distribution for the signal can often be tuned so that a
rational (profit-maximizing) attacker will crack fewer passwords. The signaling
scheme exploits the fact that password cracking is not a zero-sum game i.e.,
the attacker's profit is given by the value of the cracked passwords minus the
total guessing cost. Thus, a well-defined signaling strategy will encourage the
attacker to reduce his guessing costs by cracking fewer passwords. We use an
evolutionary algorithm to compute the optimal signaling scheme for the
defender. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our mechanism on several password
datasets and show that it can reduce the total number of cracked passwords by
up to $12\%$ (resp. $5\%$) of all users in defending against offline (resp.
online) attacks.

players that faces an opponent in an imperfect-information zero-sum
extensive-form game. Team members are not allowed to communicate during play
but can coordinate before the game. In that setting, it is known that the best
the team can do is sample a profile of potentially randomized strategies (one
per player) from a joint (a.k.a. correlated) probability distribution at the
beginning of the game. In this paper, we first provide new modeling results
about computing such an optimal distribution by drawing a connection to a
different literature on extensive-form correlation. Second, we provide an
algorithm that computes such an optimal distribution by only using profiles
where only one of the team members gets to randomize in each profile. We can
also cap the number of such profiles we allow in the solution. This begets an
anytime algorithm by increasing the cap. We find that often a handful of
well-chosen such profiles suffices to reach optimal utility for the team. This
enables team members to reach coordination through a relatively simple and
understandable plan. Finally, inspired by this observation and leveraging
theoretical concepts that we introduce, we develop an efficient
column-generation algorithm for finding an optimal distribution for the team.
We evaluate it on a suite of common benchmark games. It is three orders of
magnitude faster than the prior state of the art on games that the latter can
solve and it can also solve several games that were previously unsolvable.

to better understand the reliability of these algorithms, it is crucial to
understand their robustness properties in presence of natural noise sources or

formalize a fundamental link between binary quantum hypothesis testing and

Based on this result, we develop practical protocols to optimally certify

highly asymmetric masses, significant spin, and component mass in the ""mass
gap"". These features can be explained if one or both components of the binary
are the remnants of previous mergers. In this paper, we explore hierarchical
mergers in multiple stellar systems, taking into account the natal kick and
mass loss due to the supernova explosion (SN) on each component, as well as the
merger kick received by the merger remnant. The binaries that have survived the
SNe and kicks generally have too wide orbital separations to merge by
themselves, but can merge with the aid of an external companion that gives rise
to Lidov-Kozai oscillations. The BH binaries that consist of second-generation
BHs can also be assembled in dense star clusters through binary interactions.
We characterize the parameter space of these BH binaries by merger fractions in
an analytical approach. Combining the distributions of the survived binaries,
we further constrain the parameters of the external companion, using the
analytically formulated tertiary perturbation strength. We find that to produce
the three LIGO/VIRGO O3 events, the external companions must be at least a few
hundreds $M_\odot$, and fall in the intermediate-mass BH and supermassive BH
range. We suggest that GW190412, GW190814 and GW190521 could all be produced

means to test and anchor these models, but limited studies have assessed the
relative dynamical role of multiple feedback modes, particularly at the
earliest stages of expansion when HII regions are still deeply embedded. In
this paper, we use multiwavelength (radio, infrared, and X-ray) data to measure
the pressures associated with direct radiation ($P_{\rm dir}$), dust-processed
radiation ($P_{\rm IR}$), photoionization heating ($P_{\rm HII}$), and
shock-heating from stellar winds ($P_{\rm X}$) in a sample of 106 young,
resolved HII regions with radii $\lesssim$0.5 pc to determine how stellar
feedback drives their expansion. We find that the $P_{\rm IR}$ dominates in 84%
of the regions and that the median $P_{\rm dir}$ and $P_{\rm HII}$ are smaller
than the median $P_{\rm IR}$ by factors of $\approx 6$ and $\approx 9$,
respectively. Based on the radial dependences of the pressure terms, we show
that HII regions transition from $P_{\rm IR}$-dominated to $P_{\rm

$f_{\rm trap} \sim$ 8 without any radial dependence for the sample, suggesting
this value can be adopted in sub-grid feedback models. Moreover, we show that
the total pressure is greater than the gravitational pressure in the majority
of our sample, indicating that the feedback is sufficient to expel gas from the

with component masses of 23 and 2.6 solar masses. Motivated by the relatively
small rate of such a coalescence and the fact that the mass of the secondary is
close to the total mass of known binary neutron star (bNS) systems, we propose
that GW190814 was a second-generation merger from a hierarchical triple system,
i.e., the remnant from the bNS coalescence was able to merge again with the 23
Msun black hole (BH) tertiary. We show that this occurs at a sufficiently high
probability provided that the semimajor axis of the outer orbit is less than a
few AU at the time of bNS coalescence. It remains to be explored whether the
conditions for the formation of such tight triple systems are commonly realized
in the Universe, especially in low metallicity (less than 0.1 solar)
environments. Our model provides a number of predictions. (1) The spin of the
secondary in GW190814-like systems is 0.6 to 0.7. (2) The component mass
distribution from a large sample of LIGO sources should have a narrow peak
between 2.5 and ~3.5 Msun, whereas the range between ~3.5 and ~5 Msun stays
empty (provided that stellar evolution does not generate such BHs in the ""mass
gap""). (3) About 90% (10%) of GW190814-like events have an eccentricity of e >
2x10^{-3} (> 0.1) near gravitational wave frequency of 10 mHz. (4) A
significant fraction (> 10%) of bNS mergers should have signatures of a massive
tertiary at a distance of a few AU in the gravitational waveform. (5) There are
10^5 undetected radio-quiet bNS systems with a massive BH tertiary in the Milky
Way.

Measuring the rotation curve with the relative velocities of the H-alpha

mass. We develop a statistical model to describe the observed distribution in
the ratio of total to visible mass, from which we extract a galaxy's most
probable value for this mass ratio. We present the relationships between the
ratio of total to visible mass and several characteristics describing galactic
evolution, such as luminosity, gas-phase metallicity, distance to the nearest
neighbor, and position on the color-magnitude diagram. We find that faint
galaxies with low metallicities, typically in the blue cloud, have the highest
ratios of total to visible mass. Those galaxies that exhibit the second highest
ratios of total to visible mass are the brightest with high metallicities,
typically members of the red sequence or green valley. AGN activity is likely
both the quenching mechanism and the feedback that drives the mass ratio higher
in these massive galaxies. Finally, we introduce a parametrization that
predicts a galaxy's ratio of total to visible mass based on its photometry and
luminosity.

the context of stellar population synthesis models that include the effects of
stellar multiplicity, the difference in reddening of the nebular lines and
stellar continuum may imply molecular cloud crossing timescales that are a
factor of $\gtrsim 3\times$ longer than those inferred for local molecular
clouds, star-formation rates that are constant or increasing with time such
that newly-formed and dustier OB associations always dominate the ionizing

existing far-infrared and radio measurements of dust-continuum and molecular

dust-corrected H$\alpha$ emission (SFR(H$\alpha$)) and gas-phase oxygen
abundances from the ratio [NII]$\lambda 6584$/H$\alpha$. We find that the
dust-corrected SFR(H$\alpha$) is systematically lower than the bolometric SFR

Relative to a large $z\sim 2$ comparison sample from the MOSDEF survey, the
ALMA HUDF galaxies scatter roughly symmetrically around the best-fit linear
mass-metallicity relation, providing tentative evidence for a flattening in the
SFR dependence of metallicity at high stellar mass. Combining oxygen abundances

galaxies (UFDs). Both r- and s- processes produce these elements, and one can
infer the contribution of the r-process from the characteristic r-process
abundance pattern, whereas the s-process contribution remains largely unknown.
We show that the current s-process yield from asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars is not sufficient to explain the Ba and Sr abundances observed in UFDs.
Production of these elements would need to be efficient from the beginning of
star formation in the galaxies. The discrepancy of nearly or more than 1 dex is
not reconciled even if we consider s-process in super-AGB stars. We consider a
possible resolution by assuming rotating massive stars (RMSs) and
electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) as additional contributors. We find that
the RMSs could be the origin of Ba in UFDs if ~ 10 per cent of massive stars
are rotating at 300 km s^{-1}. As for ECSNe, we argue that their fraction is
less than 2 per cent of core-collapse supernova. It narrows the progenitor
mass-range to < 0.1 Msun at -3 < [Fe/H] < -2. We also explore another
resolution by modifying the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in UFDs and
find a top-light IMF model that reproduces the observed level of Ba-enrichment.
Future observations that determine or tightly constrain the europium and
nitrogen abundances are crucial to identify the origin of Ba and Sr in UFDs.

traditionally obtained by assuming an isothermal vertical velocity dispersion
of stars. Recent observations from SDSS, LAMOST, RAVE, Gaia etc show that this
dispersion increases with height from the mid-plane. Here we study the
dynamical effect of such non-isothermal dispersion on the self-consistent
vertical density distribution for the thin disc stars in the Galaxy, obtained
by solving together the Poisson equation and the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium. We find that in the non-isothermal case the mid-plane density is
lower, and the scale height is higher than the corresponding values for the
isothermal distribution, due to higher vertical pressure, hence the
distribution is vertically more extended. The change is ~35% at the solar
radius for a stars-alone disc for the typical observed linear gradient of +6.7
km $s^{-1}kpc^{-1}$ and becomes even higher with increasing radii and
increasing gradients explored. The distribution shows a wing at high z, in
agreement with observations, and is fitted well by a double $sech^{2}$ , which
could be mis-interpreted as the existence of a second, thicker disc, specially
in external galaxies. We also consider a more realistic disc consisting of
gravitationally coupled stars and gas in the field of dark matter halo. The
results show the same trend but the effect of non-isothermal dispersion is
reduced due to the opposite, constraining effect of the gas and halo gravity.
Further, the non-isothermal dispersion lowers the theoretical estimate of the
total mid-plane density i.e, Oort limit value, by 16%.

mass radius relation of planets compared to other popular equation of states

systematic larger densities than ANEOS or QEOS. A feature which was already

models. A potential explanation is that the planets formed from a population of
a few planetary embryos with masses of a few Earth masses which formed beyond
Saturn's orbit and migrated inwards. These embryos can collide and merge to
form Uranus and Neptune. In this work we revisit this formation scenario and
study the outcomes of such collisions using 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We
investigate under what conditions the perfect-merging assumption is
appropriate, and infer the planets' final masses, obliquities and rotation
periods, as well as the presence of proto-satellite disks. We find that the
total bound mass and obliquities of the planets formed in our simulations
generally agree with N-body simulations therefore validating the
perfect-merging assumption. The inferred obliquities, however, are typically
different from those of Uranus and Neptune, and can be roughly matched only in
a few cases. In addition, we find that in most cases the planets formed in this
scenario rotate faster than Uranus and Neptune, close to break-up speed, and
have massive disks. We therefore conclude that forming Uranus and Neptune in
this scenario is challenging, and further research is required. We suggest that
future planet formation models should aim to explain the various physical
properties of the planets such as their masses, compositions, obliquities,
rotation rates and satellite systems.

local Hilbert space and in weakly-coupled systems. Here, we propose a general
criterion for the existence of a well-defined regime of exponential growth of

requires the butterfly velocity to be much larger than the Lyapunov exponent

example, we study a random unitary circuit with tunable interactions. In this
model, we show that in the weakly interacting limit the above criterion is
satisfied, and there is a prolonged window of exponential growth. Our results
are based on numerical simulations of both Clifford and universal random

inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Focusing on a family of
interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral
description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the
influence matrix (IM), which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics
of a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a
self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values
of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect
dephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as
a perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin.
For the models considered here, we establish that PD points include
dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD
points, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a
short memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency
equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the IM
temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS
computations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in
terms of an effective ""statistical-mechanics"" description. We finally
illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing
how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix
approach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body
dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing
dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods,
and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.

generalization of the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) basis, the number of which
can be determined by counting the number of solutions of the generalized

public health research. Many clinical count outcomes, such as the number of

inflation, traditional power analysis methods for count data based on Poisson

a sample size method for CRTs with zero-inflated count outcomes. It is
developed based on GEE regression directly modeling the marginal mean of a ZIP

traditional modeling approaches. A closed-form sample size formula is derived
which properly accounts for zero inflation, ICCs due to clustering, unbalanced
randomization, and variability in cluster size. Robust approaches, including
t-distribution-based approximation and Jackknife re-sampling variance

Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed

  removed, exposition improved",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the Newtonian (gravitational) $n$-body problem in the Euclidean
$d$-dimensional space, the simplest possible solutions are provided by those
rigid motions (homographic solutions) in which each body moves along a
Keplerian orbit and the configuration of the $n$-body is a constant up to
rotations and scalings named \textit{central configuration}. For $d\leq 3$, the
only possible homographic motions are those given by central configurations.
For $d \geq 4$ instead, new possibilities arise due to the higher complexity of
the orthogonal group $O(d)$, as observed by Albouy and Chenciner. For instance,
in $\mathbb R^4$ it is possible to rotate in two mutually orthogonal planes
with different angular velocities. This produces a new balance between
gravitational forces and centrifugal forces providing new periodic and
quasi-periodic motions. So, for $d\geq 4$ there is a wider class of
$S$-\textit{balanced configurations} (containing the central ones) providing
simple solutions of the $n$-body problem, which can be characterized as well
through critical point theory. In this paper, we first provide a lower bound on
the number of balanced (non-central) configurations in $\mathbb R^d$, for
arbitrary $d\geq 4$, and establish a version of the $45^\circ$-theorem for
balanced configurations, thus answering some questions raised by Moeckel. Also,
a careful study of the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Poincar\'e
polynomial of the collision free configuration sphere will enable us to derive
some rather unexpected qualitative consequences on the count of $S$-balanced
configurations. In the last part of the paper, we focus on the case $d=4$ and
provide a lower bound on the number of periodic and quasi-periodic motions of
the gravitational $n$-body problem which improves a previous celebrated result
of McCord.

functional connectivity between different brain regions using resting-state
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One way to assess the
relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their
phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such
analyses, and here we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a
sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with
those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In
particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point
resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the
underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the
necessity of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. We review
various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS
framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods
through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results
indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related
to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations
common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds
the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS
matrices into recurring brain states.

the outcome of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a
dataset in which patients with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have
congestive heart failure. This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by
heavily relying on the biased attribute. We explore this problem across a
number of attributes in the context of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure. Applied to chest X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can
accurately identify many patient attributes including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and
age (AUROC >= 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit correlations between such
attributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis, leading
to poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population
(e.g., everyone in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning
approach is surprisingly effective at preventing the shortcut and promoting
good generalization performance. On the task of diagnosing congestive heart
failure based on a set of chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age >=

fluctuations are responsible for such fractality. Loop quantum gravity approach
provided the logarithmic corrections to the entropy. This correction arises

post-quench forces initially evolve rapidly to an extremal value, whereafter
they approach their steady state value algebraically in time. In contrast to
the previously-studied case of flat boundaries (lines or planes), the algebraic
decay for the curved geometries depends on the dimension of the system.
Specifically, the steady-state values of the force are approached in time as
$t^{-d/2}$ in d-dimensional spherical (curved) geometries. For systems
consisting of concentric circles or spheres, the exponent does not change for
the force on the outer circle or sphere. However, the force exerted on the
inner circle or sphere experiences an overshoot and, as a result, does not
evolve towards the steady state in a simple algebraic manner. The extremal
value of the force also depends on the dimension of the system, and originates
from the curved boundaries and the fact that particles inside a sphere or
circle are locally more confined, and diffuse less freely than particles
outside the circle or sphere.

the novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing
patients with the COVID-19 through radiography; thus, they are introduced as a
workable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Based on
the enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the

in this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those
with pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing
dataset included 1,828 x-ray images available on public platforms. 310 images
were showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases,

enhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest

using the enhanced VGG deep neural network can help radiologists automatically

where the objective is to map tasks to gates in a topology-aware fashion. This
is an NP-complete graph isomorphism problem, and existing task assignment
approaches are either heuristic or based on physical optimization algorithms,
providing different speed and solution quality trade-offs. Ising machines such
as quantum and digital annealers have recently become available and offer an
alternative hardware solution to solve this type of optimization problems. In
this paper, we propose an algorithm that allows solving the topology-aware
assignment problem using Ising machines. We demonstrate the algorithm on two
use cases, i.e. classical task scheduling and quantum circuit gate scheduling.
TIGER---topology-aware task/gate assignment mapper tool---implements our
proposed algorithms and automatically integrates them into the quantum software
environment. To address the limitations of physical solver, we propose and
implement a domain-specific partition strategy that allows solving larger-scale
problems and a weight optimization algorithm that allows tuning Ising model
parameters to achieve better restuls. We use D-Wave's quantum annealer to
demonstrate our algorithm and evaluate the proposed tool flow in terms of
performance, partition efficiency, and solution quality. Results show
significant speed-up compared to classical solutions, better scalability, and
higher solution quality when using TIGER together with the proposed partition

specification. Previous automated streamlining approaches have been limited in
evaluating only a single default model for each streamlined specification. In
this paper we explore the effect of model selection in the context of
streamlined specifications. We propose a new best-first search method that
generates a portfolio of Pareto Optimal streamliner-model combinations by
evaluating for each streamliner a portfolio of models to search and explore the
variability in performance and find the optimal model. Various forms of racing

benchmark problems well known and widely used by the community when developing
new algorithms. Constraint programming and automated planning are examples of
these areas, where the behaviour of a new algorithm is measured by how it
performs on these instances. Typically the efficiency of each solving method
varies not only between problems, but also between instances of the same
problem. Therefore, having a diverse set of instances is crucial to be able to
effectively evaluate a new solving method. Current methods for automatic
generation of instances for Constraint Programming problems start with a
declarative model and search for instances with some desired attributes, such
as hardness or size. We first explore the difficulties of adapting this
approach to generate instances starting from problem specifications written in
PDDL, the de-facto standard language of the automated planning community. We
then propose a new approach where the whole planning problem description is
modelled using Essence, an abstract modelling language that allows expressing
high-level structures without committing to a particular low level
representation in PDDL.

forward-modeling light-based sizes from simulations is desirable. In this work,
we use the {\skirt} dust radiative transfer code to generate synthetic
observations of massive galaxies ($M_{*}\sim10^{11}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z=2$,
hosted by haloes of mass $M_{\rm{halo}}\sim10^{12.5}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) from
high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations that form part of the Feedback
In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The simulations used in this paper
include explicit stellar feedback but no active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback. From each mock observation, we infer the effective radius ($R_e$), as
well as the stellar mass surface density within this radius and within
$1\,\rm{kpc}$ ($\Sigma_e$ and $\Sigma_1$, respectively). We first investigate
how well the intrinsic half-mass radius and stellar mass surface density can be
inferred from observables. The predicted sizes and surface densities are within
a factor of two of the intrinsic values. We then compare our predictions to the
observed size-mass relationship and the $\Sigma_1-M_\star$ and
$\Sigma_e-M_\star$ relationships. At $z\gtrsim2$, the simulated massive
galaxies are in general agreement with observational scaling relations. At
$z\lesssim2$, they evolve to become too compact but still star-forming, in the
stellar mass and redshift regime where many of them should be quenched. Our
results suggest that some additional source of feedback, such as AGN driven
outflows, is necessary in order to decrease the central densities of the
simulated massive galaxies to bring them into agreement with observations at

at low shock Mach numbers. In light of these challenges, it is worthwhile to
consider alternative mechanisms. One possibility is the adiabatic compression
by a shock wave of a residual fossil electron population which has been left
over from a radio galaxy jet. This paper applies this model to the relic hosted
in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3411-3412, where a radio bridge between the
relic and a radio galaxy has been observed, with the aim to reproduce the
spatial structure of the spectral index of the relic. Four scenarios are
presented, in which different effects are investigated, such as effects behind
the shock front and different shock strengths. The results show that the
adiabatic compression model can reproduce the observed spectral indices across
the relic for a shock Mach number that is lower than the value required by the
DSA-type modelling of this relic and is in accordance with the values derived
from X-ray observations, if other mechanisms, such as an expansion phase or
post-shock turbulence, are effective behind the shock front.

has been with us ever since in different variants and incarnations, including
the broader concept of Dark Energy. Current observations are consistent with a
value of Lambda corresponding to about present-epoch 70% of the critical
density of the Universe. This is causing the speeding up (acceleration) of the
expansion of the Universe over the past 6 billion years, a discovery recognised
by the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Coupled with the flatness of the Universe
and the amount of 30% matter (5% baryonic and 25% Cold Dark Matter), this forms
the so-called Lambda-CDM standard model, which has survived many observational
tests over about 30 years. However, there are currently indications of
inconsistencies (`tensions' ) within Lambda-CDM on different values of the
Hubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. Also, time variation of Dark Energy
and slight deviations from General Relativity are not ruled out yet. Several
grand projects are underway to test Lambda-CDM further and to estimate the
cosmological parameters to sub-percent level. If Lambda-CDM will remain the
standard model, then the ball is back in the theoreticians' court, to explain
the physical meaning of Lambda. Is Lambda an alteration to the geometry of the
Universe, or the energy of the vacuum? Or maybe it is something different, that
manifests a yet unknown higher-level theory?

contribution is the insertion of a new stage in the AMR pipeline, called corner

the recognition stage. We also introduce a publicly available dataset, called
Copel-AMR, that contains 12,500 meter images acquired in the field by the

evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system, which has three networks
operating in a cascaded mode, outperforms all baselines in terms of recognition
rate while still being quite efficient. Moreover, as very few reading errors
are tolerated in real-world applications, we show that our AMR system achieves
impressive recognition rates (i.e., > 99%) when rejecting readings made with

intelligent sensors and actuators equipped with advanced processing and

reduces energy cost and increases overall reliability, achieving effective
collaboration is challenging. The main challenges stem from the heterogeneity
of system agents and their collected information. Furthermore, the scale of
data collection is constantly increasing and many grid entities have strict
privacy requirements. Another challenge is the energy industry's common
practice of keeping data in silos. Federated computation is an approach well
suited to addressing these issues that are increasingly important for
multi-agent energy systems. Through federated computation, agents
collaboratively solve learning and optimization problems while respecting each
agent's privacy and overcoming barriers of cross-device and cross-organization
data isolation. In this paper, we first establish the need for federated
computations to achieve energy optimization goals of the future power grid. We
discuss practical challenges of performing multi-agent data processing in

Architecture Search (NAS) has seen significant attention throughout the AutoML
research community, and has pushed forward the state-of-the-art in a number of
neural models to address grid-like data such as texts and images. However, very
litter work has been done about Graph Neural Networks (GNN) learning on
unstructured network data. Given the huge number of choices and combinations of
components such as aggregator and activation function, determining the suitable
GNN structure for a specific problem normally necessitates tremendous expert
knowledge and laborious trails. In addition, the slight variation of hyper
parameters such as learning rate and dropout rate could dramatically hurt the
learning capacity of GNN. In this paper, we propose a novel AutoML framework
through the evolution of individual models in a large GNN architecture space
involving both neural structures and learning parameters. Instead of optimizing
only the model structures with fixed parameter settings as existing work, an
alternating evolution process is performed between GNN structures and learning
parameters to dynamically find the best fit of each other. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to introduce and evaluate evolutionary
architecture search for GNN models. Experiments and validations demonstrate
that evolutionary NAS is capable of matching existing state-of-the-art

the help of VAs. After characterizing the communication channel that is set up

can encode data into audio and send it via the phone channel. Such an attack,
which can be crafted remotely, at scale and at low cost, can be used to bypass
network defenses that may be deployed against leakage of sensitive data. We use
Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency tones to encode arbitrary binary data into audio that
can be played over computer speakers and sent through a VA mediated phone
channel to a remote system. We show that modest amounts of data can be
transmitted with high accuracy with a short phone call lasting a few minutes.
This can be done while making the audio nearly inaudible for most people by
modulating it with a carrier with frequencies that are near the higher end of
the human hearing range. Several factors influence the data transfer rate,
including the distance between the computer and the VA, the ambient noise that
may be present and the frequency of modulating carrier. With the help of a

degeneracies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that govern their dynamics. In
recent years, increasingly sophisticated models of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric

time-delayed coupling have been investigated, and such systems have been
realized across numerous platforms comprising optics, acoustics, mechanical

$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric (balanced gain and loss) system with memory, and
investigate its dynamics analytically and numerically. Our model consists of
two coupled $LC$ oscillators with positive and negative resistance,
respectively. We introduce memory by replacing either the resistor with a
memristor, or the coupling inductor with a meminductor, and investigate the
circuit energy dynamics as characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric or

find that energy dynamics depend on the sign and strength of initial voltages

self-organized Floquet dynamics, including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase
at vanishingly small dissipation strength. Our results indicate that

with the anticipated signal-to-noise enhancements will be challenging. We
explore here a calibration method that uses astronomical signals, namely
inspiral signals from compact-object binaries, and we show that it can in
principle enable calibration at the sub-1\% accuracy levels needed for future
gravitational wave science. We show how ensembles of these transient events can
be used to measure the calibration errors of individual detectors in a network
of three or more comparably sensitive instruments. As with telescopes, relative
calibration of gravitational-wave detectors using detected events is easier to
achieve than absolute calibration, which in principle would still need to be
done with a hardware method for at least one detector at one frequency. Our
proposed method uses the so-called null streams, the signal-free linear
combinations of the outputs of the detectors that exist in any network with
three or more differently oriented detectors. Signals do not appear in the null
stream if the signal amplitude in the detector output is faithful to that of
the real signal. Frequency-dependent calibration errors and relative
calibration and timing errors between detectors leave a residual in the null
stream. The amount of residual from each detector depends on the source
direction. We adapt the method of matched filtering to the problem of
extracting the calibration error of each detector from this residual. This
requires combining linearly the filter outputs of a sufficient number of
detected signals, and in principle it can achieve any desired accuracy in a
long enough observation run. We anticipate that A+ detector networks, expected
in 5 years, could employ this method to check anticipated hardware calibration
accuracies.

searching over a large search space of various CPS configurations and possible
values of components composing the system. Hence, there is a need for
sample-efficient CPS design space exploration to select the system architecture
and component values that meet the target system requirements. We address this
challenge by formulating CPS design as a multi-objective optimization problem
and propose DISPATCH, a two-step methodology for sample-efficient search over
the design space. First, we use a genetic algorithm to search over discrete
choices of system component values for architecture search and component
selection or only component selection and terminate the algorithm even before
meeting the system requirements, thus yielding a coarse design. In the second
step, we use an inverse design to search over a continuous space to fine-tune
the component values and meet the diverse set of system requirements. We use a
neural network as a surrogate function for the inverse design of the system.
The neural network, converted into a mixed-integer linear program, is used for
active learning to sample component values efficiently in a continuous search
space. We illustrate the efficacy of DISPATCH on electrical circuit benchmarks:
two-stage and three-stage transimpedence amplifiers. Simulation results show
that the proposed methodology improves sample efficiency by 5-14x compared to a
prior synthesis method that relies on reinforcement learning. It also
synthesizes circuits with the best performance (highest bandwidth/lowest area)
compared to designs synthesized using reinforcement learning, Bayesian
optimization, or humans.

the cutting plane method of Jiang, Lee, Song, and Wong [JLSW20].
  Our algorithm's runtime can be naturally interpreted as follows:
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \log (1/\epsilon))$ is the number of iterations needed
for our interior point method, $mn^2$ is the input size, and $m^\omega +

the incompatibility in quantum theory between unitary evolution and wave
function reduction in a measurement. This work resulted in a class of thought
experiments often called Wigner's Friend Scenarios, which have been providing
insights over many frameworks and interpretations of quantum theory. Recently,
a no-go theorem obtained by Daniela Frauchiger and Renato Renner brought
attention back to the Wigner's Friend and its potential of putting theories to
test. Many answers to this result pointed out how timing in the thought
experiment could be yielding a paradox. In this work, we ask what would happen
if the isolated friend in a Wigner's Friend Scenario did not share a time
reference frame with the outer observer, and time should be tracked by a
quantum clock. For this purpose, we recollect concepts provided by the theory
of quantum reference frames and the quantum resource theory of asymmetry, to
learn how to internalize time in this scenario, and introduce a model for a
feasible quantum clock proposed by Mischa P. Woods, Ralph Silva and Jonathan
Oppenheim, called the quasi-ideal clock. Our results have shown that no
decoherent behavior comes from this approach, and the disagreement between the
superobserver and its friend persists even for an imprecise clock on Wigner's
side. However, the gaussian spread of this clock model can control what
observables do not raise a paradox, indicating the relevance of deepening this
analysis.

orbital dynamics in the vicinity of $T_C\cong 140$ K, reminiscent of a
second-order phase transition, despite the (weakly) first-order nature of the

generation and recombination, but are related to the dynamics of Hubbard
exciton formation in the presence of a fluctuating many-body environment.

fundamentally a human activity and visual methods are more readily
interpretable. While efficient visual representations of high-dimensional data
exist, the loss of interpretable information, occlusion, and clutter continue
to be a challenge, which lead to quasi-explanations. We start with the
motivation and the different definitions of explainability. The paper focuses
on a clear distinction between quasi-explanations and domain specific
explanations, and between explainable and an actually explained ML model that
are critically important for the explainability domain. We discuss foundations
of interpretability, overview visual interpretability and present several types
of methods to visualize the ML models. Next, we present methods of visual
discovery of ML models, with the focus on interpretable models, based on the
recently introduced concept of General Line Coordinates (GLC). These methods
take the critical step of creating visual explanations that are not merely
quasi-explanations but are also domain specific visual explanations while these
methods themselves are domain-agnostic. The paper includes results on
theoretical limits to preserve n-D distances in lower dimensions, based on the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, point-to-point and point-to-graph GLC approaches,
and real-world case studies. The paper also covers traditional visual methods
for understanding ML models, which include deep learning and time series
models. We show that many of these methods are quasi-explanations and need
further enhancement to become domain specific explanations. We conclude with

environment and in the decision making engine. The former is reflected on the
behavioral changes due to communicating: few changes indicate rigid

communicating effort with few productive changes characterize a chaotic
environment. Hence, communicating, effective decision making and productive
behavioral changes are related. The entropy measures the indeterminacy of the
environment, and there is an entropy range in which communicating supports
effective decision making. This conjecture is referred to here as the The
Potential Productivity of Decisions.
  The computing engine that is causal to decision making should also have some
indeterminacy. However, computations performed by standard Turing Machines are
predetermined. To overcome this limitation an entropic mode of computing that
is called here Relational-Indeterminate is presented. Its implementation in a
table format has been used to model an associative memory. The present theory
and experiment suggest the Entropy Trade-off: There is an entropy range in
which computing is effective but if the entropy is too low computations are too
rigid and if it is too high computations are unfeasible. The entropy trade-off
of computing engines corresponds to the potential productivity of decisions of
the environment.
  The theory is referred to an Interaction-Oriented Cognitive Architecture.
Memory, perception, action and thought involve a level of indeterminacy and
decision making may be free in such degree. The overall theory supports an
ecological view of rationality. The entropy of the brain has been measured in
neuroscience studies and the present theory supports that the brain is an

propose to solve these subproblems using projected gradient descent on both the

further demonstrate that SAG can significantly reduce the computation and
memory overhead compared with the state-of-the-art approach, making SAG
applicable towards graphs with large size of nodes and edges.

initially empty(occupied) and linear $k$-mers ($k$ linear consecutive sites)
are randomly and sequentially deposited on(removed from) the lattice,

following the behavior of four critical concentrations with the size $k$,

$\theta^i_{c,k}$[$\vartheta^i_{c,k}$]. The obtained results indicate that:
$(1)$ $\theta_{c,k}$[$\theta^i_{c,k}$] exhibits a non-monotonous dependence

11$, then increases and asymptotically converges towards a definite value for
large $k$ $\theta_{c,k \rightarrow \infty}=0.500(2)$[$\theta^i_{c,k \rightarrow

found $\theta_{c,k} + \theta^i_{c,k} = 1$ (and $\vartheta_{c,k} +

This condition is analytically validated by using exact enumeration of

rich semantics that makes it possible to very concisely express complex

itself to generating explanations that are easier to translate into natural

underlying proof system, resolution. In this paper, we present a new tool LP2PB
that translates ASP programs into pseudo-Boolean theories, for which solvers
based on the (stronger) cutting plane proof system exist. We evaluate our tool,
and the potential of cutting-plane-based solving for ASP on traditional ASP
benchmarks as well as benchmarks from pseudo-Boolean solving. Our results are
mixed: overall, traditional ASP solvers still outperform our translational
approach, but several benchmark families are identified where the balance
shifts the other way, thereby suggesting that further investigation into a
stronger proof system for ASP is valuable.

identification of which hazards can be controlled and which ones cannot be
controlled by the existing safety patterns; and (2) automated recommendation of
which patterns could be used at which place of the system to control potential
hazards. Finally, we apply our machinery to two examples taken from the

NeurASP -- a simple extension of answer set programs by embracing neural

the properties of a refined sample of 283 \textit{Swift}/BAT gamma-ray bursts

level larger than 3$\sigma$. It is interestingly found that duration ($T_{90}$)
distribution of \textit{Swift} bursts still exhibits an evident bimodality with
a more reliable boundary of $T_{90}\simeq$1.06 s instead of 2 s for previously
contaminated samples including bursts without well-peaked spectra, which is
very close to $\sim$1.27 s and $\sim$0.8 s suggested by some authors for
Fermi/GBM and \textit{Swift}/BAT catalogs, respectively. The \textit{Swift}/BAT
short and long bursts have comparable mean $E_{\text p}$ values of
$87^{+112}_{-49}$ and $85^{+101}_{-46}$ keV in each, similar to what found for
both types of BATSE bursts, which manifests the traditional
short-hard/long-soft scheme may not be tenable for the certain energy window of
a detector. In statistics, we also investigate the consistency of distinct
methods for the $E_{\text p}$ estimates and find that Bayesian approach and
BAND function can always give consistent evaluations. In contrast, the
frequently-used cut-off power-law model matches two other methods for lower
$E_{\text p}$ and will overestimate the $E_{\text p}$ more than 70\% as
$E_{\text p}>$100 keV. Peak energies of X-ray flashes, X-ray rich bursts and
classical gamma-ray bursts could have an evolutionary consequence from
thermal-dominated to non-thermal-dominated radiation mechanisms. Finally, we
find that the $E_{\text p}$ and the observed fluence ($S_{\gamma}$) in the
observer frame are correlated as $E_p\simeq [S_{\gamma}/(10^{-5} erg\

outcomes is sometimes ignored in analyses of clinical trials. This leads to
biased estimates of study-level intervention effect and, consequently, a biased
estimate of the overall intervention effect in a meta-analysis. The current
study proposes a novel statistical approach, the Zero-inflation Bias Correction
(ZIBC) method, that can account for the bias introduced when using the Poisson
regression model, despite a high rate of inflated zeros in the outcome
distribution of a randomized clinical trial. This correction method only
requires summary information from individual studies to correct intervention
effect estimates as if they were appropriately estimated using the
zero-inflated Poisson regression model, thus it is attractive for meta-analysis
when individual participant-level data are not available in some studies.
Simulation studies and real data analyses showed that the ZIBC method performed
well in correcting zero-inflation bias in most situations.

and the autonomous decisions. We complement the meta-model with a template of
requirements elicitation questions to derive models for specific missions. We
also identify common scenarios where humans should collaborate with UAVs to
augment the autonomy of the UAVs. We introduce the meta-model and the
requirements elicitation process with examples drawn from a search-and-rescue
mission in which multiple UAVs collaborate with humans to respond to the
emergency. We then apply it to a second scenario in which UAVs support first
responders in fighting a structural fire. Our results show that the meta-model
and the template of questions support the modeling of the human-on-the-loop
human interactions for these complex missions, suggesting that it is a useful
tool for modeling the human-on-the-loop interactions for multi-UAVs missions.

interactions between dark matter and dark energy. Particularly, we describe
such interactions in the dark sector by considering diffusion models that
couple the cold dark matter fluid with the dark energy component, where the
latter has the form of a variable cosmological ""constant"". For the first time,
we solve the cosmological evolution of these models from the radiation
dominated era to the present day. We show how the diffusion processes take
place by analyzing the cosmological evolution of the energy density parameters
$\Omega_{cdm}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, as well as that of the Hubble parameter.
Finally, we perform the statistical analysis, imposing constraints on the
diffusion parameters, by using data from Planck 2018, SH0ES, Pantheon, and
H0LICOW collaborations. We found that cosmological diffusion models in the
framework of Unimodular Gravity can ease the current tension in the value of
$H_0$. We also show that the very far future cosmological evolution for all
diffusion models is eternally accelerating without future singularities.

with the distributed issue in machine learning and still guarantee high

their resources to join the FL algorithm. This motivates us to study the
incentive mechanism design for FL. In this paper, we consider a FL system that
involves one base station (BS) and multiple mobile users. The mobile users use
their own data to train the local machine learning model, and then send the
trained models to the BS, which generates the initial model, collects local
models and constructs the global model. Then, we formulate the incentive
mechanism between the BS and mobile users as an auction game where the BS is an
auctioneer and the mobile users are the sellers. In the proposed game, each
mobile user submits its bids according to the minimal energy cost that the
mobile users experiences in participating in FL. To decide winners in the
auction and maximize social welfare, we propose the primal-dual greedy auction
mechanism. The proposed mechanism can guarantee three economic properties,
namely, truthfulness, individual rationality and efficiency. Finally, numerical
results are shown to demonstrate the performance effectiveness of our proposed

  Learning","Best Student Paper Runner-up Award at ICDM 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph representation learning has attracted lots of attention recently.
Existing graph neural networks fed with the complete graph data are not
scalable due to limited computation and memory costs. Thus, it remains a great
challenge to capture rich information in large-scale graph data. Besides, these
methods mainly focus on supervised learning and highly depend on node label
information, which is expensive to obtain in the real world. As to unsupervised
network embedding approaches, they overemphasize node proximity instead, whose
learned representations can hardly be used in downstream application tasks
directly. In recent years, emerging self-supervised learning provides a
potential solution to address the aforementioned problems. However, existing
self-supervised works also operate on the complete graph data and are biased to
fit either global or very local (1-hop neighborhood) graph structures in
defining the mutual information based loss terms.
  In this paper, a novel self-supervised representation learning method via
Subgraph Contrast, namely \textsc{Subg-Con}, is proposed by utilizing the
strong correlation between central nodes and their sampled subgraphs to capture
regional structure information. Instead of learning on the complete input graph
data, with a novel data augmentation strategy, \textsc{Subg-Con} learns node
representations through a contrastive loss defined based on subgraphs sampled
from the original graph instead. Compared with existing graph representation
learning approaches, \textsc{Subg-Con} has prominent performance advantages in
weaker supervision requirements, model learning scalability, and
parallelization. Extensive experiments verify both the effectiveness and the
efficiency of our work compared with both classic and state-of-the-art graph
representation learning approaches on multiple real-world large-scale benchmark

Measures approach to faceted Rasch item response theory (IRT). We decompose the
target construct, hate speech in our case, into multiple constituent components
that are labeled as ordinal survey items. Those survey responses are
transformed via IRT into a debiased, continuous outcome measure. Our method
estimates the survey interpretation bias of the human labelers and eliminates
that influence on the generated continuous measure. We further estimate the
response quality of each labeler using faceted IRT, allowing responses from
low-quality labelers to be removed.
  Our faceted Rasch scaling procedure integrates naturally with a multitask
deep learning architecture for automated prediction on new data. The ratings on
the theorized components of the target outcome are used as supervised, ordinal
variables for the neural networks' internal concept learning. We test the use
of an activation function (ordinal softmax) and loss function (ordinal
cross-entropy) designed to exploit the structure of ordinal outcome variables.
Our multitask architecture leads to a new form of model interpretation because
each continuous prediction can be directly explained by the constituent
components in the penultimate layer.

speech to counterspeech. We evaluate Universal Sentence Encoders, BERT, and

for implicit surface reconstruction techniques, which typically assume a
closed, orientable surface. We show that by approximately interpolating a point
cloud of the surface (augmented with off-surface points) and restricting the
evaluation of the interpolant to a tight domain around the point cloud, we need
only require an orientable surface for the reconstruction. We use polyharmonic
smoothing splines to fit approximate interpolants to noisy data, and a
partition of unity method with an octree-like strategy for choosing subdomains.
This method enables us to interpolate an N-point dataset in O(N) operations. We
present results for point clouds of capsicum and tomato plants, scanned with a
handheld device. An important outcome of the work is that sufficiently smooth
leaf surfaces are generated that are amenable for droplet spreading
simulations.

according to whether they are spinless or spinful. This is especially crucial
for the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, as the two classes have
distinct symmetry algebra. As a prominent example, the spacetime inversion
symmetry $PT$ satisfies $(PT)^2=\pm 1$ for spinless/spinful systems, and each
class features unique topological phases. Here, we reveal a possibility to
switch the two fundamental classes via $\mathbb{Z}_2$ projective

transformation needed to recover the original $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge connections
under $P$. As a result, we can achieve topological phases originally unique for
spinful systems in a spinless system, and vice versa. We explicitly demonstrate
the claimed mechanism with several concrete models, such as Kramers degenerate

topological phases in spinful systems. Possible experimental realization of
these models is discussed. Our work breaks a fundamental limitation on
topological phases and opens an unprecedented possibility to realize intriguing

However, most state-of-the-art person ReID approaches, typically driven by a

issue, we introduce a novel pairwise loss function that enables ReID models to
learn the fine-grained features by adaptively enforcing an exponential
penalization on the images of small differences and a bounded penalization on
the images of large differences. The proposed loss is generic and can be used

dust mass. The fit results depend on the assumed value for FIR/submm opacity,
which in most models - due to the scarcity, until recently, of experimental
measurements - is extrapolated from shorter wavelengths. Lab measurements of
dust analogues, however, show that FIR opacities are usually higher than the
values used in models and depend on temperature, which suggests that dust mass
estimates may be biased. To test the extent of this bias, we create
multi-wavelength synthetic photometry for dusty galaxies at different
temperatures and redshifts, using experimental results for FIR/submm dust
opacity, then we fit the synthetic data using standard dust models. We find
that the dust masses recovered by typical models are overestimated by a factor
2 to 20, depending on how the experimental opacities are treated. If the
experimental dust samples are accurate analogues of interstellar dust,
therefore, current dust masses are overestimated by up to a factor 20. The

formulated as control/optimization problems. The computational models for such
systems generally contain hyperparameters, which control solution fidelity and
computational expense. The tuning of these parameters is non-trivial and the
general approach is to manually `spot-check' for good combinations. This is
because optimal hyperparameter configuration search becomes impractical when
the parameter space is large and when they may vary dynamically. To address
this issue, we present a framework based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) to
train a deep neural network agent that controls a model solve by varying
parameters dynamically. First, we validate our RL framework for the problem of
controlling chaos in chaotic systems by dynamically changing the parameters of
the system. Subsequently, we illustrate the capabilities of our framework for
accelerating the convergence of a steady-state CFD solver by automatically
adjusting the relaxation factors of discretized Navier-Stokes equations during
run-time. The results indicate that the run-time control of the relaxation
factors by the learned policy leads to a significant reduction in the number of
iterations for convergence compared to the random selection of the relaxation
factors. Our results point to potential benefits for learning adaptive
hyperparameter learning strategies across different geometries and boundary
conditions with implications for reduced computational campaign expenses.

fluctuation over the known backgrounds have been reported. To delineate their
origin, a fluctuation analysis of the deepest optical images was performed,
leading to the detection of a flat fluctuation down to 0.2 arcsec, which is
much larger than that expected for galaxies. The sky brightness obtained from
the detected fluctuation is a few times brighter than the integrated light of
the galaxies. These findings require some new objects. As a candidate, faint
compact objects (FCOs) whose surface number density rapidly increases to the
faint end were proposed. FCOs are very compact and show peculiar spectra with
infrared excess. If FCOs cause the excess brightness and fluctuation, the
surface number density reaches 2.6e3 in 1 square arcsec. Gamma ray observations
require the redshift of FCOs to be less than 0.1 with FCOs consisting of
missing baryons. A very low M/L indicates that FCOs are powered by
gravitational energy associated with black holes.

growth of trees nowadays known as the Leonardo's rule. This rule relates the
thickness of the stem with the thickness of the branches at different
bifurcation stages in a Pythagorean fashion. He argued that his rule was the
result of the conservation of sap flux. In the present work, we explore this
idea by assuming that the sap flux through each xylem element behaves as a
non-ideal fluid and the size-distribution of the xylem elements obeys a power
law distribution. We find that the simultaneous fulfillment of Leonardo's rule
and the conservation of the sap flux, lead to a global behavior of the sap like
that of an ideal fluid after summing over all xylem elements. These results are
supported by field and experimental work. In particular, we corroborated the
Leonardo's rule in different tree species by measuring the stem-branches
thickness at different bifurcations stages. We also determined the statistical
size-distribution of the xylem elements through a maceration process, finding
that it corresponds to a power law distribution with an exponent close to
three, which is the exponent required for the Leonardo's rule. As far as we
know this is the first time that a statistical hydraulic model supported by
experimental data is presented for the Leonardo's rule.

sources of gravitational waves are binary black hole or neutron star mergers,
the only objects that have been observed by detectors to date. But also
gravitational waves from core collapse supernovae, rapidly rotating neutron
stars, and the stochastic gravitational wave background are in the sensitivity
band of the ground-based interferometers and expected to be observable in

not comprehensive enough in terms of achieving accuracy as well as reminding

models to generate target sequence. Along with three accuracy metrics, we

objects with weak contrast in X-ray absorption index but strong contrast in
refractive index decrement. To reconstruct an object imaged using XPCT, phase
retrieval algorithms are first used to estimate the X-ray phase projections,
which is the 2D projection of the refractive index decrement, at each view.
Phase retrieval is followed by refractive index decrement reconstruction from
the phase projections using an algorithm such as filtered back projection
(FBP). In practice, phase retrieval is most commonly solved by approximating it
as a linear inverse problem. However, this linear approximation often results
in artifacts and blurring when the conditions for the approximation are
violated. In this paper, we formulate phase retrieval as a non-linear inverse
problem, where we solve for the transmission function, which is the negative
exponential of the projections, from XPCT measurements. We use a constraint to
enforce proportionality between phase and absorption projections. We do not use
constraints such as large Fresnel number, slowly varying phase, or Born/Rytov
approximations. Our approach also does not require any regularization parameter
tuning since there is no explicit sparsity enforcing regularization function.
We validate the performance of our non-linear phase retrieval (NLPR) method
using both simulated and real synchrotron datasets. We compare NLPR with a
popular linear phase retrieval (LPR) approach and show that NLPR achieves
sharper reconstructions with higher quantitative accuracy.

critical applications like medical image analysis. This process indeed adds an
extra burden to the already tedious annotation work that usually requires
professional training and expertise in the specific domains. On the other hand,
automated annotation methods based on NLP algorithms have recently shown
promise as a reasonable alternative, relying on the existing diagnostic reports
of those images that are widely available in the clinical system. Compared to
human labelers, different algorithms provide labels with varying qualities that
are even noisier. In this paper, we show how noisy annotations (e.g., from
different algorithm-based labelers) can be utilized together and mutually
benefit the learning of classification tasks. Specifically, the concept of
attention-on-label is introduced to sample better label sets on-the-fly as the
training data. A meta-training based label-sampling module is designed to
attend the labels that benefit the model learning the most through additional
back-propagation processes. We apply the attention-on-label scheme on the
classification task of a synthetic noisy CIFAR-10 dataset to prove the concept,

temperature range for WR stars is much broader than that of their O-star

variability in the strong emission lines from the dense winds of these three

Temperature and terminal velocity are correlated, so faster winds show a lower
variability, though this trend goes against any predictions made involving Line
Deshadowing Instability (LDI) only, implying that instabilities intrinsic to
LDI are not the main source of wind clumping. Instead, it could be taken as
support for the suggestion that clumps are caused by a sub-surface convection
zone (SSCZ) at T ~ 170 kK, since such an SSCZ would have little opportunity to
operate under the hydrostatic surface of these hottest WR stars. It is still
possible, however, that an SSCZ-related driver could interact with nonlinear
line instability effects to enhance or possibly even produce clumps.

recently confirmed as originating from the Galactic magnetar soft gamma
repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154. Just before and after FRB 200428 was detected,
the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) had been
monitoring SGR J1935+2154 for eight hours. From UTC 2020 April 27 23:55:00 to
2020 April 28 00:50:37, FAST detected no pulsed radio emission from SGR
J1935+2154, while Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor registered 34 bursts in the
X/soft $\gamma$-ray band, forming a unique sample of X-ray bursts in the
absence of FRBs. After a comprehensive analysis on light curves,
time-integrated, and time-resolved spectral properties of these FRB-absent
X-ray bursts, we compare this sample with the FRB-associated X-ray burst
detected by Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind. The FRB-associated burst
distinguishes itself from other X-ray bursts by its nonthermal spectrum and a
higher spectral peak energy, but otherwise is not atypical. We also compare the
cumulative energy distribution of our X-ray burst sample with that of first
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102, with the calibration of FRB 200428-X-ray
burst association. We find a similarity between the two, offering indirect
support of the magnetar origin of cosmological FRBs. The event rate density of
magnetar bursts is about $\sim 150$ times higher than the FRB event rate
density at the energy of FRB 200428. This again suggests that, if all FRBs
originate from magnetars, only a small fraction of X-ray bursts are associated
with FRBs.

including medical diagnostics, fraud detection, and others. It causes bias in
classification algorithms leading to poor performance on the minority class
data. In this paper, we propose a novel method for balancing the class
distribution in data through intelligent resampling of the minority class
instances. The proposed method is based on generating new minority instances in
the neighborhood of the existing minority points via a gamma distribution. Our
method offers a natural and coherent approach to balancing the data. We conduct
a comprehensive numerical analysis of the new sampling technique. The
experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced data. Concretely, the new sampling
technique produces the best results on 12 out of 24 real life as well as
synthetic datasets. For comparison, the SMOTE method achieves the top score on
only 1 dataset. We conclude that the new technique offers a simple yet
effective sampling approach to balance data.

analyticity-based sink strength terms in rate equations by surrogate models of
machine learning representation. Here we emphasise, in the context of
multiscale modelling, a combinative use of machine learning with scale
analysis, through which a set of fine-resolution problems of partial
differential equations describing the (quasi-steady) short-range individual
sink behaviour can be asymptotically sorted out from the mean-field kinetics.
Hence the training of machine learning is restrictively oriented, that is, to
express the local and already identified, but analytically unavailable
nonlinear functional relationships between the sink strengths and other local
continuum field quantities. With the trained models, one is enabled to
quantitatively investigate the biased effect shown by a void/bubble being a
point defect sink, and the results are compared with existing ones over
well-studied scenarios. Moreover, the faster diffusive mechanisms on
crystalline interfaces are distinguishingly modelled by locally planar rate
equations, and their linkages with rate equations for bulk diffusion are
formulated through derivative jumps of point defect concentrations across the
interfaces. Thus the distinctive role of crystalline interfaces as partial
sinks and quick diffusive channels can be investigated. Methodologicalwise, the
present treatment is also applicable for studying more complicated situation of
long-term sink behaviour observed in irradiated materials.

filaments, a solar active-region filament (labeled F2) eruption associated with
a B-class flare was investigated by using high-resolution H$\alpha$ data from
the 1 m New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), combined with EUV observations of
the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). The filament F2 was disturbed by another
filament (labeled F1) eruption that experienced a whip-like motion. Before the
filament F2 eruption, the Dopplergrams show that the southern and the northern
parts of the filament F2 body exhibit blueshift and redshift along the filament
spine, simultaneously. It implies that the filament F2 was rolling from one
side to the other. During the filament F2 eruption, the Doppler velocity shifts
of the filament body are opposite to that before its eruption. It demonstrates
that the filament body exhibits an untwisting motion, which can be also
identified by tracing the movement of the eruptive filament threads. Moreover,
it is found that the material of the filament F2 was transferred to the
surrounding magnetic field loops, which is caused by magnetic reconnection
between the filament F2 and the surrounding magnetic loops. According to the
right-bearing threads of the filament F2 before its eruption, it can be deduced
that the filament F2 is initially supported by a sheared arcade. The following
observations reveal that the twisted magnetic structure of the filament F2
formed in the eruption phase.

X-ray source associated with a longest middle ribbon was observed in the second

that the identifying code problem for axis-parallel unit square intersection

the \lya\ emission than that in the SXR emission, while type II has nearly a
same peak time (within the time resolution of 10 s) between the \lya\ and SXR

flares, 10 (1.5\%) type II flares, and 143 (21.7\%) type III flares, and that
the three types appear to have no dependence on the flare duration, flare
location, or solar cycle. Besides the main peak, the \lya\ emission of the
three type flares also shows sub-peaks which can appear in the impulsive or
gradual phase of the flare. It is found that the main-peak (for type I) and
sub-peak (for type III) emissions of \lya\ that appear in the impulsive phase
follow the Neupert effect in general. This indicates that such \lya\ emissions
are related to the nonthermal electron beam heating. While the main-peak (for

representations model the semantic information of all entities in the document,
entity local representations aggregate the contextual information of multiple
mentions of specific entities, and context relation representations encode the
topic information of other relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance on two public datasets for document-level

still a challenging task. It is often solved either with tedious manual work or
motion capture based techniques that require specialised and costly hardware.
Example based animation approaches circumvent these problems by re-using
captured data of real people. This data is split into short motion samples that
can be looped or concatenated in order to create novel motion sequences. The
obvious advantages of this approach are the simplicity of use and the high
realism, since the data exhibits only real deformations. Rather than tuning
weights of a complex face rig, the animation task is performed on a higher
level by arranging typical motion samples in a way such that the desired facial
performance is achieved. Two difficulties with example based approaches,
however, are high memory requirements as well as the creation of artefact-free
and realistic transitions between motion samples. We solve these problems by
combining the realism and simplicity of example-based animations with the
advantages of neural face models. Our neural face model is capable of
synthesising high quality 3D face geometry and texture according to a compact
latent parameter vector. This latent representation reduces memory requirements
by a factor of 100 and helps creating seamless transitions between concatenated
motion samples. In this paper, we present a marker-less approach for facial
motion capture based on multi-view video. Based on the captured data, we learn
a neural representation of facial expressions, which is used to seamlessly
concatenate facial performances during the animation procedure. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach by synthesising mouthings for Swiss-German
sign language based on viseme query sequences.

at the ESO/VLT to search for faint (sub)stellar companions. We utilized the
classical coronagraphic imaging mode to perform a snapshot survey (3-6 min
integration time) of exoplanet host stars in the Ks-band. We detected new
stellar companions to the exoplanet host stars HD1666, HIP68468, HIP107773, and
HD109271. With an angular separation of only 0.38"" (40 au of projected
separation) HIP107773 is among the closest companions found to exoplanet host
stars. The presence of the stellar companion explains the linear
radial-velocity trend seen in the system. At such a small separation the
companion likely had significant influence on the evolution of the planet
forming disk around the primary star. We find that the companion in the HD1666
system may well be responsible for the high orbit eccentricity (0.63) of the
detected Jupiter class planet, making this system one of only a few where such
a connection can be established. A cross-match with the Gaia DR2 catalog showed

such a problem. However, most embedding algorithms and GNNs are difficult to

tackle the problem from a new perspective based on the equivalence of three
constrained optimization problems: the network embedding problem, the trace
maximization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph, and the
matrix factorization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph. The
optimal solutions to these three problems are the dominant eigenvectors of the
modularity matrix. We proposed two algorithms that belong to a special class of
graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for solving these problems: (i) Clustering
As Feature Embedding GCN (CAFE-GCN) and (ii) sphere-GCN. Both algorithms are
stable trace maximization algorithms, and they yield good approximations of
dominant eigenvectors. Moreover, there are linear-time implementations for
sparse graphs. In addition to solving the network embedding problem, both
proposed GCNs are capable of performing dimensionality reduction. Various
experiments are conducted to evaluate our proposed GCNs and show that our

structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. The trails consist predominantly of
cometary particles with sizes of approximately 0.1 mm to 1 cm which are ejected
at low speeds and remain very close to the comet orbit for several revolutions
around the Sun. When re-analysing the Helios dust data measured in the 1970s,
Altobelli et al. (2006) recognized a clustering of seven impacts, detected in a
very narrow region of space at a true anomaly angle of 135 deg, which the
authors considered as potential cometary trail particles. We re-analyse these
candidate cometary trail particles to investigate the possibility that some or
all of them indeed originate from cometary trails and we constrain their source
comets. The Interplanetary Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust
streams in space model is a new universal model for cometary meteoroid streams
in the inner solar system, developed by Soja et al. (2015). Using IMEX we study
cometary trail traverses by Helios. During ten revolutions around the Sun, and
in the narrow region of space where Helios detected the candidate dust
particles, the spacecraft repeatedly traversed the trails of comets
45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajduvsakova and 72P/Denning-Fujikawa. Based on the detection
times and particle impact directions, four detected particles are compatible
with an origin from these two comets. We find a dust spatial density in these
trails of about 10^-8 to 10^-7 m^-3. The in-situ detection and analysis of
meteoroid trail particles which can be traced back to their source bodies by
spacecraft-based dust analysers opens a new window to remote compositional

aureus plasmid pUB110. The recombinant strain, designated BBG100, produced up
to 15-fold more mycosubtilin than the wild type produced. The overproducing
phenotype was related to enhancement of the antagonistic activities against
several yeasts and pathogenic fungi. Hemolytic activities were also clearly
increased in the modified strain. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched
mycosubtilin extracts showed similar patterns of lipopeptides for BBG100 and
the wild type. Interestingly, these analyses also revealed a new form of
mycosubtilin which was more easily detected in the BBG100 sample. When tested
for its biocontrol potential, wild-type strain ATCC 6633 was almost ineffective
for reducing a Pythium infection of tomato seedlings. However, treatment of
seeds with the BBG100 overproducing strain resulted in a marked increase in the
germination rate of seeds. This protective effect afforded by mycosubtilin
overproduction was also visualized by the significantly greater fresh weight of
emerging seedlings treated with BBG100 compared to controls or seedlings
inoculated with the wild-type strain.

between the primary and tertiary (3D) structures. Precise prediction of
eight-state protein secondary structure (PSS) has significantly utilized in the
structural and functional analysis of proteins in bioinformatics. Deep learning
techniques have been recently applied in this research area and raised the
eight-state (Q8) protein secondary structure prediction accuracy remarkably.
Nevertheless, from a theoretical standpoint, there are still lots of rooms for
improvement, specifically in the eight-state PSS prediction. In this study, we
have presented a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), namely PS8-Net,
to enhance the accuracy of eight-class PSS prediction. The input of this
architecture is a carefully constructed feature matrix from the proteins
sequence features and profile features. We introduce a new PS8 module in the
network, which is applied with skip connection to extracting the long-term
inter-dependencies from higher layers, obtaining local contexts in earlier
layers, and achieving global information during secondary structure prediction.
Our proposed PS8-Net achieves 76.89%, 71.94%, 76.86%, and 75.26% Q8 accuracy
respectively on benchmark CullPdb6133, CB513, CASP10, and CASP11 datasets. This
architecture enables the efficient processing of local and global
interdependencies between amino acids to make an accurate prediction of each
class. To the best of our knowledge, PS8-Net experiment results demonstrate
that it outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods on the aforementioned
benchmark datasets.

we modulate the intermediate features using Global Feature Modulation (GFM), of

considerably by contamination with thick tin deposits that cannot be removed
sufficiently fast by plasma etching. For tin droplet splats sticking to large
substrates, we have developed and compared several efficient cleaning
techniques based on cryogenic cooling. A silicon carbide substrate and
different silicon wafer samples with up to 6 inch diameter with the surface
uncoated, multilayer-coated, unstructured and grating-structured were tested.
After tin dripping onto heated samples, embrittlement of droplet contamination
is induced in-situ by stresses during phase transformation, following the
initiation of tin pest with seed crystals of gray tin. Conversion of initially
adhesive deposits to loose gray tin has been reached in less than 24 hours on
all tested surfaces by continuous cooling with cold nitrogen vapor to
temperatures in the range of -30 to -50 {\deg}C. Alternatively,
stress-initiated tin-removal by delamination of beta-Sn droplet splats has been
attained via contraction strain induced by strong cooling to temperatures of
around -120 {\deg}C. Profilometry has been used to analyze the bottom side of
tin droplet splats removed from a grating-structured wafer. The in-situ tin
cleaning techniques give results comparable to fast ex-situ cleaning that has
been achieved either by sample immersion in liquid nitrogen or by splat removal
after CO2 snowflake aerosol impact using a hand-held jet-nozzle. The
implementation of the in-situ phase-conversion concept for the cleaning of

computer-assisted treatment systems for thermal ablation. It can be used to
predict tissue temperatures and ablation volumes for personalised treatment
planning and image-guided intervention. Numerically, it requires full nonlinear
modelling of the coupled computational bioheat transfer and biomechanics, and
efficient solution procedures; however, existing studies considered the bioheat
analysis alone or the coupled linear analysis, without the fully coupled
nonlinear analysis. We present a coupled thermo-visco-hyperelastic finite
element algorithm, based on finite-strain thermoelasticity and total Lagrangian
explicit dynamics. It considers the coupled nonlinear analysis of (i) bioheat
transfer under soft tissue deformations and (ii) soft tissue deformations due
to thermal expansion/shrinkage. The presented method accounts for anisotropic,
finite-strain, temperature-dependent, thermal, and viscoelastic behaviours of
soft tissues, and it is implemented using GPU acceleration for real-time
computation. We also demonstrate the translational benefits of the presented
method for clinical applications using a simulation of thermal ablation in the
liver. The key advantage of the presented method is that it enables full
nonlinear modelling of the anisotropic, finite-strain, temperature-dependent,
thermal, and viscoelastic behaviours of soft tissues, instead of linear
elastic, linear viscoelastic, and thermal-only modelling in the existing
methods. It also provides high computational speeds for computer-assisted
treatment systems towards enabling the operator to simulate thermal ablation
accurately and visualise tissue temperatures and ablation zones immediately.

learning is an efficient and accurate way to detect COVID-19 infections.
However, sharing diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually not
allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy. This causes the issue of
insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated
learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that
produces an unbiased global model based on the received updates of local models
trained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. Nevertheless, the
default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication cost of
transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data
heterogeneity of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency
and model performance, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based
federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect
COVID-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based
federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Further, we
present a dynamic fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients
according to their local model performance and schedule the model fusion-based
on participating clients' training time. In addition, we summarise a category
of medical diagnostic image datasets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used
by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results
show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the
default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance,
communication efficiency and fault tolerance.

distributions termed Fluctuation or mother and Trends or father, with specific
spectra is initially generated. The spectral properties of the trend function,
allow to target efficiently the basin of optimal solutions. For optimizing a 1D
metasurface to deflect a normally incident plane wave into a given deflecting
angle, a cosine-like function has been identified to be an optimal father
profile allowing to efficiently target a basin of local minima. However there
is no efficient method to predict the father profile number of oscillations
that effectively allows to avoid undesirable local optima. It would be natural
to suggest a randomization of the variable which controls the number of
oscillations of the father function. However, one of the main drawbacks of the
randomness searching process is that, combined with a gradient method, the
algorithm can target, undesirable local minima. The method proposed in this
paper improves the possibility of the classical FTA to avoid the trapping of
undesirable local optimal solutions. This is accomplished by extending the
initial candidate family to higher quality offspring that are generated thanks
to a diamond-square-algorithm (DSA). Doing so, ensures that the main features
of the best trends are stored in the genes of all Offspring structures.

Increasing solutal Marangoni stress enhances spreading rates in all cases,
approaching those of superspreading liquids. To validate our model, experiments

a special class of sources with outstanding scientific significance. TDEs can
generate ultrafast winds, which should almost inevitably collide with the
preexisting AGN dusty tori. We perform analytical calculations and simulations
on the wind-torus interactions and find such a process can generate
considerable X-ray afterglow radiation several years or decades later after the
TDE outburst. This provides a new origin for the years delayed X-rays in TDEs.
The X-ray luminosity can reach 10^{41-42} erg/s, and the light curve
characteristics depend on the parameters of winds and tori. We apply the model
to two TDE candidates, and provide lower limits on the masses of the disrupted
stars, as well as rigorous constraints on the gas densities of tori. Our
results suggest that the observations of the time delay, spectral shape,
luminosity and the light curve of the X-ray afterglow can be used to constrain
the physical parameters of both TDE winds and tori, including the wind
velocity, wind density and torus density.

on the Long-Range (LoRa) physical layer (PHY) framework. LoRa PHY employs CSS
on top of a variant of frequency shift keying (FSK), and non-coherent detection
is employed at the receiver for obtaining the transmitted data symbols. In this
paper, we propose a scheme that encodes information bits on both in-phase and
quadrature components of the chirp signal, and rather employs a coherent
detector at the receiver. Hence, channel equalization is required for
compensating the channel induced phase rotation on the transmit signal.
Moreover, a simple channel estimation technique exploits the LoRa reference
sequences used for synchronization to obtain the complex channel coefficient
used in the equalizer. Performance evaluation using numerical simulation shows
that the proposed scheme achieves approximately 1 dB gain in terms of energy
efficiency, and it doubles the spectral efficiency when compared to the
conventional LoRa PHY scheme. This is due to the fact that the coherent
receiver is able to exploit the orthogonality between in-phase and quadrature
components of the transmit signal.

  rotation parallel to the magnetic field","26 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is believed that plasma rotation can affect the transitions to the
advanced confinement regimes in tokamaks. In addition, in order to achieve
fusion temperatures modern tokamaks rely on auxiliary heating methods. These
methods generate pressure anisotropy in the plasma. For incompressible rotation
with pressure anisotropy the equilibrium is governed by a Generalized
Grad-Shafranov (GGS) equation and a decoupled Bernoulli-type equation for the
effective pressure, $\bar{p}=(p_\parallel+p_\perp)/2$, where $p_\parallel$
($p_\perp$) is the pressure tensor element parallel (perpendicular) to the
magnetic field. In the case of plasma rotation parallel to the magnetic field
the GGS equation can be transformed to one equation identical in form with the
GS equation. In this study by making use of the aforementioned property of the
GGS equation for parallel plasma rotation we have constructed ITER-like
numerical equilibria by extending HELENA, an equilibrium fixed-boundary solver
and examined the impact of rotation and anisotropy on certain equilibrium
quantities. The main conclusions are that the addition of pressure anisotropy
to rotation allows the profile shaping of the equilibrium quantities in much
more extent thus favouring the confinement and allows extension of the
parametric space of the Mach number corresponding to higher values.
Furthermore, the impact of pressure anisotropy in the equilibrium quantities is
stronger than that of the rotation, for most of the quantities examined. For
the pressure components the impact of the pressure anisotropy is the same
regardless of whether the power is deposited parallel or perpendicular to the
magnetic surfaces, thus implying that there is no preferable heating direction,
while for the current density, the heating parallel to the magnetic surfaces
seems to be beneficial for the current-gradient driven instabilities.

on boundedness, blow-up and asymptotical behavior of solutions for a combined
chemotaxis-haptotaxis model in 2D settings. It is well-known that the
corresponding Keller-Segel chemotaxis-only model possesses a striking feature
of critical mass blow-up phenomenon, namely, subcritical mass ensures
boundedness, whereas, supercritical mass induces the existence of blow-ups.
Herein, we show that this critical mass blow-up phenomenon stays almost the
same in the full chemotaxis-haptotaxis model. For negligibility of haptotaxis
on asymptotical behavior, we show that any global-in-time haptotaxis solution
component vanishes exponentially as time approaches infinity, and the other two
solution components converge exponentially to that of chemotaxis-only model in
a global sense for suitably large chemo-sensitivity and in the usual sense for
suitably small chemo-sensitivity. Therefore, the aforementioned critical mass
blow-up phenomenon for the chemotaxis-only model is almost undestroyed even
with arbitrary introduction of haptotaixs, showing negligibility of haptotaxis

frequencies ranging from nanoHz to KHz that covers the observational scales

PBHs which would be valid for a large class of ultra slow roll inflationary

epoch on both the ISGWB and the derived lower mass bound. We find that any
non-instantaneous reheating leads to an even stronger lower bound on PBHs mass

early matter dominated phase leads to a secondary amplification of ISGWB at
much smaller scales corresponding to the smallest comoving scale leaving the

classical counterparts. As a concrete example, in case where the second-order

non-stationary classical noise, the higher-order quantum correlations can
single out a quantum target from the classical noise background, regardless of

compact representation of the user goal in the context of dialogue history.
Dialogue state tracking (DST) is to estimate the dialogue state at each turn.
Due to the dependency on complicated dialogue history contexts, DST data
annotation is more expensive than single-sentence language understanding, which
makes the task more challenging. In this work, we formulate DST as a sequence
generation problem and propose a novel dual-learning framework to make full use
of unlabeled data. In the dual-learning framework, there are two agents: the
primal tracker agent (utterance-to-state generator) and the dual utterance
generator agent (state-to-utterance genera-tor). Compared with traditional
supervised learning framework, dual learning can iteratively update both agents
through the reconstruction error and reward signal respectively without labeled
data. Reward sparsity problem is hard to solve in previous DST methods. In this
work, the reformulation of DST as a sequence generation model effectively
alleviates this problem. We call this primal tracker agent dual-DST.
Experimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 dataset show that the proposed dual-DST
works very well, especially when labelled data is limited. It achieves
comparable performance to the system where labeled data is fully used.

language query. The challenges of this task include 1) the requirement of
localizing the relevant moment in an untrimmed video, and 2) bridging the
semantic gap between textual query and video contents. To tackle those
problems, early approaches adopt the sliding window or uniform sampling to
collect video clips first and then match each clip with the query. Obviously,
these strategies are time-consuming and often lead to unsatisfied accuracy in
localization due to the unpredictable length of the golden moment. To avoid the
limitations, researchers recently attempt to directly predict the relevant
moment boundaries without the requirement to generate video clips first. One
mainstream approach is to generate a multimodal feature vector for the target
query and video frames (e.g., concatenation) and then use a regression approach
upon the multimodal feature vector for boundary detection. Although some
progress has been achieved by this approach, we argue that those methods have
not well captured the cross-modal interactions between the query and video
frames.
  In this paper, we propose an Attentive Cross-modal Relevance Matching (ACRM)
model which predicts the temporal boundaries based on an interaction modeling.
In addition, an attention module is introduced to assign higher weights to
query words with richer semantic cues, which are considered to be more
important for finding relevant video contents. Another contribution is that we
propose an additional predictor to utilize the internal frames in the model
training to improve the localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on two

number of colors in a cyclic coloring of a plane graph $G$ is its cyclic

  In this note we show that to prove the Cyclic Coloring Conjecture of Borodin

\lfloor \frac{3}{2}\Delta^*(G)\rfloor$, it is enough to do it for subdivisions
of simple $3$-connected plane graphs.
  We have discovered four new different upper bounds on $\chi_c(G)$ for graphs
$G$ from this restricted family; three bounds of them are tight. As
corollaries, we have shown that the conjecture holds for subdivisions of plane
triangulations, simple $3$-connected plane quadrangulations, and simple
$3$-connected plane pentagulations with an even maximum face degree, for
regular subdivisions of simple $3$-connected plane graphs of maximum degree at

consider the same special textures in neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices

structure enforces two texture zeros, the contribution of the charged lepton
sector to the PMNS matrix can be parametrized by two rotation angles.
Restricting to the cases where at least one of these angles is small, we obtain
three representative scenarios. In all scenarios we obtain a narrow prediction
for the sum of neutrino masses in the range of 60$-$75 meV, possibly in the

the transit depth at different wavelengths. To date, a number of ground and
space based instruments have been used to obtain transmission spectra of
exoplanets in different spectral band. One common practice is to combine
observations from different instruments in order to achieve a broader
wavelength coverage. We present here two inconsistent observations of WASP-96
b, one by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the other by the Very Large

water signature is detected via the HST WFC3 observations. 2.) A notable offset
in transit depth (> 1100 ppm) can be seen when the ground-based and space-based
observations are combined together. The discrepancy raises the question of
whether observations from different instruments could indeed be combined
together. We attempt to align the observations by including an additional
parameter in our retrieval studies but are unable to definitively ascertain
that the aligned observations are indeed compatible. The case of WASP-96 b
signals that compatibility of instruments should not be assumed. While
wavelength overlaps between instruments can help, it should be noted that
combining datasets remains a risky business. The difficulty in combining
observations also strengthens the need for next generation instruments which

diffusions involve imputing diffusion bridges between observations. This can be
computationally challenging in settings in which the temporal horizon between
subsequent observations is large, due to the poor scaling of algorithms for
simulating bridges as observation distance increases. It is common in practical
settings to use a blocking scheme, in which the path is split into a
(user-specified) number of overlapping segments and a Gibbs sampler is employed
to update segments in turn. Substituting the independent simulation of
diffusion bridges for one obtained using blocking introduces an inherent
trade-off: we are now imputing shorter bridges at the cost of introducing a
dependency between subsequent iterations of the bridge sampler. This is further
complicated by the fact that there are a number of possible ways to implement
the blocking scheme, each of which introduces a different dependency structure
between iterations. Although blocking schemes have had considerable empirical
success in practice, there has been no analysis of this trade-off nor guidance
to practitioners on the particular specifications that should be used to obtain
a computationally efficient implementation. In this article we conduct this
analysis and demonstrate that the expected computational cost of a blocked
path-space rejection sampler applied to Brownian bridges scales asymptotically
at a cubic rate with respect to the observation distance and that this rate is
linear in the case of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Numerical experiments
suggest applicability both of the results of our paper and of the guidance we
provide beyond the class of linear diffusions considered.

reconstruction of the lensing potential, and can hinder the detection of the
Primordial Gravitational Wave Background for low values of $r$. Therefore,
extragalactic point-source detection and subtraction is a fundamental part of
the component separation process necessary to achieve some of the science goals

minimum polarization intensity of, respectively, 125 pK and 14 pK. Adopting a

A reduced subproblem formulation is investigated that solves the original

reasonable assumptions, we show that the probability that the reduced problem
is successful in solving the original, full-dimensional problem is positive.
Furthermore, in the case when the objective's effective subspace is aligned

surprisingly, ambient dimensions. We then propose X-REGO, a generic algorithmic
framework that uses multiple random embeddings, solving the above reduced

the development of effective spatially targeted interventions in the midst of
this turmoil, it is important to understand the geolocalization of these online
emotional responses, as well as their association with offline behavioral
responses. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities
across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional
dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major topics, and how
these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility.
Surprisingly, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments
across cities over the time period studied, with variability primarily seen
only in the immediate impact of federal guidelines and local lockdown policies.
We also find that these local sentiments are highly correlated with and
predictive of city-level mobility, while the correlations between sentiments
and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to
widespread commonalities in the online public emotional responses to COVID
across the US, both temporally and relative to offline indicators, in contrast
with the high variability seen in early local containment policies. This study
also provides new insights into the use of social media data in crisis

Thermo-physical characterization is performed by measuring viscosity and
thermal conductivity of the nanofluids. Convection characteristics are
experimentally studied from laminar to turbulent flow regimes. It is seen that
pressure drop increases dramatically in the transition region, and laminar to
turbulent transition shifts to lower Reynolds numbers with increasing
nanoparticle concentration. The transition initiates at a Reynolds number of
2475 for water, while it initiates at 2315 for the nanofluid with 0.2% particle
mass fraction. Increase in mean heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt numbers
are nearly identical at different Reynolds numbers and axial positions along
the test tube in the laminar flow for nanofluids and water due to dominance of
conduction enhancement mechanisms on the heat transfer increase in laminar
flow. Beyond laminar flow regime, enhancement of Nusselt number is observed
indicating that thermophoresis and Brownian motion are more effective heat
transfer augmentation mechanisms. The maximum heat transfer enhancement is
observed as 36% for a Reynolds number of 3950.

electric current under forward bias without any loss and that behaves like a
perfect insulator under reverse bias. However, real diodes have a junction
barrier that electrons have to overcome and thus they have a threshold voltage
$V_T$, which must be supplied to the diode to turn it on. This threshold
voltage gives rise to power dissipation in the form of heat and hence is an
undesirable feature. In this work, based on half-metallic magnets and
spin-gapless semiconductors we propose a diode concept that does not have a
junction barrier and the operation principle of which relies on the
spin-dependent transport properties of the HMM and SGS materials. We show that
the HMM and SGS materials form an Ohmic contact under any finite forward bias,
while for a reverse bias the current is blocked due to spin-dependent filtering
of the electrons. Thus, the HMM-SGS junctions act as a diode with zero
threshold voltage $V_T$, and linear $I-V$ characteristics as well as an
infinite on:off ratio at zero temperature. However, at finite temperatures,
non-spin-flip thermally excited high-energy electrons as well as low-energy
spin-flip excitations can give rise to a leakage current and thus reduce the
on:off ratio under a reverse bias. Furthermore, a zero threshold voltage allows
one to detect extremely weak signals and due to the Ohmic HMM-SGS contact, the
proposed diode has a much higher current drive capability and low resistance,
which is advantageous compared to conventional semiconductor diodes. We employ
the NEGF method combined with DFT to demonstrate the linear $I-V$
characteristics of the proposed diode based on two-dimensional half-metallic
Fe/MoS$_2$ and spin-gapless semiconducting VS$_2$ planar heterojunctions.

agglomerative clustering. We test our classification algorithms by applying our

into three different regions (the plasma sheet, the plasma sheet boundary
layer, and the lobes), that are primarily defined by their plasma
characteristics. Starting with the ECLAT database with associated

decompression, the crystal undergoes transition to a new monoclinic structure.
Atomic coordinates have been refined in the low pressure cubic phase to capture

continuous-time master equation from the discrete-time dynamics given by any

$\delta t$, by interpolating the dynamics between the time-points $t =
n\,\delta t$. I will contrast this with previous methods which only work in the
continuum limit (as $\delta t\to 0$). Moreover, I will show that any
continuum-limit-based approach will always yield unitary dynamics unless it is
fine-tuned in some way. For instance, it is common to find non-unitary dynamics
in the continuum limit by taking an (I will argue unphysical) divergence in the
interaction strengths, $g$, such that $g^2 \delta t$ is constant as $\delta t

signatures in the frequency spectra of rotating stars, particularly among
rapidly rotating early-type stars, which provides a means of probing their
internal structure and dynamics. They can also transport angular momentum,
chemical species, and energy from the excitation region to where they dissipate
in radiative regions. To estimate the excitation and convective parameter
dependence of the amplitude of those waves, a monomodal model for stellar and
planetary convection as described in Paper I is employed, which provides the
magnitude of the rms convective velocity as a function of rotation rate. With
this convection model, two channels for wave driving are considered: excitation
at a boundary between convectively stable and unstable regions and excitation
due to Reynolds-stresses. Parameter regimes are found where the sub-inertial
waves may carry a significant energy flux, depending upon the convective Rossby
number, the interface stiffness, and the wave frequency. The super-inertial
waves can also be enhanced, but only for convective Rossby numbers near unity.
Interfacially excited waves have a peak energy flux near the lower cutoff
frequency when the convective Rossby number of the flows that excite them are

as long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As
an alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision
with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19
from CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these
research efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning.
This commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model
performance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the
Source feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space.
Unfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification
of medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual
features found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of
Multi-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer
Learning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our

One of the primary aims were to investigate the effect of different MHD
instabilities on the jet dynamics and their dependence on the choice of jet
parameters. We find that two dominant MHD instabilities affect the dynamics of
the jet, small scale Kelvin- Helmholtz (KH) modes and large scale kink modes,
whose evolution depend on internal jet parameters like the Lorentz factor, the
ratio of the density and pressure to the external medium and the magnetisation
and hence consequently on the jet power. Low power jets are susceptible to both
instabilities, kink modes for jets with higher central magnetic field and KH
modes for lower magnetisation. Moderate power jets do not show appreciable
growth of kink modes, but KH modes develop for lower magnetisation. Higher
power jets are generally stable to both instabilities. Such instabilities
decelerate and decollimate the jet while inducing turbulence in the cocoon,
with consequences on the magnetic field structure. We model the dynamics of the
jets following a generalised treatment of the Begelman-Cioffi relations which
we present here. We find that the dynamics of stable jets match well with
simplified analytic models of expansion of non self-similar FRII jets, whereas
jets with prominent MHD instabilities show a nearly self-similar evolution of
the morphology as the energy is more evenly distributed between the jet head

Approximation (INLA). Our model includes 11 spatial and spatio-temporal
predictors, including meteorological variables and Aerosol Optical Depth. As

monthly models with the same set of covariates. The predictive model
performance has been analyzed using a cross-validation study. Our results show

13.9 $\mu \text{g}/\text{m}^3$). The model final output is a set of 365 gridded
(1km $\times$ 1km) daily $\text{PM}_{10}$ maps over Italy equipped with an
uncertainty measure. The spatial prediction performance shows that the
interpolation procedure is able to reproduce the large scale data features
without unrealistic artifacts in the generated $\text{PM}_{10}$ surfaces. The

deformation turns out to be a sum of an equilibrium part, that actually
corresponds to adiabatic switching on the disorder, and a dynamically-induced

disorder is switched off afterwards, the resulting condensate deformation
acquires an additional dynamically-induced part in the long-time limit, while
the equilibrium part vanishes. We also present an appropriate generalization to
inhomogeneous trapped condensates. Our results demonstrate that the condensate

scattering and, if relativistic, pair creation. Since the radiation force acts
primarily on electrons and positrons, the question arises of how the force is
mediated to the ions which are the dominant carriers of the shock energy. It
has been widely thought that a small charge separation induced by the radiation
force generates electric field inside the shock that decelerates the ions. In
this paper we argue that, while this is true in sub-relativistic shocks which
are devoid of positrons, in relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS),
which are dominated by newly created $e^+e^-$ pairs, additional coupling is
needed, owing to the opposite electric force acting on electrons and positrons.
Specifically, we show that dissipation of the ions energy must involve
collective plasma interactions. By constructing a multi-fluid model for RRMS
that incorporates friction forces, we estimate that momentum transfer between
electrons and positrons (and/or ions) via collective interactions on scales of
tens to thousands proton skin depths, depending on whether friction is
effective only between $e^+e^-$ pairs or also between pairs and ions, is
sufficient to coupe all particles and radiation inside the shock into a single
fluid. This leaves open the question whether in relativistic RMS particles can
effectively accelerate to high energies by scattering off plasma turbulence.
Such acceleration might have important consequences for relativistic shock
breakout signals.

First, we construct different outcome regression-based estimators for

parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric dimension reduction structure.
Second, according to the corresponding asymptotic variance functions, we answer
the following questions when supposing the models are correctly specified: what
is the asymptotic efficiency ranking about the four estimators in general? how
is the efficiency related to the affiliation of the given covariates in the set
of arguments of the regression functions? what do the roles of bandwidth and
kernel function selections play for the estimation efficiency; and in which
scenarios should the estimator under semiparametric dimension reduction
regression structure be used in practice? As a by-product, the results show
that any outcome regression-based estimation should be asymptotically more
efficient than any inverse probability weighting-based estimation. All these
results give a relatively complete picture of the outcome regression-based
estimation such that the theoretical conclusions could provide guidance for
practical use when more than one estimations can be applied to the same
problem. Several simulation studies are conducted to examine the performances
of these estimators in finite sample cases and a real dataset is analyzed for

the outcome of BNS mergers, whose nature depends on the equation of state (EOS)

engine of SGRBs based on this link. We produce an extended catalog of BNS
mergers by combining recent theoretically predicted BNS merger rate as a
function of redshift and the NS mass distribution inferred from measurements of
Galactic BNSs. We use this catalog to predict the number of BNS systems ending
as magnetars (stable or Supramassive NS) or BHs (formed promptly or after the
collapse of a hypermassive NS) for different EOSs, and we compare these
outcomes with the observed rate of SGRBs. Despite the uncertainties mainly
related to the poor knowledge of the SGRB jet structure, we find that for most
EOSs the rate of magnetars produced after BNS mergers is sufficient to power
all the SGRBs, while scenarios with only BHs as possible central engine seems
to be disfavoured.

  models based on group and fused lasso",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A vital problem in solving classification or regression problem is to apply
feature engineering and variable selection on data before fed into models.One
of a most popular feature engineering method is to discretisize continous
variable with some cutting points,which is refered to as bining processing.Good
cutting points are important for improving model's ability, because wonderful
bining may ignore some noisy variance in continous variable range and keep
useful leveled information with good ordered encodings.However, to our best
knowledge a majority of cutting point selection is done via researchers domain
knownledge or some naive methods like equal-width cutting or equal-frequency
cutting.In this paper we propose an end-to-end supervised cutting point
selection method based on group and fused lasso along with the automatically
variable selection effect.We name our method \textbf{ABM}(automatic bining
machine). We firstly cut each variable range into fine grid bins and train
model with our group and group fused lasso regularization on each successive
bins.It is a method that integrates feature engineering,variable selection and
model training simultanously.And one more inspiring thing is that the method is
flexible such that it can be taken into a bunch of loss function based model
including deep neural networks.We have also implemented the method in R and
open the source code to other researchers.A Python version will also meet the
community in days.

dynamical properties of excited states of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic chain in longitudinal magnetic fields associated with Bethe

described by Bethe-ansatz complex non-real rapidities. Previous studies on this
problem referred to finite-size systems. Here we consider the thermodynamic
limit and study it for the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain in a
longitudinal magnetic field. We confirm that also in that limit the most
significant spectral weight contribution from Bethe strings leads to gapped
continua in the spectra of the spin +- and xx dynamical structure factors. The
contribution of Bethe strings to the zz dynamical structure factor is found to
be small at low spin densities and to become negligible upon increasing that
density above 0.317. For the -+ dynamical structure factor, that contribution
is found to be negligible at finite magnetic field. We derive analytical
expressions for the line shapes of the +-, xx, and zz dynamical structure
factors valid in the vicinity of singularities located at and just above the
gapped lower thresholds of the Bethe-string states's spectra. As a side result
and in order to provide an overall physical picture that includes the relative
location of all spectra with a significant amount of spectral weight, we
revisit the general problem of the line-shape of the transverse and
longitudinal spin dynamical structure factors at finite magnetic field and
excitation energies in the vicinity of other singularities. This includes those
located at and just above the lower thresholds of the spectra that stem from
excited states described by only real Bethe-ansatz rapidities.

However, recent observations of the CO gas emission were found incompatible

a recently developed dynamical formulation of time-independent scattering

therefore the solution of the scattering problem for a given potential to the
solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for an effective
non-unitary two-level quantum system. We provide a self-contained treatment of

with helium-rich CSM, similar to a Type Ibn supernova. This event provides an
apparently rare opportunity to view the inner workings of an interacting
supernova. The observed properties can be explained by the explosion of a star
in an aspherical CSM. The initial light is emitted from an extended CSM (~ 4000
Rsun), which ionises the exterior unshocked material. Some days after, the SN
photosphere envelops this region, leading to the appearance of a SN IIb. Over
time, the photosphere recedes in velocity space, revealing interaction between
the supernova ejecta and the CSM that partially obscures the supernova nebular
phase. Modelling of the initial spectrum reveals a surface composition
consistent with compact H-deficient Wolf-Rayet and LBV stars. Such
configurations may not be unusual, with SNe IIb being known to have signs of

within its experimental uncertainties, is in agreement with the small radius
measured in muonic hydrogen spectroscopy experiments and it was a critical
input in the recent revision of the CODATA recommendation for the proton charge
radius. Consequently, the PRad result is in direct conflict with all modern
electron scattering experiments. Most importantly, it is 5.8% smaller than the
value from the most precise electron scattering experiment to date, and this
difference is about three standard deviations given the precision of the PRad
experiment. As the first experiment of its kind, PRad did not reach the highest
precision allowed by the calorimetric technique. Here we propose a new (and)
upgraded experiment -- PRad-II, which will reduce the overall experimental
uncertainties by a factor of 3.8 compared to PRad and address this as yet
unsettled controversy in subatomic physics. In addition, PRad-II will be the
first lepton scattering experiment to reach the Q^2 range of 10^{-5} GeV^2
allowing a more accurate and robust extraction of the proton charge radius. The
muonic hydrogen result with its unprecedented precision (~0.05%) determines the
CODATA value of the proton charge radius, hence, it is critical to evaluate
possible systematic uncertainties of those experiments, such as the laser
frequency calibration that was raised in recent review articles. The PRad-II
experiment with its projected total uncertainty of 0.43% could demonstrate
whether there is any systematic difference between $e-p$ scattering and muonic
hydrogen results. PRad-II will establish a new precision frontier in electron
scattering and open doors for future physics opportunities.

was inferred from measurements of the optically detected magnetic resonance

magnetic field starting from around 400 G up to magnetic field values

measured the influence of angular deviations of the magnetic field from the NV

is more sensitive to this angle than in the vicinity of the excited-state level
anti-crossing. Indeed, an angle as small as a tenth of a degree of arc can
destroy almost completely the spin polarization of a nitrogen nucleus. In
addition, we investigated theoretically the influence of strain and optical

on the sample size. Using data from multiple randomized controlled clinical

subgroups as differences in study design, subject selection and other sources
of between-trial heterogeneity are ignored. In order to account for
between-trial heterogeneity in individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis
random-effect models are frequently used. Commonly, heterogeneity in the
treatment effect is modelled using random effects whereas heterogeneity in the
baseline risks is modelled by either fixed effects or random effects. In this
article, we propose metaMOB, a procedure using the generalized mixed-effects
model tree (GLMM tree) algorithm for subgroup identification in IPD
meta-analysis. Although the application of metaMOB is potentially wider, e.g.
randomized experiments with participants in social sciences or preclinical
experiments in life sciences, we focus on randomized controlled clinical
trials. In a simulation study, metaMOB outperformed GLMM trees assuming a
random intercept only and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB), whose
algorithm is the basis for GLMM trees, with respect to the false discovery
rates, accuracy of identified subgroups and accuracy of estimated treatment
effect. The most robust and therefore most promising method is metaMOB with
fixed effects for modelling the between-trial heterogeneity in the baseline

Our results showed that the presence of anionic vacancies in NbC and NbN tends
to deteriorate the mechanical properties and ultimately the mechanical hardness
due to vacancy softening that can be attributed to defect induced covalent to
metallic bond transition. Further, it was observed that anionic vacancies in
NbC tend to modify its toughness, in particular, NbC in ZB becomes brittle
while NbC in WZ becomes ductile in the presences of C vacancies of up to 6%. On
the other hand, the toughness of NbN was found to be insensitive to defect
concentration of even up to 8%. Consequently, stringent control of anionic
defects during the synthesis of NbC and NbN is critical for the realization of
the desired mechanical response that can make these materials ideal for

been one of the main topics in high-energy astrophysics ever since the first
observation of high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.
Active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets, also known as blazars, have been
considered to be one of the main candidates because of their ability to
accelerate particles to high energies. We study the connection between radio
emission and IceCube neutrino events using data from the Owens Valley Radio
Observatory (OVRO) and Mets\""ahovi Radio Observatory blazar monitoring
programs. We identify sources in our radio monitoring sample that are
positionally consistent with IceCube high-energy neutrino events. We estimate
their mean flux density and variability amplitudes around the neutrino arrival
time, and compare these with values from random samples to establish the
significance of our results. We find radio source associations within our
samples with 15 high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Nearly half of
the associated sources are not detected in the $\gamma$-ray energies, but their
radio variability properties and Doppler boosting factors are similar to the
$\gamma$-ray detected objects in our sample, meaning that they could still be
potential neutrino emitters. We find that the number of strongly flaring
objects in our statistically complete OVRO samples is unlikely to be a random
coincidence (at $2\sigma$ level). Based on our results, we conclude that
although it is clear that not all neutrino events are associated with strong
radio flaring blazars, observations of large-amplitude radio flares in a blazar
at the same time as a neutrino event are unlikely to be a random coincidence.

many applications in computational linguistics, however there is currently no
general semantic formalism for representing meaning in terms of vectors. We
present a framework for natural language semantics in which words, phrases and
sentences are all represented as vectors, based on a theoretical analysis which
assumes that meaning is determined by context.
  In the theoretical analysis, we define a corpus model as a mathematical
abstraction of a text corpus. The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be
a vector representing the contexts it occurs in in the corpus model. Based on
this assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words can be
considered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in applications
of vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an underlying
lattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice as
describing entailment between meanings. We also define the context-theoretic
probability of a string, and, based on this and the lattice structure, a degree
of entailment between strings.
  Together these properties form guidelines as to how to construct semantic
representations within the framework. A context theory is an implementation of
the framework; in an implementation strings are represented as vectors with the
properties deduced from the theoretical analysis.
  We show how to incorporate logical semantics into context theories; this
enables us to represent statistical information about uncertainty by taking
weighted sums of individual representations. We also use the framework to
analyse approaches to the task of recognising textual entailment, to
ontological representations of meaning and to representing syntactic structure.
For the latter, we give new algebraic descriptions of link grammar.

network focus more on the foreground region. Then, a novel channel attention
module is proposed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses and
highlight the most relevant feature channels. Also, we propose a scale
attention module implicitly emphasizing the most salient feature maps among
multiple scales so that the CNN is adaptive to the size of an object. Extensive
experiments on skin lesion segmentation from ISIC 2018 and multi-class
segmentation of fetal MRI found that our proposed CA-Net significantly improved
the average segmentation Dice score from 87.77% to 92.08% for skin lesion,
84.79% to 87.08% for the placenta and 93.20% to 95.88% for the fetal brain
respectively compared with U-Net. It reduced the model size to around 15 times
smaller with close or even better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art
DeepLabv3+. In addition, it has a much higher explainability than existing

linear spatial processing. In line with previous results based on
infinite-blocklength bounds, we prove that, with minimum mean-square error
(MMSE) processing and spatially correlated channels, the error probability at
finite blocklength goes to zero as the number $M$ of antennas grows to
infinity, even under pilot contamination. On the other hand, numerical results
for a practical URLLC network setup involving a base station with $M=100$
antennas, show that a target error probability of $10^{-5}$ can be achieved
with MMSE processing, uniformly over each cell, only if orthogonal pilot
sequences are assigned to all the users in the network. Maximum ratio

create fully automatic production schemes in these cases, with non-zero cost of
switching between different states of production. Along the way of deriving
these schemes, we also create a model for the random flow of water based on
stochastic differential equations and fit this model to historical data. This
stochastic flow model, which should be of independent interest, mimics the long

the solar photosphere, as a consequence of the gravitational potential of the
Sun. This effect can be measured from a solar disk-integrated flux spectrum of
the Sun's reflected light on solar system bodies. The laser frequency comb
(LFC) calibration system attached to the HARPS spectrograph offers the
possibility to perform an accurate measurement of the solar gravitational
redshift (GRS) by observing the Moon or other solar system bodies. We have
analysed the line shift observed in Fe absorption lines from five high-quality
HARPS-LFC spectra of the Moon. We select an initial sample of 326 photospheric
Fe lines in the spectral range 476-585 nm and measure their line positions and
equivalent widths (EWs). Accurate line shifts are derived from the wavelength
position of the core of the lines compared with the laboratory wavelengths. We
fit the observed spectral Fe lines using CO$^5$BOLD 3D synthetic profiles.
Convective motions in the solar photosphere do not affect the line cores of Fe
lines stronger than about $\sim 150$ mA. In our sample, only 15 FeI lines have
EWs in the range $150 <$ EW(mA) $< 550$, providing a measurement of the solar
GRS at $639\pm14$ ${\rm m\;s^{-1}}$, consistent with the expected theoretical
value on Earth of $\sim 633.1$ ${\rm m\;s^{-1}}$. A final sample of about 97
weak Fe lines with EW $<180$ mA allows us to derive a mean global line shift of
$638\pm6$ ${\rm m\;s^{-1}}$ in agreement with the theoretical solar GRS. These
are the most accurate measurements of the solar GRS so far. Ultrastable
spectrographs calibrated with the LFC over a larger spectral range, such as
HARPS or ESPRESSO, together with a further improvement on the laboratory
wavelengths, could provide a more robust measurement of the solar GRS and
further tests for the 3D hydrodynamical models.

topic in relativistic heavy-ion collisions because it has been believed to
signal one of the fundamental natures of the QGP -- Debye screening due to the
liberation of color degrees of freedom. Among recent new theoretical
developments is the application of open quantum system framework to quarkonium
in the QGP. Open system approach enables us to describe how dynamical as well
as static properties of QGP influences the time evolution of quarkonium in a
coherent way.
  Currently, there are several master equations for quarkonium corresponding to
various scale assumptions, each derived in different theoretical frameworks. In
this review, all of the existing master equations are systematically rederived
as Lindblad equations in a unified framework. Also, as one of the most relevant
descriptions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, quantum Brownian motion of
heavy quark pair in the QGP is studied in detail. The quantum Brownian motion
is parametrized by a few fundamental quantities of QGP such as real and
imaginary parts of heavy quark potential (complex potential), heavy quark
momentum diffusion constant, and thermal dipole self-energy constant, which
constitute in-medium self-energy of a static quarkonium. This indicates that
the yields of quarkonia such as $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ in the relativistic
heavy-ion collisions have the potential to determine these fundamental
quantities.

addition, chambers constructed of 316L and 316LN stainless steel were subjected
to a vacuum-fire process, where they were heated to approximately 950 {\deg}C

chambers can be made. Water outgassing rates were measured as a function of
time using the throughput technique. The water outgassing results for the 316L,
316LN, 316L-XHV, 316LN-XHV were all similar, but lower than those of 304L by a
factor of 3 to 5 lower at 10^4 s. The water outgassing results for Ti and Al

outgassing rates were measured using the rate-of-rise method and performed
after a low-temperature bake of 125 {\deg}C to 150 {\deg}C for a minimum of 72
hours. The Ti, Al, 316L-XHV, and 316LN-XHV chambers all have specific
outgassing rates below 1 X 10^-11 Pa L s^-1 cm^-2 and are at least a factor of
100 or better than the 304L chamber. The 304L, 316L, and 316LN chambers without

chambers, with specific outgassing rates ranging between 4.0 X 10^-11 Pa L s^-1

316LN-XHV have hydrogen outgassing rates that make them excellent choices for
ultra-high vacuum (UHV) and extreme-high vacuum (XHV) applications, the choice
depending on cost and other material properties.

Pescara shows stylized statistical properties that are reminiscent of Kirman

model to a situation with two asymmetric zones and finite resources. We show
that, in the mean-field regime, our model exhibits the same properties as the
empirical data. We obtain a phase diagram that separates high and low herding
regimes, but also fish population extinction. Our analysis has interesting
policy implications for the ecology of fishing areas. It also suggests that
herding behaviour here, just as in financial markets, will lead to significant
fluctuations in the amount of fish landed, as the boat concentration on one
area at a given point in time will diminish the overall catch, such loss not
being compensated by the reproduction of fish in the other area. In other
terms, individually rational behaviour will not lead to collectively optimal
results.

""Gardner"" transition to a marginally stable phase, similar to that observed in
jamming of amorphous materials. We confirm and complement our analytical
results by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we extend their relevance by
showing that they hold for others interacting random dynamical systems, such as
the Random Replicant Model. Finally, we discuss their extension to the case of

  titanium alloys",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Titanium alloys can suffer from halide-associated stress corrosion cracking
at elevated temperatures e.g., in jet engines, where chlorides and Ti-oxide
promote the cracking of water vapour in the gas stream, depositing embrittling
species at the crack tip. Here we report, using isotopically-labelled
experiments, that crack tips in an industrial Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-6Mo alloy are
strongly enriched (>5 at.%) in oxygen from the water vapour, far greater than
the amounts (0.25 at.%) required to embrittle the material. Surprisingly,
relatively little hydrogen (deuterium) is measured, despite careful preparation
and analysis. Therefore, we suggest that a combined effect of O and H leads to
cracking, with O playing a vital role, since it is well-known to cause
embrittlement of the alloy. In contrast it appears that in alpha+beta Ti
alloys, it may be that H may drain away into the bulk owing to its high
solubility in beta-Ti, rather than being retained in the stress field of the
crack tip. Therefore, whilst hydrides may form on the fracture surface,
hydrogen ingress might not be the only plausible mechanism of embrittlement of
the underlying matrix. This possibility challenges decades of understanding of
stress-corrosion cracking as being related solely to the hydrogen enhanced
localised plasticity (HELP) mechanism, which explains why H-doped Ti alloys are
embrittled. This would change the perspective on stress corrosion embrittlement
away from a focus purely on hydrogen to also consider the ingress of O
originating from the water vapour, insights critical for designing corrosion
resistant materials.

learning. However, the existing countermeasures are designed to resist

deep learning based side-channel attacks. Thus, there arises a strong need for
countermeasures against deep learning based side-channel attacks. Although deep
learning has the high potential in solving complex problems, it is vulnerable
to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead
a model to predict incorrectly.
  In this paper, we propose a kind of novel countermeasures based on
adversarial attacks that is specifically designed against deep learning based
side-channel attacks. We estimate several models commonly used in deep learning
based side-channel attacks to evaluate the proposed countermeasures. It shows
that our approach can effectively protect cryptographic devices from deep

high recall proposals for existing 2-stage detectors and demonstrate that the

correlations provide a consistent description of the experimental data, and
account for some surprising aspects of the data such as the substantial out of
plan dispersion of the electron Fermi surface having dominant xz/yz character.
Hence, correlations effects can be separated into static non-local
contributions well described by LQSGW and dynamical local contributions. Hall

by considering more physical processes and having greater resolution or larger
statistics. However, usually either the statistical power of such simulations
or the resolution reached within galaxies are sacrificed. Here, we introduce
the NewHorizon project in which we simulate at high resolution a zoom-in region
of $\sim(16\,\rm Mpc)^3$ that is larger than a standard zoom-in region around a
single halo and is embedded in a larger box. A resolution of up to 34 pc is
reached within galaxies; this allows the simulation to capture the multi-phase
nature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation
process in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key
fundamental properties of galaxies and their black holes, including the galaxy
mass function, cosmic star formation rate, galactic metallicities, the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, galaxy sizes,
stellar kinematics and morphology, gas content within galaxies and its
kinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various
scaling relations are broadly reproduced by NewHorizon with some differences
with the standard observables. Owing to its exquisite spatial resolution,
NewHorizon captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies,
which evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas rich, and star bursting
at high redshift. These high-redshift galaxies are also more compact, and they
are more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence
decays enough to allow for the formation of discs. The NewHorizon simulation
gives access to a broad range of galaxy formation and evolution physics at
low-to-intermediate stellar masses, which is a regime that will become
accessible in the near future through surveys such as the LSST.

nebulae. We take advantage of its object-oriented architecture, class methods,
and historical atomic database to structure a practical environment for atomic
data assessment. Our aim is to reduce the uncertainties in parameter space
(line-ratio diagnostics, electron density and temperature, and ionic
abundances) arising from the underlying atomic data by critically selecting the
PyNeb default datasets. We evaluate the questioned radiative-rate accuracy of
the collisionally excited forbidden lines of the N- and P-like ions (O II, Ne
IV, S II, Cl III, and Ar IV), which are used as density diagnostics. With the
aid of observed line ratios in the dense NGC 7027 planetary nebula and careful
data analysis, we arrive at emissivity-ratio uncertainties from the radiative
rates within 10\%, a considerable improvement over a previously predicted 50\%.
We also examine the accuracy of an extensive dataset of electron-impact
effective collision strengths for the carbon isoelectronic sequence recently
published. By estimating the impact of the new data on the pivotal temperature
diagnostics of [N II] and [O III] and by benchmarking the collision strength
with a measured resonance position, we question their usefulness in nebular
modeling. We confirm that the effective-collision-strength scatter of selected
datasets for these two ions does not lead to uncertainties in the temperature
diagnostics larger than 10\%.

highly non-convex loss function, typically by a stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) method. This learning process can effectively find good wide minima
without being trapped in poor local ones. We present a novel account of how
such effective deep learning emerges through the interactions of the SGD and
the geometrical structure of the loss landscape. Rather than being a normal
diffusion process (i.e. Brownian motion) as often assumed, we find that the SGD
exhibits rich, complex dynamics when navigating through the loss landscape;
initially, the SGD exhibits anomalous superdiffusion, which attenuates
gradually and changes to subdiffusion at long times when the solution is
reached. Such learning dynamics happen ubiquitously in different DNNs such as
ResNet and VGG-like networks and are insensitive to batch size and learning
rate. The anomalous superdiffusion process during the initial learning phase
indicates that the motion of SGD along the loss landscape possesses
intermittent, big jumps; this non-equilibrium property enables the SGD to
escape from sharp local minima. By adapting the methods developed for studying
energy landscapes in complex physical systems, we find that such superdiffusive
learning dynamics are due to the interactions of the SGD and the fractal-like
structure of the loss landscape. We further develop a simple model to
demonstrate the mechanistic role of the fractal loss landscape in enabling the
SGD to effectively find global minima. Our results thus reveal the
effectiveness of deep learning from a novel perspective and have implications
for designing efficient deep neural networks.

noise and initial value $x$. The driving noise processes include Brownian
motion, $\alpha$-stable L\'evy flights, finite intensity compound Poisson

thermalization is shown under mild generic assumptions; that is, we see an
asymptotically sharp $\infty/0$-collapse of the renormalized Wasserstein
distance from the current state to the equilibrium measure $\mu^\varepsilon$
along a time window centered on a precise $\varepsilon$- and $x$-dependent time
scale $t_\varepsilon^x$. In many interesting situations such as reversible
(L\'evy) diffusions it is possible to prove the existence of an explicit,
universal, deterministic cutoff thermalization profile. That is, for generic

$\mathcal{W}_p(X^\varepsilon_{t_\varepsilon + r}(x), \mu^\varepsilon) \cdot

characterized by the absence of non-normal growth patterns in terms of an

$\mathcal{Q}$. Precise error bounds are given. Using these results, this
article provides a complete discussion of the cutoff phenomenon for the
classical linear oscillator with friction subject to $\varepsilon$-small

fully loaded 96 channel DWDM system this leads to a total capacity of 4.8 Tb/s.
To meet the requirements of the targeted application in terms of cost

is mainly determined by the length of the fast Fourier transformation (FFT).
Since data center interconnects only have to bridge a distance of typically 80

among other parameters on the achievable performance for 56 Gb/s DMT only for

objective is to find conditions on $\bfv_*$ ensuring that $\mathscr B$ performs
a non-zero net motion, namely, $\mathscr B$ can cover any given distance in a
finite time. The approach to the problem depends on whether the averaged value
of $\bfv_*$ over a period of time is (case (b)) or is not (case (a))
identically zero. In case (a) we solve the problem in a relatively
straightforward way, by showing that, for small $\delta$, it reduces to the
study of a suitable amd well-investigated time-dependent Stokes (linear)

we show that it {\em cannot} be brought to the study of a linear problem.

solve directly on the nonlinear system by a contradiction argument approach. In

corona, and can potentially be a rich source of coronal diagnostics. On its way
to the observer, it gets modified substantially due to the propagation effects
- primarily refraction and scattering - through the magnetized and turbulent
coronal medium, leading to the redistribution of the intensity in the image
plane. By comparing the full-disk meterwave solar maps during a quiet solar
period and the modelled thermal bremsstrahlung emission, we characterise these
propagation effects. The solar radio maps between 100 and 240 MHz come from the
Murchison Widefield Array. FORWARD package is used to simulate thermal
bremsstrahlung images using the self-consistent Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm
outside a Sphere coronal model. The FORWARD model does not include propagation
effects. The differences between the observed and modelled maps are interpreted
to arise due to scattering and refraction. There is a good general
correspondence between the predicted and observed brightness distributions,
though significant differences are also observed. We find clear evidence for
the presence of significant propagation effects, including anisotropic
scattering. The observed radio size of the Sun is 25--30\% larger in area. The
emission peak corresponding to the only visible active region shifts by 8'--11'
and its size increases by 35--40\%. Our simple models suggest that the fraction

properties of LFQPOs at high energies (above 30 keV) are closely related to the
nature of the accretion flow in the innermost regions, and thus play a crucial
role in critically testing various theoretical models. The Hard X-ray
Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) is capable of detecting emissions above 30
keV, and is therefore an ideal instrument to do so. Here we report the
discovery of LFQPOs above 200 keV in the new black hole MAXI J1820+070 in the
X-ray hard state, which allows us to understand the behaviours of LFQPOs at
hundreds of kiloelectronvolts. The phase lag of the LFQPO is constant around
zero below 30 keV, and becomes a soft lag (that is, the high-energy photons
arrive first) above 30 keV. The soft lag gradually increases with energy and
reaches ~0.9s in the 150-200 keV band. The detection at energies above 200 keV,
the large soft lag and the energy-related behaviors of the LFQPO pose a great
challenge for most currently existing models, but suggest that the LFQPO
probably originates from the precession of a small-scale jet.

feature maps, which establishes the importance of the dual-channel structure.

long lead time but short product life cycle. These SKUs are usually sold for
one season only, without any replenishments. An exponential factorization
machine (EFM) sales forecast model is developed to solve this problem which not
only considers SKU attributes, but also pairwise interactions. The EFM model is
significantly different from the original Factorization Machines (FM) from
two-fold: (1) the attribute-level formulation for explanatory variables and (2)
exponential formulation for the positive response variable. The attribute-level
formation excludes infeasible intra-attribute interactions and results in more
efficient feature engineering comparing with the conventional one-hot encoding,
while the exponential formulation is demonstrated more effective than the
log-transformation for the positive but not skewed distributed responses. In
order to estimate the parameters, percentage error squares (PES) and error
squares (ES) are minimized by a proposed adaptive batch gradient descent method
over the training set. Real-world data provided by a footwear retailer in
Singapore is used for testing the proposed approach. The forecasting
performance in terms of both mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean
absolute error (MAE) compares favourably with not only off-the-shelf models but
also results reported by extant sales and demand forecasting studies. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is also demonstrated by two external
public datasets. Moreover, we prove the theoretical relationships between PES
and ES minimization, and present an important property of the PES minimization
for regression models; that it trains models to underestimate data. This
property fits the situation of sales forecasting where unit-holding cost is
much greater than the unit-shortage cost.

auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding
biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since
auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same
generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the
loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care
about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from
\textit{transductive learning} and note that after receiving an input but
before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised
loss. We call this process {\em tailoring}, because we customize the model to
each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we
formulate {\em meta-tailoring}, a nested optimization similar to that in
meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after
adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and
meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a
diverse set of examples.

introduce a novel curriculum sampling strategy which takes into consideration
the diversity of the training data together with the difficulty of the inputs.

human time required for solving a visual search task. We consider this kind of
difficulty metric to be better suited for solving general problems, as it is
not based on certain task-dependent elements, but more on the context of each

elements from less visited classes. We conduct object detection and instance
segmentation experiments on Pascal VOC 2007 and Cityscapes data sets,

in contrast to previous models such as the GN and EGN models, which are valid
for polarization multiplexed (PM)formats, where the two polarizations are seen
as independent channels on which data is multiplexed. The proposed model agrees
with the EGN model in the special case of independent two-dimensional

cross-phase modulation. Numerical results show that the EGN model may
inaccurately estimate the nonlinear interference of 4D formats. This nonlinear

to the ability of MPC to enforce state and control constraints, which are
crucial in many applications of control. In order to avoid the need for an
observer, output-feedback model predictive control with online identification
(OFMPCOI) uses the block observable canonical form whose state consists of past
values of the control inputs and measured outputs. Online identification is
performed using recursive least squares (RLS) with variable-rate forgetting.
The article describes the algorithmic details of OFMPCOI and numerically
investigates its performance through a collection of numerical examples that
highlight various control challenges, such as model order uncertainty, sensor
noise, prediction horizon, stabilization, magnitude and move-size saturation,
and stabilization. The numerical examples are used to probe the performance of
OFMPCOI in terms of persistency, consistency, and exigency. Since OFMPCOI does
not employ a separate control perturbation to enhance persistency, the focus is
on self-generated persistency during transient operation. For closed-loop
identification using RLS, sensor noise gives rise to bias in the identified
model, and the goal is to determine the effect of the lack of consistency.
Finally, the numerical examples reveal exigency, which is the extent to which
the online identification emphasizes model characteristics that are most
relevant to meeting performance objectives.

most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI

expert system that incorporates the time value of money, costs, and the
fundamental trade-off between accumulating arrears versus forsaking future

addition, the procedure reacts positively to portfolios afflicted by either
systematic defaults (such as during an economic downturn) or episodic
delinquency (i.e., cycles of curing and re-defaulting). In optimising a

prevalent, yet there are limited algorithms and software for approximating
their solution. This paper represents a step forward by considering the special
case of the regulator problem where the state equation has polynomial
nonlinearity, control costs are quadratic, and the feedback control is
approximated by low-degree polynomials. As this represents the natural
extension of the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and quadratic-quadratic
regulator (QQR) problems, we denote this class as polynomial-quadratic
regulator (PQR) problems. The present approach is amenable to feedback
approximations with low degree polynomials and to problems of modest model
dimension. This setting can be achieved in many problems using modern model
reduction methods. The Al'Brekht algorithm, when applied to polynomial
nonlinearities represented as Kronecker products leads to an elegant
formulation. The terms of the feedback control lead to large linear systems
that can be effectively solved with an N-way generalization of the
Bartels-Stewart algorithm. We demonstrate our algorithm with numerical examples

the stringent end-to-end delay and reliability requirements of URLLC MEC
systems, we propose joint uplink-downlink resource allocation and finite
blocklength transmission. Furthermore, we employ a partial time overlap between
the uplink and downlink frames to minimize the end-to-end delay, which
introduces a new time causality constraint. The proposed resource allocation
algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem for minimization of the
total weighted power consumption of the network under a constraint on the
number of URLLC user bits computed within the maximum allowable computation
time, i.e., the end-to-end delay of a computation task. Despite the
non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, we develop a globally
optimal solution using a branch-and-bound approach based on discrete monotonic
optimization theory. The branch-and-bound algorithm minimizes an upper bound on
the total power consumption until convergence to the globally optimal value.
Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational complexity and
performance, we propose two efficient suboptimal algorithms based on successive
convex approximation and second-order cone techniques. Our simulation results
reveal that the proposed resource allocation algorithm design facilitates URLLC
in MEC systems, and yields significant power savings compared to three baseline
schemes. Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed suboptimal

autonomous vehicle in the environment using information coming from the
vehicle's sensors, a problem known as navigation or simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM) depending on the context. To infer knowledge from sensors'
measurements, while drawing on a priori knowledge about the vehicle's dynamics,
modern approaches solve an optimization problem to compute the most likely
trajectory given all past observations, an approach known as smoothing.
Improving smoothing solvers is an active field of research in the SLAM
community. Most work is focused on reducing computation load by inverting the
involved linear system while preserving its sparsity. The present paper raises
an issue which, to the knowledge of the authors, has not been addressed yet:
standard smoothing solvers require explicitly using the inverse of sensor noise
covariance matrices. This means the parameters that reflect the noise magnitude
must be sufficiently large for the smoother to properly function. When matrices
are close to singular, which is the case when using high precision modern
inertial measurement units (IMU), numerical issues necessarily arise,
especially with 32-bits implementation demanded by most industrial aerospace
applications. We discuss these issues and propose a solution that builds upon
the Kalman filter to improve smoothing algorithms. We then leverage the results
to devise a localization algorithm based on fusion of IMU and vision sensors.
Successful real experiments using an actual car equipped with a tactical grade
high performance IMU and a LiDAR illustrate the relevance of the approach to
the field of autonomous vehicles.

open-source python code to generate the tree graph, the adjacency matrix, and
the histogram of the links for each different tree representation. We show how
this mapping reflects the difference between tree realizations, and how
valuable information may be extracted upon inspection of these matrices. The
algorithm includes a feature to average several tree realizations, obtain the
connectivity distribution, and calculate the average and mean value. We used
this feature to compare trees with a different number of generations and nodes.

common activity during software maintenance. Beyond traditional performance
metrics like latency, mobile app developers are interested in reducing app
energy usage. Some mobile apps have centralized locations for parameter tuning,
similar to databases and operating systems, but it is common for mobile apps to
have hundreds of parameters scattered around the source code. The correlation
between these ""deep"" parameters and app energy usage is unclear. Researchers
have studied the energy effects of deep parameters in specific modules, but we
lack a systematic understanding of the energy impact of mobile deep parameters.
  In this paper we empirically investigate this topic, combining a developer
survey with systematic energy measurements. Our motivational survey of 25
Android developers suggests that developers do not understand, and largely
ignore, the energy impact of deep parameters. To assess the potential
implications of this practice, we propose a deep parameter energy profiling
framework that can analyze the energy impact of deep parameters in an app. Our
framework identifies deep parameters, mutates them based on our parameter value
selection scheme, and performs reliable energy impact analysis. Applying the
framework to 16 popular Android apps, we discovered that deep parameter-induced
energy inefficiency is rare. We found only 2 out of 1644 deep parameters for
which a different value would significantly improve its app's energy
efficiency. A detailed analysis found that most deep parameters have either no
energy impact, limited energy impact, or an energy impact only under extreme
values. Our study suggests that it is generally safe for developers to ignore
the energy impact when choosing deep parameter values in mobile apps.

order to ensure safety and reliability in the electricity grid, the power flow
in the grid needs to be observed to prevent overloading. Furthermore, the
energy supply and consumption need to be continuously balanced to ensure the
security of energy supply. Therefore a high quality of power flow forecasts for
the next few hours within the grid are needed. In this paper we investigate
forecasts of the vertical power flow at transformer between the medium and high
voltage grid. Forecasting the vertical power flow is challenging due to
constantly changing characteristics of the power flow at the transformer. This
is mainly a result of dynamic grid topologies, changes in the installed assets,
maintenance of the transformer itself as well as the volatile generation. In
this paper we present a novel approach to deal with these challenges. For the
multi step time series forecasts a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used. In
our presented approach an update process where the model is retrained regularly
is investigated and compared to baseline models. The model is retrained as soon
as a sufficient amount of new measurements are available. This retraining
should capture changes in the characteristic of the transformer that the model
has not yet seen in the past and therefore cannot be predicted by the model.
For the regular update process we investigate different strategies where
especially the number of used epochs are considered, but also different
learning rates are used. We show that our new approach significantly

  Uncertainty Principle",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One can use the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) to incorporate the
minimum measurable length in quantum gravity. It may be interesting to have a
minimal time interval as well as the minimal length in the relativistic version
of quantum mechanics in the presence of the gravitational effects. In this
paper, we consider a covariant version of the generalized uncertainty principle
to investigate the effects of both the minimal time and the minimal length.
Using the covariant GUP, the energy-momentum dispersion relation is modified.
Starting with the modified dispersion relation, the corrections to the wave
function are obtained and the problems of the particle in a box and the
Hydrogen atom are revisited.

  Unstructured Driving Environments",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an unsupervised adaptation approach for visual scene understanding
in unstructured traffic environments. Our method is designed for unstructured
real-world scenarios with dense and heterogeneous traffic consisting of cars,
trucks, two-and three-wheelers, and pedestrians. We describe a new semantic
segmentation technique based on unsupervised domain adaptation (DA), that can
identify the class or category of each region in RGB images or videos. We also
present a novel self-training algorithm (Alt-Inc) for multi-source DA that
improves the accuracy. Our overall approach is a deep learning-based technique
and consists of an unsupervised neural network that achieves 87.18% accuracy on
the challenging India Driving Dataset. Our method works well on roads that may
not be well-marked or may include dirt, unidentifiable debris, potholes, etc. A
key aspect of our approach is that it can also identify objects that are
encountered by the model for the fist time during the testing phase. We compare
our method against the state-of-the-art methods and show an improvement of
5.17% - 42.9%. Furthermore, we also conduct user studies that qualitatively
validate the improvements in visual scene understanding of unstructured driving
environments.

model is more in line with the actual turbulence. However, anisotropic factor
is vital for the accuracy of calculations, and measuring it precisely is a
challenging task. In this paper, utilizing three modeling approaches, we derive
four different equivalence formulas between the anisotropic non-Kolmogorov and
the Kolmogorov structure constants, and apply them to the extant anisotropic
results. It is found that the anisotropic factor is eliminated and the
anisotropic turbulence can be predicted only by Kolmogorov structure constant
and power law.

the prediction of nonlinear time-series. However, there is no complete
understanding of the proper design of a reservoir yet. We find that the
simplest popular setup has a harmful symmetry, which leads to the prediction of
what we call mirror-attractor. We prove this analytically. Similar problems can
arise in a general context, and we use them to explain the success or failure
of some designs. The symmetry is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic tangent
activation function. Further, four ways to break the symmetry are compared
numerically: A bias in the output, a shift in the input, a quadratic term in
the readout, and a mixture of even and odd activation functions. Firstly, we
test their susceptibility to the mirror-attractor. Secondly, we evaluate their
performance on the task of predicting Lorenz data with the mean shifted to
zero. The short-time prediction is measured with the forecast horizon while the
largest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are used to represent
the climate. Finally, the same analysis is repeated on a combined dataset of
the Lorenz attractor and the Halvorsen attractor, which we designed to reveal
potential problems with symmetry. We find that all methods except the output
bias are able to fully break the symmetry with input shift and quadratic
readout performing the best overall.

in operation, subjected to high voltage. The device operated under constant and
intense angular velocity for each high voltage applied. The measurements were
made in the similar way than an analogue magnetic gyroscope, by considering
clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. We found that there are significant
weight reduction on the device in the clockwise case, with one order of
magnitude higher than the magnetic case. In addition, we detected a similar
asymmetry in the observation of the effect, that is, there are smaller results
for the anomalous forces in counterclockwise rotation. We also propose a
theoretical model to explain the quantitative effect based on average values of
macroscopic observables of the device rotation and concluded that it is
consistent with the experimental results.
