space group $P6_1$ ($\gamma$-In$_2$Se$_3$) has a direct band gap of $\sim$1.8
eV and high absorption coefficient, making it a promising semiconductor
material for optoelectronics. Incorporating Te allows for tuning the band gap,
adding flexibility to device design and extending the application range. Here
we report the growth and characterization of $\gamma$-In$_2$Se$_3$ thin films,
and results of hybrid density functional theory calculations to assess the
electronic and optical properties of $\gamma$-In$_2$Se$_3$ and
$\gamma$-In$_2$(Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$)$_3$ alloys. The calculated band gap of 1.84
eV for $\gamma$-In$_2$Se$_3$ is in good agreement with data from the absorption
spectrum, and the absorption coefficient is found to be as high as that of
direct band gap conventional III-V and II-VI semiconductors. Incorporation of
Te in the form of $\gamma$-In$_2$(Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$)$_3$ alloys is an effective
way to tune the band gap from 1.84 eV down to 1.23 eV, thus covering the
optimal band gap range for solar cells. We also discuss band gap bowing and
mixing enthalpies, aiming at adding $\gamma$-In$_2$Se$_3$ and
$\gamma$-In$_2$(Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$)$_3$ alloys to the available toolbox of
materials for solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

paradigmatic types of quantum noise in continuous-variable systems: damping and
diffusion. This is no longer the case for the code space of finite squeezed
combs, and noise robustness depends crucially on the encoding parameters. We
analyze finite squeezed comb states in phase space, highlighting their
complicated interference features and characterizing their dynamics when
exposed to amplitude damping and Gaussian diffusion noise processes. We find
that squeezed comb state are more suitable and less error-prone when exposed to
damping, which speaks against standard error correction strategies that employ
linear amplification to convert damping into easier-to-describe isotropic

is time-reversal invariant and centrosymmetric, these two phases only appear in
the odd-parity pairings. The Andreev $\pi$-phase has nothing to do with the
specific form of the odd-parity pairings and means an intrinsic $\pi$-phase
between the spin-triplet Cooper pairs entering and leaving CTSCs in the Andreev
reflections. The orbital-phase corresponds to the phase difference between the
spin-triplet Cooper pairs with opposite spin polarization and depends on the
specific form of the odd-parity gap functions. When the normal region of the
Josephson junction contacts the same side of the CTSCs with some specific
odd-parity parings, the competition between the two phases can lead to the
Josephson $\pi$-junction. Note that this junction is different from that of the
conventional Josephson junction (JJ) and is dubbed a U-shaped junction
according to its geometry. Meanwhile, in a conventional JJ, the interplay of
these two phases causes their impact on the CPR to be completely canceled out.
Therefore no matter what kind of pairing symmetries the CTSC has, it will lead
to Josephson 0-junction in this case. We obtain our results based on the model
of the M$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family where M may be Cu, Sr, or Nb. Therefore, we
propose to detect the pairing symmetry of M$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ through a

However, segmenting small tumors in ultrasound images is challenging, due to
the speckle noise, varying tumor shapes and sizes among patients, and the
existence of tumor-like image regions. Recently, deep learning-based approaches
have achieved great success for biomedical image analysis, but current
state-of-the-art approaches achieve poor performance for segmenting small

architecture, namely Enhanced Small Tumor-Aware Network (ESTAN), to accurately
and robustly segment breast tumors. ESTAN introduces two encoders to extract
and fuse image context information at different scales and utilizes
row-column-wise kernels in the encoder to adapt to breast anatomy. We validate
the proposed approach and compare it to nine state-of-the-art approaches on
three public breast ultrasound datasets using seven quantitative metrics. The
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the best overall
performance and outperforms all other approaches on small tumor segmentation.

pulse profiles found close to this energy. We also found that 30 keV feature

made at relatively high luminosities. Moreover, all spectral fit parameters

implications, when an extra matter term generated by thermal effects is added
by hand in the Lagrangian. We formulate the equations of motion of the theory
as a dynamical system, that can be treated as an autonomous one only for
specific solutions for the Hubble rate, which are of cosmological interest.
Particularly, we focus our analysis on subspaces of the total phase space,
corresponding to (quasi-)de Sitter accelerating expansion, matter-dominated and
radiation-dominated solutions. In all the aforementioned cases, the dynamical
system is an autonomous dynamical system. With regard to the thermal term
effects, these are expected to significantly affect the evolution near a Big
Rip singularity, and we also consider this case in terms of the corresponding
dynamical system, in which case the system is non-autonomous, and we attempt to
extract analytical and numerical solutions that can assess the specific cases.
This course is taken twice: the first for the vacuum theory and the second when
two perfect fluids (dust and radiation) are included as matter sources in the
field equations. In both cases, we reach similar conclusions. The results of
this theory do not differ significantly from the results of the pure $f(R)$ in
the de Sitter and quasi-de Sitter phases, as the same fixed points are
attained, so for sure the late-time era de Sitter is not affected. However, in
the matter-dominated and radiation-dominated phases, the fixed points attained
are affected by the presence of the thermal term, so surely the thermal effects
would destroy the matter and radiation domination eras.

  Methods: This AI agent was trained using a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network architecture. The generator, PyraNet, is a novel Deep Learning network
that implements 28 classic ResNet blocks in pyramid-like concatenations. The
discriminator is a customized 4-layer DenseNet. The AI agent first generates
customized 2D projections at 9 template beam angles from 3D CT volume and
structures of a patient. These projections are then stacked as 4D inputs of
PyraNet, from which 9 radiation fluence maps are generated simultaneously.
Finally, the predicted fluence maps are imported into a commercial treatment
planning system (TPS) for plan integrity checks. The AI agent was built and
tested upon 231 oropharyngeal plans from a TPS plan library. Only the primary
plans in the sequential boost regime were studied. A customized Harr wavelet
loss was adopted for fluence map comparison. Isodose distributions in test AI
plans and TPS plans were qualitatively evaluated. Key dosimetric metrics were
statistically compared.$$$$
  Results: All test AI plans were successfully generated. Isodose gradients
outside of PTV in AI plans were comparable with TPS plans. After PTV coverage
normalization, $D_{mean}$ of parotids and oral cavity in AI plans and TPS plans
were comparable without statistical significance. AI plans achieved comparable
$D_{max}$ at 0.01cc of brainstem and cord+5mm without clinically relevant
differences, but body $D_{max}$ was higher than the TPS plan results. The AI
agent needs ~3s per case to predict fluence maps.$$$$
  Conclusions: The developed AI agent can generate H&N IMRT plans with
satisfying dosimetry quality. With rapid and fully automated implementation, it
holds great potential for clinical applications.

equilibrium outcome inefficient. The recent literature of information design --

carefully-tuned information to players in order to influence their actions.
Most previous studies have focused on the question of designing optimal
signaling schemes. This work departs from previous research by considering a
descriptive question and looks to quantitatively characterize the power of
signaling (PoS), i.e., how much a signaling designer can improve her objective
of the equilibrium outcome. We consider four signaling schemes with increasing
power: full information, optimal public signaling, optimal private signaling
and optimal ex-ante private signaling. Our main result is a clean and tight
characterization of the additional power each signaling scheme has over its
immediate predecessor above in the broad classes of cost-minimization and
payoff-maximization games where: (1) all players minimize non-negative cost
functions or maximize non-negative payoff functions; (2) the signaling designer

d-dimensional CFT, with constant coefficients. We extend this dimensional
reduction relation to all higher-point scalar conformal blocks of arbitrary

appearing in the finite term higher-point dimensional reduction obey an
interesting factorization property allowing them to be determined in terms of
certain graphical Feynman-like rules and the associated finite set of vertex

the explicit power-series representation of just three particular conformal
blocks: the four-point block, the five-point block and the six-point block of
the so-called OPE/snowflake topology. In principle, this method can be applied
to obtain the arbitrary-point dimensional reduction of conformal blocks with
spinning exchanges as well. We also show how to systematically extend the

real-world self-driving system. Actors' long-term behaviors tend to be governed
by their interactions with other actors or traffic elements (traffic lights,
stop signs) in the scene. To capture this highly complex structure of
interactions, we propose to use a hybrid graph whose nodes represent both the
traffic actors as well as the static and dynamic traffic elements present in
the scene. The different modes of temporal interaction (e.g., stopping and
going) among actors and traffic elements are explicitly modeled by graph edges.
This explicit reasoning about discrete interaction types not only helps in
predicting future motion, but also enhances the interpretability of the model,
which is important for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.
We predict actors' trajectories and interaction types using a graph neural
network, which is trained in a semi-supervised manner. We show that our
proposed model, TrafficGraphNet, achieves state-of-the-art trajectory
prediction accuracy while maintaining a high level of interpretability.

spatial heterogeneities well characterized by the so-called backbone, a
magnetic structure that arises as a consequence of the properties of the ground
state and the low-excitation levels of such a frustrated Ising system. Using
extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling, we study how these
heterogeneities affect the phase transition of the model. Although, we do not
detect any significant difference between the critical behavior displayed by
the whole system and that observed inside and outside the backbone,
surprisingly, a selective bond dilution of the complement of this magnetic
structure induces a change of the universality class, whereas no change is
noted when the backbone is fully diluted. This finding suggests that the region
surrounding the backbone plays a more relevant role in determining the physical
properties of the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model than previously thought.
Furthermore, we show that when a selective bond dilution changes the
universality class of the phase transition, the ground state of the model does
not undergo any change. The opposite case is also valid, i. e., a dilution that
does not change the critical behavior significantly affects the fundamental
level.

information readily accessible to retailers, and this information has been
widely used in pricing decisions. When involving personalized information, how
to protect the privacy of such information becomes a critical issue in
practice. In this paper, we consider a dynamic pricing problem over $T$ time
periods with an \emph{unknown} demand function of posted price and personalized
information. At each time $t$, the retailer observes an arriving customer's
personal information and offers a price. The customer then makes the purchase
decision, which will be utilized by the retailer to learn the underlying demand
function. There is potentially a serious privacy concern during this process: a
third party agent might infer the personalized information and purchase
decisions from price changes from the pricing system. Using the fundamental
framework of differential privacy from computer science, we develop a
privacy-preserving dynamic pricing policy, which tries to maximize the retailer
revenue while avoiding information leakage of individual customer's information
and purchasing decisions. To this end, we first introduce a notion of
\emph{anticipating} $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy that is
tailored to dynamic pricing problem. Our policy achieves both the privacy
guarantee and the performance guarantee in terms of regret. Roughly speaking,
for $d$-dimensional personalized information, our algorithm achieves the
expected regret at the order of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1} \sqrt{d^3 T})$,
when the customers' information is adversarially chosen. For stochastic
personalized information, the regret bound can be further improved to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2T} + \varepsilon^{-2} d^2)$

However, its complex cross-section means that RIXS has been more difficult to

high-resolution RIXS measurements of magnetic excitations of La2CuO4, the
antiferromagnetic parent of one system of high-temperature superconductors. At
high energies (~2 eV), the RIXS spectra show angular-dependent dd orbital
excitations which are found to be in good agreement with single-site multiplet
calculations. At lower energies (<0.3 eV), we show that the
wavevector-dependent RIXS intensities are proportional to the product of the
single-ion spin-flip cross section and the dynamical susceptibility of the
spin-wave excitations. When the spin-flip crosssection is dividing out, the
RIXS magnon intensities show a remarkable resemblance to INS data. Our results
show that RIXS is a quantitative probe the dynamical spin susceptibility in
cuprate and therefore should be used for quantitative investigation of other

($Re_{D}$) of $5000$, based on jet diameter ($D$) and jet-exit bulk velocity
($U_{e}$), are performed to study jet turbulence characteristics at
supercritical pressures. The jet consists of $\mathrm{N_{2}}$ that is injected
into $\mathrm{N_{2}}$ at same temperature. To understand turbulent mixing, a
passive scalar is transported with the flow at unity Schmidt number. Two sets
of inflow conditions that model jets issuing from either a smooth contraction
nozzle (laminar inflow) or a long pipe nozzle (turbulent inflow) are
considered. By changing one parameter at a time, the simulations examine the
jet-flow sensitivity to the thermodynamic condition (characterized in terms of
the compressibility factor ($Z$) and the normalized isothermal
compressibility), inflow condition, and ambient pressure ($p_{\infty}$)
spanning perfect- to real-gas conditions. The inflow affects flow statistics in
the near-field (containing the potential core closure and the transition
region) as well as further downstream (containing fully-developed flow with
self-similar statistics) at both atmospheric and supercritical $p_{\infty}$.
The sensitivity to inflow is larger in the transition region, where the
laminar-inflow jets exhibit dominant coherent structures that produce higher
mean strain rates and higher turbulent kinetic energy than in turbulent-inflow
jets. Decreasing $Z$ at a fixed supercritical $p_{\infty}$ enhances pressure
and density fluctuations (normalized by local mean pressure and density,
respectively), but the effect on velocity fluctuations depends also on local
flow dynamics. When $Z$ is reduced, large mean strain rates in the transition
region of laminar-inflow jets significantly enhance velocity fluctuations
(normalized by local mean velocity) and scalar mixing, whereas the effects are
minimal in jets from turbulent inflow.

epidemic thresholds to help forecast whether a disease will eventually infect a
large fraction of a population. Because network structure typically changes in
time, which fundamentally influences the dynamics of spreading processes on
them and in turn affects epidemic thresholds for disease propagation, it is
important to examine epidemic thresholds in temporal networks. Most existing
studies of epidemic thresholds in temporal networks have focused on models in
discrete time, but most real-world networked systems evolve continuously in
time. In our work, we encode the continuous time-dependence of networks into
the evaluation of the epidemic threshold of a
susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) process by studying an SIS model on
tie-decay networks. We derive the epidemic-threshold condition of this model,
and we perform numerical experiments to verify it. We also examine how
different factors---the decay coefficients of the tie strengths in a network,
the frequency of interactions between nodes, and the sparsity of the underlying
social network in which interactions occur---lead to decreases or increases of
the critical values of the threshold and hence contribute to facilitating or
impeding the spread of a disease. We thereby demonstrate how the features of
tie-decay networks alter the outcome of disease spread.

toroidal dipole modes in all-dielectric metasurfaces composed of trimer or
twin-trimer clusters of dielectric disks. Such metasurfaces permit enhanced
light-matter interaction due to spatially confined light in resonant systems
with a high-quality factor. To describe characteristics of toroidal modes
existing in the clusters, we use the magnetic dipole moments approximation,
group-theoretical methods, group representation theory, symmetry-adapted linear
combination method, and circuit theory. To validate the obtained theoretical
results, we fulfill both full-wave numerical simulations and microwave
experiments. In particular, we have shown that the toroidal dipole mode appears
as a quasi-dark state of the trimer. It can be excited in the metasurface by
the field of a linearly polarized wave, providing the symmetry of the trimer is
properly reduced. In the metasurface, the properties of the toroidal dipole
mode are determined primarily by the parameters of a single trimer and are not
a consequence of the periodicity of the array. The coupling of the toroidal
dipole modes in the twin-trimers can appear in both bonding and anti-bonding
fashion resulting in different orders of the net toroidal dipole moment. Due to
the unique field configuration of these modes, the proposed metasurfaces can be
considered as a platform for efficient light-matter interaction for enhanced
absorption, nonlinear switching, and sensing.

unstable to dewetting-type instabilities due to destablizing solid/NLC
interaction forces. These instabilities are modified by the nematic nature of
the films, which influences the effective solid/NLC interaction. In this work,
we focus on the influence of imposed substrate anchoring on the instability
development. The analysis is carried out within a long-wave formulation based
on the Leslie-Ericksen description of NLC films. Linear stability analysis of
the resulting equations shows that some features of the instability, such as
emerging wavelengths, may not be influenced by the imposed substrate anchoring.
Going further into the nonlinear regime, considered via large-scale GPU-based
simulations, shows however that nonlinear effects may play an important role,
in particular in the case of strong substrate anchoring anisotropy. Our
simulations show that instability of the film develops in two stages: the first
stage involves formation of ridges that are perpendicular to the local
anchoring direction; and the second involves breakup of these ridges and
formation of drops, whose final distribution is influenced by the anisotropy
imposed by the substrate. Finally, we show that imposing more complex substrate
anisotropy patterns allows us to reach basic understanding of the influence of
substrate-imposed defects in director orientation on the instability evolution.

extremely large action spaces. Learning from extreme bandit feedback is
ubiquitous in recommendation systems, in which billions of decisions are made
over sets consisting of millions of choices in a single day, yielding massive
observational data. In these large-scale real-world applications, supervised
learning frameworks such as eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) are widely
used despite the fact that they incur significant biases due to the mismatch
between bandit feedback and supervised labels. Such biases can be mitigated by
importance sampling techniques, but these techniques suffer from impractical
variance when dealing with a large number of actions. In this paper, we
introduce a selective importance sampling estimator (sIS) that operates in a
significantly more favorable bias-variance regime. The sIS estimator is
obtained by performing importance sampling on the conditional expectation of
the reward with respect to a small subset of actions for each instance (a form
of Rao-Blackwellization). We employ this estimator in a novel algorithmic
procedure -- named Policy Optimization for eXtreme Models (POXM) -- for
learning from bandit feedback on XMC tasks. In POXM, the selected actions for
the sIS estimator are the top-p actions of the logging policy, where p is
adjusted from the data and is significantly smaller than the size of the action
space. We use a supervised-to-bandit conversion on three XMC datasets to
benchmark our POXM method against three competing methods: BanditNet, a
previously applied partial matching pruning strategy, and a supervised learning
baseline. Whereas BanditNet sometimes improves marginally over the logging
policy, our experiments show that POXM systematically and significantly
improves over all baselines.

accurate ocean currents and surface winds are available -- this is often too

focus on some of the main problems oil-spill modelers face, which is
determining accurate trajectories when the velocity may be missing important
physics, or when the velocity has localized errors that result in large
trajectory errors. A foundation of physical mechanisms driving motion in the
ocean may help identify currents lacking certain types of physics, and the
remedy. Recent progress in our understanding of motion in the upper centimeters

example the 2003 Point Wells oil spill which had remained unexplained until
recently. When the velocity realistically represents trajectory forcing
mechanisms, advanced Lagrangian techniques that build on the theory of
Lagrangian Coherent Structures can bypass localized velocity errors by
identifying regions of attraction likely to dictate fluid deformation. The

tedious, long, costly, and error-prone. It is often the case that most of our

strong assumptions about the relation between the labels and the input data
distribution. This paradigm has been successful in practice, but most SSL
algorithms end up fully trusting the few available labels. In real life, both
humans and automated systems are prone to mistakes; it is essential that our
algorithms are able to work with labels that are both few and also unreliable.
Our work aims to perform an extensive empirical evaluation of existing
graph-based semi-supervised algorithms, like Gaussian Fields and Harmonic
Functions, Local and Global Consistency, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Graph
Transduction Through Alternating Minimization. To do that, we compare the
accuracy of classifiers while varying the amount of labeled data and label
noise for many different samples. Our results show that, if the dataset is
consistent with SSL assumptions, we are able to detect the noisiest instances,
although this gets harder when the number of available labels decreases. Also,
the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm performed better than label propagation when

systems, as they help users to discover from a large pool of items a compact
set of candidates that are not only interesting but exploratory as well. The
challenge is that relevance and diversity usually act as two competing
objectives in conventional recommender systems, which necessities the classic
trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Traditionally, higher diversity
often means sacrifice on relevance and vice versa. We propose a new approach,
heterogeneous inference, which extends the general collaborative filtering (CF)
by introducing a new way of CF inference, negative-to-positive. Heterogeneous
inference achieves divergent relevance, where relevance and diversity support
each other as two collaborating objectives in one recommendation model, and
where recommendation diversity is an inherent outcome of the relevance
inference process. Benefiting from its succinctness and flexibility, our
approach is applicable to a wide range of recommendation scenarios/use-cases at
various sophistication levels. Our analysis and experiments on public datasets

as sleep diaries rely on subjective recall, which is qualitative and
inaccurate. Wearable devices, on the other hand, provide a low-cost and
convenient means to monitor sleep in home settings. The main aim of this study
was to devise and extract sleep features, from data collected using a wearable
device, and analyse their correlation with depressive symptom severity and
sleep quality, as measured by the self-assessed Patient Health Questionnaire
8-item. Daily sleep data were collected passively by Fitbit wristband devices,
and depressive symptom severity was self-reported every two weeks by the PHQ-8.
The data used in this paper included 2,812 PHQ-8 records from 368 participants
recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK.We
extracted 21 sleep features from Fitbit data which describe sleep in the
following five aspects: sleep architecture, sleep stability, sleep quality,
insomnia, and hypersomnia. Linear mixed regression models were used to explore
associations between sleep features and depressive symptom severity. The z-test
was used to evaluate the significance of the coefficient of each feature. We
tested our models on the entire dataset and individually on the data of three
different study sites. We identified 16 sleep features that were significantly
correlated with the PHQ-8 score on the entire dataset. Associations between

drug repositioning, polypharmacology, drug discovery, as well as drug
resistance and side-effect prediction. DTI identification using machine
learning is gaining popularity in these research areas. Through the years,
numerous deep learning methods have been proposed for DTI prediction.
Nevertheless, prediction accuracy and efficiency remain key challenges.
Pharmaco-electroencephalogram (pharmaco-EEG) is considered valuable in the
development of central nervous system-active drugs. Quantitative EEG analysis
demonstrates high reliability in studying the effects of drugs on the brain.
Earlier preclinical pharmaco-EEG studies showed that different types of drugs
can be classified according to their mechanism of action on neural activity.
Here, we propose a convolutional neural network for EEG-mediated DTI
prediction. This new approach can explain the mechanisms underlying complicated
drug actions, as it allows the identification of similarities in the mechanisms
of action and effects of psychotropic drugs.

four-dimensional gravity in the limit $D \rightarrow 4$. Thus, in this manner,
the GB term yields a non-trivial contribution to the gravitational dynamics. In
fact, regularized black hole solutions and applications in the novel 4D EGB

astrophysical observations, we present an in-depth study of the optical
features of AdS black holes in the novel 4D EGB gravity coupled to exponential
nonlinear electrodynamics (NED), such as the shadow geometrical shape, the
energy emission rate, the deflection angle and quasinormal modes. Taking into

solution by varying the parameters of the models. More specifically, we show
that the variation of the GB and NED parameters, and of the cosmological

holes in the novel 4D EGB gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, thus
leading to the possibility of directly testing these black hole models by using

long-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However,
existing methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that
lack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference
framework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also
derives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD
momentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one
hand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased
towards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the
representation learning and head prediction. Our framework elegantly
disentangles the paradoxical effects of the momentum, by pursuing the direct
causal effect caused by an input sample. In particular, we use causal
intervention in training, and counterfactual reasoning in inference, to remove
the ""bad"" while keep the ""good"". We achieve new state-of-the-arts on three

worst-case and average-case complexities. In a recent work, Dinitz et
al.~[Distributed Computing, 2018] suggested to use smoothed analysis in order
to study dynamic networks. Their aim was to explain the gaps between real-world
networks that function well despite being dynamic, and the strong theoretical
lower bounds for arbitrary networks. To this end, they introduced a basic model
of smoothing in dynamic networks, where an adversary picks a sequence of
graphs, representing the topology of the network over time, and then each of
these graphs is slightly perturbed in a random manner. The model suggested
above is based on a per-round noise, and our aim in this work is to extend it
to models of noise more suited for multiple rounds. This is motivated by
long-lived networks, where the amount and location of noise may vary over time.
To this end, we present several different models of noise. First, we extend the
previous model to cases where the amount of noise is very small. Then, we move
to more refined models, where the amount of noise can change between different
rounds, e.g., as a function of the number of changes the network undergoes. We
also study a model where the noise is not arbitrarily spread among the network,
but focuses in each round in the areas where changes have occurred. Finally, we
study the power of an adaptive adversary, who can choose its actions in
accordance with the changes that have occurred so far. We use the flooding
problem as a running case-study, presenting very different behaviors under the
different models of noise, and analyze the flooding time in different models.

formulate the task of neural network architecture optimization as a graph space

interbank money market. Its main topological features are examined applying
graph theory, focusing on the unsecured overnight loans settled from 2003 to
2017. The network, where banks are the nodes and the operations between them
represent the links, exhibits low density, a higher reciprocity than comparable
random graphs, short average distances and its clustering coefficient remains
above that of a random network of equal size. Furthermore, the network is
prominently disassortative. Its structural metrics experienced significant
volatility, in correlation with the economic activity fluctuations and
regulatory shifts. Signs of nodes' random-like behavior are detected during
contractions. The degree distributions fit better to a Lognormal distribution
than to a Poisson or a Power Law. Additionally, different node centrality
measures are computed. It is found that a higher centrality enables a node to
settle more convenient bilateral interest rates compared to the average market
rate, identifying a statistical and economically significant effect by means of
a regression analysis. These results constitute a relevant input for systemic
risk assessment and provide solid empirical foundations for future theoretical

complexity of Perturbed Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) algorithm to reach
an $\epsilon$-local-minimizer, matches the corresponding deterministic rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^{2})$. We next analyze Stochastic
Cubic-Regularized Newton (SCRN) algorithm under interpolation-like conditions,
and show that the oracle complexity to reach an $\epsilon$-local-minimizer

$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^{2.5})$. While this obtained complexity is
better than the corresponding complexity of either PSGD, or SCRN without

use a sample of FRB host galaxies and a complete sample of core-collapse

a population of magnetars born in CCSNe. We also compare the FRB hosts to the
hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and long gamma-ray

with a population of transients that may be connected to millisecond magnetars.
After using a novel approach to scale the stellar masses and star-formation

we find that the CCSN hosts and FRBs are consistent with arising from the same

in a folded band structure that is difficult to interpret. To solve this
problem and gain insight into the effect of cuprous ion (Cu+) on electronic
properties; We unfolded the band structure of SC KCl:Cu to directly compare
with the band structure of the primitive cell (PC) of pristine KCl. To
understand the effect of Cu substitution on optical absorption, we calculated
the imaginary part of the dielectric function of KCl:Cu through a
sum-over-states formalism and broke it down into different band contributions
by partially making an iterated cumulative sum (ICS) of selected valence and
conduction bands. As a result, we identified those interband transitions that
give rise to the absorption peaks due to the Cu ion. These transitions include
valence and conduction bands formed by the Cu-3d and Cu-4s electronic states.
To investigate the effects of doping position, we consider different doping
positions, where the Cu dopant occupies all the substitutional sites replacing
host K cations. Our results indicate that the doping position's effects give

to Kramers degeneracy and protect nontrivial topological states such as quantum

are stable against coupling to environment, provided that both environment and
the coupling to environment also respect the time-reversal symmetry. By
employing a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with the Langevin noise term and
ultilizing the non-Hermitian linear response theory, we show that the spectral
functions for Kramers degenerate states can be split by dissipation, and the
backscattering between counter-propagating edge states can be induced by
dissipation. The latter leads to the absence of accurate quantization of
conductance in the case of quantum spin Hall effect. As an example, we
demonstrate this concretely with the Kane-Mele model. Our study could also be

of developing deep neural networks with low energy consumption. Unfortunately,
there is an accuracy drop when replacing all convolution filters by adder
filters. The main reason here is the optimization difficulty of ANNs using
$\ell_1$-norm, in which the estimation of gradient in back propagation is
inaccurate. In this paper, we present a novel method for further improving the
performance of ANNs without increasing the trainable parameters via a
progressive kernel based knowledge distillation (PKKD) method. A convolutional
neural network (CNN) with the same architecture is simultaneously initialized
and trained as a teacher network, features and weights of ANN and CNN will be
transformed to a new space to eliminate the accuracy drop. The similarity is
conducted in a higher-dimensional space to disentangle the difference of their
distributions using a kernel based method. Finally, the desired ANN is learned
based on the information from both the ground-truth and teacher, progressively.
The effectiveness of the proposed method for learning ANN with higher
performance is then well-verified on several benchmarks. For instance, the
ANN-50 trained using the proposed PKKD method obtains a 76.8\% top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet dataset, which is 0.6\% higher than that of the ResNet-50.

of deep neural networks. However, it suffers severe performance degradation.
One of the major impediments is the large quantization error between the
full-precision weight vector and its binary vector. Previous works focus on
compensating for the norm gap while leaving the angular bias hardly touched. In
this paper, for the first time, we explore the influence of angular bias on the
quantization error and then introduce a Rotated Binary Neural Network (RBNN),
which considers the angle alignment between the full-precision weight vector
and its binarized version. At the beginning of each training epoch, we propose
to rotate the full-precision weight vector to its binary vector to reduce the
angular bias. To avoid the high complexity of learning a large rotation matrix,
we further introduce a bi-rotation formulation that learns two smaller rotation
matrices. In the training stage, we devise an adjustable rotated weight vector
for binarization to escape the potential local optimum. Our rotation leads to
around 50% weight flips which maximize the information gain. Finally, we
propose a training-aware approximation of the sign function for the gradient
backward. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiorities of
RBNN over many state-of-the-arts. Our source code, experimental settings,

rich Floquet topological phases of matter. Nevertheless, a systematic approach
to characterize non-Hermitian Floquet topological matter is still lacking. In
this work we introduce a dual scheme to characterize the topology of
non-Hermitian Floquet systems in momentum space and in real space, using a
piecewise quenched nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for our case
studies. Under the periodic boundary condition, topological phases are
characterized by a pair of experimentally accessible winding numbers that make
jumps between integers and half-integers. Under the open boundary condition, a
Floquet version of the so-called open boundary winding number is found to be
integers and can predict the number of pairs of zero and $\pi$ Floquet edge
modes coexisting with the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results indicate that
a dual characterization of non-Hermitian Floquet topological matter is
necessary and also feasible because the formidable task of constructing the
celebrated generalized Brillouin zone for non-Hermitian Floquet systems with
multiple hopping length scales can be avoided. This work hence paves a way for
further studies of non-Hermitian physics in non-equilibrium systems.

widely applied to nonlinear industrial systems. As EKF is limited in accuracy
and reliability, sequential Monte-Carlo methods or particle filters (PF) can
obtain superior accuracy at the cost of a huge number of random samples. The
unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can achieve adequate accuracy more efficiently by
using deterministic samples, but its weights may be negative, which might cause
instability problem. For Gaussian filters, the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and
Gauss Hermit filter (GHF) employ cubature and respectively Gauss-Hermite rules
to approximate statistic information of random variables and exhibit impressive
performances in practical problems. Inspired by this work, this paper presents
a new nonlinear estimation scheme named after geometric unscented Kalman filter
(GUF). The GUF chooses the filtering framework of CKF for updating data and
develops a geometric unscented sampling (GUS) strategy for approximating random
variables. The main feature of GUS is selecting uniformly distributed samples
according to the probability and geometric location similar to UKF and CKF, and
having positive weights like PF. Through such way, GUF can maintain adequate
accuracy as GHF with reasonable efficiency and good stability. The GUF does not
suffer from the exponential increase of sample size as for PF or failure to
converge resulted from non-positive weights as for high order CKF and UKF.

length of a bounded variation path $\gamma$ can be recovered from the

tree-reducedness (namely, with no tree-like pieces). Existing arguments have
relied crucially on $\gamma$ having a continuous derivative under the unit
speed parametrisation. In this article, we prove the above isometry conjecture
for planar paths by assuming only local bounds on the angle of $\gamma'$ (which
ensures the absence of tree-like pieces). Our technique is based on lifting the
path onto the special linear group ${\rm SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and analysing the

little systematic evidence of rates of teacher turnover in low-income
countries. I investigate the incidence and consequences of teacher turnover in
Rwandan public primary schools over the period from 2016-2019. To do so, I
combine the universe of teacher placement records with student enrollment
figures and school-average Primary Leaving Exam scores in a nationally
representative sample of 259 schools. Results highlight five features of
teacher turnover. First, rates of teacher turnover are high: annually, 20
percent of teachers separate from their jobs, of which 11 percent exit from the
public-sector teaching workforce. Second, the burden of teacher churn is higher
in schools with low learning levels and, perhaps surprisingly, in low
pupil-teacher-ratio schools. Third, teacher turnover is concentrated among
early-career teachers, male teachers, and those assigned to teach Math. Fourth,
replacing teachers quickly after they exit is a challenge; 23 percent of
exiting teachers are not replaced the following year. And fifth, teacher
turnover is associated with subsequent declines in learning outcomes. On
average, the loss of a teacher is associated with a reduction in learning
levels of 0.05 standard deviations. In addition to class-size increases, a
possible mechanism for these learning outcomes is the prevalence of teachers
teaching outside of their areas of subject expertise: in any given year, at
least 21 percent of teachers teach in subjects in which they have not been
trained. Taken together, these results suggest that the problem of teacher
turnover is substantial in magnitude and consequential for learning outcomes in
schools.

conceivable in various real-world applications such as online advertisements,

delayed feedback, naive classification of the positive and negative samples
returns a biased classifier. One solution is to use samples that have been

(SGD) is closely related to generalization: A larger SGD noise, if not too
large, results in better generalization. Since the covariance of the SGD noise
is proportional to $\eta^2/B$, where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $B$ is the
minibatch size of SGD, the SGD noise has so far been controlled by changing
$\eta$ and/or $B$. However, too large $\eta$ results in instability in the
training dynamics and a small $B$ prevents scalable parallel computation. It is
thus desirable to develop a method of controlling the SGD noise without
changing $\eta$ and $B$. In this paper, we propose a method that achieves this
goal using ``noise enhancement'', which is easily implemented in practice. We
expound the underlying theoretical idea and demonstrate that the noise
enhancement actually improves generalization for real datasets. It turns out
that large-batch training with the noise enhancement even shows better
generalization compared with small-batch training.

applied to a range of challenging sequential decision-making and control tasks.
However, most of existing techniques are designed for discrete-time systems. As
a first step toward their extension to continuous-time systems, this paper
considers continuous-time deterministic optimal control problems with entropy
regularization. Applying the dynamic programming principle, we derive a novel
class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and prove that the optimal
value function of the maximum entropy control problem corresponds to the unique
viscosity solution of the HJB equation. Our maximum entropy formulation is
shown to enhance the regularity of the viscosity solution and to be
asymptotically consistent as the effect of entropy regularization diminishes. A
salient feature of the HJB equations is computational tractability. Generalized
Hopf-Lax formulas can be used to solve the HJB equations in a tractable
grid-free manner without the need for numerically optimizing the Hamiltonian.
We further show that the optimal control is uniquely characterized as Gaussian
in the case of control affine systems and that, for linear-quadratic problems,
the HJB equation is reduced to a Riccati equation, which can be used to obtain
an explicit expression of the optimal control. Lastly, we discuss how to extend
our results to continuous-time model-free RL by taking an adaptive dynamic
programming approach. To our knowledge, the resulting algorithms are the first
data-driven control methods that use an information theoretic exploration
mechanism in continuous time.

dependence of the photocurrent, a so-called momentum map or k-map, and
interprets it as the Fourier transform of the initial state's molecular
orbital, thereby gains insights into the geometric and electronic structure of
organic/metal interfaces.
  In this contribution, we present kMap.py which is a Python program that
enables the user, via a PyQt-based graphical user interface, to simulate
photoemission momentum maps of molecular orbitals and to perform a one-to-one
comparison between simulation and experiment. Based on the plane wave
approximation for the final state, simulated momentum maps are computed
numerically from a fast Fourier transform of real space molecular orbital
distributions, which are used as program input and taken from density
functional calculations. The program allows the user to vary a number of
simulation parameters such as the final state kinetic energy, the molecular
orientation or the polarization state of the incident light field. Moreover,
also experimental photoemission data can be loaded into the program enabling a
direct visual comparison as well as an automatic optimization procedure to
determine structural parameters of the molecules or weights of molecular
orbitals contributions. With an increasing number of experimental groups
employing photoemission tomography to study adsorbate layers, we expect kMap.py

energy gap in between intra and interband particle hole continuum (PHC) for
vanishing excitation wavevector. In the long wavelength limit, the width of
interband PHC behaves differently for Fermi energies below and above the BTP as
a clear signature of the Fermi surface topology change. We find a single
undamped optical plasmon mode lying in between the intra and interband PHC for
Fermi energies above and below the BTP. The plasmon mode below the BTP has
smaller velocity than that of above the BTP. It is interesting to find that as
we tune the Fermi energy around the BTP, the plasmon mode becomes damped within
a range of e-e interaction strength. For Fermi energies above and below the
BTP, we also obtain an approximate analytical result of plasma frequency and
plasmon dispersion which match well with their numerical counterparts in the
long wavelength limit. The plasmon dispersion is $\propto q^2$ with $q$ being
the wave vector for plasmon excitation in the long wavelength limit. We find
that varying the carrier density with fixed e-e interaction strength or vice
versa does not change the number of undamped plasmon mode, although damped
plasmon modes can be more in number for some values of these parameters. We
demonstrate our results by calculating the loss function and optical

that developers more often than not have to resort to compromises when it comes
to code that is well written and code that just does the job. This has led over
the past decades to the concept of ""technical debt"", a short-term hack that
potentially generates long-term maintenance problems. Self-admitted technical
debt (SATD) is a particular form of technical debt: developers consciously
perform the hack but also document it in the code by adding comments as a
reminder (or as an admission of guilt). We focus on a specific type of SATD,
namely ""On-hold"" SATD, in which developers document in their comments the need
to halt an implementation task due to conditions outside of their scope of work
(e.g., an open issue must be closed before a function can be implemented). We
present an approach, based on regular expressions and machine learning, which
is able to detect issues referenced in code comments, and to automatically
classify the detected instances as either ""On-hold"" (the issue is referenced to
indicate the need to wait for its resolution before completing a task), or as
""cross-reference"", (the issue is referenced to document the code, for example
to explain the rationale behind an implementation choice). Our approach also
mines the issue tracker of the projects to check if the On-hold SATD instances
are ""superfluous"" and can be removed (i.e., the referenced issue has been
closed, but the SATD is still in the code). Our evaluation confirms that our
approach can indeed identify relevant instances of On-hold SATD. We illustrate
its usefulness by identifying superfluous On-hold SATD instances in open source
projects as confirmed by the original developers.

spatiotemporal pattern formation are rarely isolated systems, either chemically
or thermodynamically. However, even formulations of `open' reaction-diffusion
systems often neglect the role of domain boundaries. Most idealizations of
closed reaction-diffusion systems employ no-flux boundary conditions, and often
patterns will form up to, or along, these boundaries. Motivated by boundaries
of patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic
development, we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two-species
reaction-diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the
boundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics, with a
prescribed uniform state near the boundary. We show that these boundary
conditions can be derived from a larger heterogeneous field, indicating that
these conditions can arise naturally if cell signalling or other properties of
the medium vary in space. We explain the basic mechanisms behind this pattern
localization, and demonstrate that it can capture a large range of localized
patterning in one, two, and three dimensions, and that this framework can be
applied to systems involving more than two species. Furthermore, the boundary
conditions proposed lead to more symmetrical patterns on the interior of the
domain, and plausibly capture more realistic boundaries in developmental
systems. Finally, we show that these isolated patterns are more robust to
fluctuations in initial conditions, and that they allow intriguing
possibilities of pattern selection via geometry, distinct from known selection
mechanisms.

study primes that are totally split in extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ of high
degree. Motivated by a question of Kowalski we focus on the extensions
$\mathbb{Q}(E[d])$ obtained by adjoining the coordinates of $d$-torsion points
of a non-CM elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$. A prime $p$ is said to be an outside
prime of $E$ if it is totally split in $\mathbb{Q}(E[d])$ for some $d$ with
$p<|\text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[d])/\mathbb{Q})| = d^{4-o(1)}$ (so that $p$ is not
accounted for by the expected main term in the Chebotarev Density Theorem). We
show that for almost all integers $d$ there exists a non-CM elliptic curve
$E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p<|\text{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[d])/\mathbb{Q})|$ which
is totally split in $\mathbb{Q}(E[d])$. Furthermore, we prove that for almost

$E/\mathbb{Q}$ and a prime $p$ with $p^{0.2694} < d$ which is totally split in
$\mathbb{Q}(E[d])$.
  To show this we use work of Kowalski to relate the question to the
distribution of primes in certain residue classes modulo $d^2$. Hence, the
barrier $p < d^4$ is related to the limit in the classical Bombieri-Vinogradov
Theorem. To break past this we make use of the assumption that $d$ factorizes
conveniently, similarly as in the works on primes in arithmetic progression to
large moduli by Bombieri, Friedlander, Fouvry, and Iwaniec, and in the more
recent works of Zhang, Polymath, and the author. In contrast to these works we
do not require any of the deep exponential sum bounds (ie. sums of Kloosterman
sums or Weil/Deligne bound). Instead, we only require the classical large sieve
for multiplicative characters. We use Harman's sieve method to obtain a
combinatorial decomposition for primes.

investigate literature according to data augmentation, transfer learning, and
interactive segmentation, separately. Compared to existing surveys, this survey
classifies the literatures very differently from before and is more convenient

solution to the autonomous vector-valued ODE: X (t, x) = b(X(t, x)) for t $\in$

vector field b reads as the product $\rho$ $\Phi$, where $\rho$ : Y d
$\rightarrow$ [0, $\infty$) is a non negative regular function and $\Phi$ : Y d
$\rightarrow$ R d is a non vanishing regular vector field. In this work, the
singleton condition means that the rotation set C b composed of the average
values of b with respect to the invariant probability measures for the flow X
is a singleton {$\zeta$}, or equivalently, that lim t$\rightarrow$$\infty$ X(t,
x)/t = $\zeta$ for any x $\in$ Y d. This combined with Liouville's theorem
regarded as a divergence-curl lemma, first allows us to obtain the asymptotics
of the flow X when b is a current field. Then, we prove a general perturbation
result assuming that $\rho$ is the uniform limit in Y d of a positive sequence
($\rho$ n) n$\in$N satisfying for any n $\in$ N, $\rho$ $\le$ $\rho$ n and C
$\rho$n$\Phi$ is a singleton {$\zeta$ n }. It turns out that the limit set C b
either remains a singleton, or enlarges to the closed line set [0, lim n

involving or not the classical ergodic condition, according to the positivity
or not of some harmonic means of $\rho$. These results are illustrated by
different examples which show that the perturbation result is limited to the
scalar perturbation of $\rho$, and which highlight the alternative satisfied by
the rotation set C b. Finally, we prove that the singleton condition allows us
to homogenize in any dimension the linear transport equation induced by the
oscillating velocity b(x/$\epsilon$) beyond any ergodic condition satisfied by
the flow X.

ahead of the subcluster. At a later merger stage, this bow shock separates from
the subcluster, becoming a ""runaway"" shock that propagates down the steep
density gradient through the cluster outskirts and approximately maintains its
strength and the Mach number. Such shocks are plausible candidates for
producing radio relics in the periphery of clusters. We argue that, during the
same merger stage, a secondary shock is formed much closer to the main cluster
center. A close analog of this structure is known in the usual hydrodynamics as
N-waves, where the trailing part of the ""N"" is the result of the non-linear
evolution of a shock. In merging clusters, spherical geometry and
stratification could further promote its development. Both the primary and the
secondary shocks are the natural outcome of a single merger event and often
both components of the pair should be present. However, in the radio band, the
leading shock could be more prominent, while the trailing shock might
conversely be more easily seen in X-rays. The latter argument implies that for
some of the (trailing) shocks found in X-ray data, it might be difficult to
identify their ""partner"" leading shocks or the merging subclusters, which are
farther away from the cluster center. We argue that the Coma cluster and A2744
could be two examples in a post-merger state with such well-separated shock
pairs.

resulting in the output switching to an often unsatisfactory state. This
phenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. This thermoacoustic
instability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and
aeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression.
It was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by
changing quickly enough the bifurcation parameters. Thus, in this work, based
on a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored
noise, the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is
derived by using a stochastic averaging method. A transient dynamical behavior
is identified through a probability density analysis. We find that the rate of
change of parameters and the correlation time of the noise are helpful to dodge
thermoacoustic instability, while a relatively large noise intensity is a
disadvantageous factor. In addition, power-law relationships between the
maximum amplitude and the noise parameters are explored, and the probability of
successfully dodging a thermoacoustic instability is calculated. These results
serve as a guide to the design of engines and to propose an effective control
strategy, which is of great significance to aerospace-related fields.

test suites for evaluating algorithms. In visualization, similar approaches
have been adopted in some areas (e.g., volume visualization), while user

establish a test suite for evaluating the design of colormaps. With such a

are applied to planar scalar fields that may exhibit various characteristic
features, such as jumps, local extrema, ridge or valley lines, different
distributions of scalar values, different gradients, different signal
frequencies, different levels of noise, and so on. The suite also includes an
expansible collection of real-world data sets including the most popular data

super-resolution for detail fidelity. Aiming at pursuing this intention, there
are two challenging issues to be solved: (1) learning appropriate operators

improving the ability of model to preserve the low-frequency smoothes and
reconstruct the high-frequency details. To solve them, we propose a purposeful
and interpretable detail-fidelity attention network to progressively process
these smoothes and details in divide-and-conquer manner, which is a novel and
specific prospect of image super-resolution for the purpose on improving the
detail fidelity, instead of blindly designing or employing the deep CNNs
architectures for merely feature representation in local receptive fields.
Particularly, we propose a Hessian filtering for interpretable feature
representation which is high-profile for detail inference, a dilated
encoder-decoder and a distribution alignment cell to improve the inferred
Hessian features in morphological manner and statistical manner respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve superior

bits for ultrafast and power-efficient spintronic memory and logic devices.
They may be stabilized in heavy-metal/ferromagnetic/oxide trilayer systems. The
skyrmion chirality is then determined by the sign of the interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Nevertheless, for apparently identical
systems, there is some controversy about the DMI sign. Here, we show that the
degree of oxidation of the top interface and the thickness of the ferromagnetic
layer play a major role. Using Brillouin light-scattering measurements in
Ta/Fe-Co-B/TaOx trilayers, we demonstrate a sign change of the DMI with the
degree of oxidation of the Fe-Co-B/TaOx interface. Using polar magneto-optical
Kerr effect microscopy, we consistently observe a reversal of the direction of
current-induced motion of skyrmions with the oxidation level of TaOx; this is
attributed to their chirality reversal. In addition, a second chirality
reversal is observed when changing the Fe-Co-B thickness, probably due to the
proximity of the two Fe-Co-B interfaces in the ultrathin case. By properly
tuning the chirality of the skyrmion, spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques
combine constructively to enhance the skyrmion velocity. These observations
thus allow us to envision an optimization of the material parameters to produce
highly mobile skyrmions. Moreover, this chirality control enables a versatile
manipulation of skyrmions and paves the way towards multidirectional devices.

astrophysical issues, including the interpretation of gravitational waves
signals, of the short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and of the chemical properties
of stars in galaxies. Such rate depends on the distribution of the delay times
(DDT) of the merging events. In this paper we derive a theoretical DDT of
merging DNS following from the characteristics of the clock controlling their
evolution. We show that the shape of the DDT is governed by a few key
parameters, primarily the lower limit and the slope of the distribution of the
separation of the DNS systems at birth. With a parametric approach we
investigate on the observational constraints on the DDT from the cosmic rate of
short GRBs and the Europium to Iron ratio in Milky Way stars, taken as tracer
of the products of the explosion. We find that the local rate of DNS merging
requires that about 1 percent of neutron stars progenitors live in binary
systems which end their evolution as merging DNS within a Hubble time. The
redshift distribution of short GRBs does not yet provide a strong constraint on
the shape of the DDT, although the best fitting models have a shallow DDT. The
chemical pattern in Milky Way stars requires an additional source of Europium
besides the products from merging DNS, which weakens the related requirement on
the DDT. At present both constraints can be matched with the same DDT for
merging DNS.

that is inherent in entropy-conserving two-point fluxes, which are a key

we investigate if pressure equilibrium preservation is a remedy to these

describes the property of a discretization to keep pressure and velocity

quantum computing for a range of applications. However, as the problem size
grows, quantum logic errors and the effect of barren plateaus overwhelm the
quality of the results. There is now a clear focus on strategies that require
fewer quantum circuit steps and are robust to device errors. Here we present an
approach in which problem complexity is transferred to dynamic quantities
computed on the quantum processor - Hamiltonian moments, $\langle H^n\rangle$.
From these quantum computed moments, estimates of the ground-state energy are
obtained using the ""infinum"" theorem from Lanczos cumulant expansions which
manifestly correct the associated variational calculation. With system dynamics
encoded in the moments the burden on the trial-state quantum circuit depth is
eased. The method is introduced and demonstrated on 2D quantum magnetism models
on lattices up to 5 $\times$ 5 (25 qubits) implemented on IBM Quantum
superconducting qubit devices. Moments were quantum computed to fourth order
with respect to a parameterised antiferromagnetic trial-state. A comprehensive
comparison with benchmark variational calculations was performed, including
over an ensemble of random coupling instances. The results showed that the
infinum estimate consistently outperformed the benchmark variational approach
for the same trial-state. These initial investigations suggest that the quantum
computed moments approach has a high degree of stability against trial-state
variation, quantum gate errors and shot noise, all of which bodes well for
further investigation and applications of the approach.

Differential Equations (ODEs) which achieves non-trivial adversarial robustness
under white-box adversarial attacks even when the network is trained naturally.
For most existing defense methods withstanding strong white-box attacks, to
improve robustness of neural networks, they need to be trained adversarially,
hence have to strike a trade-off between natural accuracy and adversarial
robustness. Inspired by dynamical system theory, we design a stabilized neural
ODE network named SONet whose ODE blocks are skew-symmetric and proved to be
input-output stable. With natural training, SONet can achieve comparable
robustness with the state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, without
sacrificing natural accuracy. Even replacing only the first layer of a ResNet
by such a ODE block can exhibit further improvement in robustness, e.g., under
PGD-20 ($\ell_\infty=0.031$) attack on CIFAR-10 dataset, it achieves 91.57\%
and natural accuracy and 62.35\% robust accuracy, while a counterpart
architecture of ResNet trained with TRADES achieves natural and robust accuracy
76.29\% and 45.24\%, respectively. To understand possible reasons behind this
surprisingly good result, we further explore the possible mechanism underlying
such an adversarial robustness. We show that the adaptive stepsize numerical
ODE solver, DOPRI5, has a gradient masking effect that fails the PGD attacks
which are sensitive to gradient information of training loss; on the other
hand, it cannot fool the CW attack of robust gradients and the SPSA attack that
is gradient-free. This provides a new explanation that the adversarial
robustness of ODE-based networks mainly comes from the obfuscated gradients in
numerical ODE solvers.

interesting tool for lifting good properties of finite Markov chains to
denumerable ones. Later, this concept was extended to more general stochastic
transition systems (STSs), allowing the design of various verification
algorithms for large classes of (infinite) STSs. We further improve the
understanding and utility of decisiveness in two ways. First, we provide a
general criterion for proving decisiveness of general STSs. This criterion,
which is very natural but whose proof is rather technical, (strictly)
generalizes all known criteria from the literature. Second, we focus on
stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), a stochastic extension of hybrid systems. We
establish the decisiveness of a large class of SHSs and, under a few classical
hypotheses from mathematical logic, we show how to decide reachability problems
in this class, even though they are undecidable for general SHSs. This provides
a decidable stochastic extension of o-minimal hybrid systems.

However, the privacy risks brought by untrustworthy cloud servers arise the
attention of more and more people and legislatures. In the last two decades,
plenty of works seek to outsource various specific tasks while ensuring the
security of private data. The tasks to be outsourced are countless; however,
the computations involved are similar. In this paper, we construct a series of
novel protocols that support the secure computation of various functions on
numbers (e.g., the basic elementary functions) and matrices (e.g., the
calculation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues) in arbitrary $n\geq 2$ servers.
All protocols only require constant rounds of interactions and achieve the low
computation complexity. Moreover, the proposed $n$-party protocols ensure the
security of private data even though $n-1$ servers collude. The convolutional
neural network models are utilized as the case studies to verify the protocols.
The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the correctness,
efficiency, and security of the proposed protocols.

available to analysts and researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and
subjective feedback methods. These data can be used for modeling comfort
behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and
well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor
conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are
less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning
workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for
developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with
high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset
class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), $\texttt{comfortGAN}$, to
address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly
available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection
of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points,
respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced
dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from $\texttt{comfortGAN}$,
has higher performance (increase between 4% and 17% in classification accuracy)
than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing
discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is
expected, and the additional increase in performance by $\texttt{comfortGAN}$
shrinks to 1-2%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal
comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its
value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist
potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which
method works best.

Agency's (ESA) X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton). Its observing time lost
due to background contamination is about 40\%. This loss of observing time
affects all the major broad science goals of this observatory, ranging from

background could dramatically impact future large X-ray missions such as the
ESA planned Athena mission (http://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/).
Physical processes that trigger this background are still poorly understood. We
use a Machine Learning (ML) approach to delineate related important parameters
and to develop a model to predict the background contamination using 12 years
of XMM observations. As predictors we use the location of satellite, solar and
geomagnetic activity parameters. We revealed that the contamination is most
strongly related to the distance in southern direction, $Z$, (XMM observations
were in the southern hemisphere), the solar wind radial velocity and the
location on the magnetospheric magnetic field lines. We derived simple
empirical models for the first two individual predictors and an ML model which
utilizes an ensemble of the predictors (Extra Trees Regressor) and gives better
performance. Based on our analysis, future missions should minimize
observations during times associated with high solar wind speed and avoid
closed magnetic field lines, especially at the dusk flank region in the

over $\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading channel. Firstly, new accurate approximations
of error probability (EP) of both modulation schemes are derived over additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Leveraging the trapezoidal integral
method, a tight approximate expression of symbol error probability for $M$-PSK
modulation is presented, while new upper and lower bounds for Marcum
$Q$-function of the first order (MQF), and subsequently those for bit error

linearly combined to propose a highly refined and accurate BER's approximation.
The key idea manifested in the decrease property of modified Bessel function

the effect of such heterogeneity on the outcome of local interactions and,
ultimately, on global competition. For instance, a strategy that was dominated
before can become desirable from the selection perspective when behavioural

resources. Through several case studies, it is shown that inertia and frequency
response cannot be considered as system-wide magnitudes in power systems that
exhibit inter-area oscillations in frequency, as their location in a particular

medium-sized loss in the low-inertia region proves to cause significant wind
curtailment, which could be alleviated through reinforced transmission
corridors. In this context, the proposed constraints allow to find the optimal
volume of ancillary services to be procured in each region.

expansion time scales, and ($\alpha$,n) reactions become critical to move
matter towards heavier nuclei. The rates of these reactions are calculated with

of collocation points cannot ensure a fast convergence to spectral accuracy. In
this paper, we propose a scaling technique and a moving technique to adaptively
cluster enough collocation points in a region of interest in order to achieve a
fast spectral convergence. Our scaling algorithm employs an indicator in the
frequency domain that is used to determine when scaling is needed and informs
the tuning of a scaling factor to redistribute collocation points to adapt to
the diffusive behavior of the solution. Our moving technique adopts an
exterior-error indicator and moves the collocation points to capture the
translation. Both frequency and exterior-error indicators are defined using
only the numerical solutions. We apply our methods to a number of different
models, including diffusive and moving Fermi-Dirac distributions and nonlinear
Dirac solitary waves, and demonstrate recovery of spectral convergence for
time-dependent simulations. Performance comparison in solving a linear
parabolic problem shows that our frequency scaling algorithm outperforms the
existing scaling approaches. We also show our frequency scaling technique is

$\sim10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with an X-ray spectrum that is consistent with the
power law, blackbody, or accretion-heated neutron star atmosphere models. The
improved X-ray localization of the source allowed us to confirm the previously
identified candidate optical counterpart as a relatively massive G/K~III star
at 8 kpc close to the Galactic center, implying an almost face-on view of the
binary system. Although we could only find a nonrestricting upper limit on the
pulsed fraction of $\sim20$%, the observed hard X-ray spectrum and strong
long-term variability of the X-ray flux suggest that the source is also still
accreting when not in outburst. The luminosity corresponding to the onset of
centrifugal inhibition of accretion is thus estimated to be at least two orders
of magnitude lower than previously reported. We discuss this finding in the
context of previous studies and argue that the results indicate a multipole
structure in the magnetic field with the first dipole term of $\sim 10^{10}$ G,
which is much lower than previously assumed.

scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,

superconductivity in epitaxial graphene $via$ a remote proximity effect, from
the rhenium substrate through an intercalated gold layer. Weak graphene-Au
interaction, contrasting with the strong undesired graphene-Re interaction, is
demonstrated by a reduced graphene corrugation, an increased distance between
graphene and the underlying metal, a linear electronic dispersion and a
characteristic vibrational signature, both latter features revealing also a
slight $p$ doping of graphene. We also reveal that the main shortcoming of the
intercalation approach to proximity superconductivity is the creation of a high
density of point defects in graphene (10$^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$). Finally, we
demonstrate remote proximity superconductivity in graphene/Au/Re(0001), at low

hindered by the intrinsic electron-hole exchange interaction. In this study, we
present a comprehensive investigation of valley-polarized finite-momentum
excitons in WSe$_2$-MLs over the entire Brillouin zone by solving the
density-functional-theory(DFT)-based Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) under the

actually in general well immune from the exchange-induced valley
depolarization, except for those with specific exciton momenta directionally
coincide with the axes associated with the $3\sigma_v$ and $3C_2'$ symmetries
in TMD-MLs. Governed by the symmetries, the valley pseudo-spin texture of the
full-zone exciton band in the momentum space is locally featured by individual
skyrmion-like structures where highly valley-polarized finite-momentum exciton
states are centred. Remarkably, we show that the high degrees of valley
polarizations of the finite-momentum exciton states are excellently well
transferable to the optical polarizations in the resulting phonon-assisted
photo-luminescences, suggesting the prospective usefulness of those
inter-valley excitons in valley-based photonics.

their seminal graph minors series, turns out to be one of the most important
tool in structural and algorithmic graph theory. In this paper, we provide the
canonical tree decomposition theorem for digraphs. More precisely, we construct
directed tree-decompositions of digraphs that distinguish all their tangles of
order $k$, for any fixed integer $k$, in polynomial time. As an application of
this canonical tree-decomposition theorem, we provide the following result for
the directed disjoint paths problem:
  For every fixed $k$ there is a polynomial-time algorithm which, on input $G$,
and source and terminal vertices $(s_1, t_1), \dots, (s_k, t_k)$, either
  1. determines that there is no set of pairwise vertex-disjoint paths
connecting each source $s_i$ to its terminal $t_i$, or
  2.finds a half-integral solution, i.e., outputs paths $P_1, \dots, P_k$ such
that $P_i$ links $s_i$ to $t_i$, so that every vertex of the graph is contained
in at most two paths. Given known hardness results for the directed disjoint
paths problem, our result cannot be improved for general digraphs, neither to
fixed-parameter tractability nor to fully vertex-disjoint directed paths. As
far as we are aware, this is the first time to obtain a tractable result for
the $k$-disjoint paths problem for general digraphs. We expect more
applications of our canonical tree-decomposition for directed results.

8at.% oxygen content. Here we show that such naive interpretation is
misleading. We support XRD data with a machine learning analysis of ab initio
simulations and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy data, revealing no
signs of a possible solubility limit. Instead, the presence of a wide range of
non-equilibrium oxygen-rich defective structures emerging at increasing oxygen

in two different ways. The more intuitive of them is based on truncated

estimates are more uniform in the sense that errors do not become too large in

numerically demonstrated to exhibit variable absorption performance, it cannot

that the waveform-selective responses in the linear metasurfaces are originated
from the dispersion behaviors of the structures rather than the
frequency-conversion seen in nonlinear waveform-selective metasurfaces. We thus
refer to these linear structures as pseudo-waveform-selective metasurfaces.
Additionally, we show that the pseudo-waveform-selective metasurfaces have
limited performance unless nonlinearity is introduced. These results and
findings confirm the advantages of nonlinear waveform-selective metasurfaces,
which can be exploited to provide an additional degree of freedom to address

structure of the top-quark coupling to the photon. The invisible-decay channel
$t\bar{t}Z(Z \to \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)$ is an important SM background for
Dark Matter searches in $t\bar{t}+E_{T}^{miss}$ final states. Our results are
accurate to NLO in QCD and include all resonant and non-resonant diagrams,
interferences and off-shell effects for top quarks and $W/Z$ bosons. As such,
they represent the most complete description of these processes from the

  Synthesis From a Single Timepoint",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning how to predict the brain connectome (i.e. graph) development and
aging is of paramount importance for charting the future of within-disorder and
cross-disorder landscape of brain dysconnectivity evolution. Indeed, predicting
the longitudinal (i.e., time-dependent ) brain dysconnectivity as it emerges
and evolves over time from a single timepoint can help design personalized
treatments for disordered patients in a very early stage. Despite its
significance, evolution models of the brain graph are largely overlooked in the
literature. Here, we propose EvoGraphNet, the first end-to-end geometric deep
learning-powered graph-generative adversarial network (gGAN) for predicting
time-dependent brain graph evolution from a single timepoint. Our EvoGraphNet
architecture cascades a set of time-dependent gGANs, where each gGAN
communicates its predicted brain graphs at a particular timepoint to train the
next gGAN in the cascade at follow-up timepoint. Therefore, we obtain each next
predicted timepoint by setting the output of each generator as the input of its
successor which enables us to predict a given number of timepoints using only
one single timepoint in an end- to-end fashion. At each timepoint, to better
align the distribution of the predicted brain graphs with that of the
ground-truth graphs, we further integrate an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler
divergence loss function. To capture time-dependency between two consecutive
observations, we impose an l1 loss to minimize the sparse distance between two
serialized brain graphs. A series of benchmarks against variants and ablated
versions of our EvoGraphNet showed that we can achieve the lowest brain graph
evolution prediction error using a single baseline timepoint. Our EvoGraphNet
code is available at http://github.com/basiralab/EvoGraphNet.

one light fermion, the fermion-mediated potential between the two heavy bosons
gives rise to an infinite series of three-body bound states. The intraspecies
scattering length determines the three-body parameter and the scaling factor
between consecutive Efimov states. In a second scenario, we replace the single
fermion by an entire Fermi Sea at zero temperature. The emerging interaction
potential for the two bosons exhibits long-range oscillations leading to a
weakening of the binding and a breakup of the infinite series of Efimov states.
In this scenario, the binding energies follow a modified Efimov scaling law
incorporating the Fermi momentum. The scaling factor between deeply bound
states is governed by the intraspecies interaction, analogous to the Efimov
states in vacuum.

hypothesis that conscious observation causes collapse by exploring dynamical
collapse models in which some purportedly quantifiable aspect(s) of
consciousness resist superposition. Kremnizer-Ranchin, Chalmers-McQueen and
Okon-Sebasti\'an have explored the idea that collapse may be associated with a
numerical measure of consciousness. More recently, Chalmers-McQueen have argued
that any single measure is inadequate because it will allow superpositions of
distinct states of equal consciousness measure to persist. They suggest a
satisfactory model needs to associate collapse with a set of measures
quantifying aspects of consciousness, such as the ""Q-shapes"" defined by Tononi
et al. in their ""integrated information theory"" (IIT) of consciousness. I argue
here that Chalmers-McQueen's argument against associating a single measure with
collapse requires a precise symmetry between brain states associated with
different experiences and thus does not apply to the only case where we have
strong intuitions, namely human (or other terrestrial biological) observers. In
defence of Chalmers-McQueen's stance, it might be argued that idealized
artificial information processing networks could display such symmetries.
However, I argue that any theory (such as IIT) that postulates a map from
network states to mind states should assign identical mind states to isomorphic
network states (as IIT does). This suggests that, if such a map exists, no
familiar components of mind states, such as viewing different colours, or
experiencing pleasure or pain, are likely to be related by symmetries.

characteristics are elucidated. Investigations were carried out in several
deaerated solvents using acridone and naphthalene derivatives as a sensitizer
and emitter, respectively. Both upconversion quantum efficiency and sample
photostability under continuous photoirradiation strongly depended on the
solvent. The former dependence is governed by the solvent polarity, which
affects the triplet energy level matching between the sensitizer and emitter
because of the solvatochromism of the sensitizer. To elucidate the latter,
first we investigated the photodegradation of samples without the emitter,
which revealed that the sensitizer degradation rate is correlated with the
difference between the frontier orbital energy levels of the sensitizer and
solvent. Inclusion of the emitter effectively suppressed the degradation of the
sensitizer, which is ascribed to fast quenching of the triplet sensitizer by
the emitter and justifies the use of ketonic sensitizers for UV-UC in solvents.
A theoretical model was developed to acquire insight into the observed temporal
decays of the upconverted emission intensity under continuous photoirradiation.
The theoretical curves generated by this model fitted the experimental decay
curves well, which allowed the reaction rate between the emitter and solvent to
be obtained. This rate was also correlated with difference between the frontier
orbital energy levels of the emitter and solvent. Finally, based on the
acquired findings, general design guidelines for developing UV-UC samples were
proposed.

including self-doping associated with defects and a reduction of the electron

indicates that the structural transformation is sluggish and shows a sizable

first-order reconstructive, with chemical bonds being broken and rearranged in

cosmology relies on a single global linear relationship between their peak
luminosity and colour, the $\beta$ parameter. However, there are several pieces
of evidence and physical reasons to believe that this relation is not universal
and may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In
this work, we allow $\beta$ to vary among subpopulations with different
observed properties in the cosmological fits. Although the inferred
cosmological parameters are consistent with previous studies that assume a
single colour-luminosity relation, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal
distributions of $\beta$ when split according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy
mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a $\beta$-step relation in which low $\beta$
values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by
differing dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we
find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are consistent with a lower/larger $\beta$. This
trend is explained with $\beta$ being a combination of a low intrinsic
colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic
reddening relation dominant at redder colours. The host galaxy mass-step
correction always provides better distance calibration, regardless of the
multiple $\beta$ approaches, and we suggest that it may come from a difference
in intrinsic colour-luminosity properties of SNe Ia in two types of
environments. Additionally, we find that blue SNe in low-mass environments are
better standard candles than the others.

leading cause of death worldwide[1]. A progressive state of this disease marked
by plaque rupture and clot formation in the coronary arteries, also known as an
acute coronary syndrome (ACS), is a condition of the heart associated with
sudden, reduced blood flow caused due to partial or full occlusion of coronary
vasculature that normally perfuses the myocardium and nerve bundles,
compromising the proper functioning of the heart. Often manifesting with pain
or tightness in the chest as the second most common cause of emergency
department visits in the United States, it is imperative to detect ACS at the
earliest. This is particularly relevant to diabetic patients at home, that may
not feel classic chest pain symptoms, and are susceptible to silent myocardial
injury. In this study, we developed the RCE- ECG-Detect algorithm, a machine
learning model to detect the morphological patterns in significant ST change
associated with myocardial ischemia. We developed the RCE- ECG-Detect using
data from the LTST database which has a sufficiently large sample set to train
a reliable model. We validated the predictive performance of the machine
learning model on a holdout test set collected using RCE's ECG wearable. Our
deep neural network model, equipped with convolution layers, achieves 90.31%

in diverse use cases. Existing purely supervised end-to-end deep learning

acquiring which is notoriously difficult but required to achieve a sufficient
level of generalization on a task of interest. In this work, we leverage the
self-supervised learning paradigm towards realizing the vision of continual
learning from unlabeled inputs. We present a generalized framework named Sense
and Learn for representation or feature learning from raw sensory data. It
consists of several auxiliary tasks that can learn high-level and broadly
useful features entirely from unannotated data without any human involvement in
the tedious labeling process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on
several publicly available datasets from different domains and in various
settings, including linear separability, semi-supervised or few shot learning,
and transfer learning. Our methodology achieves results that are competitive
with the supervised approaches and close the gap through fine-tuning a network
while learning the downstream tasks in most cases. In particular, we show that
the self-supervised network can be utilized as initialization to significantly
boost the performance in a low-data regime with as few as 5 labeled instances
per class, which is of high practical importance to real-world problems.
Likewise, the learned representations with self-supervision are found to be
highly transferable between related datasets, even when few labeled instances
are available from the target domains. The self-learning nature of our
methodology opens up exciting possibilities for on-device continual learning.

little rotation support and no gas, often form as a result of tidal
interactions with a galaxy cluster, as was recently demonstrated using the
IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. Galaxies that exhibit similar properties are,
however, also found to be infalling into the cluster for the first time. We use
the same simulation to study in detail the history of such a galaxy over cosmic
time in order to determine its origin. The bar appears to be triggered at t=6.8
Gyr by the combined effect of the last significant merger with a subhalo and
the first passage of another dwarf satellite, both ten times less massive than
the galaxy. The satellites deposit all their gas in the galaxy, contributing to
its third and last star-formation episode, which perturbs the disk and may also
contribute to the formation of the bar. The galaxy then starts to lose its gas
and dark matter due to its passage near a group of more massive galaxies. The
strongest interaction involves a galaxy 22 times more massive, leaving the
barred galaxy with no gas and half of its maximum dark matter mass. During this
time, the bar grows steadily, seemingly unaffected by the interactions,
although they may have aided its growth by stripping the gas. The studied
galaxy, together with two other similar objects briefly discussed in this
letter, suggest the existence of a new class of early-type barred galaxies and
thereby demonstrate the importance of interactions in galaxy formation and
evolution.

an extremely strong cooling flow, as well as a mini-halo. Strong star-formation
in the brightest cluster galaxy indicates that AGN feedback has been unable to
inhibit this cooling flow. We have studied the strong cooling flow in the
Phoenix cluster by determining the radio properties of the AGN and its lobes.
In addition, we use spatially resolved observations to investigate the origin
of the mini-halo. We present new Very Large Array 1-12 GHz observations of the
Phoenix cluster which resolve the AGN and its lobes in all four frequency
bands, and resolve the mini-halo in L- and S-band. Using our L-band
observations, we measure the total flux density of the radio lobes at 1.5 GHz
to be $7.6\pm0.8$ mJy, and the flux density of the mini-halo to be $8.5\pm0.9$
mJy. Using L- and X-band images, we produce the first spectral index maps of
the lobes from the AGN and measure the spectral indices of the northern and
southern lobes to be $-1.35\pm0.07$ and $-1.30\pm0.12$, respectively.
Similarly, using L- and S-band data, we map the spectral index of the
mini-halo, and obtain an integrated spectral index of $\alpha=-0.95 \pm 0.10$.
We find that the mini-halo is most likely formed by turbulent re-acceleration
powered by sloshing in the cool core due to a recent merger. In addition, we
find that the feedback in the Phoenix cluster is consistent with the picture
that stronger cooling flows are to be expected for massive clusters like the
Phoenix cluster, as these may feature an underweight supermassive black hole
due to their merging history. Strong time variability of the AGN on
Myr-timescales may help explain the disconnection between the radio and the
X-ray properties of the system. Finally, a small amount of jet precession
likely contributes to the relatively low ICM re-heating efficiency of the
mechanical feedback.

and show that adversaries can leverage explainable ML to bypass multi-feature
types malware classifiers. Previous adversarial attacks against such
classifiers only add new features and not modify existing ones to avoid harming
the modified malware executable's functionality. Current attacks use a single
algorithm that both selects which features to modify and modifies them blindly,
treating all features the same. In this paper, we present a different approach.
We split the adversarial example generation task into two parts: First we find
the importance of all features for a specific sample using explainability
algorithms, and then we conduct a feature-specific modification,
feature-by-feature. In order to apply our attack in black-box scenarios, we
introduce the concept of transferability of explainability, that is, applying
explainability algorithms to different classifiers using different features
subsets and trained on different datasets still result in a similar subset of
important features. We conclude that explainability algorithms can be leveraged

central quantity in these approaches is the mobility function, which describes
the effect of chain connectivity on the nonlocal response of monomers to
thermodynamic driving fields. In a recent study [Mantha et al, Macromolecules
53, 3409 (2020)], we have developed a method to systematically construct
mobility functions from reference fine-grained simulations. Here we focus on
melts of linear chains in the Rouse regime and show how the mobility functions
can be calculated semi-analytically for multiblock copolymers with arbitrary
sequences without resorting to simulations. In this context, an accurate
approximate expression for the single-chain dynamic structure factor is
derived. Several limiting regimes are discussed. Then we apply the resulting
density functional theory to study ordering processes in a two-length scale
block copolymer system after instantaneous quenches into the ordered phase.
Different dynamical regimes in the ordering process are identified: At early
times, the ordering on short scales dominates; at late times, the ordering on
larger scales takes over. For large quench depths, the system does not
necessarily relax into the true equilibrium state. Our density functional
approach could be used for the computer-assisted design of quenching protocols
in order to create novel nonequilibrium materials.

for that field if the splitting of its energy levels is so small as to be
ignored. After showing explicitly that a detector with unresolved inner
structure does behave as a structureless scalar source, we use that analysis to
rederive the scalar version of a previous analysis of the accelerated

""zero-energy particles."" Then we recover these results when the detector energy
gap is taken to be zero from the beginning. This vindicates the informal
terminology ""zero-frequency Rindler modes"" as a shorthand for ""Rindler modes
with arbitrarily small energy."" In an appendix, the mathematical behavior of
the normal modes in the limit of small frequency is examined in more detail

sharing $M^{[X]}/M/1$ processor queue, where geometrically distributed batches
arrive according to a Poisson process and jobs require exponential service
times. By conditioning on the number of jobs in the systems and the number of
jobs in a tagged batch, we establish recurrence relations between conditional
sojourn times, which subsequently allow us to derive a partial differential
equation for an associated bivariate generating function. This equation
involves an unknown generating function, whose coefficients can be computed by
solving an infinite lower triangular linear system. Once this unknown function
is determined, we compute the Laplace transform and the mean value of the
sojourn time of a batch in the system.

Augmentation problem we need to increase the edge-connectivity by $1$. In the
Block-Tree Augmentation problem $H$ is connected and $H \cup S$ should be
$2$-connected. In Leaf-to-Leaf Connectivity Augmentation problems every edge in
$E$ connects minimal deficient sets. For this version we give a simple
combinatorial approximation algorithm with ratio $5/3$, improving the previous
$1.91$ approximation that applies for the general case. We also show by a
simple proof that if the Steiner Tree problem admits approximation ratio
$\alpha$ then the general version admits approximation ratio
$1+\ln(4-x)+\epsilon$, where $x$ is the solution to the equation
$1+\ln(4-x)=\alpha+(\alpha-1)x$. For the currently best value of $\alpha=\ln
4+\epsilon$ this gives ratio $1.942$. This is slightly worse than the best
ratio $1.91$, but has the advantage of using Steiner Tree approximation as a
""black box"", giving ratio $< 1.9$ if ratio $\alpha \leq 1.35$ can be achieved.

all $u,v \in S$ the graph $G \cup J$ contains $r(u,v)$ $uv$-paths such that no
two of them have an edge or a node in $V \setminus S$ in common. The problem is
NP-hard even when $\max_{u,v \in S} r(u,v)=2$. We obtain approximation ratio

allow special updates to clock variables, like x:= x - 1, x := y + 2, etc., on
transitions. Reachability for UTA is undecidable in general. Various subclasses
with decidable reachability have been studied. A generic approach to UTA
reachability consists of two phases: first, a static analysis of the automaton
is performed to compute a set of clock constraints at each state; in the second
phase, reachable sets of configurations, called zones, are enumerated. In this
work, we improve the algorithm for the static analysis. Compared to the
existing algorithm, our method computes smaller sets of constraints and
guarantees termination for more UTA, making reachability faster and more
effective. As the main application, we get an alternate proof of decidability
and a more efficient algorithm for timed automata with bounded subtraction, a
class of UTA widely used for modelling scheduling problems. We have implemented
our procedure in the tool TChecker and conducted experiments that validate the
benefits of our approach.

Multiple-Input Multiple-Output(MIMO) radar in the presence of multipath from
the view of waveform-filter design. The goal is to maximize the worst-case
Signal-to-Interference-pulse-Noise Ratio(SINR) at the receiver against the
uncertainties of the target and multipath reflection coefficients. Moreover, a
Constant Modulus Constraint(CMC) is imposed on the transmit waveform to meet
the actual demands of radar. Two types of uncertainty sets are taken into
consideration. One is the spherical uncertainty set. In this case, the max-min
waveform-filter design problem belongs to the non-convex concave minimax
problems, and the inner minimization problem is converted to a maximization
problem based on Lagrange duality with the strong duality property. Then the
optimal waveform is optimized with Semi-Definite Relaxation(SDR) and
randomization schemes. Therefore, we call the optimization algorithm Duality
Maximization Semi-Definite Relaxation(DMSDR). Additionally, we further study
the case of annular uncertainty set which belongs to non-convex non-concave
minimax problems. In order to address it, the SDR is utilized to approximate
the inner minimization problem with a convex problem, then the inner
minimization problem is reformulated as a maximization problem based on
Lagrange duality. We resort to a sequential optimization procedure alternating
between two SDR problems to optimize the covariance matrix of transmit waveform
and receive filter, so we call the algorithm Duality Maximization Double
Semi-Definite Relaxation(DMDSDR). The convergences of DMDSDR are proved
theoretically. Finally, numerical results highlight the effectiveness and
competitiveness of the proposed algorithms as well as the optimized

module of the Galois group of the maximal abelian pro-$p$ extension of $F$
unramified outside $p$ over $F$, denoted as $\mathcal{T}_p(F)$, is an important
subject in abelian $p$-ramification theory. In this paper we study the group
$\mathcal{T}_2(F)=\mathcal{T}_2(m)$ of the quadratic field $F=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{
m})$. Firstly, assuming $m>0$, we prove an explicit $4$-rank formula for
$\mathcal{T}_2(-m)$. Furthermore, applying this formula, we obtain the $4$-rank
density of $\mathcal{T}_2$-groups of imaginary quadratic fields. Secondly, for
$l$ an odd prime, we obtain results about the $2$-divisibility of orders of
$\mathcal{T}_2(\pm l)$ and $\mathcal{T}_2(\pm 2l)$. In particular we find that
$\#\mathcal{T}_2(l)\equiv 2\# \mathcal{T}_2(2l)\equiv h_2(-2l)\bmod{16}$ if
$l\equiv 7\bmod{8}$ where $h_2(-2l)$ is the $2$-class number of
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2l})$. We then obtain density results for $\mathcal{T}_2(\pm

numerical data, we propose distribution conjectures about $\mathcal{T}_p(F)$
when $F$ varies over real or imaginary quadratic fields for any prime $p$, and
about $\mathcal{T}_2(\pm l)$ and $\mathcal{T}_2(\pm 2 l)$ when $l$ varies, in
the spirit of Cohen-Lenstra heuristics. Our conjecture in the
$\mathcal{T}_2(l)$ case is closely connected to Shanks-Sime-Washington's
speculation on the distributions of the zeros of $2$-adic $L$-functions and to
the distributions of the fundamental units.

nearer-term, noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computers. In this work, we
discuss hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for skewed linear systems for
over-determined and under-determined cases. Our input model is such that the
columns or rows of the matrix defining the linear system are given via quantum
circuits of poly-logarithmic depth and the number of circuits is much smaller
than their Hilbert space dimension. Our algorithms have poly-logarithmic
dependence on the dimension and polynomial dependence in other natural
quantities. In addition, we present an algorithm for the special case of a
factorized linear system with run time poly-logarithmic in the respective
dimensions. At the core of these algorithms is the Hadamard test and in the
second part of this paper we consider the optimization of the circuit depth of
this test. Given an $n$-qubit and $d$-depth quantum circuit $\mathcal{C}$, we
can approximate $\langle 0|\mathcal{C}|0\rangle$ using $(n + s)$ qubits and
$O\left(\log s + d\log (n/s) + d\right)$-depth quantum circuits, where $s\leq
n$. In comparison, the standard implementation requires $n+1$ qubits and
$O(dn)$ depth. Lattice geometries underlie recent quantum supremacy experiments
with superconducting devices. We also optimize the Hadamard test for an
$(l_1\times l_2)$ lattice with $l_1 \times l_2 = n$, and can approximate
$\langle 0|\mathcal{C} |0\rangle$ with $(n + 1)$ qubits and $O\left(d \left(l_1
+ l_2\right)\right)$-depth circuits. In comparison, the standard depth is
$O\left(d n^2\right)$ in this setting. Both of our optimization methods are
asymptotically tight in the case of one-depth quantum circuits $\mathcal{C}$.

proposed. By focusing on the local fine features of point cloud and applying
multi attention modules based on channel affinity, the learned feature map for

computer vision. With the recent development of deep learning techniques and
large-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and
been widely used in many real-world applications. Given a natural image or
video frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs the
face feature for recognition. To achieve this, a typical end-to-end system is
built with three key elements: face detection, face alignment, and face
representation. The face detection locates faces in the image or frame. Then,
the face alignment is proceeded to calibrate the faces to the canonical view
and crop them with a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face
representation, the discriminative features are extracted from the aligned face
for recognition. Nowadays, all of the three elements are fulfilled by the
technique of deep convolutional neural network. In this survey article, we
present a comprehensive review about the recent advance of each element. To
start with, we present an overview of the end-to-end deep face recognition.
Then, we review the advance of each element, respectively, covering many
aspects such as the to-date algorithm designs, evaluation metrics, datasets,
performance comparison, existing challenges, and promising directions for
future research. Also, we provide a detailed discussion about the effect of
each element on its subsequent elements and the holistic system. Through this
survey, we wish to bring contributions in two aspects: first, readers can
conveniently identify the methods which are quite strong-baseline style in the
subcategory for further exploration; second, one can also employ suitable
methods for establishing a state-of-the-art end-to-end face recognition system

astrochemistry. Unbiased spectral surveys with large bandwidth and high
spectral resolution are thus needed, to resolve line blending in chemically
rich sources and identify complex organic molecules. This kind of observations
has been successfully carried out, mainly towards the Galactic Center, a region
that shows peculiar environmental conditions. We present an unbiased spectral
survey at 3mm of one of the most chemically rich hot molecular cores located
outside the Galactic Center, in the high-mass star-forming region G31.41+0.31.
In this first paper, we present the survey and discuss the detection of the 3
isomers of C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O$_{2}$: methyl formate, glycolaldehyde and acetic
acid. Observations were carried out with ALMA and cover the entire Band 3 from
84 to 116 GHz with an angular resolution of $1.2^{''}$x$1.2^{''}$ and a
spectral resolution of $\sim0.488$ MHz. The transitions of the 3 molecules have
been analyzed with the software XCLASS. All three isomers were detected and
methyl formate and acetic acid abundances in G31 are the highest detected up to
now, if compared to sources in literature. The size of the emission varies
among the three isomers with acetic acid showing the most compact emission
while methyl formate the most extended. The comparison with chemical models
suggests the necessity of grain-surface routes for the formation of methyl
formate in G31, while for glycolaldehyde both scenarios could be feasible.
Proposed grain-surface reaction for acetic acid is not able to reproduce the
observed abundance in this work, while gas-phase scenario should be further
tested due to large uncertainties.

emerging in the form of two-dimensional chiral stacking orders composed of

Such chiral stacking orders correspond to newly introduced chiral winding

intertwined with chiral vortices and chiral domain walls, which play a crucial
role in engineering the chiral stacking orders. Our findings suggest that the
unexpected chiral stacking orders can open a way to investigate the chirality
in CDW systems, which can lead to diverse phenomena such as circular dichroism

transient self-poisoning, related domain formation, and excluded-volume effects

tuned by the balance between adsorption affinity, mixed 2D and 3D diffusion,

the correlations and fluctuations, depending on overall reaction speed, thereby
going beyond conventional steric (e.g., Langmuir-like) product inhibition
mechanisms. We summarize our findings in a state diagram depicting the
nonlinear kinetic regimes by an apparent surface reaction order in dependence
of the intrinsic reaction propensity and adsorption strength. Our study using a

uncertainty models environments where some preliminary action can influence the
duration of a task. In the model, each job has an unknown processing time that
can be revealed by running a test. Alternatively, jobs may be run untested for
the duration of a given upper limit. Recently, D\""urr et al. [5] have studied
the setting where all testing times are of unit size and have given lower and
upper bounds for the objectives of minimizing the sum of completion times and
the makespan on a single machine. In this paper, we extend the problem to
non-uniform testing times and present the first competitive algorithms. The
general setting is motivated for example by online user surveys for market
prediction or querying centralized databases in distributed computing.
Introducing general testing times gives the problem a new flavor and requires
updated methods with new techniques in the analysis. We present constant
competitive ratios for the objective of minimizing the sum of completion times
in the deterministic case, both in the non-preemptive and preemptive setting.
For the preemptive setting, we additionally give a first lower bound. We also
present a randomized algorithm with improved competitive ratio. Furthermore, we
give tight competitive ratios for the objective of minimizing the makespan,
both in the deterministic and the randomized setting.

the invariant measures of Langevin equations and their numerical methods, as
the noise intensity $\epsilon\to 0$ and the dissipation intensity
$\nu\to\infty$ respectively. First, by proving the weak LDP and the exponential
tightness, we conclude that the invariant measure $\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}$ of
the exact solution satisfies the LDPs as $\epsilon\to0$ and $\nu\to\infty$
respectively. Then, we study whether there exist numerical methods
asymptotically preserving these two LDPs of $\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}$ in the
sense that the rate functions of invariant measures of numerical methods
converge pointwise to the rate function of $\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}$ as the
step-size tends to zero. The answer is positive for the linear Langevin
equation. For the small noise case, we show that a large class of numerical
methods can asymptotically preserve the LDP of
$\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}_{\epsilon>0}$ as $\epsilon\to0$. For the strong
dissipation case, we study the stochastic $\theta$-method ($\theta\in[1/2,1]$)
and show that only the midpoint scheme ($\theta=1/2$) can asymptotically
preserve the LDP of $\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}_{\nu>0}$ as $\nu\to\infty$. These
results indicate that in the linear case, the LDP as $\epsilon\to0$ and the LDP
as $\nu\to\infty$ for the invariant measures of numerical methods have
intrinsic differences: the common numerical methods can asymptotically preserve
the LDP of $\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}_{\epsilon>0}$ as $\epsilon\to0$ while the
asymptotical preservation of numerical methods for the LDP of
$\{\mu_{\nu,\epsilon}\}_{\nu>0}$ as $\nu\to\infty$ depends on the choice of

emission line of hydrogen. However, at higher redshifts, we need very deep
integrations to detect HI emission. The HI absorption does not suffer from this
dependence on distance as long as there is a bright enough background radio
source. However, resolved HI absorption studies of galaxies are rare. We report
one such rare study of resolved HI absorption against the radio galaxy 3C 433
at $z = 0.101$ with the VLA. The resolved kinematics of the absorber, located
against the southern lobe of the 3C 433, shows that it has regular kinematics
with an HI mass $\lesssim 3.4 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ for T$_{spin} =$ 100K.
Our deep optical continuum and H$\alpha$ observations from the Gran Telescopio
CANARIAS (GTC) show that the absorber is a faint disc galaxy in the same
environment as 3C 433 with a stellar mass $\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and a
star-formation rate of 0.15 $M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ or less. For its HI mass, HI
column density, stellar mass, and star-formation rate, this galaxy lies well
below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Its HI mass is lower than the
galaxies studied in HI emission at $z \sim 0.1$. Our GTC imaging reveals
interesting alignments between H$\alpha$ and radio emission in the HI companion
and in the host galaxy of the AGN as well as in the circumgalactic medium in
between. This suggests that the shock ionization of gas by the propagating
radio source may happen across tens of kpc. Our work supports the potential of
studying the HI content in galaxies via absorption in the case of a fortuitous
alignment with an extended radio continuum. This allows us to trace galaxies
with low HI masses which would otherwise be missed by deep HI emission surveys.
In conjunction with the deep all-sky optical surveys, the blind HI surveys with
the SKA pathfinders will be able to detect many such systems.

  Description",,,,,"eess.SY cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ever-increasing industry desire for improved performance makes linear
controller design run into fundamental limitations. Nonlinear control methods
such as Reset Control (RC) are needed to overcome these. RC is a promising
candidate since, unlike other nonlinear methods, it easily integrates into the
industry-preferred PID design framework. Thus far, RC has been analysed in the
frequency domain either through describing function analysis or by direct
closed-loop numerical computation. The former computes a simplified closed-loop
RC response by assuming a sufficient low-pass behaviour. In doing so it ignores
all harmonics, which literature has found to cause significant modelling
prediction errors. The latter gives a precise solution, but by its direct
closed-loop computation does not clearly show how open-loop RC design
translates to closed-loop performance. The main contribution of this work is
aimed at overcoming these limitations by considering an alternative approach
for modelling RC using state-dependent impulse inputs. This permits accurately
computing closed-loop RC behaviour starting from the underlying linear system,
improving system understanding. A frequency-domain description for closed-loop
RC is obtained, which is solved analytically by using several well-defined
assumptions. This analytical solution is verified using a simulated
high-precision stage, critically examining sources of modelling errors. The
accuracy of the proposed method is further substantiated using controllers
designed for various specifications.

numerologies destroys the orthogonality principle defined for single-numerology
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SN-OFDM) systems with overlapping

orthogonality leads to inter-numerology interference (INI), which complicates
signal generation and impedes signal isolation. In this paper, the INI in
MN-OFDM systems is characterized through mathematical modeling and is shown to
primarily rely on system parameters with regard to the pulse shape, the
relative distance between subcarriers and the numerology scaling factor.
Reduced-form formulas for the INI in continuous-time and discrete-time MN
systems are derived. The derived mathematical framework facilitates the study
of the effect of discretization on the INI and partial orthogonality existing

effective theory is a mixture of a LGT and a gauge-broken term. Using matrix
product state based methods, both the ground state properties and quench
dynamics are systematically investigated. With an increase of the transverse

phase, an approximate Gauss law of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT emerges in the ground

dynamics, where there is a dynamical signature of the spontaneous translational
symmetry breaking. The spreading of the single particle of matter degree is
diffusive under the weak transverse field, while it is ballistic with small
velocity for the strong field. Furthermore, due to the emergent Gauss law under
the strong transverse field, the matter degree can also exhibit confinement

identify victim nodes that correspond to the least-effort destabilizing DLAAs.
Further, to analyze the SLAAs, we present closed-form expression for the
system's frequency response in terms of the attacker's inputs, helping us
characterize the minimum load change required to cause unsafe frequency
excursions. Using these results, we formulate the defense against S/DLAAs as a
linear programming problem in which we determine the minimum amount of load

  double harmonic oscillator system",,,,,"quant-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea of adaptive perturbation theory is to divide a Hamiltonian into a
solvable part and a perturbation part. The solvable part contains the
non-interacting sector and the diagonal elements of Fock space from the
interacting terms. The perturbed term is the non-diagonal sector of Fock space.
Therefore, the perturbation parameter is not coupling constant. This is
different from the standard procedure of previous perturbation method. In this
letter, we use the adaptive perturbation theory to extract the solvable
elements in the strongly coupled double harmonic oscillator system and obtain
the energy spectrum of the solvable part. Then, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian
to obtain the numerical solution. In order to study the accuracy of adaptive
perturbation theory in the strongly coupled double harmonic oscillator system,
we demonstrate the analytical study from the leading order and second-order
perturbation. The deviations between the leading-order and the numerical
solution show that as the gap between the quasiparticle number n1 and n2
decreases, or the coupling constant $\lambda$ increases, the gap between the
exact solutions in the strongly coupling region of double harmonic oscillator
system and the numerical solutions becomes smaller. Overall, the numerical gap
is about 1% to 3%, which is not a bad result. The value of the second-order is
quite close to the numerical solution when n1 doesn't equal n2. In most cases,
the deviation is less than 1%, which means that the adaptive perturbation
theory is effective for the double harmonic oscillator system in strong
coupling field.

paradigm in solving the scene classification problem for remote sensing, but
learning from only a few data points remains a challenge. Existing methods for
few-shot remote sensing scene classification are performed in a sample-level
manner, resulting in easy overfitting of learned features to individual samples
and inadequate generalization of learned category segmentation surfaces. To
solve this problem, learning should be organized at the task level rather than
the sample level. Learning on tasks sampled from a task family can help tune
learning algorithms to perform well on new tasks sampled in that family.
Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, called RS-MetaNet, to
resolve the issues related to few-shot remote sensing scene classification in
the real world. On the one hand, RS-MetaNet raises the level of learning from
the sample to the task by organizing training in a meta way, and it learns to
learn a metric space that can well classify remote sensing scenes from a series
of tasks. We also propose a new loss function, called Balance Loss, which
maximizes the generalization ability of the model to new samples by maximizing
the distance between different categories, providing the scenes in different
categories with better linear segmentation planes while ensuring model fit. The
experimental results on three open and challenging remote sensing datasets,
UCMerced\_LandUse, NWPU-RESISC45, and Aerial Image Data, demonstrate that our
proposed RS-MetaNet method achieves state-of-the-art results in cases where
there are only 1-20 labeled samples.

Fine-Tuning as an Effective Regularizer. Specifically, we complement the

discriminate between in-domain and out-of-domain text representations.
In-domain refers to the labeled dataset of the task at hand while out-of-domain
refers to unlabeled data from a different domain. Intuitively, the adversarial
classifier acts as a regularizer which prevents the model from overfitting to
the task-specific domain. Empirical results on various natural language

steps designed to appear within a student workspace, and in the same format as
student-derived steps, to show students a possible subgoal leading to the
solution. We hypothesized that Assertions can help address the well-known hint
avoidance problem. In systems that only provide hints upon request, hint
avoidance results in students not receiving hints when they are needed. Our
unsolicited Assertions do not seek to improve student help-seeking, but rather
seek to ensure students receive the help they need. We contrast Assertions with
Messages, text-based, unsolicited hints that appear after student inactivity.
Our results show that Assertions significantly increase unsolicited hint usage
compared to Messages. Further, they show a significant aptitude-treatment
interaction between Assertions and prior proficiency, with Assertions leading
students with low prior proficiency to generate shorter (more efficient)
posttest solutions faster. We also present a clustering analysis that shows
patterns of productive persistence among students with low prior knowledge when
the tutor provides unsolicited help in the form of Assertions. Overall, this
work provides encouraging evidence that hint presentation can significantly
impact how students use them and using Assertions can be an effective way to
address help avoidance.

treat the gathered scores as quality ground truth data. Knowing if subjective

functional tools based on those scores (e.g., algorithms assessing the

scattering theory. Conceived as a generalization of the concept of metagrating,
we call metaclusters to a finite set of scatterers whose position and
properties are obtained by inverse design once we have defined their response
to some external incident field. The particular focus is on designing passive
metaclusters that do not require an external source of energy. The method is
applied to the propagation of flexural waves in thin plates, and to the design
of far field patterns, although its generalization to acoustic or
electromagnetic waves is straightforward. Numerical examples are presented to
the design of uni and bidirectional ""anomalous scatterers"", which will bend the
scattering energy along a specific direction, ""odd pole"" scatterers, whose
radiation pattern presents an odd number of poles and to the generation of
vortical patterns. Finally, some considerations about the optimal design of
these metaclusters are discussed.

the product of the complex Stiefel manifold and the special linear group.
Instead of the cyclic fashion, we choose a block optimization based on the
Riemannian gradient. To update the first block variable in the complex Stiefel
manifold, we use the well-known line search descent method. To update the
second block variable in the special linear group, based on four kinds of
different elementary transformations, we construct three classes: GLU, GQU and
GU, and then get three BCD-G algorithms: BCD-GLU, BCD-GQU and BCD-GU. We
establish the global and weak convergence of these three algorithms using the
\L{}ojasiewicz gradient inequality under the assumption that the iterates are
bounded. We also propose a gradient-based Jacobi-type framework to solve the
joint approximate diagonalization of matrices defined on the special linear
group. As in the BCD-G case, using the GLU and GQU classes of elementary
transformations, we focus on the Jacobi-GLU and Jacobi-GQU algorithms and
establish their global and weak convergence. All the algorithms and convergence
results described in this paper also apply to the real case.

challenges, data centres grew constantly over the past decades. However, this
growth comes with a price, particularly from the environmental point of view.
Among various promising media, DNA is one of the most fascinating candidate. In
our previous work, we have proposed an automated archival architecture which
uses bioengineered bacteria to store and retrieve data, previously encoded into
DNA. This storage technique is one example of how biological media can deliver
power-efficient storing solutions. The similarities between these biological
media and classical ones can also be a drawback, as malicious parties might
replicate traditional attacks on the former archival system, using biological
instruments and techniques. In this paper, first we analyse the main
characteristics of our storage system and the different types of attacks that
could be executed on it. Then, aiming at identifying on-going attacks, we
propose and evaluate detection techniques, which rely on traditional metrics
and machine learning algorithms. We identify and adapt two suitable metrics for
this purpose, namely generalized entropy and information distance. Moreover,
our trained models achieve an AUROC over 0.99 and AUPRC over 0.91.

independently by another team, claiming a detection of sodium incompatible with
previous studies of data from both ground and space. We show that this large
sodium detection is actually due to contamination from telluric sodium

properly accounting for these effects, the previous sodium signal is reduced to
an absorption of $0.46\pm0.20\%$ ($2.3\sigma$), which is compatible with

the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has performed an analysis of

excess' interpretation in terms of anomalous gauge-Higgs interactions at face
value and discuss further steps that are required to scrutinize its origin. In
particular, we discuss the relevance of multi-boson production using adapted
angular observables to show how they can be used to directly tension the
reported $Zjj$ excess in a more comprehensive analysis. To connect the excess
to a concrete UV scenario for which the underlying assumptions of the $Zjj$
analysis are valid, we identify vector-like leptons as a candidate theory
consistent with the observed CP-odd Wilson coefficient hierarchy observed by
ATLAS. We perform a complete one-loop matching calculation to motivate further
model-specific and correlated new physics searches. In parallel, we provide
estimates of the sensitivity reach of the LHC's high luminosity phase for this
particular scenario of CP-violation in light of electroweak precision and Run-2
Higgs data. These provide strong constraints on the model's CP-even low-energy

light on daily-life fashion trends. CAT STREET includes images showing what
people wore in their daily lives during 1970--2017, and these images contain
timestamps and street location annotations. This novel database combined with
machine learning enables us to observe daily-life fashion trends over a long

approach with the novel database, we corroborated the rules-of-thumb of two
fashion trend phenomena that have been observed and discussed qualitatively in
previous studies. Through these empirical analyses, we verified that our
approach to quantify fashion trends can help in exploring unsolved research
questions. We also demonstrate CAT STREET's potential to find new standpoints

morphological information, named entities and terminology. In addition to
evaluating the general performance of the system, we systematically analysed
the performance of the proposed approaches when dealing with the targeted

December 2019, equipped with the capacity to perform photometric measurements
at the 20 ppm level. As CHEOPS carries out its observations in a broad optical
passband, it can provide insights into the reflected light from exoplanets and
constrain the short-wavelength thermal emission for the hottest of planets by
observing occultations and phase curves. Here, we report the first CHEOPS
observation of an occultation, namely, that of the hot Jupiter WASP-189b, a
$M_P \approx 2 M_J$ planet orbiting an A-type star. We detected the occultation
of WASP-189 b at high significance in individual measurements and derived an
occultation depth of $dF = 87.9 \pm 4.3$ppm based on four occultations. We
compared these measurements to model predictions and we find that they are
consistent with an unreflective atmosphere heated to a temperature of $3435 \pm
27$K, when assuming inefficient heat redistribution. Furthermore, we present
two transits of WASP-189b observed by CHEOPS. These transits have an asymmetric
shape that we attribute to gravity darkening of the host star caused by its
high rotation rate. We used these measurements to refine the planetary
parameters, finding a $\sim25\%$ deeper transit compared to the discovery paper
and updating the radius of WASP-189b to $1.619\pm0.021 R_J$. We further
measured the projected orbital obliquity to be $\lambda =
86.4^{+2.9}_{-4.4}$deg, a value that is in good agreement with a previous
measurement from spectroscopic observations, and derived a true obliquity of
$\Psi = 85.4\pm4.3$deg. Finally, we provide reference values for the
photometric precision attained by the CHEOPS satellite: for the V=6.6 mag star,
and using a one-hour binning, we obtain a residual RMS between 10 and 17ppm on
the individual light curves, and 5.7ppm when combining the four visits.

  Effect of Mass Shootings on Attitudes toward Gun Control",,,,,"stat.AP econ.EM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The difference-in-differences (DID) design is widely used in observational
studies to estimate the causal effect of a treatment when repeated observations
over time are available. Yet, almost all existing methods assume linearity in
the potential outcome (parallel trends assumption) and target the additive
effect. In social science research, however, many outcomes of interest are
measured on an ordinal scale. This makes the linearity assumption inappropriate
because the difference between two ordinal potential outcomes is not well
defined. In this paper, I propose a method to draw causal inferences for
ordinal outcomes under the DID design. Unlike existing methods, the proposed
method utilizes the latent variable framework to handle the non-numeric nature
of the outcome, enabling identification and estimation of causal effects based
on the assumption on the quantile of the latent continuous variable. The paper
also proposes an equivalence-based test to assess the plausibility of the key
identification assumption when additional pre-treatment periods are available.
The proposed method is applied to a study estimating the causal effect of mass
shootings on the public's support for gun control. I find little evidence for a
uniform shift toward pro-gun control policies as found in the previous study,
but find that the effect is concentrated on left-leaning respondents who
experienced the shooting for the first time in more than a decade.

Decision Processes (MDPs) when the learner has access to a generative model.
The objective is to devise a learning algorithm returning the best policy as
early as possible. We first derive a problem-specific lower bound of the sample
complexity satisfied by any learning algorithm. This lower bound corresponds to
an optimal sample allocation that solves a non-convex program, and hence, is
hard to exploit in the design of efficient algorithms. We then provide a simple
and tight upper bound of the sample complexity lower bound, whose corresponding
nearly-optimal sample allocation becomes explicit. The upper bound depends on
specific functionals of the MDP such as the sub-optimality gaps and the
variance of the next-state value function, and thus really captures the
hardness of the MDP. Finally, we devise KLB-TS (KL Ball Track-and-Stop), an
algorithm tracking this nearly-optimal allocation, and provide asymptotic
guarantees for its sample complexity (both almost surely and in expectation).
The advantages of KLB-TS against state-of-the-art algorithms are discussed and

dead-time characteristic and constraints on physical states apply since the
vehicle is neither able to accelerate arbitrarily strong, nor to drive
arbitrarily fast. A model predictive controller (MPC) is able to cope with both
of the aforementioned system properties. MPC heavily relies on a model and
therefore a strategy on how to obtain multiple linear state space prediction
models of the nonlinear system via input/output data system identification from
acceleration data is given. The models are identified in different regions of
the vehicle dynamics in order to obtain more accurate predictions. The still
remaining plant-model mismatch can be expressed as an additive disturbance
which can be handled through robust control theory. Therefore modifications to
the models for applying robust MPC tracking control theory are described. Then
a controller which guarantees robust constraint satisfaction and recursive
feasibility is designed. As a next step, modifications to apply the controller
on multiple models are discussed. In this context, a model switching strategy
is provided and theoretical and computational limitations are pointed out.
Lastly, simulation results are presented and discussed, including computational

  The key building block of all multi-pass streaming algorithms for Maximum

solely relies on the invocation of the Greedy algorithm?
  In this paper, we initiate the study of lower bounds for restricted families
of multi-pass streaming algorithms for Maximum Matching. We focus on the simple
yet powerful class of algorithms that in each pass run Greedy on a
vertex-induced subgraph of the input graph. In bipartite graphs, we show that
$3$ passes are necessary and sufficient to improve on the trivial approximation
factor of $1/2$: We give a lower bound of $0.6$ on the approximation ratio of
such algorithms, which is optimal. We further show that $\Omega(

$(1-\epsilon)$-approximation, even in bipartite graphs. Last, the considered
class of algorithms is not well-suited to general graphs: We show that
$\Omega(n)$ passes are required in order to improve on the trivial

areas ranging from personal care to biomedicine, and with increasing potential
to act as extracellular matrix (ECM) models of hollow organs or tissues. Such
capsules are conventionally generated from non-ECM materials including
synthetic polymers. Here, we fabricated robust microcapsules with controllable
shell thickness from physically- and enzymatically-crosslinked gelatin and
achieved a core-shell architecture by exploiting a liquid-liquid phase
separated aqueous dispersed phase system in a one-step microfluidic process.
Microfluidic mechanical testing revealed that the mechanical robustness of
thicker-shell capsules could be controlled through modulation of the shell
thickness. Furthermore, the microcapsules demonstrated
environmentally-responsive deformation, including buckling by osmosis and
external mechanical forces. A sequential release of cargo species was obtained
through the degradation of the capsules. Stability measurements showed the
capsules were stable at 37 {\deg}C for more than two weeks. Finally,
all-aqueous liquid-liquid phase separated and multiphase liquid-liquid phase
separated systems were generated with the gel-sol transition of microgel
precursors. These smart capsules are promising models of hollow biostructures,
microscale drug carriers, and building blocks or compartments for active soft
materials and robots.

from the field-polarized ferromagnetic phase at high fields. A tiny spin gap of
the pseudo-Goldstone magnon mode, observed at wave vectors that are
structurally equivalent but orthogonal to the propagation vector of the spin
helix, vanishes at this quantum critical point, restoring the cubic symmetry in
the magnetic subsystem. The anisotropy imposed by the spin helix has only a
minor influence on the lattice structure and sound velocity but has a much
stronger effect on the heat conductivities measured parallel and perpendicular

discretizations that self-adjust to local macroscopic conditions such as
velocity and temperature. While this feature improves the accuracy and the
stability of LBMs for large velocity and temperature fluctuations, it also
strongly impacts the efficiency of the algorithm due to space interpolations
that are required to get populations at grid nodes. To avoid this defect, the
present work proposes new formulations of adaptive LBMs for the simulation of
compressible flows which do not rely anymore on space interpolations, hence,
drastically improving their parallel efficiency for the simulation of
high-speed compressible flows. To reach this goal, the adaptive phase
discretization is restricted to particular states that are compliant with the
efficient ""collide and stream"" algorithm, and as a consequence it does not
require additional interpolation steps. The development of proper
state-adaptive solvers with on-grid propagation imposes new restrictions and
challenges on the discrete stencils, namely the need for an extended
operability range allowing for the transition between two phase
discretizations. Achieving the minimum operability range for discrete
polynomial equilibria requires rather large stencils (e.g. D2Q81, D2Q121) and
is therefore not competitive for compressible flow simulations. However, as
shown in the article, the use of numerical equilibria can provide for overlaps
in the operability ranges of neighboring discrete shifts at acceptable cost
using the D2Q21 lattice. Through several numerical validations, the present
approach is shown to allow for an efficient realization of discrete
state-adaptive LBMs for high Mach number flows even in the low viscosity
regime.

two competing text-book reactions relevant to organic synthesis, E2 and SN2,
trained and tested on chemically diverse quantum data from literature. After
training on 1k to 1.8k examples, R2B predicts activation energies on average
within less than 2.5 kcal/mol with respect to Coupled-Cluster Singles Doubles

matrices reveals the hierarchy of the multiple scales underpinning reactivity
in chemical space: Nucleophiles and leaving groups, substituents, and pairwise

correlation information between them. However, we noted that, so far, the
efforts to obtain better performance by supporting bidirectional and explicit
information exchange between ID and SF are not well studied.In addition, few
studies attempt to capture the local context information to enhance the
performance of SF. Motivated by these findings, in this paper, Parallel
Interactive Network (PIN) is proposed to model the mutual guidance between ID

introduced to generate the context-aware feature embedding of the utterance
which is able to capture local context information. Taking the feature
embedding of the utterance, Slot2Intent module and Intent2Slot module are
developed to capture the bidirectional information flow for ID and SF tasks.
Finally, a cooperation mechanism is constructed to fuse the information

prediction bias.The experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., SNIPS and

enhancement, i.e., enhancement of scattering in backward direction over
scattering in other directions of a wave-chaotic system with partially violated
time-reversal (T ) invariance on its openness. The elastic enhancement factor
is a characteristic of quantum chaotic scattering which is of particular
importance in experiments, like compound-nuclear reactions, where only cross
sections, i.e., the moduli of the associated scattering matrix elements are
accessible. In the experiment a quantum billiard with the shape of a quarter
bow-tie, which generates a chaotic dynamics, is emulated by a flat microwave
cavity. Partial T-invariance violation of varying strength 0 < xi < 1 is
induced by two magnetized ferrites. The openness is controlled by increasing
the number M of open channels, 2 < M < 9, while keeping the internal absorption
unchanged. We investigate the elastic enhancement as function of xi and find
that for a fixed M it decreases with increasing time-reversal invariance
violation, whereas it increases with increasing openness beyond a certain value
of xi > 0.2. The latter result is surprising because it is opposite to that
observed in systems with preserved T invariance (xi = 0). We come to the
conclusion that the effect of T -invariance violation on the elastic
enhancement then dominates over the openness, which is crucial for experiments
which rely on enhanced backscattering, since, generally, a decrease of the
openness is unfeasible. Motivated by these experimental results we,
furthermore, performed theoretical investigations based on random matrix theory

termination rates of ribosomes along the mRNA. These rates depend on many
""local"" factors like the abundance of free ribosomes and tRNA molecules in the
vicinity of the mRNA molecule. All these factors are stochastic and their
experimental measurements are also noisy. An important question is how protein
production in the cell is affected by this considerable variability. We develop
a new theoretical framework for addressing this question by modeling the rates
as identically and independently distributed random variables and using tools
from random matrix theory to analyze the steady-state production rate. The
analysis reveals a principle of universality: the average protein production
rate depends only on the of the set of possible values that the random variable
may attain. This explains how total protein production can be stabilized
despite the overwhelming stochasticticity underlying cellular processes.

efficiently via the mechanism of total internal reflection. The frequencies

from the perfect spherical form the resonances change accordingly. In this
thesis, a perturbation theory for the optical resonances of such a deformed
sphere is developed. The optical resonances of such an open system are
characterized by complex eigenvalues, where the real part relates to the
frequency of the resonant light and the imaginary part to the energy leakage
out of the system. As unperturbed and analytically solvable problem serves the
homogeneous dielectric sphere, and the corrections to its eigenvalues are
determined up to and including second order for any polarization of light. For
each order, the corrections of the optical resonances are determined by a
finite-dimensional linear eigenvalue equation, similar to degenerate
time-independent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. Furthermore,
geometrically intuitive applicability criteria are derived. To check the
validity of the presented method, it is applied and compared to an analytically

alignment called Fast Gravitational Approach (FGA). In FGA, the source and
target point sets are interpreted as rigid particle swarms with masses
interacting in a globally multiply-linked manner while moving in a simulated
gravitational force field. The optimal alignment is obtained by explicit
modeling of forces acting on the particles as well as their velocities and
displacements with second-order ordinary differential equations of motion.
Additional alignment cues (point-based or geometric features, and other
boundary conditions) can be integrated into FGA through particle masses. We
propose a smooth-particle mass function for point mass initialization, which
improves robustness to noise and structural discontinuities. To avoid
prohibitive quadratic complexity of all-to-all point interactions, we adapt a
Barnes-Hut tree for accelerated force computation and achieve quasilinear
computational complexity. We show that the new method class has characteristics
not found in previous alignment methods such as efficient handling of partial
overlaps, inhomogeneous point sampling densities, and coping with large point
clouds with reduced runtime compared to the state of the art. Experiments show
that our method performs on par with or outperforms all compared competing
non-deep-learning-based and general-purpose techniques (which do not assume the
availability of training data and a scene prior) in resolving transformations
for LiDAR data and gains state-of-the-art accuracy and speed when coping with

first find the effect of LIV speeds up the black hole evaporation, leaving the
induced Hawking temperature very sensitive to the changes in the energy of the
radiation particle, but at the same energy level, insensitive to the changes in
the charge of the radiation particle. This provides a phenomenological evidence
for the LIV-DR as a candidate for describing the effect of quantum gravity.
Then, when the effect of LIV is included, we find the statistical correlations
with the Planck-scale corrections between the successive emissions can leak out
the information through the radiation. And, it turns out that the black hole
radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process, and no information
loss occurs during the radiation, where the interpretation for the entropy of
black hole is addressed. Finally, we conclude that black hole evaporation is
still an unitary process in the context of quantum gravity.

Fragile Points Method (FPM), is presented for analyzing flexoelectric effects
in dielectric solids. Local, simple, polynomial and discontinuous trial and
test functions are generated with the help of a local meshless Differential
Quadrature approximation of derivatives. Both primal and mixed FPM are
developed, based on two alternate flexoelectric theories, with or without the
electric gradient effect and Maxwell stress. In the present primal as well as
mixed FPM, only the displacements and electric potential are retained as
explicit unknown variables at each internal Fragile Point in the final
algebraic equations. Thus the number of unknowns in the final system of
algebraic equations is kept to be absolutely minimal. An algorithm for
