work constructs a unifying effective field theory capturing all universal

pseudogap state is established to be a phase where a charged magnetic monopole
condensate confines Cooper pairs to form an oblique version of a
superinsulator. The HTS phase diagram is dominated by a tricritical point (TCP)
at which the first order transition between a fundamental Cooper pair
condensate and a charged magnetic monopole condensate merges with the
continuous superconductor-normal metal and superconductor-pseudogap state phase
transitions. The universality of the HTS phase diagram reflects a unique
topological mechanism of competition between the magnetic monopole condensate,
inherent to antiferromagnetic-order-induced Mott insulators and the Cooper pair
condensate. The obtained results establish the topological nature of the HTS

following: (a) a set of service centers; (b) a set of demand nodes and; (c) a
cost matrix containing the cost of assignment for each (demand node, service

of capacity and a penalty which is incurred if it gets overloaded. Given the
input, the LBDD problem determines a mapping from the set of n demand vertices
to the set of k service centers, n being much larger than k. The objective is
to determine a mapping that minimizes the sum of the following two terms: (i)
the total cost between demand units and their allotted service centers and,
(ii) total penalties incurred. The problem of LBDD has a variety of
applications. An instance of the LBDD problem can be reduced to an instance of
the min-cost bi-partite matching problem. The best known algorithm for min-cost

This paper proposes novel allotment subspace re-adjustment based approach which
allows us to characterize the optimality of the mapping without invoking

complexity $O(nk^3 +nk^2 log n)$, and also allows us to efficiently maintain an

domain distribution mismatches between synthetic datasets and real datasets. To
address the severe domain distribution mismatch, we propose a synthetic-to-real
domain adaptation method for scene text detection, which transfers knowledge
from synthetic data (source domain) to real data (target domain). In this
paper, a text self-training (TST) method and adversarial text instance
alignment (ATA) for domain adaptive scene text detection are introduced. ATA
helps the network learn domain-invariant features by training a domain
classifier in an adversarial manner. TST diminishes the adverse effects of
false positives~(FPs) and false negatives~(FNs) from inaccurate pseudo-labels.
Two components have positive effects on improving the performance of scene text
detectors when adapting from synthetic-to-real scenes. We evaluate the proposed
method by transferring from SynthText, VISD to ICDAR2015, ICDAR2013. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with up to 10%
improvement, which has important exploration significance for domain adaptive

  Gowers uniformity norms are the central objects of higher order Fourier
analysis, one of the cornerstones of additive combinatorics, and play an
important role in both Gowers' proof of Szemer\'{e}di's theorem and the
Green-Tao theorem. The inverse theorem states that if a function has a large
uniformity norm, which is a robust combinatorial measure of structure, then it
must correlate with a nilsequence, which is a highly structured algebraic
object. This was proved in a qualitative sense by Green, Tao, and Ziegler, but
with a proof that was incapable of providing reasonable bounds. In 2018 Manners
achieved a breakthrough by giving a new proof of the inverse theorem. Not only
does this new proof contain a wealth of new insights but it also, for the first

48kHz) to convey expression and emotion. However, higher sampling rate causes
the wider frequency band and longer waveform sequences and throws challenges
for singing voice synthesis (SVS) in both frequency and time domains.
Conventional SVS systems that adopt small sampling rate cannot well address the
above challenges. In this paper, we develop HiFiSinger, an SVS system towards
high-fidelity singing voice. HiFiSinger consists of a FastSpeech based acoustic
model and a Parallel WaveGAN based vocoder to ensure fast training and
inference and also high voice quality. To tackle the difficulty of singing
modeling caused by high sampling rate (wider frequency band and longer
waveform), we introduce multi-scale adversarial training in both the acoustic
model and vocoder to improve singing modeling. Specifically, 1) To handle the
larger range of frequencies caused by higher sampling rate, we propose a novel
sub-frequency GAN (SF-GAN) on mel-spectrogram generation, which splits the full
80-dimensional mel-frequency into multiple sub-bands and models each sub-band
with a separate discriminator. 2) To model longer waveform sequences caused by
higher sampling rate, we propose a multi-length GAN (ML-GAN) for waveform
generation to model different lengths of waveform sequences with separate
discriminators. 3) We also introduce several additional designs and findings in
HiFiSinger that are crucial for high-fidelity voices, such as adding F0 (pitch)
and V/UV (voiced/unvoiced flag) as acoustic features, choosing an appropriate
window/hop size for mel-spectrogram, and increasing the receptive field in
vocoder for long vowel modeling. Experiment results show that HiFiSinger
synthesizes high-fidelity singing voices with much higher quality: 0.32/0.44
MOS gain over 48kHz/24kHz baseline and 0.83 MOS gain over previous SVS systems.

  Consistency","Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Limited view tomographic reconstruction aims to reconstruct a tomographic
image from a limited number of sinogram or projection views arising from sparse
view or limited angle acquisitions that reduce radiation dose or shorten
scanning time. However, such a reconstruction suffers from high noise and
severe artifacts due to the incompleteness of sinogram. To derive quality
reconstruction, previous state-of-the-art methods use UNet-like neural
architectures to directly predict the full view reconstruction from limited
view data; but these methods leave the deep network architecture issue largely
intact and cannot guarantee the consistency between the sinogram of the
reconstructed image and the acquired sinogram, leading to a non-ideal
reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel recurrent reconstruction
framework that stacks the same block multiple times. The recurrent block
consists of a custom-designed residual dense spatial-channel attention network.
Further, we develop a sinogram consistency layer interleaved in our recurrent
framework in order to ensure that the sampled sinogram is consistent with the
sinogram of the intermediate outputs of the recurrent blocks. We evaluate our
methods on two datasets. Our experimental results on AAPM Low Dose CT Grand
Challenge datasets demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a consistent and
significant improvement over the existing state-of-the-art neural methods on
both limited angle reconstruction (over 5dB better in terms of PSNR) and sparse
view reconstruction (about 4dB better in term of PSNR). In addition, our
experimental results on Deep Lesion datasets demonstrate that our method is
able to generate high-quality reconstruction for 8 major lesion types.

asymmetries that develop stochastically in the neutrino-heating layer due to
hydrodynamic instabilities (e.g., convective overturn and the standing
accretion shock instability) during the first second after core bounce. We
coupled a 3D HD model of a neutrino-driven SN explosion with 3D MHD/HD
simulations of the remnant formation. The simulations cover 2000 years of
expansion and include all physical processes relevant to describe the
complexities in the SN evolution and the subsequent interaction of the stellar
debris with the wind of the progenitor star. The interaction of large-scale
asymmetries left from the earliest phases of the explosion with the reverse
shock produces, at the age of $\approx 350$~years, an ejecta structure and a
remnant morphology which are remarkably similar to those observed in Cas A.
Small-scale structures in the large-scale Fe-rich plumes created during the
initial stages of the SN, combined with HD instabilities that develop after the
passage of the reverse shock, naturally produce a pattern of ring- and
crown-like structures of shocked ejecta. The consequence is a spatial inversion
of the ejecta layers with Si-rich ejecta being physically interior to Fe-rich
ejecta. The full-fledged remnant shows voids and cavities in the innermost
unshocked ejecta resulting from the expansion of Fe-rich plumes and their
inflation due to the decay of radioactive species. The asymmetric distributions
of $^{44}$Ti and $^{56}$Fe and their abundance ratio are both compatible with
those inferred from high-energy observations of Chandra and NuSTAR. The main
asymmetries observed in the ejecta distribution of Cas A can be explained by
the interaction of the reverse shock with the large-scale asymmetries that
developed from stochastic processes that originate during the first seconds of
the SN blast.

these agents use perception to align their beliefs with the world and use
actions to align the world with their beliefs. They infer representations that
are informative of past inputs, explore future inputs that are informative of
their representations, and select actions or skills that maximally influence
future inputs. This explains a wide range of unsupervised objectives from a

smaller physical scales than ever before, however, model uncertainties from
baryonic physics and non-linear structure formation will become a significant
concern. The $k$-cut method -- applying a redshift-dependent $\ell$-cut after
making the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya transform -- can reduce sensitivity to
baryonic physics; allowing Stage IV surveys to include information from
increasingly higher $\ell$-modes. Here we address the question of whether it
can also mitigate the impact of making the reduced shear approximation; which
is also important in the high-$\kappa$, small-scale regime. The standard
procedure for relaxing this approximation requires the repeated evaluation of
the convergence bispectrum, and consequently can be prohibitively
computationally expensive when included in Monte Carlo analyses. We find that
the $k$-cut cosmic shear procedure suppresses the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological
parameter biases expected from the reduced shear approximation for Stage IV
experiments, when $\ell$-modes up to $5000$ are probed. The maximum cut
required for biases from the reduced shear approximation to be below the
threshold of significance is at $k = 5.37 \, h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this cut,
the predicted $1\sigma$ constraints increase, relative to the case where the
correction is directly computed, by less than $10\%$ for all parameters. This
represents a significant improvement in constraints compared to the more
conservative case where only $\ell$-modes up to 1500 are probed, and no $k$-cut
is used. We also repeat this analysis for a hypothetical, comparable kinematic
weak lensing survey. The key parts of code used for this analysis are made

representations from being catastrophically forgotten. However, comparison of
individual methods is nevertheless performed in isolation from the real world
by monitoring accumulated benchmark test set performance. The closed world
assumption remains predominant, i.e. models are evaluated on data that is

trustworthiness and accountability of the models when deployed in real

Existing solutions suggest the benefits attained by combining deep neural
networks and Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty over the models'

test the efficacy of likelihood based models in the task of out of distribution

neural networks and in the event of minimal overlap between in/out distribution
classes, even the best models exhibit a reduction in AUC scores in detecting
OoD data. Preliminary investigations indicate the potential inherent role of
bias due to choices of initialisation, architecture or activation functions. We
hypothesise that the sensitivity of neural networks to unseen inputs could be a
multi-factor phenomenon arising from the different architectural design choices

is strongly contingent upon two contradictory requirements: a high quality of

be improved by increasing the number of steered ultrafast acquisitions, but at

accurate motion estimation at uncompromised frame rates and immune to motion

intrusion of its intimate space it leaned back. Our research questions were:

size (16-42 cm). This suggests that most participants did not (fully) scale
down the extent of these zones to the robot size. We also found that the
leaning back behavior of the robot was correctly interpreted by most
participants as the robot's reaction to the intrusion of its personal space;
however, our implementation of the behavior was often perceived as
""unfriendly"". We will discuss this and other limitations of the study in
detail. Additionally we found positive correlations between participants'
personality traits, Godspeed Questionnaire subscales, and the average approach

of 25 keypoints on the human body using a single compact RGB-D camera and the
use of these points for accurate interpersonal distance estimation and as
gazing targets for the robot.

recent years. Speaker representations extracted by deep learning models are

emotion recognition. Attention mechanisms have started to play an important
role in improving deep learning models in the field of speech processing.
Nonetheless, despite the fact that important speaker-related information can be
embedded in individual frequency-bins of the input spectral representations,
current attention models are unable to attend to fine-grained information items
in spectral representations. In this paper we propose Fine-grained Early
Frequency Attention (FEFA) for speaker representation learning. Our model is a
simple and lightweight model that can be integrated into various CNN pipelines
and is capable of focusing on information items as small as frequency-bins. We
evaluate the proposed model on three tasks of speaker recognition, speech
emotion recognition, and spoken digit recognition. We use Three widely used
public datasets, namely VoxCeleb, IEMOCAP, and Free Spoken Digit Dataset for
our experiments. We attach FEFA to several prominent deep learning models and
evaluate its impact on the final performance. We also compare our work with
other related works in the area. Our experiments show that by adding FEFA to
different CNN architectures, performance is consistently improved by
substantial margins, and the models equipped with FEFA outperform all the other
attentive models. We also test our model against different levels of added
noise showing improvements in robustness and less sensitivity compared to the
backbone networks.

within the range of g-r colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by

by major, minor, and mini mergers. Accretion histories in TNG100 ETGs as well
as the radial distributions of ex-situ stars $f_{ex}(R)$ strongly correlate
with stellar mass. Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles
and near-oblate shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the
in-situ stars. At high $f_{ex}$ major mergers decrease the in-situ peak in
rotation velocity, flatten the $V_{*}/\sigma_{*}(R)$ profiles, and increase the
triaxiality of the stellar halos. Kinematic transition radii do not trace the
transition between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with
$M_{*}>10^{10.6}M_\odot$ the local rotational support decreases with the local
ex-situ fraction $f_{ex}(R)$ and triaxiality increases with $f_{ex}$. These
correlations are followed by fast and slow rotators alike with a continuous and
overlapping sequence of properties. Merger events dynamically couple stars and
dark matter: in high mass ETGs and at large radii where $f_{ex}\gtrsim0.5$,
both components tend to have similar intrinsic shapes and rotational support,
and nearly aligned principal axes and spin directions. Based on these results
we suggest that extended photometry and kinematics of massive ETGs
($M_{*}>10^{10.6}M_\odot$) can be used to estimate the local fraction of
ex-situ stars and to approximate the intrinsic shapes and rotational support of
the co-spatial dark matter component. [abridged]

it into a black hole. The wide range of allowed dark matter masses allows a
smaller effective Chandrasekhar limit, and thus smaller mass black holes. We
point out several avenues to test our proposal, focusing on the redshift
dependence of the merger rate. We show that redshift dependence of the merger

Hubbard interaction in terms of an auxiliary vector field and use a recently

approximately from the Keldysh formalism, allows us to study the effect of
finite temperature. At strong coupling, $U \gg t$, where $U$ is the local
repulsion and $t$ the nearest neighbour hopping, our results reproduce the well
known dynamics of the nearest neighbour Heisenberg model with exchange $J \sim
{\cal O}(t^2/U)$. These include crossover from weakly damped dispersive modes
at temperature $T \ll J$ to strong damping at $T \sim {\cal O}(J)$, and
diffusive dynamics at $T \gg J$. The crossover temperatures are naturally
proportional to $J$. To highlight the progressive deviation from Heisenberg
physics as $U/t$ reduces we compute an effective exchange scale $J_{eff}(U)$
from the low temperature spin wave velocity. We discover two features in the
dynamical behaviour with decreasing $U/t$: (i)~the low temperature dispersion
deviates from the Heisenberg result, as expected, due to longer range and
multispin interactions, and (ii)~the crossovers between weak damping, strong
damping, and diffusion take place at noticeably lower values of $T/J_{eff}$. We
relate this to enhanced mode coupling, in particular to thermal amplitude
fluctuations, at weaker $U/t$. A comparison of the square and triangular

solidify upon heating, due to a high excess spin entropy in the solid phase.
Here, using both local and global electronic entropy and compressibility
measurements, we show that an analogous effect occurs in magic angle twisted
bilayer graphene. Near a filling of one electron per moir'e unit cell, we
observe a dramatic increase in the electronic entropy to about 1kB per unit
cell. This large excess entropy is quenched by an in-plane magnetic field,
pointing to its magnetic origin. A sharp drop in the compressibility as a
function of the electron density, associated with a reset of the Fermi level
back to the vicinity of the Dirac point, marks a clear boundary between two
phases. We map this jump as a function of electron density, temperature, and
magnetic field. This reveals a phase diagram that is consistent with a
Pomeranchuk-like temperature- and field-driven transition from a low-entropy
electronic liquid to a high-entropy correlated state with nearly-free magnetic
moments. The correlated state features an unusual combination of seemingly
contradictory properties, some associated with itinerant electrons, such as the
absence of a thermodynamic gap, metallicity, and a Dirac-like compressibility,
and others associated with localized moments, such as a large entropy and its
disappearance with magnetic field. Moreover, the energy scales characterizing
these two sets of properties are very different: whereas the compressibility
jump onsets at T~30K, the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is ~3K or smaller.
The hybrid nature of the new correlated state and the large separation of
energy scales have key implications for the physics of correlated states in
twisted bilayer graphene.

higher quality spectra. We study the performance of the proposed HiRISE fiber

the ultimate detection limits of HiRISE as a function of stellar magnitude, and
we quantify the impact of different coronagraphs and of the system
transmission. We find that HiRISE largely outperforms CRIRES+ for companions
around bright hosts like $\beta$ Pic or 51 Eri. For an $H=3.5$ host, we observe
a gain of a factor of up to 16 in observing time with HiRISE to reach the same
S/N on a companion at 200 mas. More generally, HiRISE provides better
performance than CRIRES+ in two-hour integration times between 50-350 mas for
hosts with $H<8.5$ and between 50-700 mas for $H<7$. For fainter hosts like PDS
70 and HIP 65426, no significant improvements are observed. We find that using
no coronagraph yields the best S/N when characterizing known exoplanets due to
higher transmission and fiber-based starlight suppression. We demonstrate that
the overall transmission of the system is in fact the main driver of

molecular gas surface densities (3.4 dex), velocity dispersions (1.7 dex), and
turbulent pressures (6.5 dex) across the galaxies in our sample. Under
simplifying assumptions about sub-resolution gas structure, the inferred virial

modest factor (1.3 on average). We find that the cloud-scale surface density,
velocity dispersion, and turbulent pressure (1) increase towards the inner

through near-IR spectral energy distributions of $\sim$83,000 resolved stars to
infer their individual ionizing flux outputs. We constrain the local escape
fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the
number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding
neutral hydrogen in individual star-forming regions. We find substantial
spatial variation in the escape fraction (0-40%). Integrating over the entire
galaxy yields a global escape fraction of 25% (+16%/-15%). This value is much
higher than previous escape fractions of zero reported for this galaxy. We
discuss sources of this apparent tension, and demonstrate that the viewing

has no internal dust, like many high-redshift galaxies, we find an escape
fraction of 59% (an upper-limit for NGC 4214). This is the first non-zero
escape fraction measurement for UV-faint (M$_{\rm FUV}$ = -15.9) galaxies at

observations of the CANDELS GOODS-South field. Denoising algorithms often
outperform the standard approach of filtering with the Point Spread Function

Perona-Malik filtering, the Total Variation method by Chambolle, and Bilateral
filtering on the Euclid-VIS image, we obtain catalogs that are both more pure

same result is achieved with the Structure-Texture image decomposition
algorithm applied on the H160 image. The advantage of denoising techniques with

neutrinos, it is possible to account for dark matter via RH neutrino portal
couplings to a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP) dark sector. However,
for large RH neutrino masses, gravity can play an important role. We study the
interplay between the neutrino portal through the right-handed neutrinos and
the gravity portal through the massless spin-2 graviton in producing dark
matter particles in the early universe. As a concrete example, we consider the
minimal and realistic Littlest Seesaw model with two RH neutrinos, augmented
with a dark scalar and a dark fermion charged under a global $U(1)_D$ dark
symmetry. In the model, the usual seesaw neutrino Yukawa couplings and the
right-handed neutrino masses (the lightest being about $5\times 10^{10}$ GeV)
are fixed by neutrino oscillations data and leptogenesis. Hence, we explore the
parameter space of the two RH neutrino portal couplings, the two dark particle
masses and the reheating temperature of the universe, where the correct dark
matter relic abundance is achieved through the freeze-in mechanism. In
particular, we highlight which class of processes dominate the dark matter
production. We find that, despite the presence of the gravity portal, the dark
matter production relies on the usual seesaw neutrino Yukawa coupling in some
regions of the parameter space, so realising a direct link between dark matter
and neutrino phenomenology. Finally, we report the threshold values for the
neutrino portal couplings below which the neutrino portal is irrelevant and the

by a binary companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves,
the influence and final fate of helium stars -- in particular the resulting
black hole mass -- highly depends on their wind mass loss as stripped-envelope
objects. While empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have
improved over the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to
metallicities with the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual
stars. Yet, theoretical efforts have been hampered by the complexity of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising from the more massive helium stars. In an
unprecedented effort, we calculate next-generation stellar atmosphere models
resembling massive helium main sequence stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to
$500\,M_\odot$ over a wide metallicity range between $2.0$ and $0.02\,Z_\odot$.
We uncover a complex $\Gamma_\text{e}$-dependency of WR-type winds and their
metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset of
multiple scattering, requiring higher $L/M$-ratios at lower metallicity. Based
on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically-motivated mass-loss
recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for LyC and He II
ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium stars to contribute considerably at
low metallicity. In sharp contrast to OB-star winds, the mass loss for helium
stars scales with the terminal velocity. While limited to the helium main

consistent with the bar-driven secular evolution picture for their formation.
In fact, we show that these nuclear discs have, in the region where they

define a kinematic radius for the nuclear discs and show that it relates to bar
radius, ellipticity and strength, and bar-to-total ratio. Comparing our results

nuclear discs are typically identified in such image decompositions as
photometric bulges with (near-)exponential profiles. However, we find that the

discovery of new and rare types of transients, most notably the class of
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I), with about 150 events
confirmed to date. Here we present a machine-learning classification algorithm
targeted at rapid identification of a pure sample of SLSN-I to enable
spectroscopic and multi-wavelength follow-up. This algorithm is part of the
FLEET (Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients) observational
strategy. It utilizes both light curve and contextual information, but without
the need for a redshift, to assign each newly-discovered transient a
probability of being a SLSN-I. This classifier can achieve a maximum purity of
about 85\% (with 20\% completeness) when observing a selection of SLSN-I
candidates. Additionally, we present two alternative classifiers that use
either redshifts or complete light curves and can achieve an even higher purity
and completeness. At the current discovery rate, the FLEET algorithm can
provide about $20$ SLSN-I candidates per year for spectroscopic follow-up with
85\% purity; with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time we anticipate this will
rise to more than $\sim 10^3$ events per year.

indicate that nuclear discs and nuclear rings are part of the same physical
component, with nuclear rings constituting the outer edge of nuclear discs. All
nuclear discs in the sample are clearly distinguished based on their stellar
population properties. As expected in the picture of bar-driven secular
evolution, nuclear discs are younger, more metal-rich, and show lower
[$\alpha$/Fe] enhancements, as compared to their immediate surroundings.
Moreover, nuclear discs exhibit well-defined radial gradients, with ages and
metallicities decreasing, and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances increasing with radius
out to the nuclear ring. Often, these gradients show no breaks from the edge of
the nuclear disc until the centre, suggesting that these structures extend to
the very centres of the galaxies. We argue that continuous (stellar) nuclear
discs may form from a series of bar-built (initially gas-rich) nuclear rings
that grow in radius, as the bar evolves. In this picture, nuclear rings are
simply the (often) star-forming outer edge of nuclear discs. Finally, by
combining our results with those from a accompanying kinematic study, we do not
find evidence for the presence of large, dispersion-dominated components in the
centres of these galaxies. This could be a result of quiet merger histories,
despite the large galaxy masses, or perhaps high angular momentum and strong
feedback processes preventing the formation of these kinematically hot

  Indicators","Submitted to ApJ, comments welcome",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abbb2f",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-ray line fluorescence is ubiquitous around powerful accretion sources,
namely active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. The brightest and
best-studied line is the Fe K$\alpha$ line at $\lambda = 1.937$\AA (6.4\,keV).
This paper presents a survey of all well-measured Chandra/HETG grating spectra
featuring several K$\alpha$ fluorescence lines from elements between Mg and Ni.
Despite the variety of sources and physical conditions, we identify a common
trend that dictates the K$\alpha$ line intensity ratios between elements. For
the most part, the line intensities are well described by a simple,
plane-parallel approximation of a near-neutral, solar-abundance, high column
density ($N_{\textrm{H}} > 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) medium. This approximation gives
canonical photon-intensity line ratios for the K$\alpha$ fluorescence of all
elements, e.g., 0.104:\,0.069:\,1.0:\,0.043 for Si:\,S:\,Fe:\,Ni, respectively.
Deviations from these ratios are shown to be primarily due to excess column
density along the line of sight beyond the Galactic column. Therefore, measured
fluorescence line ratios provide an independent estimate of $N_{\textrm{H}}$
and insight into the environment of accretion sources. Residual discrepancies
with the canonical ratios could be due to a variety of effects such as a
fluorescing medium with $N_{\textrm{H}} < 10^{24}$\,cm$^{-2}$, a non-neutral
medium, variations in the illuminating spectrum, non-solar abundances, or an
irregular source geometry. However, evidently and perhaps surprisingly, these
are uncommon, and their effect remains minor.

fit our model to simulated power spectra and show that we can match the results

high neutrino mass. We also present a simple halo model that can be used to
model the impact of baryonic feedback on the power spectrum. This six-parameter

flare observed with the GRAVITY instrument on July 28, 2018. Motivated by the
time evolution of both the observed astrometric and polarimetric signatures, we
interpret the data in terms of the polarised emission of a compact region
('hotspot') orbiting a black hole in a fixed, background magnetic field
geometry. We calculated a grid of general relativistic ray-tracing models,
created mock observations by simulating the instrumental response, and compared
predicted polarimetric quantities directly to the measurements. We take into
account an improved instrument calibration that now includes the instrument's
response as a function of time, and we explore a variety of idealised magnetic
field configurations. We find that the linear polarisation angle rotates during
the flare, which is consistent with previous results. The hotspot model can
explain the observed evolution of the linear polarisation. In order to match
the astrometric period of this flare, the near horizon magnetic field is
required to have a significant poloidal component, which is associated with
strong and dynamically important fields. The observed linear polarisation
fraction of $\simeq 30\%$ is smaller than the one predicted by our model
($\simeq 50\%$). The emission is likely beam depolarised, indicating that the

be one of the main sources of gravitational waves in the Universe. Here, we use
our new population synthesis code, cBHBd, to determine the redshift evolution
of the merger rate density and masses of black hole binaries formed in globular
clusters. We simulate $\sim 2$ million models to explore the parameter space
that is relevant to real clusters and over all mass scales. We show that when
uncertainties on the initial cluster mass function and density are properly
taken into account, they become the two dominant factors in setting the
theoretical error bars on merger rates. Other model parameters (e.g., natal
kicks, black hole masses, metallicity) have virtually no effect on the local
merger rate density, although they affect the masses of the merging black
holes. Modelling the merger rate density as a function of redshift as
$R(z)=R_0(1+z)^\kappa$ at $z<2$, and marginalizing over uncertainties, we find:
$R_0=7.2^{+21.5}_{-5.5}{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ and $\kappa=1.6^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$
($90\%$ credibility). The rate parameters for binaries that merge inside the
clusters are ${R}_{\rm 0,in}=1.6^{+1.9}_{-1.0}{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ and
$\kappa_{\rm in}=2.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$; $\sim 20\%$ of these form as the result of
a gravitational-wave capture, implying that eccentric mergers from globular
clusters contribute $\lesssim 0.4 \rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ to the local rate. A
comparison to the merger rate reported by LIGO-Virgo shows that a scenario in
which most of the detected black hole mergers are formed in globular clusters
is consistent with current constraints, and requires initial cluster half-mass
densities $\gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot \rm pc^{-3}$. Such models also reproduce the
inferred primary black hole mass distribution for masses $13-30 M_\odot$, but
under-predict the data outside this range.

$\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $E$ of full support. Using methods of elementary
number theory, we describe the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded polynomial identities for
the so-called $2$-induced $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $E$ of full support. As a
consequence of this fact we provide examples of $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $E$
which are PI-equivalent but not $\mathbb{Z}$-isomorphic. This is the first
example of graded algebras with infinite support that are PI-equivalent and not
isomorphic as graded algebras. We also present the notion of central
$\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on $E$ and we show that its $\mathbb{Z}$-graded
polynomial identities are closely related to the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-graded
polynomial identities of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-gradings on $E$.

meta-algorithm that captures state-of-the-art polynomial time guarantees for
many optimization problems such as Max-$k$-CSPs and Tensor PCA. On the flip
side, a SoS lower bound provides evidence of hardness, which is particularly
relevant to average-case problems for which NP-hardness may not be available.
  In this paper, we consider the following average case problem, which we call
the \emph{Planted Affine Planes} (PAP) problem: Given $m$ random vectors
$d_1,\ldots,d_m$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, can we prove that there is no vector $v \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ such that for all $u \in [m]$, $\langle v, d_u\rangle^2 = 1$? In
other words, can we prove that $m$ random vectors are not all contained in two
parallel hyperplanes at equal distance from the origin? We prove that for $m
\leq n^{3/2-\epsilon}$, with high probability, degree-$n^{\Omega(\epsilon)}$
SoS fails to refute the existence of such a vector $v$.
  When the vectors $d_1,\ldots,d_m$ are chosen from the multivariate normal
distribution, the PAP problem is equivalent to the problem of proving that a
random $n$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ does not contain a boolean
vector. As shown by Mohanty--Raghavendra--Xu [STOC 2020], a lower bound for
this problem implies a lower bound for the problem of certifying energy upper
bounds on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian, and so our lower bound
implies a degree-$n^{\Omega(\epsilon)}$ SoS lower bound for the certification
version of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick problem.

is a very active topic of study and goes under the name of ""type theory eating
itself"" or ""type theory in type theory."" Most approaches are at least loosely
based on Dybjer's categories with families (CwF's) and come with a type CON of
contexts, a type family TY indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This
works well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity
proofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a
long-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory
""eats itself"" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying
difficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type
theory in the absence of UIP.
  In this paper, we develop a notion of $\infty$-categories with families
($\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the
previously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity
substitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The
type-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although
it remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known
unsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is
presented in two-level type theory (2LTT).
  Apart from introducing $\infty$-CwF's, the paper explains the shortcomings of
1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and
approaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.

Among post-hoc explanation techniques, counterfactual explanations are becoming
one of the most popular methods to achieve this objective. In particular, in
addition to highlighting the most important features used by the black-box
model, they provide users with actionable explanations in the form of data
instances that would have received a different outcome. Nonetheless, by doing
so, they also leak non-trivial information about the model itself, which raises
privacy issues. In this work, we demonstrate how an adversary can leverage the
information provided by counterfactual explanations to build high-fidelity and
high-accuracy model extraction attacks. More precisely, our attack enables the
adversary to build a faithful copy of a target model by accessing its
counterfactual explanations. The empirical evaluation of the proposed attack on
black-box models trained on real-world datasets demonstrates that they can
achieve high-fidelity and high-accuracy extraction even under low query
budgets.

duration is studied with the purpose to determine the effect of the bursts on
the strength and sustainability of gravitational instability in the disk. A
special emphasis is paid to the spatial distribution of gas and grown dust
(from 1 mm to a few cm) during and after the burst. Methods: Numerical
hydrodynamics simulations using the FEOSAD code were employed to study the
dynamics of gas and dust in the thin-disk limit. Dust-to-gas friction including
back reaction and dust growth were also considered. Bursts of various duration
(from 100 to 500 yr) were initiated in accordance with a thermally ignited
magnetorotational instability. Luminosity curves for constant- and
declining-magnitude bursts were adopted to represent two typical limiting cases
for FU-Orionis-type eruptions. Results: The short-term effect of the burst is
to reduce the strength of gravitational instability by heating and expanding
the disk. The longest bursts with duration comparable to the revolution period
of the spiral can completely dissolve the original two-armed spiral pattern in
the gas disk by the end of the burst, while the shortest bursts only weaken the
spiral pattern. The reaction of grown dust to the burst is somewhat different.
The spiral-like initial distribution with deep cavities in the inter-armed
regions transforms into a ring-like distribution with deep gaps. This
transformation is most expressed for the longest-duration bursts. The long-term
effect of the burst depends on the initial disk conditions at the onset of the
burst. In some cases, vigorous disk fragmentation sets in several thousand
years after the burst, which was absent in the model without the bursts
(abridged).

by tracing neurons through high-resolution image stacks acquired with

propose a new semi-automatic method that uses topological features to guide
users in tracing neurons and integrate this method within a virtual reality

visualization and interaction with topological elements, allowing rapid
understanding and tracing of complex morphologies. In our pilot study,
neuroscientists demonstrated a strong preference for using our tool over prior

better understand possible paths and alternatives. Quantitative evaluation of
the traces reveals that users' tracing speed increased, while retaining similar

This
is consistent with the hypothesis that supernovae and asymptotic giant branch
stars are the primary producers of dust in the Universe. However, there has
been a longstanding question of how much of the dust detected in the interiors
of young supernova remnants can escape into the interstellar medium. We present
new hydrodynamical calculations of the evolution of dust grains that were
formed in dense ejecta clumps within a Cas A-like remnant. We follow the
dynamics of the grains as they decouple from the gas after their clump is hit
by the reverse shock. They are subsequently subject to destruction by thermal
and kinetic sputtering as they traverse the remnant. Grains that are large
enough ($\sim 0.25\,\mu$m for silicates and $\sim 0.1\,\mu$m for carbonaceous
grains) escape into the interstellar medium while smaller grains get trapped
and destroyed. However, grains that reach the interstellar medium still have
high velocities, and are subject to further destruction as they are slowed
down. We find that for initial grain size distributions that include large
($\sim 0.25 - 0.5\,\mu$m) grains, 10--20\% of silicate grains can survive,
while 30--50\% of carbonaceous grains survive even when the initial size
distribution cuts off at smaller ($0.25\,\mu$m) sizes. For a 19 M$_{\odot}$
star similar to the progenitor of Cas A, up to 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of dust can
survive if the dust grains formed are large. Thus we show that supernovae under
the right conditions can be significant sources of interstellar dust.

covering 100,486 research papers across all areas of science to investigate the
rates at which scientists are mentioned in the stories about their work as a
function of their perceived ethnicity from names. By focusing only on research
papers news outlets chose to cover, the analysis reduces concerns that
differences in mentions rates are driven by differences in research quality or
newsworthiness. We find substantial disparities in mention rates across names
associated with particular ethnicities. Researchers with names not from British
origins, especially those with East Asian and African names, are significantly
less likely to be mentioned in stories of their own research than those with
British-origin names, even when controlling for stories of a particular news
outlet covering a particular scientific venue on a particular research topic.
The disparities are explained only in part by authors' locations, suggesting
that pragmatic factors such as difficulties in scheduling interviews play a
partial role. We also find that English speaking fluency may be one of the
causes because there are disparities in quotation rates among authors
affiliated with U.S. institutions. Furthermore, among U.S.-based authors,
journalists more often use authors' institutions instead of names when
referring to non-British-named authors, suggesting that journalists' rhetorical
choices are also key. Overall, multiple mechanisms generate substantial
disparities across perceived ethnicities in how researchers are covered in

While retrospective histories from a prevalent cohort do not identify incidence
rates without parametric modelling assumptions, the rates can be identified
when combined with data from a general cohort. Moreover, education, a strong
endogenous covariate, and marriage processes are correlated. Hence, they need
to be modelled jointly in order to estimate the marriage incidence. For this
purpose, we specify a multi-state model and propose a likelihood-based
estimation method. We outline the assumptions under which a likelihood
expression involving only marriage incidence parameters can be derived. This is
of particular interest when either retrospective education histories are not

confirm the gain in efficiency by combining data from the two designs, while
demonstrating how the parameter estimates are affected by violations of the

of lepton masses and flavor mixing. In these models, a given symmetry is
assumed at a high scale and then is spontaneously broken by scalars (the
flavons), which acquire vacuum expectation values. Typically, the resulting
leading order predictions for the oscillation parameters require corrections in
order to comply with neutrino oscillation data. We introduce such corrections
through an explicit small breaking of the symmetry.
  This has the advantage of solving the cosmological problems of these models
without resorting to inflation. The explicit breaking induces an energy
difference or ""bias"" between different vacua and drives the evolution of the
domain walls, unavoidably produced after the symmetry breaking, towards their
annihilation. Importantly, the wall annihilation leads to gravitational waves
which may be observed in current and/or future experiments. We show that a
distinctive pattern of gravitational waves with multiple overlapped peaks is
generated when walls annihilate, which is within the reach of future detectors.
We also show that cosmic walls from discrete flavor symmetries can be
cosmologically safe for any spontaneous breaking scale between 1 and $10^{18}$
GeV, if the bias is chosen adequately, without the need to inflate the walls
away. We use as an example a particular $A_4$ model in which an explicit

  Segmentation with Minimalistic Models",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The segmentation of the retinal vasculature from eye fundus images represents
one of the most fundamental tasks in retinal image analysis. Over recent years,
increasingly complex approaches based on sophisticated Convolutional Neural
Network architectures have been slowly pushing performance on well-established
benchmark datasets. In this paper, we take a step back and analyze the real
need of such complexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that a minimalistic
version of a standard U-Net with several orders of magnitude less parameters,
carefully trained and rigorously evaluated, closely approximates the
performance of current best techniques. In addition, we propose a simple
extension, dubbed W-Net, which reaches outstanding performance on several
popular datasets, still using orders of magnitude less learnable weights than
any previously published approach. Furthermore, we provide the most
comprehensive cross-dataset performance analysis to date, involving up to 10
different databases. Our analysis demonstrates that the retinal vessel
segmentation problem is far from solved when considering test images that
differ substantially from the training data, and that this task represents an
ideal scenario for the exploration of domain adaptation techniques. In this
context, we experiment with a simple self-labeling strategy that allows us to
moderately enhance cross-dataset performance, indicating that there is still
much room for improvement in this area. Finally, we also test our approach on
the Artery/Vein segmentation problem, where we again achieve results
well-aligned with the state-of-the-art, at a fraction of the model complexity
in recent literature. All the code to reproduce the results in this paper is
released.

mechanism working in its interior -- modulates the electromagnetic, particulate
and radiative environment in space. While solar activity variations on short
timescale create space weather, slow long-term modulation forms the basis of
space climate. Space weather impacts diverse space-reliant technologies while
space climate influences planetary atmospheres and climate. Having prior
knowledge of the Sun's activity is important in these contexts. However,
forecasting solar-stellar magnetic activity has remained an outstanding
challenge. In this review, predictions for sunspot cycle 24 and the upcoming
cycle 25 are summarized, and critically assessed. The analysis demonstrates
that while predictions based on diverse techniques disagree across solar cycles
24--25, physics-based predictions for solar cycle 25 have converged and
indicates a weak sunspot cycle 25. It is argued that this convergence in
physics-based predictions is indicative of progress in the fundamental
understanding of solar cycle predictability. Based on this understanding,
resolutions to several outstanding questions related to solar cycle predictions
are discussed.

mathematical formulation of numerical differentiation is typically ill-posed,
and researchers often resort to an \textit{ad hoc} process for choosing one of
many computational methods and its parameters. In this work, we take a
principled approach and propose a multi-objective optimization framework for
choosing parameters that minimize a loss function to balance the faithfulness
and smoothness of the derivative estimate. Our framework has three significant
advantages. First, the task of selecting multiple parameters is reduced to
choosing a single hyper-parameter. Second, where ground-truth data is unknown,
we provide a heuristic for automatically selecting this hyper-parameter based
on the power spectrum and temporal resolution of the data. Third, the optimal
value of the hyper-parameter is consistent across different differentiation
methods, thus our approach unifies vastly different numerical differentiation
methods and facilitates unbiased comparison of their results. Finally, we
provide an extensive open-source Python library \texttt{pynumdiff} to

The electron spectrum of such heterostructure is characterized by two subbands

$\Delta_{12}=15.5$ meV. It is shown that, in the linear regime at the applied
magnetic field $B >3$ T, the system exhibits oscillations corresponding to the
integer quantum Hall effect. A quite complicated pattern of such oscillations
is well interpreted in terms of transitions between Landau levels related to
different subbands. At $B <1$ T, magneto-intersubband resistance oscillations
(MISOs) are observed. An increase in the conductivity with the electric current
flowing across the sample or in the intensity of the surface acoustic wave
(SAW) in the regime of the integer quantum Hall effect is determined by an
increase in the electron gas temperature. In the case of intersubband
transitions, it is found that nonlinearity cannot be explained by heating. At
the same time, the decrease in the AC conductivity with increasing SAW electric
field is independent of frequency, but the corresponding behavior does not
coincide with that corresponding to the dependence of the DC conductivity on

This new cooling function calculates the cooling rate due to inverse Compton

and approximating the radiation energy density and Compton temperature there by
integrating over the thermal seed photon flux from the disk surface. The method
either assumes ion and electron temperatures are equal (1T), or calculates them
separately (2T) using an instantaneous equilibrium approach predicated on the
actual relevant rate equations (Coulomb and Compton). The method is shown to be
consistent with a more detailed ray-tracing calculation where the bulk of the
cooling occurs, but is substantially less costly to perform. As an example, we
apply these methods to a \textsc{harm3d} simulation of a $10 M_\odot$,
non-spinning black hole, accreting at nominally 1\% the Eddington value. Both
1T and 2T approaches lead to increased radiative efficiency and a larger
fraction of total cooling in the corona as compared to the original
target-temperature cooling function used by \textsc{harm3d}, especially in the
1T case. Time-averaged post-processing reveals that the continuum spectral

In particular, we apply the covariant phase space methods on a class of first

Furthermore, we renormalize the symplectic structure at null infinity to obtain
the generalized BMS charge algebra associated with smooth superrotations. We
then study the vacuum structure of the gravitational field, which allows us to
relate the so-called superboost transformations to the velocity kick/refraction
memory effect. Afterward, we propose a new set of boundary conditions in
asymptotically locally (A)dS spacetime that leads to a version of the BMS group
in the presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant, called the
$\Lambda$-BMS asymptotic symmetry group. Using the holographic renormalization
procedure and a diffeomorphism between Bondi and Fefferman-Graham gauges, we

study the everted problem: an aqueous droplet deposited onto a deep layer of
silicone oil. As it is energetically favourable for the oil phase to spread to
cover the droplet surface completely, the droplet is ultimately engulfed in the
oil layer. We present a detailed study of engulfment dynamics, from the instant
the droplet first impacts the oil surface until it finally sediments into the
less dense oil. We study a broad range of droplet sizes (micrometric to
millimetric) and oil kinematic viscosities ($10^2$ to $10^5$ cSt),
corresponding to a viscosity-dominated parameter regime with relevance to oil
spills. Our investigation primarily examines droplet engulfment dynamics over
two distinct stages: a rapid earlier stage in which the droplet is almost
entirely submerged, driven by capillary forces in the oil surface, and cloaked
by a thin layer of oil; and a much slower later stage in which gravity pulls on
the drop adhered to the oil surface, thus driving a peeling flow. This means
that gravitational effects are essential to complete the engulfmet of the
droplet, even for micrometric droplets. We observe the longest engulfment times

graphs, pushed by a growing availability of temporally-annotated network data
coming from social, biological and financial networks. Despite the importance
of analyzing complex temporal networks, there is a huge gap between the set of
definitions, algorithms and tools available to study large static graphs and
the ones available for temporal graphs. An important task in temporal graph
analysis is mining dense structures, i.e., identifying high-density subgraphs
together with the span in which this high density is observed. In this paper,
we introduce the concept of $(k, \Delta)$-truss (span-truss) in temporal
graphs, a temporal generalization of the $k$-truss, in which $k$ captures the
information about the density and $\Delta$ captures the time span in which this
density holds. We then propose novel and efficient algorithms to identify
maximal span-trusses, namely the ones not dominated by any other span-truss
neither in the order $k$ nor in the interval $\Delta$, and evaluate them on a
number of public available datasets.

clumps can produce exponential discs, and the effectiveness of the process
depends on the mass of scattering centres, as well as the stability of the
galactic disc. Heavy, dense scattering centres in a less stable disc generate
an exponential profile quickly, with a timescale shorter than 1 Gyr. The
profile evolution due to scattering can make a near-exponential disc under
various initial stellar distributions. This result supports analytic theories
that predict the scattering processes always favour the zero entropy gradient
solution to the Jeans/Poisson equations, whose profile is a near-exponential.
Profile changes are accompanied by disc thickening, and a power-law increase in
stellar velocity dispersion in both vertical and radial directions is also
observed through the evolution. Close encounters between stars and clumps can
produce abrupt changes in stellar orbits and shift stars radially. These events
can make trajectories more eccentric, but many leave eccentricities little
changed. On average, orbital eccentricities of stars increase moderately with
time.

obtain secure post-quantum cryptography at high communication rates. The secure
network-coding scheme we offer is hybrid in the sense that it combines
information-theory security with public-key cryptography. In addition, the
scheme is general and can be applied to any communication network, and to any
public-key cryptosystem. Our hybrid scheme is based on the information
theoretic notion of individual secrecy, which traditionally relies on the
assumption that an eavesdropper can only observe a subset of the communication
links between the trusted parties - an assumption that is often challenging to
enforce. For this setting, several code constructions have been developed,
where the messages are linearly mixed before transmission over each of the
paths in a way that guarantees that an adversary which observes only a subset
has sufficient uncertainty about each individual message.
  Instead, in this paper, we take a computational viewpoint, and construct a
coding scheme in which an arbitrary secure cryptosystem is utilized on a subset
of the links, while a pre-processing similar to the one in individual security
is utilized. Under this scheme, we demonstrate 1) a computational security
guarantee for an adversary which observes the entirety of the links 2) an
information theoretic security guarantee for an adversary which observes a
subset of the links, and 3) information rates which approach the capacity of
the network and greatly improve upon the current solutions.
  A perhaps surprising consequence of our scheme is that, to guarantee a
computational security level b, it is sufficient to encrypt a single link using
a computational post-quantum scheme. In addition, the information rate
approaches 1 as the number of communication links increases.

there are clues to its origin in the acoustic nearfield and farfield. To
unravel this mystery, we recorded the acoustic nearfield generated by six
freely hovering Annas hummingbirds using a 2176 microphone array. We also
directly measured the 3D aerodynamic forces generated by the hummingbird in
vivo using a new aerodynamic force platform. To determine the degree to which
the aerodynamic forces cause the hum, we developed a simple first-principles
model to predict the acoustic field radiated by the 3D oscillating forces. The
correspondence between the predicted and measured acoustic field shows the
primary acoustic sources of the hum are the lift and drag forces that oscillate
as the flapping wings move back and forth. The model also shows how the
aerodynamic force profile of the flapping wing determines the hums timbre and
sound pressure level: profiles that support bodyweight with higher harmonics
radiate more acoustic power. Further, extending this model across birds and
flying insects, we show how the radiated acoustic power scales with body mass
to the second power - with allometric deviation making larger birds quieter and
elongated flies louder. The model's ability to predict the acoustic signature
of flapping wings suggests it can be applied for such diverse uses as
differentiating wing and feather sounds in bird display behaviors to
interpreting how insects generate courtship songs with their wings to making
flapping robot wings more silent.

on two 2-dimensional spectroscopic surveys with different spatial resolutions,
MAD and MaNGA. After taking out the overall mass and radial dependences, which

find that $\Delta {\rm log}$sSFR and $\Delta {\rm log}$(O/H) on galactic are

Epidemiologists are more involved in policy decisions and evidence generation

Beyond the issues that are faced for any policy, evaluation of COVID-19
policies is complicated by additional challenges related to infectious disease
dynamics and lags, lack of direct observation of key outcomes, and a
multiplicity of interventions occurring on an accelerated time scale. The
methods needed for policy-level impact evaluation are not often used or taught

blocks and attention modules help in feature extraction using a combination of
feature reuse, increased network depth, and maximum context aggregation.
Furthermore, we reveal previously unknown problems with a loss based on the
spectral magnitude of enhanced speech. To alleviate these problems, we propose
a novel loss based on magnitudes of enhanced speech and a predicted noise. Even
though the proposed loss is based on magnitudes only, a constraint imposed by
noise prediction ensures that the loss enhances both magnitude and phase.
Experimental results demonstrate that DCN trained with the proposed loss
substantially outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches to causal and

multi-pool networks of any tree topology, Markovian or non-Markovian, in the
Halfin-Whitt regime. This parameter can be regarded as the optimal reallocation
of the capacity fluctuations (positive or negative) of order $\sqrt{n}$ when
each server pool employs a square-root staffing rule. We provide an explicit
form of the SWSS as a function of the system parameters, which is derived using
a graph theoretic approach based on Gaussian elimination.
  For Markovian networks, we give an equivalent characterization of the SWSS
parameter via the drift parameters of the limiting diffusion. We show that if
the SWSS parameter is negative, the limiting diffusion and the diffusion-scaled
queueing processes are transient under any Markov control, and cannot have a
stationary distribution when this parameter is zero. If it is positive, we show
that the diffusion-scaled queueing processes are uniformly stabilizable, that
is, there exists a scheduling policy under which the stationary distributions
of the controlled processes are tight over the size of the network. In
addition, there exists a control under which the limiting controlled diffusion
is exponentially ergodic. Thus we have identified a necessary and sufficient
condition for the uniform stabilizability of such networks in the Halfin-Whitt
regime.
  We use a constant control resulting from the leaf elimination algorithm to
stabilize the limiting controlled diffusion, while a family of Markov
scheduling policies which are easy to compute are used to stabilize the
diffusion-scaled processes. Finally, we show that under these controls the
processes are exponentially ergodic and the stationary distributions have
exponential tails.

summer of 2015. Such high-cadence, long-baseline data set is crucial for
understanding spurious radial-velocity signals induced by our Sun and by the
instrument. On the instrumental side, this data set allowed us to detect
sub-\ms\,systematics that needed to be corrected for. The goal of this
manuscript is to i) present a new data reduction software for HARPS-N, ii)
demonstrate the improvement brought by this new software on the first three
years of the HARPS-N solar data set, and iii) release all the obtained solar
products, from extracted spectra to precise radial velocities. To correct for
the instrumental systematics observed in the data reduced with the current
version of the HARPS-N data reduction software (DRS version 3.7), we adapted
the newly available ESPRESSO DRS (version 2.2.3) to HARPS-N and developed new
optimized recipes for the spectrograph. We then compared the first three years
of HARPS-N solar data reduced with the current and new DRS. The most
significant improvement brought by the new DRS is a strong decrease in the
day-to-day radial-velocity scatter, from 1.27 to 1.07\ms; this is thanks to a
more robust method to derive wavelength solutions, but also to the use of
calibrations closer in time. The newly derived solar radial-velocities are also
better correlated with the chromospheric activity level of the Sun on the
long-term, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93 compared to 0.77
before, which is expected from our understanding of stellar signals. Finally,
we also discuss how HARPS-N spectral ghosts contaminate the measurement of the
calcium activity index, and present an efficient technique to derive an index
free of instrumental systematics. This paper presents a new data reduction
software for HARPS-N, and demonstrates its improvements [...]

classification agrees with the well-known classification into torsionless,
twistless torsional and torsional Newton-Cartan geometries. In the case of
carrollian structures, we find that intrinsic torsion allows us to classify
Carroll manifolds into four classes, depending on the action of the Carroll
vector field on the spatial metric, or equivalently in terms of the nature of
the null hypersurfaces of a lorentzian manifold into which a carrollian
geometry may embed. By a small refinement of the results for galilean and
carrollian structures, we show that there are sixteen classes of aristotelian
structures, which we characterise geometrically. Finally, the bulk of the paper
is devoted to the case of bargmannian structures, where we find twenty-seven

understand the populations that make up the colour-magnitude distribution of
galaxies can be combined with machine learning photometric redshift codes to
improve redshift estimates. In particular we combine the use of Gaussian
Mixture Models with the high performing machine learning photo-z algorithm GPz
and show that modelling and accounting for the different colour-magnitude
distributions of training and test data separately can give improved redshift
estimates, reduce the bias on estimates by up to a half, and speed up the
run-time of the algorithm. These methods are illustrated using data from deep
optical and near infrared data in two separate deep fields, where training and
test data of different colour-magnitude distributions are constructed from the
galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts, derived from several heterogeneous

without the need for costly fine-tuning. Specifically, we decompose the weight
filters using SVD and train the network on incremental tasks in its factorized
form. Such a factorization allows us to directly impose sparsity-inducing
regularizers over the singular values and allows us to use fewer number of

significant patterns in the relative emission from these two atmospheric
regions as a function of stellar age and effective temperature. We find that as

coronae follow a pattern in response to the amount of magnetic heating in these
atmospheric layers. A single trendline slope describes the pattern of X-ray vs.
Lyman-alpha emission for G and K dwarfs, but the different trendlines for M

smaller than warmer stars with the same X-ray flux. The X-ray and Lyman-alpha

treatment timing such that, after making an appropriate parallel trends
assumption, one can identify, estimate, and make inference about causal
effects. In practice, however, different DID procedures rely on different
parallel trends assumptions (PTA), and recover different causal parameters. In
this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event-studies) and
discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identification and estimation of
causal parameters. We document a ``robustness'' vs. ``efficiency'' trade-off in
terms of the strength of the underlying PTA, and argue that practitioners
should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We
propose new DID estimators that reflect these trade-offs and derived their
large sample properties. We illustrate the practical relevance of these results
by assessing whether the transition from federal to state management of the

  analysis",,"Medical Physics 2020","10.1002/mp.14465",,"eess.IV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Body composition is known to be associated with many diseases
including diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we
developed a fully automatic body tissue decomposition procedure to segment
three major compartments that are related to body composition analysis -
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and muscle.
Three additional compartments - the ventral cavity, lung and bones were also
segmented during the segmentation process to assist segmentation of the major
compartments.
  Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model with densely connected
layers was developed to perform ventral cavity segmentation. An image
processing workflow was developed to segment the ventral cavity in any
patient's CT using the CNN model, then further segment the body tissue into
multiple compartments using hysteresis thresholding followed by morphological
operations. It is important to segment ventral cavity firstly to allow accurate
separation of compartments with similar Hounsfield unit (HU) inside and outside
the ventral cavity.
  Results: The ventral cavity segmentation CNN model was trained and tested
with manually labelled ventral cavities in 60 CTs. Dice scores (mean +/-
standard deviation) for ventral cavity segmentation were 0.966+/-0.012. Tested
on CT datasets with intravenous (IV) and oral contrast, the Dice scores were
0.96+/-0.02, 0.94+/-0.06, 0.96+/-0.04, 0.95+/-0.04 and 0.99+/-0.01 for bone,
VAT, SAT, muscle and lung, respectively. The respective Dice scores were
0.97+/-0.02, 0.94+/-0.07, 0.93+/-0.06, 0.91+/-0.04 and 0.99+/-0.01 for
non-contrast CT datasets.
  Conclusion: A body tissue decomposition procedure was developed to
automatically segment multiple compartments of the ventral body. The proposed
method enables fully automated quantification of 3D ventral body composition

the particle is reset to the origin at a random sequence of times that is
generated by a Poisson process with rate $r$. The velocity state is reset to
$\pm v$ with fixed probabilities $\rho_1$ and $\rho_{-1}=1-\rho_1$, where $v$
is the speed. We exploit the fact that the moment generating functions with and
without resetting are related by a renewal equation, and the latter generating
function can be calculated by solving a corresponding Feynman-Kac equation.
This allows us to numerically locate in Laplace space the largest real pole of
the moment generating function with resetting, and thus derive a large
deviation principle (LDP) for the occupation time probability density using the
Gartner-Ellis theorem. We explore how the LDP depends on the switching rate
$\alpha$ of the velocity state, the resetting rate $r$ and the probability
$\rho_1$. In particular, we show that the corresponding LDP for a Brownian
particle with resetting is recovered in the fast switching limit
$\alpha\rightarrow \infty$. On the other hand, the behavior in the slow
switching limit depends on $\rho_1$ in the resetting protocol.

the Ultimatum game is almost always irrational, preferring mutualistic sharing
strategies, while chimpanzees act rationally and selfishly. However, human
behavior varies with geographic and cultural differences leading to distinct
behaviors. In this paper, we analyze a social imitation model that incorporates
internal energy caches (e.g., food/money savings), cost of living, death, and
reproduction. We show that when imitation (and death) occurs, a natural
correlation between selfishness and cost of living emerges. However, in all
societies that do not collapse, non-Nash sharing strategies emerge as the de
facto result of imitation. We explain these results by constructing a
mean-field approximation of the internal energy cache informed by time-varying
distributions extracted from experimental data. Results from a meta-analysis on
geographically diverse ultimatum game studies in humans, show the proposed
model captures some of the qualitative aspects of the real-world data and
suggests further experimentation.

characteristic are desirable to implement modern control systems. To overcome
such a shortcoming, this paper describes a methodology to train models from
dynamical data and steady-state information, which is assumed available. The
novelty is that the procedure can be applied to models with rather complex
structures such as multilayer perceptron neural networks in a bi-objective
fashion without the need to compute fixed points neither analytically nor
numerically. As a consequence, the required computing time is greatly reduced.
The capabilities of the proposed method are explored in numerical examples and

suitable soft-sensors with good dynamical and static performance and, in the
case of models that are nonlinear in the parameters, the gain in computation

  Symposium on Microarchitecture",,,,"quant-ph cs.AR cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current, near-term quantum devices have shown great progress in recent years
culminating with a demonstration of quantum supremacy. In the medium-term,
however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability
through error correction, likely through promising techniques such as surface
codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit
connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with
transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement
surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains.
Specifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them in layers
distributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon.
  Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a
minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient
operations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical
qubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice
surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves ~10x in transmons with
another 2x from an additional optimization for compactness.
  Although Virtualized Logical Qubits (VLQ) pays a 10x penalty in
serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and area efficiency result in
performance comparable to 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show
fault tolerance comparable to 2D architectures while saving substantial
hardware. Furthermore, VLQ can produce magic states 1.22x faster for a fixed
number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future
fault-tolerant quantum computers. VLQ substantially reduces the hardware
requirements for fault tolerance and puts within reach a proof-of-concept
experimental demonstration of around 10 logical qubits, requiring only 11
transmons and 9 attached cavities in total.

the interpretation of evidence ratios. A natural question is, how often will
you get it right when you choose on the basis of some threshold value of the
evidence ratio? The evidence ratio will be different in different realizations
of the data, and its utility can be examined in a Neyman-Pearson like way to
see what the trade-offs are between statistical power (the chance of ``getting
it right'') versus the false alarm rate, picking the alternative hypothesis
when the null is actually true. I will show some simple examples which show
that there can be a surprisingly large range for an evidence ratio under
different realizations of the data. It seems best not to simply rely on
Jeffrey's scale when decisions have to be taken, but also to examine the
probability of taking the ``wrong'' decision if some evidence ratio is taken to
be decisive. Interestingly, Turing knew this and applied it during WWII,

bound states that can lead to non-Abelian statistics and application in quantum
computation, have been one of the most intensively studied topics in condensed
matter physics recently. Up to date, only a few compounds have been proposed as
candidates of intrinsic TSCs, such as doped topological insulator CuxBi2Se3 and
iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. Here, by carrying out synchrotron and
laser based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we
systematically investigated the electronic structure of a quasi-1D
superconductor TaSe3, and identified the nontrivial topological surface states.
In addition, our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study revealed a clean
cleaved surface with a persistent superconducting gap, proving it suitable for
further investigation of potential Majorana modes. These results prove TaSe3 as
a stoichiometric TSC candidate that is stable and exfoliable, therefore a great
platform for the study of rich novel phenomena and application potentials.

two types: offline dynamic networks, where all states of the network are known,
and online dynamic networks, where only the past states of the network are
known. Research on staging animated transitions in dynamic networks has focused
more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into account past and
future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more
challenging problem since it requires a balance between timeliness for
monitoring tasks -- so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events
-- and clarity for comprehension tasks -- to minimize simultaneous changes that
may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these
requirements, we explore three strategies to stage animations for online
dynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approach that we
introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate the
advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in representing low- and
high-throughput data and conduct a user study involving monitoring and
comprehension of dynamic networks. We also conduct a follow-up, a think-aloud
study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic network
visualization. Our findings show that animation staging strategies that
emphasize comprehension do better for participant response times and accuracy.
However, the notion of ``comprehension'' is not always clear when it comes to
complex changes in highly dynamic networks, requiring some iteration in staging
that the hybrid approach affords. Based on our results, we make recommendations
for balancing event-based and time-based parameters for our hybrid approach.

embedded devices, it becomes popular to use a hardware CNN accelerator, called
neural processing unit (NPU), to achieve higher performance per watt than CPUs
or GPUs. Recently, automated neural architecture search (NAS) emerges as the
default technique to find a state-of-the-art CNN architecture with higher
accuracy than manually-designed architectures for image classification. In this
paper, we present a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology, called S3NAS, to find a CNN
architecture with higher accuracy than the existing ones under a given latency
constraint. It consists of three steps: supernet design, Single-Path NAS for
fast architecture exploration, and scaling. To widen the search space of the
supernet structure that consists of stages, we allow stages to have a different
number of blocks and blocks to have parallel layers of different kernel sizes.
For a fast neural architecture search, we apply a modified Single-Path NAS
technique to the proposed supernet structure. In this step, we assume a shorter
latency constraint than the required to reduce the search space and the search
time. The last step is to scale up the network maximally within the latency
constraint. For accurate latency estimation, an analytical latency estimator is
devised, based on a cycle-level NPU simulator that runs an entire CNN
considering the memory access overhead accurately. With the proposed
methodology, we are able to find a network in 3 hours using TPUv3, which shows
82.72% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 11.66 ms latency. Code are released at

activations/weights/outputs during the DNN computations to reduce data movement
from DRAM to the chip. The reuse is captured by the accelerator's dataflow.
While there has been significant prior work in exploring and comparing various
dataflows, the strategy for assigning on-chip hardware resources (i.e., compute
and memory) given a dataflow that can optimize for performance/energy while
meeting platform constraints of area/power for DNN(s) of interest is still
relatively unexplored. The design-space of choices for balancing compute and
memory explodes combinatorially, as we show in this work (e.g., as large as
O(10^(72)) choices for running \mobilenet), making it infeasible to do
manual-tuning via exhaustive searches. It is also difficult to come up with a
specific heuristic given that different DNNs and layer types exhibit different
amounts of reuse.
  In this paper, we propose an autonomous strategy called ConfuciuX to find
optimized HW resource assignments for a given model and dataflow style.
ConfuciuX leverages a reinforcement learning method, REINFORCE, to guide the
search process, leveraging a detailed HW performance cost model within the
training loop to estimate rewards. We also augment the RL approach with a
genetic algorithm for further fine-tuning. ConfuciuX demonstrates the highest
sample-efficiency for training compared to other techniques such as Bayesian
optimization, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and other RL methods. It
converges to the optimized hardware configuration 4.7 to 24 times faster than
alternate techniques.

keys, encryption alone becomes insufficient for data protection. Plausible
deniability (PD) mechanisms resolve this by enabling users to hide the mere
existence of sensitive data, often by providing plausible ""cover texts"" or
""public data volumes"" hosted on the same device.
  Unfortunately, with the increasing prevalence of (NAND) flash as a
high-performance cost-effective storage medium, PD becomes even more
challenging in the presence of realistic adversaries who can usually access a
device at multiple points in time (""multi-snapshot""). This is because
read/write operations to flash do not result in intuitive corresponding changes
to the underlying device state. The problem is further compounded by the fact
that this behavior is mostly proprietary. For example, in a majority of
commercially-available flash devices, an issued delete or overwrite operation
from the upper layers almost certainly won't result in an actual immediate
erase of the underlying flash cells.
  To address these challenges, we designed a new class of write-once memory
(WOM) codes to store hidden bits in the same physical locations as other public
bits. This is made possible by the inherent nature of NAND flash and the
possibility of issuing multiple writes to target cells that have not previous
been written to in existing pages.
  We designed PEARL, a general-purpose Flash Translation Layer (FTL) that
allows users to plausibly deniably store hidden data in NAND flash devices. We
implemented and evaluated PEARL on a widely used simulator FlashSim (Kim et al.
2019). PEARL performs well on real-world workloads, comparably to non-PD
baselines. PEARL is the first system that achieves strong plausible deniability
for NAND flash devices, secure against realistic multi-snapshot adversaries.

features. However, the attention mechanism lacks sufficient semantic
interactions between modalities while the other two provide fixed visual
context, which is unsuitable for modeling the observed variability when
generating translation. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose
a novel Dynamic Context-guided Capsule Network (DCCN) for MMT. Specifically, at
each timestep of decoding, we first employ the conventional source-target
attention to produce a timestep-specific source-side context vector. Next, DCCN
takes this vector as input and uses it to guide the iterative extraction of
related visual features via a context-guided dynamic routing mechanism.
Particularly, we represent the input image with global and regional visual
features, we introduce two parallel DCCNs to model multimodal context vectors
with visual features at different granularities. Finally, we obtain two
multimodal context vectors, which are fused and incorporated into the decoder
for the prediction of the target word. Experimental results on the Multi30K

the obstacle of effectively learning weakly discriminative modulation patterns.
This paper proposes a robust modulation classification method by taking
advantage of deep learning to capture the meaningful information of modulation

architecture of convolutional neural network, namely Chain-Net, is developed
with various asymmetric kernels organized in two processing flows and
associated via depth-wise concatenation and element-wise addition for
optimizing feature utilization. The network is evaluated on a big dataset of 14
challenging modulation formats, including analog and high-order digital

classifies the modulation of radio signals suffering from a synthetic channel
deterioration and further performs better than other deep networks.

find that suppressed magnetic order in bulk FeSe is associated with the
reduction of inter-orbital charge fluctuations, an effect of Hund's coupling,
enhanced by a larger crystal field splitting. Meanwhile, spatial isolation of

round in the iterative FL process to be stably executed within a large-scale

CFmMIMO, this paper proposes choosing only a subset of available users to
participate in FL. An optimal selection of users with favorable link conditions
would minimize the execution time of each communication round, while limiting
the total number of communication rounds required. Toward this end, we
formulate a joint optimization problem of user selection, transmit power, and
processing frequency, subject to a predefined minimum number of participating
users to guarantee the quality of learning. We then develop a new algorithm
that is proven to converge to the neighbourhood of the stationary points of the
formulated problem. Numerical results confirm that our proposed approach
significantly reduces the FL total execution time over baseline schemes. The
time reduction is more pronounced when the density of access point deployments
is moderately low.

this can be implemented with the formalism of constrained random fields. In the

as $n\to+\infty$. We also show that the fluctuations of the density, after
another scaling and an additional random but explicit shift, converge to a
$1$-stable random variable. Our approach uses analytic techniques and is
motivated by the connection between the properties of the branching Brownian
motion and the Bramson shift of the solutions to the Fisher-KPP equation with
some specific initial conditions initiated in \cite{BD1,BD2} and further
developed in the present paper. The proofs of the limit theorems for ${\mathcal
X}$ rely crucially on the fine asymptotics of the behavior of the Bramson shift
for the Fisher-KPP equation starting with initial conditions of ""size""
$0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, up to terms of the order $[{(\log
\varepsilon^{-1})]^{-1-\gamma}}$, with some $\gamma>0$.

compensation for the abstract linear system (A,B,C). Both the input delay and
output delay are investigated. We first propose a full state feedback control
to stabilize the system (A,B) with input delay and then design a
Luenberger-like observer for the system (A,C) in terms of the delayed output.
We formulate the delay compensation in the framework of regular linear systems.
The developed approach builds upon an upper-block-triangle transform that is
associated with a Sylvester operator equation. It is found that the
controllability/observability map of system (-A,B)/(-A,-C) happens to be the
solution of the corresponding Sylvester equation. As an immediate consequence,
both the feedback law and the state observer can be expressed explicitly in the
operator form. The exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system
and the exponential convergence of the observation error are established
without using the Lyapunov functional approach. The theoretical results are
validated through the delay compensation for a benchmark one-dimensional wave

oscillations couple electrons propagating in opposite directions and supply an
additional Coulomb energy. As the crystal switches phase, this energy acquires
time dependence and the Landau-Zener mechanism operates, steering population
transfer from the valence to the conduction band and vice versa. Spectroscopy
suggests that the oscillator energy dominates the optical properties and a
calculation involving the crystalline field and spin-orbit interaction yields
good estimates for of both structural phases. Further analysis relates the
optical gap with the crystalline-field energy as well as activation energy for
electrical conduction. This last property characterizes the amorphous phase,
thereby furnishing a link between the crystalline field and the activation
energy and ultimately with the resistance drift exponent. Providing optical
means to quantify resistance drift in PCMs could circumvent the need for

on explainable models in MIR has generally used image processing tools to
produce explanations for DNN predictions, but these are not necessarily
musically meaningful, or can be listened to (which, arguably, is important in
music). We propose audioLIME, a method based on Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), extended by a musical definition of

we want to explain. Instead of extracting components of the spectrogram using
image segmentation as part of the LIME pipeline, we propose using source
separation. The perturbations are created by switching on/off sources which
makes our explanations listenable. We first validate audioLIME on a classifier
that was deliberately trained to confuse the true target with a spurious
signal, and show that this can easily be detected using our method. We then
show that it passes a sanity check that many available explanation methods
fail. Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of our (model-agnostic)
method on a third-party music tagger.

this optical-GeV connection in four flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) by a
systematic investigation of their long term optical and $\gamma$-ray light
curves. On analysis of the four sources, namely 3C 273, 3C 279, PKS 1510$-$089

variations. We found instances when (i) the optical and GeV flux variations are
closely correlated (ii) there are optical flares without $\gamma$-ray
counterparts and (iii) $\gamma$-ray flares without optical counterparts. To
understand these diverse behaviours, we carried out broad band spectral energy
distribution (SED) modelling of the sources at different epochs using a
one-zone leptonic emission model. The optical-UV emission is found to be
dominated by emission from the accretion disk in the sources PKS 1510$-$089,
CTA 102 and 3C 273, while in 3C 279, the synchrotron radiation from the jet
dominates the optical-UV emission. Our SED analysis indicates that (i)
correlated optical and $\gamma$-ray flux variations are caused by changes in
the bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$), (ii) $\gamma$-ray flares without optical
counterparts are due to increase in $\Gamma$ and/or the electron energy density
and (iii) an optical flare without $\gamma$-ray counterpart is due to increase
in the magnetic field strength.

gapped, and in-gap valley-momentum locked helical hinge states are
topologically protected by the surface valley-Chern number. In the presence of
weak disorders, helical hinge states are robust against disorders while the
quantized conductance of the states is fragile due to the inter-valley
scattering. As disorder increases, the system undergoes a series of quantum
phase transitions: from the WSOTI to the weak first-order topological
insulator, then to a diffusive metal and finally to an Anderson insulator. Our
results thus fully establish the WSOTI phase as a genuine state of matters and

many others, have flooded on the Internet. Interconnections among these
services have resulted in a new phenomenon called ""Internet of Services"" (IoS).
By IoS,people don't need to request multiple services by themselves to fulfill
their daily requirements, but it is an IoS platform that is responsible for
constructing integrated solutions for them. Since user requirements (URs) are
usually coarse-grained and transboundary, IoS platforms have to integrate
services from multiple domains to fulfill the requirements. Considering there
are too many available services in IoS, a big challenge is how to look for a
tradeoff between the construction efficiency and the precision of final
solutions. For this challenge, we introduce a framework and a platform for
transboundary user requirement oriented solution design in IoS. The main idea
is to make use of domain priori knowledge derived from the commonness and
similarities among massive historical URs and among historical integrated
service solutions(ISSs). Priori knowledge is classified into three types:
requirement patterns (RPs), service patterns (SPs), and probabilistic matching
matrix (PMM) between RPs and SPs. A UR is modeled in the form of an intention
tree (ITree) along with a set of constraints on intention nodes, and then
optimal RPs are selected to cover the I-Tree as much as possible. By taking
advantage of the PMM, a set of SPs are filtered out and composed together to
form the final ISS. Finally, the design of a platform supporting the above
process is introduced.

classification framework for Ethereum smart contract bugs, nor detailed
criteria for detecting bugs in smart contracts, making it difficult for
developers to fully understand the negative effects of bugs and design new
approaches to detect bugs. In this paper, to fill the gap, we first collect as
many smart contract bugs as possible from multiple sources and divide these
bugs into 9 categories by extending the IEEE Standard Classification for
Software Anomalies. Then, we design the criteria for detecting each kind of
bugs, and construct a dataset of smart contracts covering all kinds of bugs.
With our framework and dataset, developers can learn smart contract bugs and
develop new tools to detect and locate bugs in smart contracts. Moreover, we
evaluate the state-of-the-art tools for smart contract analysis with our

over a p-adic field that are more stable than that of classical Gr{\""o}bner

incremental way, monomo-mial by monomial, to compute the multiplication
matrices and the change of basis matrix can not be transposed at all to the
tropical setting. We mitigate this issue by developing new linear algebra
algorithms and apply them to our new tropical FGLM algorithms. Motivations are
twofold. Firstly, to compute tropical varieties, one usually goes through the
computation of many tropical Gr{\""o}bner bases defined for varying weights (and
then varying term orders). For an ideal of dimension 0, the tropical FGLM
algorithm provides an efficient way to go from a tropical Gr{\""o}bner basis
from one weight to one for another weight. Secondly, the FGLM strategy can be
applied to go from a tropical Gr{\""o}bner basis to a classical Gr{\""o}bner

Gr{\""o}bner basis (for weight [0,. .. , 0]) with the p-adic stabilized variants
of FGLM of [RV16] to compute a lexicographical or shape position basis. All our
algorithms have been implemented into SageMath. We provide numerical examples

Neptune, and explore the upcoming opportunities available to study these
exciting planets. The ice giants are the least understood planets in the solar
system, having been only visited by a single spacecraft, in 1986 and 1989,
respectively. The upper atmosphere plays a critical role in connecting the
atmosphere to the forces and processes contained within the magnetic field. For
example, auroral current systems can drive charged particles into the
atmosphere, heating it by way of Joule heating. Ground-based observations of
H$_3^+$ provides a powerful remote diagnostic of the physical properties and
processes that occur within the upper atmosphere, and a rich data set exists
for Uranus. These observations span almost three decades and have revealed that
the upper atmosphere has continuously cooled between 1992 and 2018 at about 8
K/year, from $\sim$750 K to $\sim$500 K. The reason for this trend remain
unclear, but could be related to seasonally driven changes in the Joule heating
rates due to the tilted and offset magnetic field, or could be related to
changing vertical distributions of hydrocarbons. H$_3^+$ has not yet been
detected at Neptune, but this discovery provides low-hanging fruit for upcoming
facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the next
generation of 30 metre telescopes. Detecting H$_3^+$ at Neptune would enable
the characterisation of its upper atmosphere for the first time since 1989. To
fully understand the ice giants we need dedicated orbital missions, in the same
way the Cassini spacecraft explored Saturn. Only by combining in-situ
observations of the magnetic field with in-orbit remote sensing can we get the
complete picture of how energy moves between the atmosphere and the magnetic
field.

condition and the second one corresponds to the confining boundary conditions.
By using the expressions for the correlators, the vacuum expectation values
(VEVs) of the photon condensate and of the electric and magnetic fields squared
are investigated. As another important local characteristic of the vacuum state
we consider the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. The Casimir forces acting on
the plates are decomposed into the self-action and interaction parts. It is
shown that the interaction forces are attractive for both types of boundary
conditions. At separations between the plates larger than the curvature radius
of the background geometry they decay exponentially as functions of the proper
distance. The self-action force per unit surface of a single plate does not
depend on its location and depending on the boundary condition and on the
number of spatial dimensions can be either attractive or repulsive with respect
to the AdS boundary. By using the generalized zeta function technique we also
evaluate the total Casimir energy. Applications are given in $Z_{2}$-symmetric
braneworld models of the Randall-Sundrum type for vector fields with even and

operate in a special parameter region, close to so-called critical points,
where the collective behavior undergoes a qualitative change between different
dynamical regimes. Critical systems exhibit unique properties, which may
benefit collective information processing such as maximal responsiveness to
external stimuli. Besides neuronal and gene-regulatory networks, recent
empirical data suggests that also animal collectives may be examples of
self-organized critical systems. However, open questions about
self-organization mechanisms in animal groups remain: Evolutionary adaptation
towards a group-level optimum (group-level selection), implicitly assumed in
the ""criticality hypothesis"", appears in general not reasonable for
fission-fusion groups composed of non-related individuals. Furthermore,
previous theoretical work relies on non-spatial models, which ignore
potentially important self-organization and spatial sorting effects. Using a
generic, spatially-explicit model of schooling prey being attacked by a
predator, we show first that schools operating at criticality perform best.
However, this is not due to optimal response of the prey to the predator, as
suggested by the ""criticality hypothesis"", but rather due to the spatial
structure of the prey school at criticality. Secondly, by investigating
individual-level evolution, we show that strong spatial self-sorting effects at
the critical point lead to strong selection gradients, and make it an
evolutionary unstable state. Our results demonstrate the decisive role of
spatio-temporal phenomena in collective behavior, and that individual-level
selection is in general not a viable mechanism for self-tuning of unrelated
animal groups towards criticality.

  Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, ridesharing has become one of the most popular services offered by
online ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber and Didi Chuxing). Existing
ridesharing platforms adopt the strategy that dispatches orders over the entire
city at a uniform time interval. However, the uneven spatio-temporal order
distributions in real-world ridesharing systems indicate that such an approach
is suboptimal in practice. Thus, in this paper, we exploit adaptive dispatching
intervals to boost the platform's profit under a guarantee of the maximum
passenger waiting time. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical approach, which
generates clusters of geographical areas suitable to share the same dispatching
intervals, and then makes online decisions of selecting the appropriate time
instances for order dispatch within each spatial cluster. Technically, we prove
the impossibility of designing constant-competitive-ratio algorithms for the
online adaptive interval problem, and propose online algorithms under partial
or even zero future order knowledge that significantly improve the platform's
profit over existing approaches. We conduct extensive experiments with a
large-scale ridesharing order dataset, which contains all of the over 3.5
million ridesharing orders in Beijing, China, received by Didi Chuxing from
October 1st to October 31st, 2018. The experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed algorithms outperform existing approaches.

approaches that efficiently operate at global scale. Popularity prediction is
important for many applications, including detection of harmful viral content

views result from interactions between user interests, content features,
resharing, feed ranking, and network structure. We consider the problem of
accurately predicting popularity both at any given prediction time since a
content item's creation and for arbitrary time horizons into the future. In
order to achieve high accuracy for different prediction time horizons, it is
essential for models to use static features (of content and user) as well as
observed popularity growth up to prediction time.
  We propose a feature-based approach based on a self-excited Hawkes point
process model, which involves prediction of the content's popularity at one or
more reference horizons in tandem with a point predictor of an effective growth
parameter that reflects the timescale of popularity growth. This results in a
highly scalable method for popularity prediction over arbitrary prediction time

measure the temperature gain after absorbing a photon using superconducting

the excess energy via heat to the superconducting bulk's phonon modes. The
temperature gain can be determined by measuring the change in the zero-bias
bulk resistivity, which does not significantly affect the lattice dynamics.
Moreover, the obtained temperature gain scales discretely with the number of
absorbed photons, enabling a photon-number resolving function. Here, we will
calculate the temperature increase as a function of the number and frequency of
photons absorbed. We will also derive the timescale for the heat transfer
process from the surface electrons to the bulk phonons. We will specifically
show that the transfer processes are fast enough to ignore heat dissipation
loss.

Blaming the P-value for the naturally tentative trial-and-error process of

process cleaner and less error-prone. However tentative, the skeptical
scientists still have to form unambiguous opinions, proximately to move forward

balance will always depend on the relative costs or the trade-off between the
errors. These costs are highly context specific, varying by area of
applications or by stage of investigation. A calibrated but tunable knob, such

two orders of magnitude larger than the SPS one, but the tetraquark formation
mechanism is unknown at present. Imposing a mass window around the resonance
position we calculate the corresponding distribution in $p_{t,4c}$ -- the
potential tetraquark transverse momentum. The cross section for the $J/\psi
J/\psi$ continuum is calculated in addition, again including SPS (box diagrams)
and DPS contributions which are of similar size. The formation probability is
estimated trying to reproduce the LHCb signal-to-background ratio. The
calculation of the SPS $g g \to T_{4c}(6900)$ fusion mechanism is performed in
the $k_T$-factorization approach assuming different spin scenarios ($0^+$ and
$0^-$). The $0^+$ assignment is preferred over the $0^-$ one by the comparison
of the transverse momentum distribution of signal and background with the LHCb
preliminary data assuming the SPS mechanism dominance. There is no reliable
approach for the DPS formation mechanism of tetraquarks at present as this is a
complicated multi-body problem.

insulin monomer and dimer are characterized from molecular dynamics simulations
using validated force fields. It is found that the spectroscopy of monomeric

B24-B26 and D24-D26, which are involved in dimerization of the hormone. Also,
the spectroscopic signatures change for mutations at position B24 from
phenylalanine - which is conserved in many organisms and known to play a
central role in insulin aggregation - to alanine or glycine. Using three
different methods to determine the frequency trajectories - solving the nuclear
Schr\""odinger equation on an effective 1-dimensional potential energy curve,
instantaneous normal modes, and using parametrized frequency maps - lead to the
same overall conclusions. The spectroscopic response of monomeric WT and mutant
insulin differs from that of their respective dimers and the spectroscopy of
the two monomers in the dimer is also not identical. For the WT and F24A and
F24G monomers spectroscopic shifts are found to be $\sim 20$ cm$^{-1}$ for
residues (B24 to B26) located at the dimerization interface. Although the
crystal structure of the dimer is that of a symmetric homodimer, dynamically
the two monomers are not equivalent on the nanosecond time scale. Together with
earlier work on the thermodynamic stability of the WT and the same mutants it
is concluded that combining computational and experimental infrared

it occurs as an all or none process, so a protein, can jump directly between
folded and unfolded states. It is proposed in this manuscript that the
cooperative phenomena associated to protein folding has its origin in the
synchronization oscillating phases of the instantaneously induced dipoles that
gives rise to the van der Waals London dispersion interaction. When the
oscillation of the induced dipoles is synchronized an enhanced interaction
regime is triggered and the protein enters a into a folding process. The
propagation of this regime throughout the molecular structure complete the
folding process. If a desynchronizing strong enough perturbation is introduced
at any component cooperative network the system enters in a weakened -- or even
a repulsive -- van der Waals dispersion interaction regime that propagate
itself throughout the structure, that triggers a phase transition that finally
unfolds the protein.

numerically using spectral methods in large domains in four different flow
scenarios (plane Couette, plane Poiseuille, Couette-Poiseuille and a sinusoidal

possible or not desirable. In this review, we focus on the first case and
present latest SSI research aimed at providing new alternative and augmentative
communication methods for persons with severe speech disorders. SSIs can employ
a variety of biosignals to enable silent communication, such as
electrophysiological recordings of neural activity, electromyographic (EMG)
recordings of vocal tract movements or the direct tracking of articulator
movements using imaging techniques. Depending on the disorder, some sensing
techniques may be better suited than others to capture speech-related
information. For instance, EMG and imaging techniques are well suited for
laryngectomised patients, whose vocal tract remains almost intact but are
unable to speak after the removal of the vocal folds, but fail for severely
paralysed individuals. From the biosignals, SSIs decode the intended message,
using automatic speech recognition or speech synthesis algorithms. Despite
considerable advances in recent years, most present-day SSIs have only been
validated in laboratory settings for healthy users. Thus, as discussed in this
paper, a number of challenges remain to be addressed in future research before
SSIs can be promoted to real-world applications. If these issues can be
addressed successfully, future SSIs will improve the lives of persons with
severe speech impairments by restoring their communication capabilities.

feature of belonging to the giant component. However, when dealing with

node to belong to the network's backbone, where the flow of information and of
other physical quantities (such as current) occurs. Here we study percolation
in a model of interdependent resistor networks and show the effect of
spatiality on their coupled functioning. We do this on a realistic model of
spatial networks, featuring a Poisson distribution of link-lengths. We find
that interdependent resistor networks are significantly more vulnerable than
their percolation-based counterparts, featuring first-order phase transitions
at link-lengths where the mutual giant component still emerges continuously. We
explain this apparent contradiction by tracing the origin of the increased
vulnerability of interdependent transport to the crucial role played by the
dandling ends. Moreover, we interpret these differences by considering an
heterogeneous $k$-core percolation process which enables to define a
one-parameter family of functionality criteria whose constraints become more
and more stringent. Our results highlight the importance that different
definitions of nodes functionality have on the collective properties of coupled
processes, and provide better understanding of the problem of interdependent

by a pair of symmetrically-detuned phase-locked pulses. The promise of
dichromatic excitation is to spectrally isolate the excitation laser from the

Paradoxically, we find that excitation is not possible without spectral overlap
between the exciting pulse and the quantum emitter transition for ideal
two-level systems due to cancellation of the accumulated pulse area. However,
any additional interactions that interfere with cancellation of the accumulated
pulse area may lead to a finite stationary population inversion. Our
spectroscopic results of a solid-state two-level system show that while
coupling to lattice vibrations helps to improve the inversion efficiency up to
50\% under symmetric driving, coherent population control and a larger amount
of inversion are possible using asymmetric dichromatic excitation, which we
achieve by adjusting the ratio of the intensities between the red and
blue-detuned pulses. Our measured results, supported by simulations using a
real-time path-integral method, offer a new perspective towards realising

focussing in particular on the rotating black hole geometry sourced by a
rotating draining vortex flow. Using this analogy, we verify for the first time
that three effects predicted to occur around rotating black holes also occur in

whereby waves extract rotational energy from the system, quasi-normal ringing,
describing the relaxation of the system toward equilibrium, and the
backreaction, which mediates the exchange of energy between fluctuations and

colours, masses) of their hosts. On average, those normal SNe Ia that are in
galaxies from the Red Sequence (early-type, massive, old hosts) have faster
declining LCs in comparison with those from the Blue Cloud (late-type, less
massive, younger hosts) of the colour-mass diagram. The observed correlations
between the $\Delta m_{15}$ of normal SNe Ia and hosts' parameters appear to be
due to the superposition of at least two distinct populations of faster and
slower declining normal SNe Ia from older and younger stellar components. We
show, for the first time, that the $\Delta m_{15}$ of 91bg- and 91T-like SNe is
independent of host morphology and colour. The distribution of hosts on the

globally red/old galaxies while 91T-like events prefer blue/younger hosts. On
average, the youngest global ages of 02cx-like SNe hosts and their positions in
the colour-mass diagram hint that these events likely originate from young

flexible dosing regimen is compared to placebo, we evaluate how switchers in
the treatment arm (i.e., patients who were switched to the higher dose) would
have fared had they been kept on the low dose. This in order to understand
whether flexible dosing is potentially beneficial for them. Simply comparing
these patients' responses with those of patients who stayed on the low dose is
unsatisfactory because the latter patients are usually in a better health
condition. Because the available information in the considered trial is too
scarce to enable a reliable adjustment, we will instead transport data from a
fixed dosing trial that has been conducted concurrently on the same target,
albeit not in an identical patient population. In particular, we will propose
an estimator which relies on an outcome model and a propensity score model for
the association between study and patient characteristics. The proposed
estimator is asymptotically unbiased if at least one of both models is
correctly specified, and efficient (under the model defined by the restrictions
on the propensity score) when both models are correctly specified. We show that
the proposed method for using results from an external study is generically
applicable in studies where a classical confounding adjustment is not possible

deterministic manner). Monte Carlo simulations and application to the

mode, namely iteratively trained on a fixed-size window of training data. Such
batch mode training of deep learning models suffers from low training
efficiency, which may lead to performance degradation when the model is not
produced on time. To tackle this issue, incremental learning is proposed and
has received much attention recently. Incremental learning has great potential
in recommender systems, as two consecutive window of training data overlap most
of the volume. It aims to update the model incrementally with only the newly
incoming samples from the timestamp when the model is updated last time, which
is much more efficient than the batch mode training. However, most of the
incremental learning methods focus on the research area of image recognition
where new tasks or classes are learned over time. In this work, we introduce a
practical incremental method to train deep CTR models, which consists of three
decoupled modules (namely, data, feature and model module). Our method can
achieve comparable performance to the conventional batch mode training with
much better training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on a public
benchmark and a private dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our

asymptotic stability for a class of Lagrangian systems in environments with
obstacles. Rather than performing trajectory planning and implementing a
trajectory-tracking feedback control law, our approach requires a sequence of
locations in the environment (a path plan) and an abstraction of the
obstacle-free space. The problem of following a path plan is then interpreted
as a sequence of reach-avoid problems: the system is required to consecutively
reach each location of the path plan while staying within safe regions.
Obstacle-free ellipsoids are used as a way of defining such safe regions, each
of which encloses two consecutive locations. Feasible Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) are created directly from geometric constraints, the ellipsoids,
ensuring forward-invariance, and therefore safety. Reachability to each
location is guaranteed by asymptotically stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions
(CLFs). Both CBFs and CLFs are then encoded into quadratic programs (QPs)
without the need of relaxation variables. Furthermore, we also propose a
switching mechanism that guarantees the control law is correct and well-defined
even when transitioning between QPs. Simulations show the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in two complex scenarios.

Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global precipitation in general and the
Indian summer monsoon (IM) in particular in the Max Planck Institute Grand
Ensemble. The forced response of the teleconnection is defined as the
time-dependence of a correlation coefficient evaluated over the ensemble. The
ensemble-wise variability is taken either wrt. spatial averages or dominant
spatial modes in the sense of Maximal Covariance Analysis or Canonical
Correlation Analysis or EOF analysis. We find that the strengthening of the
ENSO-IM teleconnection is robustly or consistently featured in view of all four
teleconnection representations, whether sea surface temperature (SST) or sea
level pressure (SLP) is used to characterise ENSO, and both in the historical
period and under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario. The main contributor to this
strengthening in terms of a linear regression model is the regression
coefficient, which can outcompete even a declining ENSO variability in view of
using the SLP. We also find that the forced change of the teleconnection is
typically nonlinear by (1) formally rejecting the hypothesis that ergodicity
holds, i.e., that expected values of temporal correlation coefficients with
respect to the ensemble equal the ensemble-wise correlation coefficient itself,
and also showing that (2) the trivial contributions of the forced changes of
e.g. the mean SST and/or precipitation to temporal correlations are
insignificant here. We also provide, in terms of the test statistics, global
maps of the degree of nonlinearity/nonergodicity of the forced change of the
teleconnection between local precipitation and ENSO.

We also generalise Bestvina's construction to obtain a polyhedral complex
equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the standard development of the lowest
possible dimension.
  As applications, for a group acting chamber transitively on a building of
type $(W,S)$, we show that its Bredon cohomological dimension is equal to the
virtual cohomological dimension of $W$ and give a realisation of the building
of the lowest possible dimension.
  We introduce the notion of a reflection-like action, and use it to give a new
family of counterexamples to the strong form of Brown's conjecture on the
equality of virtual cohomological dimension and Bredon cohomological dimension
for proper actions.
  We show that the fundamental group $G$ of a simple complex of groups acts on
a tree with stabilisers generating a family of subgroups $\mathcal{F}$ if and
only if its Bredon cohomological dimension with respect to $\mathcal{F}$ is at
most one. This confirms a folklore conjecture under the assumption that a model
for the classifying space $E_{\mathcal{F}}G$ of $G$ for the family
$\mathcal{F}$ has a strict fundamental domain.
  In order to handle complexes of groups arising from arbitrary group actions,
we define a number of combinatorial invariants such as the block poset, which
may be of independent interest. We also derive a general formula for Bredon
cohomological dimension for a group $G$ admitting a cocompact model for
$E_{\mathcal{F}}G$. As a consequence of both, we obtain a simple formula for
proper cohomological dimension of $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ groups whose actions admit

Galactic cosmic ray modulation would have been even more severe. More

among them is not always a trivial task. This work presents a comparison of the
performance of a priori and a posteriori proper generalised decomposition (PGD)
algorithms for an incompressible Stokes flow problem in a geometrically
parametrised domain. This problem is particularly challenging as the geometric
parameters affect both the solution manifold and the computational spatial
domain. The difficulty is further increased because multiple geometric
parameters are considered and extended ranges of values are analysed for the
parameters and this leads to significant variations in the flow features. Using
a set of numerical experiments involving geometrically parametrised
microswimmers, the two PGD algorithms are extensively compared in terms of
their accuracy and their computational cost, expressed as a function of the
number of full-order solves required.

BOSS-EUVLG1 is a compact (reff = 1.2 kpc), young (4-5 Myr) starburst with a
stellar mass log(M*/Msun) = 10.0 +/- 0.1 and a prodigious star formation rate
of ~1000 Msun yr-1. However, it is metal- and dust-poor (12+log(O/H) = 8.13 +/-

represent the very initial phases in the evolution of massive quiescent

  Spectroscopy",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing technique for blind source
separation (BSS) of nonnegative and overlapped data. For Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), the classical method of Naanaa and Nuzillard (NN)
requires the condition that source signals to be non-overlapping at certain
locations while they are allowed to overlap with each other elsewhere. NN's
method works well with data signals that possess stand alone peaks (SAP). The
SAP does not hold completely for realistic NMR spectra however. Violation of
SAP often introduces errors or artifacts in the NN's separation results. To
address this issue, a preprocessing technique is developed here based on
Lorentzian peak shapes and weighted peak sharpening. The idea is to superimpose
the original peak signal with its weighted negative second order derivative.
The resulting sharpened (narrower and taller) peaks enable NN's method to work
with a more relaxed SAP condition, the so called dominant peaks condition
(DPS), and deliver improved results. To achieve an optimal sharpening while
preserving the data nonnegativity, we prove the existence of an upper bound of
the weight parameter and propose a selection criterion. Numerical experiments
on NMR spectroscopy data show satisfactory performance of our proposed method.

process of energy and momentum hydrodynamization, and for this reason can be
used to greatly improve our understanding of fundamental aspects of the jet/QGP
interaction. In this work we study jet suppression from small to very large
radius, for low and very high energy jets at the LHC and RHIC. We use the
hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet quenching that combines perturbative
shower evolution with an effective strongly coupled description of the energy
and momentum transfer from the jet into the QGP. Because of energy-momentum
conservation, the wake created by the jet enhances or depletes the yield of
particles generated at the freeze-out hypersurface depending on their
orientation with respect to the direction of the jet. We find that jet
suppression is remarkably independent of the anti-$k_T$ radius R, specially at
LHC, first slightly increasing by opening R, then at larger values of R slowly
decreasing. This nearly independence of jet suppression with R arises from two
competing effects, namely the larger energy loss of the energetic jet
components, which tends to increase suppression, against the partial recovery
of the lost energy due to medium response, which reduces suppression. We find
that the boosted medium from the recoiling jet depletes the amount of QGP in
the direction opposite to it in the transverse plane, inducing energy loss due
to an over-subtraction effect. We show that this unique signature of the
hydrodynamization of part of the jet energy can be scrutinized by selecting
samples of dijet configurations with different relative rapidities between the
leading and the subleading jet.

vertical displacement is allowed. Numerical simulations suggest that this
deformation is likely to remain substantially homogeneous throughout the
specimen for moderate deformations. It is therefore further proposed that such
tests can be modelled adequately as a homogenous deformation consisting of a
triaxial stretch accompanied by a simple shear. Thus the proposed test should
be a viable alternative to the standard biaxial tests currently used as
material characterisation tests for transversely isotropic materials in general
and, in particular, for soft, biological tissue. A consequence of the analysis
is a kinematical universal relation for off-axis testing that results when the
strain-energy function is assumed to be a function of only one isotropic and
one anisotropic invariant, as is typically the case. The universal relation
provides a simple test of this assumption, which is usually made for
mathematical convenience. Numerical simulations also suggest that this

that at least three invariants are necessary to fully capture the mechanical

the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attack, or one of its derivatives, could break

to handle such complexity. However, in this paper, we propose a
neural-network-guided SAT attack (NNgSAT), in which we examine the capability
and effectiveness of a message-passing neural network (MPNN) for solving these
complex structures (SAT-hard instances). In NNgSAT, after being trained as a

the neural network is used to guide/help the actual SAT solver for finding the

understanding of the fundamental pillars of quantum field theory and the
$S$-matrix theory. We observe that positivity violation at scales of 1--10 TeV
can potentially be probed at future lepton colliders even if one assumes that
dimension-6 operators are also present. Second, the positive nature of the
dimension-8 parameter space often allows us to either directly infer the
existence of UV-scale particles together with their quantum numbers or exclude
them up to certain scales in a model-independent way. In particular,
dimension-8 positivity plays an important role in the test of the Standard
Model. If no deviations from the Standard Model are observed, it allows for
simultaneous exclusion limits on all kinds of potential UV-complete models.
Unlike the dimension-6 case, these limits apply regardless of the UV model
setup and cannot be removed by possible cancellations among various UV
contributions. This thus consists of a novel and universal test to confirm the
Standard Model. We demonstrate with realistic examples how all the previously

of two-photon transitions can be recorded directly in the bulk of solids and
read out with standard angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy. The phase of
the RABBIT beating in the photoelectron spectra coming from the bulk of solids
is sensitive to the relative phase of the Berry connection between bands and it
experiences a shift of $\pi$ as one of the quantum paths crosses a band. For
resonant interband transitions, the amplitude of the RABBIT oscillation decays
as the pump and probe pulses are separated in time due to electronic
decoherence, providing a simple interferometric method to extract dephasing
times.

Finite Element numerical experiments as being perfectly incompressible because
of the numerical difficulties associated with globally satisfying this
constraint. Most commercial Finite Element packages therefore assume that the
material is slightly compressible. It is then further assumed that the
corresponding strain-energy function can be decomposed additively into
volumetric and deviatoric parts. We show that this decomposition is not
physically realistic, especially for anisotropic materials, which are of
particular interest for simulating the mechanical response of biological soft
tissue. The most striking illustration of the shortcoming is that with this
decomposition, an anisotropic cube under hydrostatic tension deforms into
another cube instead of a hexahedron with non-parallel faces. Furthermore,
commercial numerical codes require the specification of a `compressibility
parameter' (or `penalty factor'), which arises naturally from the flawed
additive decomposition of the strain-energy function. This parameter is often
linked to a `bulk modulus', although this notion makes no sense for anisotropic
solids; we show that it is essentially an arbitrary parameter and that
infinitesimal changes to it result in significant changes in the predicted
stress response. This is illustrated with numerical simulations for biaxial
tension experiments of arteries, where the magnitude of the stress response is
found to change by several orders of magnitude when infinitesimal changes in
`Poisson's ratio' close to the perfect incompressibility limit of 1/2 are made.

numerous exciting effects that can be referred to as magneto-chiral effects,
which do not originate from the intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction or
surface-induced anisotropies. The origin of these chiral effects is the
isotropic exchange or the dipole-dipole interaction present in all magnetic
materials but renormalized by the curvature. Here, we demonstrate
experimentally that curvature induced effects originating from the
dipole-dipole interaction are directly observable by measuring spin-wave
propagation in magnetic nanotubes with hexagonal cross section using time
resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. We show that the dispersion
relation is asymmetric upon reversal of the wave vector when the propagation
direction is perpendicular to the static magnetization. Therefore
counter-propagating spin waves of the same frequency exhibit different
wavelenghts. Hexagonal nanotubes have a complex dispersion, resulting from
spin-wave modes localised to the flat facets or to the extremely curved regions
between the facets. The dispersion relations obtained experimentally and from
micromagnetic simulations are in good agreement. %The asymmetric spin-wave
transport is present for all modes, promoting hexagonal nanotubes for magnonic
applications. These results show that spin-wave transport is possible in 3D,
and that the dipole-dipole induced magneto-chiral effects are significant.

reported a dichotomy in the eccentricity distribution displayed by systems
where a single planet transits compared with that displayed by the multi-planet
systems. Using $N$-body simulations, we examine the hypothesis that this
dichotomy has arisen because inner systems of super-Earths are frequently
accompanied by outer systems of giant planets that can become dynamically
unstable and perturb the inner systems. Our initial conditions are constructed
using a subset of the known Kepler five-planet systems as templates for the
inner systems, and systems of outer giant planets with masses between those of
Neptune and Saturn that are centred on orbital radii $2 \le a_{\rm p} \le 10$
au. The parameters of the outer systems are chosen so that they are always
below an assumed radial velocity detection threshold of 3 ms$^{-1}$. The
results show an inverse relation between the mean eccentricities and the
multiplicites of the systems. Performing synthetic transit observation of the
final systems reveals dichotomies in both the eccentricity and multiplicity
distributions that are close to being in agreement with the Kepler data. Hence,
understanding the observed orbital and physical properties of the compact
systems of super-Earths discovered by Kepler may require holistic modelling
that couples the dynamics of both inner and outer systems of planets during and

into a pseudo-linear problem by transforming the non-linear vehicle equations
to be expressed in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form. An scheme composed by
a nominal controller and a corrective local controller is propossed. First, the
local controller is designed as a polytopic LPV-H$_{\infty}$ controller able to
reject external disturbances. Moreover, a finite number of accurate reachable
sets, also called tube, are computed online using zonotopes taking into account
the system dynamics, the local controller and the diturbance-uncertainty bounds
considered. Second, the nominal controller is designed as an MPC where the LPV
vehicle model is used to speed up the computational time while keeping accurate
vehicle representation. Employing reachability theory with zonotopes, the MPC
changes online its state and input constraints to ensure robust feasibility and
stability under exhogenous disturbances. Finally, we test the presented scheme
and compare the local controller performance against the LQR design as state of

properties: steel, polytetrafluorethylen (PTFE), polyoxymethylen (POM), or
rubber. The corresponding terminal Reynolds numbers range from 333 to 4012,
covering in principle the transitional and Newton regime for drag forces. For
collision studies, the Stokes number just before impact is also relevant, and
lies in the range 50 < St < 2250. The settling curves obtained experimentally
are compared with numerical and analytical solutions. The latter has been
derived on the basis of nominal terminal velocity and relaxation time for the
Stokes and Newton regimes. A deviation between experimental results and
analytical solution was observed in all cases where the terminal Reynolds
number is larger than 300 and smaller than 1100. In this flow regime, the
settling process of the spheres is already affected at a long distance from the
impact object, leading to an early but significant deceleration. Moreover, a
reduced settling velocity was observed along the whole trajectory for the PTFE
particles with the lowest terminal Reynolds number. All processed datasets are
available via the Mendeley Data repository. Two additional effects have been
observed during this study. First, a bright region was detected around all PTFE
spheres. It finally was found to be due to total light reflection around the
sphere, but, to the best of our knowledge, this peculiarity has never been
reported before. Being purely optical, this does not effect the settling
behavior for PTFE. On the other hand, partial absorption of liquid at the
particle surface was observed for rubber, leading to a reduced sedimentation
velocity.

(spoof) the estimation process and disable accurate localization. We propose a
low-complex solution based on clustering and weighted central mass to detect
attackers, using only the bare minimum of reference points, after which we
solve the localization problem by a bisection procedure. The proposed method is
studied from both localization accuracy and success in attacker detection point
of views, where closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the
probability of attacker detection are derived. Its performance is validated
through computer simulations, which corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

between environmental pollution and economic growth. Current analyses
frequently employ models which restrict nonlinearities in the data to be
explained by the economic growth variable only. We propose a Generalized
Cointegrating Polynomial Regression (GCPR) to allow for an alternative source
of nonlinearity. More specifically, the GCPR is a seemingly unrelated
regression with (1) integer powers of deterministic and stochastic trends for
the individual units, and (2) a common flexible global trend. We estimate this
GCPR by nonlinear least squares and derive its asymptotic distribution.
Endogeneity of the regressors will introduce nuisance parameters into the
limiting distribution but a simulation-based approach nevertheless enables us
to conduct valid inference. A multivariate subsampling KPSS test is proposed to
verify the correct specification of the cointegrating relation. Our simulation
study shows good performance of the simulated inference approach and
subsampling KPSS test. We illustrate the GCPR approach using data for Austria,
Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK. A single global
trend accurately captures all nonlinearities leading to a linear cointegrating
relation between GDP and CO2 for all countries. This suggests that the
environmental improvement of the last years is due to economic factors
different from GDP.

of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump
administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats,
Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information
framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for
open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term ""Chinese virus""
increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants,
conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more,

perturbations, and normally the perturbation phase is unknown. Therefore, the
instability growth rate is discussed in fluids and plasmas. However, if the
perturbation phase is known, the instability growth can be controlled by a
superimposition of perturbations imposed actively. For instance, a perturbed
driver induces a perturbation to fluids or plasmas; if the perturbation induced
by the perturbed driver is oscillated actively by the driver oscillation, the
perturbation phase is known and the perturbation amplitude can be controlled,
like a feedforward control. The application result shown in this paper
demonstrates that the dynamic mitigation mechanism works well to smooth the
non-uniformities and mitigate the instabilities in plasmas.

frequent motifs, but also extremely rare ones. For instance, on one graph we
accurately count nearly $10.000$ distinct $8$-node motifs whose relative
frequency is so small that uniform sampling would literally take centuries to
find them. Our results show that color coding is still the most promising

With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to
the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening
of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction).
However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT
images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most
importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some
literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular
manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival
hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four
months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the
consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method
of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras,
could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with very high accuracy.
We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the triage
management or the clinical diagnosis. To further evaluate our algorithm and
approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai public health clinic center of
Fudan University, we conduct a study of analyzing the eye-region images of 303
patients (104 COVID-19, 131 pulmonary, and 68 ocular patients), as well as 136
healthy people. Remarkably, our results of COVID-19 patients in testing set
consistently present similar ocular pathological symbols; and very high testing
results have been achieved in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We hope
this study can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches in this
topic.

have discussed the energetics of radio galaxy lobes, but assuming thermal SZ
effect, coming from the non-thermal electron population. We use an improved
evolutionary model for radio galaxy lobes to estimate the observed parameters
such as the radio luminosity and intensity of SZ-distortions at the redshifts
of observation. We, further, quantify the effects of various relevant physical
parameters of the radio galaxies, such as the jet power, the time scale over
which the jet is active, the evolutionary time scale for the lobe, etc on the
observed parameters. For current SZ observations towards galaxy clusters, we
find that the non-thermal SZ distortions from radio lobes embedded in galaxy
clusters can be non-negligible compared to the amount of thermal SZ distortion
from the intra-cluster medium and, hence, can not be neglected. We show that
small and young (and preferably residing in a cluster environment) radio
galaxies offer better prospects for the detection of the non-thermal SZ signal
from these sources. We further discuss the limits on different physical
parameters for some sources for which SZ effect has been either detected or
upper limits are available. The evolutionary models enable us to obtain limits,
previously unavailable, on the low energy cut-off of electron spectrum
($p_{min} \sim 1\hbox{--}2$) in order to explain the recent non-thermal SZ

based on so-called averaged-forward-backward-differencing (AFB) is shown to

equivalent to the ""rotated scheme"" (R) of Willot (2015) in the context of TD.

general validity and applicability of evaluation concepts, these scaling
considerations are detailed for ideally brittle, semi brittle and micro ductile
crack propagation, subject to both monotonic and cyclic loading. Special

pre-training process on large unlabeled text corpora and subsequently
fine-tuned for specific tasks. Although considerable work has been devoted to

understood how a model's attention mechanisms change when trained for a target
NLP task. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to

visualization, Attention Flows, is designed to support users in querying,
tracing, and comparing attention within layers, across layers, and amongst
attention heads in Transformer-based language models. To help users gain
insight on how a classification decision is made, our design is centered on
depicting classification-based attention at the deepest layer and how attention
from prior layers flows throughout words in the input. Attention Flows supports
the analysis of a single model, as well as the visual comparison between
pre-trained and fine-tuned models via their similarities and differences. We
use Attention Flows to study attention mechanisms in various sentence

of solving these tasks.

depend on polarities resulting in short ranged repulsion involving one or more
inertial bodies and a new class of bound state based on this interaction. Both
effects are new to the literature, found so far. Experimental results are
generalized and reported qualitatively. Working principles of these effects are
provided within classical mechanics and found consistent with observations and
simulations. The effects are based on the interaction of a rigid and finite
inertial body (an object having mass and moment of inertia) endowed with a
magnetic moment with a cyclic inhomogeneous magnetic field which does not
require to have a local minimum. Such a body having some degrees of freedom
involved in driven harmonic motion by this interaction can experience a net
force in the direction of the weak field regardless of its position and
orientation or can find stable equilibrium with the field itself autonomously.
The former is called polarity free magnetic repulsion and the latter magnetic
bound state. Experiments show that a bound state can be obtained between two
free bodies having magnetic dipole moment. Various schemes of trapping bodies
having magnetic moments by rotating fields are realized as well as rotating
bodies trapped by a static dipole field in presence of gravity. Also, a special
case of bound state called bipolar bound state between free dipole bodies is
investigated.

at pressures and temperatures of the order of critical point values. These
waves behave precisely opposite to the classical non-linear waves, with
inverted classical waves like the expansion shocks which do not violate entropy
conditions. More complex equation of state (EOS) other than the ideal or
perfect EOS is typically used in describing dense gases. Algorithm development
with non-ideal/real gas EOS and application to dense gasses is gaining
importance from a numerical perspective. Extending the algorithms designed for
perfect gas EOS to dense gas flows with arbitrary real gas EOS is non-trivial.
Most of the algorithms designed for prefect gas EOS are modified significantly
when applied to real gas EOS. These algorithms can become complicated and some
times impossible based on the EOS under consideration. The objective of the
present work is to develop central solvers with smart diffusion capabilities
independent of the eigenstructure and extendable to any arbitrary EOS. Euler
equations with van der Waals EOS along with two newly developed algorithms,
Method of Optimal Viscosity for Enhanced resolution of shocks (MOVERS+) and
Riemann Invariants based Contact capturing Algorithm (RICCA), are used to
simulate dense gasses over simple geometries. Various One Dimensional (1D) and
Two Dimensional (2D) benchmark test cases are validated using these algorithms,
and the results are compared with the those obtained from the literature.

from transmission of viral loads through exhalation and inhalation of
respiratory droplets. Therefore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic the usage
of face masks is strongly recommended by health officials. Although three-layer
masks are generally advised for usage, many commonly available or homemade
masks contain only single and double layers. In this study, we show through
detailed physics based analyses and high speed imaging that high momentum cough
droplets on impingement on single- and double-layer masks can lead to
significant partial penetration and more importantly atomization into numerous
much smaller daughter droplets, thereby increasing the total population of the
aerosol, which can remain suspended for a longer time. The possibility of
secondary atomization of high momentum cough droplets due to impingement,
hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous
network of the mask has not been explored before. However, this unique mode of
aerosol generation poses a finite risk of infection as shown in this work. We
also demonstrate that in single layer masks close to 70 % of a given droplet
volume is atomized and only 30 % is trapped within the fibers. The entrapped
volume is close to 90 % for double layer masks which still allows some
atomization into smaller droplets. We however found that a triple-layer
surgical mask permits negligible penetration and hence should be effective in
preventing disease transmission.
