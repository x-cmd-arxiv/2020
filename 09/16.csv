recent discovery of stellar systems that stand out in terms of their
energy-angular momentum space, such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. In particular,
it is still unclear how these groups are linked and to what extent they are
well-mixed.
  Aims: We investigate the similarities and differences in the properties
between the prograde and retrograde (counter-rotating) stars and set those
results in context by using the properties of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,
Thamnos/Sequoia, and other suggested accreted populations.
  Methods: We used the stellar metallicities of the major large spectroscopic
surveys (APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE) in combination with
astrometric and photometric data from Gaia's second data-release. We
investigated the presence of radial and vertical metallicity gradients as well
as the possible correlations between the azimuthal velocity, $v_\phi,$ and
metallicity, [M/H], as qualitative indicators of the presence of mixed
populations.
  Results: We find that a handful of super metal-rich stars exist on retrograde
orbits at various distances from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane. We
also find that the counter-rotating stars appear to be a well-mixed population,
exhibiting radial and vertical metallicity gradients on the order of $\sim$
-0.04 dex/kpc and -0.06 dex/kpc, respectively, with little (if any) variation
when different regions of the Galaxy are probed. The prograde stars show a
$v_\phi$-[M/H] relation that flattens -- and, perhaps, even reverses as a
function of distance from the plane. Retrograde samples selected to roughly
probe Thamnos and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage appear to be different populations yet
they also appear to be quite linked, as they follow the same trend in terms of
the eccentricity versus metallicity space.

factorization. The transverse polarization is contributed by the convolution of
the transversely polarizing fragmentation function~(PFF) $D_{1T}^\perp$ of the
lambda hyperon and the unpolarized fragmentation function $D_1$ of pion/kaon.
We adopt the spectator diquark model result for $D_{1T}^{\perp}$ to numerically
estimate the transverse polarization in $e^+e^-\to\Lambda^\uparrow h X$ process
at the kinematical region of Belle Collaboration. To implement the TMD
evolution formalism of the fragmentation functions, we apply two different
parametrizations on the nonperturbative Sudakov form factors associated with
the fragmentation functions of the $\Lambda$, pion and kaon. It is found that
our prediction on the polarization in the $\Lambda \pi^+$ production and
$\bar{\Lambda} \pi^-$ is consistent with the recent Belle measurement in size
and sign, while the model predictions on the polarizations in $\Lambda\pi^-$
and $\Lambda K^\pm$ productions show strong disagreement with the Belle data.
The reason for the discrepancies is discussed and possible approaches to
improve the calculation in the future are also discussed.

Detecting hierarchical community structure introduces additional challenges

theoretical study on hierarchical community structure in networks, which has
thus far not received the same rigorous attention. We address the following
questions: 1) How should we define a hierarchy of communities? 2) How do we
determine if there is sufficient evidence of a hierarchical structure in a

approach these questions by introducing a definition of hierarchy based on the

probabilistic models, such as the popular stochastic block model. We enumerate
the challenges involved in detecting hierarchies and, by studying the spectral
properties of hierarchical structure, present an efficient and principled
method for detecting them.

experimentally validate a three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer model of the

In the past several decades, EL has typically been done by rule-based systems

which heavily depend on manual human inputs. With the ever-increasing growth of
new data, deep learning (DL) based approaches have been proposed to alleviate
the high cost of EL associated with the traditional models. Existing
exploration of DL models for EL strictly follows the well-known twin-network
architecture. However, we argue that the twin-network architecture is
sub-optimal to EL, leading to inherent drawbacks of existing models. In order
to address the drawbacks, we propose a novel and generic contrastive DL
framework for EL. The proposed framework is able to capture both syntactic and
semantic matching signals and pays attention to subtle but critical
differences. Based on the framework, we develop a contrastive DL approach for
EL, called CorDEL, with three powerful variants. We evaluate CorDEL with
extensive experiments conducted on both public benchmark datasets and a
real-world dataset. CorDEL outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 5.2%
on public benchmark datasets. Moreover, CorDEL yields a 2.4% improvement over
the current best DL model on the real-world dataset, while reducing the number

the space of harmonic functions for an extension of the classical transfer
operator. We accomplish this by extending the classical Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius
theory to the realm of low regular potentials. This is done by establishing
finer properties of the associated conformal measures and thoroughly developing
a method to obtain information on the maximal eigenspace of a suitably
constructed family of Markov Processes. Our results are valid in the setting of
finite and infinite alphabets. Several new applications are given to illustrate
the theory. For example, we determine the support of a large class of
equilibrium states associated with low regular potentials, including ones
allowing phase transition. Additionally, we prove a version of the Functional
Central Limit Theorem for equilibrium states. A remarkable aspect of this
result is that it does not require the spectral gap property of the associated

set functions as equilibrium states and the possibility to replace the metric
entropy by an upper semi-continuous map associated to a general variational
principle. More precisely, using methods from Convex Analysis, we construct for
each generalized convex pressure function an upper semi-continuous entropy-like
map (which, in the context of continuous transformations acting on a compact
metric space and the topological pressure, turns out to be the upper
semi-continuous envelope of the Kolmogorov-Sinai metric entropy), then
establish a new abstract variational principle and prove that equilibrium
states, possibly finitely additive, always exist. This conceptual approach
provides a new insight on dynamical systems without a measure with maximal
entropy, prompts the study of finitely additive ground states for non-uniformly
hyperbolic maps and grants the existence of finitely additive Lyapunov
equilibrium states for singular value potentials generated by linear cocycles
over continuous maps. We further investigate several applications, including a
new thermodynamic formalism for systems driven by finitely generated semigroup
or countable sofic group actions. On the final pages of the manuscript we
provide a list of open problems in a wide range of topics suggested by our main

dynamic changes happening in the environment in real-time. One important aspect
in such scenarios is to continually learn to recognize newer object categories
when they become available. This combines two main research problems namely
continual learning and 3D object recognition. Most of the existing research
approaches include the use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
focusing on image datasets. A modified approach might be needed for continually
learning 3D object categories. A major concern in using CNNs is the problem of
catastrophic forgetting when a model tries to learn a new task. Despite various
proposed solutions to mitigate this problem, there still exist some downsides
of such solutions, e.g., computational complexity, especially when learning
substantial number of tasks. These downsides can pose major problems in robotic
scenarios where real-time response plays an essential role. Towards addressing
this challenge, we propose a new deep transfer learning approach based on a
dynamic architectural method to make robots capable of open-ended learning
about new 3D object categories. Furthermore, we make sure that the mentioned
downsides are minimized to a great extent. Experimental results showed that the
proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches with regards to
accuracy and also substantially minimizes computational overhead.

from volumetric datasets such as 3D image data from computed tomography (CT).
The method is based on a new statistical model for the distribution of voxel
intensities and gradient magnitudes, incorporating prior knowledge about the
physical nature of the imaging process. It allows for direct quantification of
parameters of the imaged sample like volume fractions, interface areas and
material density, and parameters related to the imaging process like image
resolution and noise levels.
  Existing methods for characterization from 3D images often require
segmentation of the data, a procedure where each voxel is labeled according to
the best guess of which material it represents. Through our approach, the
segmentation step is circumvented so that errors and computational costs
related to this part of the image processing pipeline are avoided. Instead, the
material parameters are quantified through their known relation to parameters
of our model which is fitted directly to the raw, unsegmented data. We present
an automated model fitting procedure that gives reproducible results without
human bias and enables automatic analysis of large sets of tomograms.
  For more complex structure analysis questions, a segmentation is still
beneficial. We show that our model can be used as input to existing
probabilistic methods, providing a segmentation that is based on the physics of
the imaged sample. Because our model accounts for mixed-material voxels
stemming from blurring inherent to the imaging technique, we reduce the errors
that other methods can create at interfaces between materials.

the absence of a physical surface in the latter. For this reason, any remaining

horizon. In the case of an NS, on the contrary, accreting material is
decelerated on the NS surface, and its kinetic energy is eventually radiated
away. Copious soft photons produced by the NS surface will affect the
properties of the Comptonised component dominating spectra of X-ray binaries in
the hard state. Thus, parameters of the Comptonised spectra -- the electron
temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ and the Compton $y$-parameter, could serve as an
important tool for distinguishing BHs from NSs. In this paper, we
systematically analyse heretofore the largest sample of spectra from the BH and
NS X-ray binaries in the hard state for this purpose, using archival RXTE/PCA
and RXTE/HEXTE observations. We find that the BHs and NSs occupy distinctly
different regions in the $y-kT_{\rm e}$ plane with NSs being characterised by
systematically lower values of $y$-parameter and electron temperature. Due to
the shape of the boundary between BHs and NSs on the $y-kT_{\rm e}$ plane,
their one-dimensional $y$ and $kT_{\rm e}$ distributions have some overlap. A
cleaner one parameter diagnostic of the nature of the compact object in X-ray

notion of a Poincar\'e $\infty$-category, which permits an abstract counterpart
of unimodular forms called Poincar\'e objects. We analyse the special cases of
hyperbolic and metabolic Poincar\'e objects, and establish a version of
Ranicki's algebraic Thom construction. For derived $\infty$-categories of
rings, we classify all Poincar\'e structures and study in detail the process of
deriving them from classical input, thereby locating the usual setting of forms
over rings within our framework. We also develop the example of visible
Poincar\'e structures on $\infty$-categories of parametrised spectra,
recovering the visible signature of a Poincar\'e duality space.
  We conduct a thorough investigation of the global structural properties of
Poincar\'e $\infty$-categories, showing in particular that they form a
bicomplete, closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. We also study the
process of tensoring and cotensoring a Poincar\'e $\infty$-category over a
finite simplicial complex, a construction featuring prominently in the
definition of the L- and Grothendieck-Witt spectra that we consider in the next
instalment.
  Finally, we define already here the 0-th Grothendieck-Witt group of a
Poincar\'e $\infty$-category using generators and relations. We extract its
basic properties, relating it in particular to the 0-th L- and algebraic
K-groups, a relation upgraded in the second instalment to a fibre sequence of
spectra which plays a key role in our applications.

oscillation experiments relies on proper modeling of neutrino-nucleus
scattering processes using neutrino-interaction event generators. Experimental
tests of these generators are difficult due to the broad range of neutrino
energies produced in accelerator-based beams and the low statistics of current
experiments. Here we overcome these difficulties by exploiting the similarity
of neutrino and electron interactions with nuclei to test neutrino event
generators using high-precision inclusive electron scattering data. To this
end, we revised the electron-scattering mode of the GENIE event generator
($e$-GENIE) to include electron-nucleus bremsstrahlung radiation effects and to
use, when relevant, the exact same physics models and model parameters, as the
standard neutrino-scattering version. We also implemented new models for
quasielastic (QE) scattering and meson exchange currents (MEC) based on the
theory-inspired SuSAv2 approach. Comparing the new $e$-GENIE predictions with
inclusive electron scattering data, we find an overall adequate description of
the data in the QE- and MEC-dominated lower energy transfer regime, especially
when using the SuSAv2 models. Higher energy transfer-interactions, which are
dominated by resonance production, are still not well modeled by $e$-GENIE.

winning strategies in the various quantum models for the game is an analogue of
the notion of non-commutative graph homomorphisms due to D. Stahlke [44].
Moreover, we present a game algebra in this context that generalizes the game

in YSSe is a result of a unique combination of its structural and electronic

piezoelectric properties, while the broken space- and time-symmetry ensures
valley polarization. YSSe is a rare magnetic-piezoelectric material that can
enable novel spintronics, valleytronics, and quantum technologies.

properties, we design two sets of new sampling algorithms: one set in which
each algorithm satisfies all three properties, and one set in which each
algorithm violates at least one of the properties. We compare their performance
with existing sampling algorithms, and find that violating the identified
properties could lead to drastic performance degradation, as measured by the

substantially. Moreover, we calculate adsorptions, radially-resolved

knapsack problem, dubbed generalized incremental knapsack. In this setting, we
are given a set of $n$ items, each associated with a non-negative weight, and
$T$ time periods with non-decreasing capacities $W_1 \leq \dots \leq W_T$. When
item $i$ is inserted at time $t$, we gain a profit of $p_{it}$; however, this
item remains in the knapsack for all subsequent periods. The goal is to decide
if and when to insert each item, subject to the time-dependent capacity
constraints, with the objective of maximizing our total profit. Interestingly,
this setting subsumes as special cases a number of recently-studied incremental
knapsack problems, all known to be strongly NP-hard.
  Our first contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time
$(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation for the generalized incremental knapsack
problem. This result is based on a reformulation as a single-machine sequencing
problem, which is addressed by blending dynamic programming techniques and the
classical Shmoys-Tardos algorithm for the generalized assignment problem.
Combined with further enumeration-based self-reinforcing ideas and
newly-revealed structural properties of nearly-optimal solutions, we turn our
basic algorithm into a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS).
Hence, under widely believed complexity assumptions, this finding rules out the

1) create tools to navigate publication decisions, 2) offer a page number

5) require the publication of expected results, and 6) revamp the peer-review

state clearly and consistently the need for established norms, 2) coordinate
and build trust as a community, and 3) change the approach.

variations of objects, has recently shown compelling performance in aligning
multiple frames and is increasingly adopted for video super-resolution. Despite
its remarkable performance, its underlying mechanism for alignment remains
unclear. In this study, we carefully investigate the relation between
deformable alignment and the classic flow-based alignment. We show that
deformable convolution can be decomposed into a combination of spatial warping
and convolution. This decomposition reveals the commonality of deformable
alignment and flow-based alignment in formulation, but with a key difference in
their offset diversity. We further demonstrate through experiments that the
increased diversity in deformable alignment yields better-aligned features, and
hence significantly improves the quality of video super-resolution output.
Based on our observations, we propose an offset-fidelity loss that guides the
offset learning with optical flow. Experiments show that our loss successfully
avoids the overflow of offsets and alleviates the instability problem of
deformable alignment. Aside from the contributions to deformable alignment, our
formulation inspires a more flexible approach to introduce offset diversity to
flow-based alignment, improving its performance.

  the hypercube","101 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new method for building higher-degree sum-of-squares lower
bounds over the hypercube $\mathbf{x} \in \{\pm 1\}^N$ from a given degree 2
lower bound. Our method constructs pseudoexpectations that are positive
semidefinite by design, lightening some of the technical challenges common to
other approaches to SOS lower bounds, such as pseudocalibration.
  We give general ""incoherence"" conditions under which degree 2 pseudomoments
can be extended to higher degrees. As an application, we extend previous lower
bounds for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian from degree 4 to degree 6.
(This is subsumed, however, in the stronger results of the parallel work of
Ghosh et al.) This amounts to extending degree 2 pseudomoments given by a
random low-rank projection matrix. As evidence in favor of our construction for
higher degrees, we also show that random high-rank projection matrices (an
easier case) can be extended to degree $\omega(1)$. We identify the main
obstacle to achieving the same in the low-rank case, and conjecture that while
our construction remains correct to leading order, it also requires a
next-order adjustment.
  Our technical argument involves the interplay of two ideas of independent
interest. First, our pseudomoment matrix factorizes in terms of certain
multiharmonic polynomials. This observation guides our proof of positivity.
Second, our pseudomoment values are described graphically by sums over forests,
with coefficients given by the M\""{o}bius function of a partial ordering of
those forests. This connection guides our proof that the pseudomoments satisfy
the hypercube constraints. We trace the reason that our pseudomoments can
satisfy both the hypercube and positivity constraints simultaneously to a
combinatorial relationship between multiharmonic polynomials and this
M\""{o}bius function.

the Zwicky Transient Facility in the gri bands as well as a sequence of optical

ejecta-velocity and Black-body radius evolutions for the two supernovae, as
well as for more typical Type II supernovae. The light curves show a great
similarity with those of iPTF14hls over the first 6 months, in luminosity,
timescale and colours. Also the spectral evolution of SN 2020faa is that of a
Type II supernova, although it probes earlier epochs than those available for

a new iPTF14hls. We present these observations now to advocate follow-up

either due to observational restrictions or limitations in the dynamical
modelling method; in this work, we explore the latter. Using a sample of
high-end Monte Carlo simulations of GCs, with and without a central IMBH, we
study the limitations of spherically symmetric Jeans models assuming constant
velocity anisotropy and mass-to-light ratio. This dynamical method is one of
the most widely used modelling approaches to identify a central IMBH in
observations.
  With these models, we are able to robustly identify and recover the mass of
the central IMBH in our simulation with a high-mass IMBH ($M_{\rm IMBH}/M_{\rm
GC}\sim4\%$). Simultaneously, we show that it is challenging to confirm the
existence of a low-mass IMBH ($M_{\rm IMBH}/M_{\rm GC}\sim0.3\%$), as both
solutions with and without an IMBH are possible within our adopted error bars.
For simulations without an IMBH we do not find any certain false detection of
an IMBH. However, we obtain upper limits which still allow for the presence of
a central IMBH. We conclude that while our modelling approach is reliable for
the high-mass IMBH and does not seem to lead towards a false detection of a
central IMBH, it lacks the sensitivity to robustly identify a low-mass IMBH and
to definitely rule out the presence of an IMBH when it is not there.

The combination of X-ray selection with astrometric noise can then be a
powerful tool for identifying accreting binaries. Here, we mine the Gaia DR2
catalogue for Galactic sources with significant values of astrometric noise
over the parameter space expected for known and candidate X-ray binaries
(XRBs). Cross-matching our sample with the Chandra Source Catalogue CSC2.0
returns a primary sample of ~1,500 X-ray sources with significant excess noise,
constituting ~0.04% of the initial Gaia sample. By contrast, the fraction of
matched X-ray sources in a control sample with smaller excess noise is a factor
of about 7 lower. The primary sample branches off the main sequence much more
than control objects in colour-mag space, shows a distinct spatial distribution
in terms of Galactic latitudes, comprises more objects with an Halpha excess
and larger X-ray-to-optical flux ratios, and includes a higher fraction of
known binaries, variables and young stellar object class types. However, for
individual XRBs with known system parameters, excess noise can exceed
expectations, especially for small wobble. It is likely that other factors
(possibly attitude and modelling uncertainties, as well as source variability)
currently dominate the observed noise in such systems. Confirmation must
therefore await future Gaia releases. The full Chandra/Gaia matched catalogue

solving for the monopole and dipoles of the intensity field and by making
ansatz for the quadrupole moments to close the system of equations. We
investigate the accuracy of the most common closure methods, i.e. Eddington
tensor choices. We argue that these algorithms are most likely to err after
reionization and study quasi-analytic test problems mimicking these situations:
large-scale post-reionization ionizing background fluctuations and radiative
transfer in a predominantly ionized medium with discrete absorbers. We show
that OTVET and M1 over-ionize self-shielding absorbers when fixing the
background photoionization rate, leading to 30-40% higher emissivity to balance
the increased recombination. This over-ionization results in a simulation run
with these algorithms having a factor of ~2 lower average metagalactic
photoionization rate relative to truth given an ionizing emissivity.
Furthermore, these algorithms are unlikely to reproduce ionizing background
fluctuations on scales below the photon mean path: OTVET tends to overpredict
the fluctuations there when the simulation box is smaller than twice the mean
free path and underpredict otherwise, while M1 drastically underpredicts these
fluctuations. As a result, these numerical methods are likely not sufficiently
accurate to interpret the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed after
reionzation. We show that a high number of angular directions need to be
followed to capture the post-reionization ionizing background fluctuations
accurately with ray-tracing codes. Lastly, we argue that the strong dependence
of the post-reionization ionizing background on the value of the reduced speed
of light found in many simulations signals that the ionizing photon mean free
path is several times larger in such simulations than the observationally
measured value.

different orientations at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 d after the merger and in the
$0.1-2\,\mu$m wavelength range. We find that both models are polarized at a
detectable level 1.5 d after the merger while show negligible levels
thereafter. The polarization spectra of the two models are significantly
different. The model lacking a disk wind shows no polarization in the optical,
while a signal increasing at longer wavelengths and reaching $\sim1\%-6\%$ at
$2\,\mu$m depending on the orientation. The model with a disk-wind component,
instead, features a characteristic ""double-peak"" polarization spectrum with one
peak in the optical and the other in the infrared. Polarimetric observations of
future events will shed light on the debated neutron richness of the disk-wind
component. The detection of optical polarization would unambiguously reveal the
presence of a lanthanide-free disk-wind component, while polarization
increasing from zero in the optical to a peak in the infrared would suggest a
lanthanide-rich composition for the whole ejecta. Future polarimetric campaigns
should prioritize observations in the first $\sim48$ hours and in the
$0.5-2\,\mu$m range, where polarization is strongest, but also explore shorter
wavelengths/later times where no signal is expected from the kilonova and the

understanding of how the internal energy balance drives their evolution. Over
the last decade, radiative transfer simulations based on the Monte Carlo method
have underlined the role of the various stellar populations heating the diffuse
dust. Beyond the expected heating through ongoing star formation, both older
stellar population (> 8Gyr) and even AGN can contribute energy to the infrared
emission of diffuse dust. Here, we examine how the radiation of an external
heating source, like the less massive galaxy NGC5195, in the M51 interacting
system, could affect the heating of the diffuse dust of its parent galaxy,
NGC5194, and vice versa. To quantify the exchange of energy between the two
galaxies we use SKIRT, a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.
In the interest of modelling, the assumed centre-to-centre distance separation
between the two galaxies is 10kpc. Our model reproduces the global SED of the
system, and it closely matches the observed images. In total, 40.7% of the
intrinsic stellar radiation of the combined system is absorbed by dust.
Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of the various dust heating sources
in the system, and find that the young stellar population of NGC5194 is the
predominant dust-heating agent, with a global heating fraction of 71.2%.
Another 23% is provided by the older stellar population of the same galaxy,
while the remaining 5.8% has its origin in NGC5195. Locally, we find that the
regions of NGC5194 closer to NGC5195 are significantly affected by the
radiation field of the latter, with the absorbed energy fraction rising up to
38%. The contribution of NGC5195 remains under the percentage level in the
outskirts of the disc of NGC5194. This is the first time that the heating of
the diffuse dust by a companion galaxy is quantified in a nearby interacting

negligible emission lines. Another seven UMGs show emission lines consistent
with active galactic nuclei and/or star formation, while only one UMG has sSFR
> 1 Gyr-1. Model star formation histories of these galaxies describe systems
that formed the majority of their stars in vigorous bursts of several hundred
Myr duration around 4 < z < 6during which hundreds to thousands of solar masses
were formed per year. These formation ages of < 1 Gyr prior to observation are
consistent with ages derived from measurements of Dn(4000) and EW0(H\delta).
Rapid quenching followed these bursty star-forming periods, generally occurring
less than 350 Myr before observation, resulting in post-starburst SEDs and
spectra for half the sample. The rapid formation timescales are consistent with
the extreme star formation rates observed in 4 < z < 7 dusty starbursts
observed with ALMA, suggesting that such dusty galaxies are progenitors of
these UMGs. While such formation histories have been suggested in previous
studies, the large sample introduced here presents the most compelling evidence
yet that vigorous star formation followed by rapid quenching is almost
certainly the norm for high mass galaxies in the early universe. The UMGs
presented here were selected to be brighter than Ks = 21.7 raising the
intriguing possibility that even (fainter) older quiescent UMGs could exist at
this epoch.

into white dwarfs. During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will
be engulfed by the star, but more distant planets can survive this phase and
remain in orbit around the white dwarf. Some white dwarfs show evidence for
rocky material floating in their atmospheres, in warm debris disks, or orbiting
very closely, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that
were scattered inward and tidally disrupted. Recently, the discovery of a
gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to ice giant planets
demonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits
around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether the planets can survive the
journey. So far, the detection of intact planets in close orbits around white
dwarfs has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant planet
candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4
days. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more
than 14 times as massive (with 95% confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs
with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence
of common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during
the red-giant phase and shrinks due to friction. In this case, though, the low
mass and relatively long orbital period of the planet candidate make
common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, the WD 1856+534 system seems to
demonstrate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being
tidally disrupted, and motivates searches for smaller transiting planets around
white dwarfs.

galaxies through stacking and even on individual basis. Despite recent
observational advances, the physical origin of these Lyman-alpha halos (LAHs),
as well as their relationships to galaxies, quasars, circumgalactic gas, and
other environmental factors remains unclear. We present results from our new
Lyman-alpha full radiative transfer code voroILTIS which runs directly on the
unstructured Voronoi tessellation of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
We make use of the TNG50 simulation and simulate LAHs from redshift $z=2$ to
$z=5$, focusing on star-forming galaxies with $8.0 <
\log_{10}{(M_\star/\rm{M}_\odot)} < 10.5$. While TNG50 does not directly follow
ionizing radiation, it includes an on-the-fly treatment for active galactic
nuclei and ultraviolet background radiation with self-shielding, which are
important processes impacting the cooling and ionization of the gas. Based on
this model, we present the predictions for the stacked radial surface
brightness profiles of Ly$\alpha$ as a function of galaxy mass and redshift.
Comparison with data from the MUSE UDF at $z>3$ reveals a promising level of
agreement. We measure the correlations of LAH size and central brightness with
galaxy properties, finding that at the masses of $8.5 \leq \log_{10}
\left(M_\star/\rm{M}_\odot\right) \leq 9.5$, physical LAH sizes roughly double
from $z=2$ to $z=5$. Finally, we decompose the profiles into contributions from
diffuse emission and scattered photons from star-forming regions. In our
simulations, we find rescattered photons from star-forming regions to be the
major source in observed LAHs. Unexpectedly, we find that the flattening of LAH
profiles at large radii becomes dominated by photons originating from other
nearby halos rather than diffuse emission itself.

interferometry, it is interesting to revisit the associated theory, which was
developed in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper argues that intensity
interferometry can be understood as an extension of Fraunhofer diffraction to
incoherent light. Interference patterns are still produced, but they are
speckle-like and transient, changing on a time scale of $1/\Delta\nu$ (where
$\Delta\nu$ is the frequency bandwidth) known as the coherence time. Bright
fringes average less than one photon per coherence time, hence fringes change
before they can be observed. But very occasionally, two or even more photons
may be detected from an interference pattern within a coherence time. These
rare coincident photons provide information about the underlying transient
interference pattern, and hence about the source brightness distribution.
Thinking in terms of transient sub-photon interference patterns makes it easy
to see why intensity interferometry will have large optical-path tolerance, and
be immune to atmospheric seeing. The unusual signal-to-noise properties also
become evident. We illustrate the unobservable but conceptually useful
transient interference patterns, and their observable correlation signal, with
three simulated examples: (i) an elongated source like Achernar, (ii) a
three-star system like Algol, and (iii) a crescent source that roughly mimics
an exoplanet transit or perhaps the M87 black hole environment. Of these, (i)
and (ii) are good targets for currently-planned setups, while (iii) is
interesting to think about for the longer term.

in the HI-distribution plot of transverse and line-of-sight distances; on
average the HI absorption peak is blueshifted by $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$ from
the LAE Ly$\alpha$ redshift, reproducing the known average velocity offset
between the Ly$\alpha$ emission redshift and the galaxy systemic redshift. We

different metallicity calibrations at $z\sim0$ and $z>1$ to account for
evolving ISM conditions. We find significant correlations between O/H and
stellar mass ($M_*$) at $z\sim2.3$ and $z\sim3.3$. The low-mass power law slope
of the mass-metallicity relation is remarkably invariant over $z=0-3.3$, such
that $\textrm{O/H}\propto M_*^{0.30}$ at all redshifts in this range. At fixed
$M_*$, O/H decreases with increasing redshift as dlog(O/H)/d$z=-0.11\pm0.02$.
We find no evidence that the fundamental metallicity relation between $M_*$,
O/H, and star-formation rate (SFR) evolves out to $z\sim3.3$, with galaxies at
$z\sim2.3-3.3$ having O/H within 0.04~dex of local galaxies matched in $M_*$
and SFR on average. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place
constraints on the mass and metal loading factors of galactic outflows. The
efficiency of metal removal increases toward lower $M_*$ at fixed redshift, and
toward higher redshift at fixed $M_*$. These models suggest that the slope of
the mass-metallicity relation is set by the scaling of the metal loading factor
of outflows with $M_*$, not by the change in gas fraction as a function of
$M_*$. The evolution toward lower O/H at fixed $M_*$ with increasing redshift
is driven by both higher gas fraction (leading to stronger dilution of ISM
metals) and higher metal removal efficiency, with models suggesting that both
effects contribute approximately equally to the observed evolution. These
results suggest that the processes governing the smooth baryonic growth of
galaxies via gas flows and star formation hold in the same form over at least

sphaleron processes at high temperatures. Yet a new possibility emerged,
electroweak baryogenesis. Here sphaleron processes generate a baryon asymmetry
during a strongly first-order phase transition. This mechanism has been studied
in many extensions of the Standard Model. However, constraints from the LHC and
from low-energy precision experiments exclude most of the known models, leaving
composite Higgs models of electroweak symmetry breaking as an interesting
possibility. Sphaleron processes are also the basis of leptogenesis, where
CP-violating decays of heavy right-handed neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry
which is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is closely
related to the one of GUT baryogenesis, and simple estimates based on GUT
models can explain the order of magnitude of the observed baryon-to-photon
ratio. In the one-flavour approximation an upper bound on the light neutrino
masses has been derived which is consistent with the cosmological upper bound
on the sum of neutrino masses. For quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos the
leptogenesis temperature can be lowered from the GUT scale down to the weak
scale, and CP-violating oscillations of GeV sterile neutinos can also lead to
successfull leptogenesis. Significant progress has been made in developing a
full field theoretical description of thermal leptogenesis, which demonstrated
that interactions with gauge bosons of the thermal plasma play a crucial role.
Finally, we discuss recent ideas how the seesaw mechanism and B-L breaking at
the GUT scale can be probed by gravitational waves.

formation rate, initial mass function, cold gas mass density, dust attenuation,
and the size evolution of galaxies. In addition to physical effects, the SB is,
unlike magnitude, a more direct way in which a galaxy's detectability is
determined. We find a very strong evolution in the intrinsic SB distribution
which declines as $(1+z)^{3}$, decreasing by 4-5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ between
$z=6$ to $z=1$. This change is much larger than expected in terms of the
evolution in UV luminosity, sizes or dust extinction and we demonstrate that
this evolution is 'unnatural' and due to selection biases. We also find no
strong correlation between mass and UV SB. Thus, deep HST imaging is unable to
discover all of the most massive galaxies in the distant universe. Through
simulations we show that only $\sim15$\% of galaxies that we can detect at

high SB galaxies at high-$z$ by investigating the relationship between

the giant planets expand. This adiabatic process maintains the orbital period
ratios, but the mutual interactions between planets and the width of
mean-motion resonances (MMR) increase, leading to the capture of Jupiter and
Saturn into a stable 5:2 resonant configuration. The expanded orbits, coupled
with the large-amplitude librations of the critical MMR angle, make the system
more susceptible to perturbations from stellar flyby interactions. Accordingly,
within about 30 Gyr, stellar encounters perturb the planets onto the chaotic
sub-domain of the 5:2 resonance, triggering a large-scale instability, which
culminates in the ejections of all but one planet over the subsequent $\sim10$

perihelion distance less than $\sim200$ AU) liberates the final planet. Through
this sequence of events, the characteristic timescale over which the solar
system will be completely dissolved is roughly 100 Gyr. Our analysis thus
indicates that the expected dynamical lifetime of the solar system is much
longer than the current age of the universe, but is significantly shorter than
previous estimates.

technologies in many quantum systems, such as cold atoms, trapped ions,
cavity-quantum electrodynamics (QED), and circuit-QED. However the fragility of
quantum states to the effects of measurement and decoherence still poses one of
the greatest challenges in quantum technology. An imperative capability in this
path is quantum feedback, as it enhances the control possibilities and allows
for prolonging coherence times through quantum error correction. While changing
parameters from shot to shot of an experiment or procedure can be considered
feedback, quantum mechanics also allows for the intriguing possibility of
performing feedback operations during the measurement process itself. This
broader approach to measurements leads to the concepts of weak measurement,
quantum trajectories and numerous types of feedback with no classical
analogues. These types of processes are the primary focus of this review. We
introduce the concept of quantum feedback in the context of circuit QED, an
experimental platform with significant potential in quantum feedback and
technology. We then discuss several experiments and see how they elucidate the
concepts of continuous measurements and feedback. We conclude with an overview
of coherent feedback, with application to fault-tolerant error correction.

disturbances due to electrode motions can lead to misinterpretations.
Therefore, alternative measurement approaches are desired to increase the
reliability of the results. In this work, a novel approach based on impedance
myography is proposed. By means of an equivalent circuit of a muscle, its
electrical characteristics during contractions are analyzed. In this analysis,
a new biomedical marker named the PhaseX Effect is described. This effect is
based on the specific behavior of the phase response when the muscle is
contracted and is interesting due to its high signal robustness and low signal
processing requirements. The resilience of this effect against electrode motion
is also analyzed. Measurements of the complex impedance myography spectra are
performed on the forearms of three subjects during relaxation and contraction
of the corresponding muscle. The subject measurements show the expected
behavior of the muscle model. Actual muscle contractions can easily be detected
via a simple analysis of the phase response. For a better visualization, the
measurements are repeated while acquiring a synchronized video of the moving
forearm. The particular effect of the phase response during muscle contraction
can be used as a new marker that can be beneficial in several applications such
as prostheses control. The PhaseX Effect has high reliability and low signal
processing requirements, making it advantageous over other muscle activity
markers. The combination of a reliable marker and simple signal analysis
promises to become a new method for prostheses control.

Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been
refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper
presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important
feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is
that it is calibration-free. GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state
preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in
a gate set simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long
sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency,
achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper,
we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to
achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error
bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus
is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details,

a 34S/33S ratio of ~4.3 in the +50 km/s Cloud. Previous studies observed a
decreasing trend in the 32S/34S isotopic ratios when approaching the Galactic
centre. Our result indicates a termination of this tendency at least at a
galactocentric distance of 130-30+60 pc. This is at variance with findings
based on 12C/13C, 14N/15N and 18O/17O isotope ratios, where the above-mentioned

\Sigma^n$ that admit a local decoding algorithm that recovers each individual
bit of the message by querying only a few bits from a noisy codeword. An
important question in this line of research is to understand the optimal
trade-off between the query complexity of LDCs and their block length. Despite
importance of these objects, the best known constructions of constant query
LDCs have super-polynomial length, and there is a significant gap between the
best constructions and the known lower bounds in terms of the block length.
  For many applications it suffices to consider the weaker notion of relaxed
LDCs (RLDCs), which allows the local decoding algorithm to abort if by querying
a few bits it detects that the input is not a codeword. This relaxation turned
out to allow decoding algorithms with constant query complexity for codes with
almost linear length. Specifically, [BGH+06] constructed an $O(q)$-query RLDC
that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of block length $n =
O(k^{1+1/\sqrt{q}})$.
  In this work we improve the parameters of [BGH+06] by constructing an
$O(q)$-query RLDC that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of
block length $O(k^{1+1/{q}})$. This construction matches (up to a
multiplicative constant factor) the lower bounds of [KT00, Woo07] for constant
query LDCs, thus making progress toward understanding the gap between LDCs and
RLDCs in the constant query regime.
  In fact, our construction extends to the stronger notion of relaxed locally
correctable codes (RLCCs), introduced in [GRR18], where given a noisy codeword
the correcting algorithm either recovers each individual bit of the codeword by
only reading a small part of the input, or aborts if the input is detected to
be corrupt.

patching a band aid, coating technology, to the breakthrough discovery of
peeling graphene flakes using sticky tape. These processes are often hindered
by the formation of blisters and loops, which are notoriously difficult to
remove. Here we describe and explain a remarkable phenomenon that arises when
one attempts to remove a loop in a self-adherent sheet that is formed by, e.g.,
folding two adhesive sides of a tape together. One would expect the loop to
simply unloop when pulling on its free ends. Surprisingly, however, the loop
does not immediately open up but shrinks in size, held together by a tenuous
contact region that propagates along the tape. This adhesive contact region
only ruptures once the loop is reduced to a critical size. We experimentally
show that the loop-shrinkage results from an interaction between the peeling
front and the loop, across the contact zone. This new type of interaction falls
outside the realm of the classical elastica theory and is responsible for a
highly nonlinear increase in the peeling force. Our results reveal and quantify
the increased force required to remove loops in self-adherent media, which is
of importance for blister removal and exfoliation of graphene sheets.

surfaces with nonopatterned charged domains, which has been connected to a bulk
ionic reservoir. The system is investigated through an improved Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation method, suitable for simulation of electrolytes in the presence
of modulated surface charge distributions. We also employ a linear approach in
the spirit of the classical Debye-H\""uckel approximation, which allows one to
obtain explicit expressions for the averaged potentials, ionic profiles,
effective surface interactions and the net ionic charge confined between the
walls. Emphasis is placed in the limit of strongly confined electrolytes, in
which case local electroneutrality in the inter-surface space might not be
fulfilled. In order to access the effects of such lack of local charge
neutrality on the ionic-induced interactions between surfaces with modulated
charge domains, we consider two distinct model systems for the confined
electrolyte: one in which a salt reservoir is explicitly taken into account
{\it via} the osmotic equilibrium with an electrolyte of fixed bulk
concentration, and a second one in which the equilibrium with a charge neutral
ionic reservoir is implicitly considered. While in the former case the osmotic
ionic exchange might lead to non-vanishing net charges, in the latter model
charge neutrality is enforced through the appearance of an implicit Donnan
potential across the charged interfaces. A strong dependence of the
ionic-induced surface interactions in the employed model system is observed at
all particle separations. These findings strongly suggest that due care is to
be taken while choosing among different scenarios to describe the ionic
exchanging in electrolytes confined between charged surfaces, even in cases
when the monopole (non zero net charge) surface contributions are absent.

However, there is plenty of scope for further investigation. This paper
addresses this scope and proposes a novel solution. Most video captioning

novel architecture, namely Semantically Sensible Video Captioning (SSVC) which
modifies the context generation mechanism by using two novel approaches -
""stacked attention"" and ""spatial hard pull"". As there are no exclusive metrics
for evaluating video captioning models, we emphasize both quantitative and
qualitative analysis of our model. Hence, we have used the BLEU scoring metric
for quantitative analysis and have proposed a human evaluation metric for
qualitative analysis, namely the Semantic Sensibility (SS) scoring metric. SS
Score overcomes the shortcomings of common automated scoring metrics. This
paper reports that the use of the aforementioned novelties improves the

Eulerian conservation laws. The method extends the favorable properties of DSEM
that include its high-order accuracy, its local and boundary fitted properties
and its high performance on parallel platforms for the concurrent Monte-Carlo,
semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian solution of a class of time-dependent problems
that can be described by coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations. The
semi-Lagrangian method seeds particles at Gauss quadrature collocation nodes
within a spectral element. The particles are integrated explicitly in time
according to a drift velocity and a Wiener increment forcing and form the nodal
basis for an advected interpolant. This interpolant is mapped back in a
semi-Lagrangian fashion to the Gauss quadrature points through a least squares
fit using constraints for element boundary values. Stochastic Monte-Carlo
samples are averaged element-wise on the quadrature nodes. The stable explicit
time step Wiener increment is sufficiently small to prevent particles from
leaving the element's bounds. The semi-Lagrangian method is hence local and
parallel and does not have the grid complexity, and parallelization challenges
of the commonly used Lagrangian particle solvers in particle-mesh methods for
solution of Eulerian-Lagrangian formulations. Formal proof is presented that
the semi-Lagrangian algorithm evolves the solution according to the Eulerian
Fokker-Planck equation. Numerical tests in one and two dimensions for
drift-diffusion problems show that the method converges exponentially for
constant and non-constant advection and diffusion velocities.

(NID) systems. However, there are currently a number of challenges derived from
how the datasets are being collected. Most attack classes in network intrusion
datasets are considered the minority compared to normal traffic and many
datasets are collected through virtual machines or other simulated environments
rather than real-world networks. These challenges undermine the performance of
intrusion detection machine learning models by fitting models such as random
forests or support vector machines to unrepresentative ""sandbox"" datasets. This
survey presents a carefully designed taxonomy highlighting eight main
challenges and solutions and explores common datasets from 1999 to 2020. Trends
are analyzed on the distribution of challenges addressed for the past decade
and future directions are proposed on expanding NID into cloud-based
environments, devising scalable models for larger amount of network intrusion
data, and creating labeled datasets collected in real-world networks.

this knowledge gap to a certain extent. We derive convergence results for the

the system from the radiation domination era to the late times, allowing the
EDE model to have a non-negligible contribution at high redshift (as opposed to
the cosmological constant that only plays a role once the structure is formed)
with a very little input to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and to do so, the
equation of state mimics the radiation behaviour, but being subdominant in
terms of its energy density. At late times, the equation of state of the dark
energy model asymptotically tends to the fiducial value of the De Sitter
domination epoch, providing an explanation for the accelerated expansion of the
Universe at late times, emulating the effect of the cosmological constant. The
proposed model has three free parameters, that we constrain using SNIa
luminosity distances, along with the CMB shift parameter and the deceleration
parameter calculated at the time of dark energy - matter equality. With full
knowledge of the best fit for our model, we calculate different observables and
compare these predictions with the standard$\Lambda$CDM model. Besides the
general consent of the community with the cosmological constant, there is no
fundamental reason to choose that particular candidate as dark energy. Here, we
open the opportunity to consider a more dynamical model, that also accounts for

learning is combining the different weak supervision signals while navigating
misleading correlations in their errors. In this paper, we propose a simple
data-free approach for combining weak supervision signals by defining a

a random labeling within this constrained space. Our method is efficient and
stable, converging after a few iterations of gradient descent. We prove
theoretical conditions under which the worst-case error of the randomized label

our method outperforms other weak supervision methods on various text- and

Liouville manifolds was recently defined. This is the symplectic Banach-Mazur
distance. It was proposed by Ostrover and Polterovich and developed by
Ostrover, Polterovich, Usher, Gutt, Zhang and Stojisavljevi\'c. The natural
question is, can an analogous distance in the contact realm be defined? One
idea is to define the distance on contact hypersurfaces of Liouville manifolds
and another one on contact forms supporting isomorphic contact structures.
Rosen and Zhang recently defined such a distance working with manifolds that
are prequantizations of Liouville manifolds. They also considered a distance on
contact forms supporting the same contact structure on a contact manifold $Y$.
This allowed them to view the space of contact forms supporting isomorphic
contact structures on a manifold $Y$ as a pseudometric space, study its
properties, and derive interesting results. In this work, we do something
similar, yet the distance we define is less restrictive. Moreover, viewing
contact homology algebra as a persistence module, focusing purely on the
overtwisted case and exploiting the fact that the contact homology of
overtwisted contact structures vanishes, allows us to bi-Lipschitz embed part
of the 2-dimensional Euclidean space into the space of overtwisted contact
forms supporting a given contact structure on a smooth closed manifold $Y$.

being a function of $\beta$ and in this case $\beta$ can be employed to measure
$\alpha$. We then use the concept to define coexistence of entities and study
its properties. A crucial role is played by a map $\alphahat$ which takes an

extraction and plays an important role in natural language understanding. Prior
systems leverage deep learning and pre-trained language models to improve the
performance of the task. However, these systems often suffer from two
short-comings: 1) when performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference based on
neural models, previous systems only used structured knowledge that are assumed
to be absolutely correct, i.e., hard constraints; 2) biased predictions on
dominant temporal relations when training with a limited amount of data. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that enhances deep neural network
with distributional constraints constructed by probabilistic domain knowledge.
We solve the constrained inference problem via Lagrangian Relaxation and apply
it on end-to-end event temporal relation extraction tasks. Experimental results
show our framework is able to improve the baseline neural network models with
strong statistical significance on two widely used datasets in news and
clinical domains.

Subsequent spectroscopic imaging of isolated, single-layer 1T-TaSe$_2$ reveals
long-wavelength modulations at Hubbard band energies that reflect spinon
density modulations. This allows direct experimental measurement of the spinon

simulations -- the game is given to us only as a black-box simulator in which
we can play it. In these settings, since the game may have unknown nature
action distributions (from which we can only obtain samples) and/or be too
large to expand fully, it can be difficult to compute strategies with
guarantees on exploitability. Recent work \cite{Zhang20:Small} resulted in a
notion of certificate for extensive-form games that allows exploitability
guarantees while not expanding the full game tree. However, that work assumed
that the black box could sample or expand arbitrary nodes of the game tree at
any time, and that a series of exact game solves (via, for example, linear
programming) can be conducted to compute the certificate. Each of those two
assumptions severely restricts the practical applicability of that method. In
this work, we relax both of the assumptions. We show that high-probability
certificates can be obtained with a black box that can do nothing more than
play through games, using only a regret minimizer as a subroutine. As a bonus,
we obtain an equilibrium-finding algorithm with $\tilde O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate in the extensive-form game setting that does not rely on a
sampling strategy with lower-bounded reach probabilities (which MCCFR assumes).
We demonstrate experimentally that, in the black-box setting, our methods are
able to provide nontrivial exploitability guarantees while expanding only a
small fraction of the game tree.

We thus seek to improve and automate the prediction of unwanted feature
interactions early in development. In this paper, we show how the detection of
unwanted feature interactions in a software product line can be effectively
represented as a link prediction problem. Link prediction uses machine learning
algorithms and similarity scores among a graph's nodes to identify likely new
edges. We here model the software product line features as nodes and the
unwanted interactions among the features as edges. We investigate six
link-based similarity metrics, some using local and some using global knowledge
of the graph, for use in this context. We evaluate our approach on a software
product line benchmark in the literature, building six machine-learning models
from the graph-based similarity data. Results show that the best ML algorithms
achieved an accuracy of 0.75 to 1 for classifying feature interactions as
unwanted or wanted in this small study and that global similarity metrics
performed better than local similarity metrics. The work shows how
link-prediction models can help find missing edges, which represent unwanted
feature interactions that are undocumented or unrecognized, earlier in
development.

This particular halo mass corresponds to a characteristic stellar mass of
$1.8\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\rm M_{\odot}$. Below the characteristic stellar mass
central galaxies have redder colors, lower sSFRs and higher metallicities in

characteristic stellar mass, the cosmic web environmental dependences either
reverse or vanish. Such dependences can be attributed to the fact that the

assist a computer vision model in solving a problem. For example, an initial

from crowdsourcing to noisy automated seeds, this is often not the case. We
hence propose the problem of seed rejection -- determining whether to reject a
seed based on the expected performance degradation when it is provided in place
of a gold-standard seed. We provide a formal definition to this problem, and
focus on two meaningful subgoals: understanding causes of error and
understanding the model's response to noisy seeds conditioned on the primary
input. With these goals in mind, we propose a novel training method and
evaluation metrics for the seed rejection problem. We then use seeded versions
of the viewpoint estimation and fine-grained classification tasks to evaluate
these contributions. In these experiments, we show our method can reduce the

algorithms, especially in high-stake applications. To identify the true
anomalies, in practice, analysts or domain experts will be employed to
investigate the top instances one by one in a ranked list of anomalies
identified by an anomaly detection system. This verification procedure
generates informative labels that can be leveraged to re-rank the anomalies so
as to help the analyst to discover more true anomalies given a time budget.
Some re-ranking strategies have been proposed to approximate the above
sequential decision process. Specifically, existing strategies have been
focused on making the top instances more likely to be anomalous based on the
feedback. Then they greedily select the top-1 instance for query. However,
these greedy strategies could be sub-optimal since some low-ranked instances
could be more helpful in the long-term. In this work, we propose Active Anomaly
Detection with Meta-Policy (Meta-AAD), a novel framework that learns a
meta-policy for query selection. Specifically, Meta-AAD leverages deep
reinforcement learning to train the meta-policy to select the most proper
instance to explicitly optimize the number of discovered anomalies throughout
the querying process. Meta-AAD is easy to deploy since a trained meta-policy
can be directly applied to any new datasets without further tuning. Extensive
experiments on 24 benchmark datasets demonstrate that Meta-AAD significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art re-ranking strategies and the unsupervised
baseline. The empirical analysis shows that the trained meta-policy is
transferable and inherently achieves a balance between long-term and short-term
rewards.

is smoothly decreasing at the surface. A depletion in the central part of the
nuclear density can have nuclear structure effects leading to the formation of
""bubble"" nuclei. However, probing the density profile of the nuclear interior
is, in general, very challenging.
  Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the nuclear bubble
structure, with nucleon-nucleus scattering, and quantify the effect that has on
the nuclear surface profile.
  Method: We employed high-energy nucleon-nucleus scattering under the aegis of
the Glauber model to analyze various reaction observables, which helps in
quantifying the nuclear bubble. The effectiveness of this method is tested on
$^{28}$Si with harmonic-oscillator (HO) densities, before applying it on
even-even $N = 14$ isotones, in the $22 \leq A \leq 34$ mass range, with
realistic densities obtained from antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD).
  Results: Elastic scattering differential cross sections and reaction
probability for the proton-$^{28}$Si reaction are calculated using the HO
density to design tests for signatures of nuclear bubble structure. We then
quantify the degree of bubble structure for $N = 14$ isotones with the AMD
densities by analyzing their elastic scattering at 325, 550 and 800 MeV
incident energies. The present analyses suggest $^{22}$O as a candidate for a
bubble nucleus, among even-even $N = 14$ isotones, in the $22 \leq A \leq 34$
mass range.
  Conclusion: We have shown that the bubble structure information is imprinted
on the nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering differential cross section,
especially in the first diffraction peak. Bubble nuclei tend to have a sharper
nuclear surface and deformation seems to be a hindrance in their emergence.

characterization reveals that these pulses, exhibit increasing spectral
flatness with dispersion order. The measured energy-width scaling laws suggest
dramatic advantages for ultrashort pulses. These results broaden the

class of nondegenerate vector solitons, which can undergo collision without any
intensity redistribution in general among the modes, associated with distinct
wave numbers, besides the already known energy exchanging solitons
corresponding to identical wave numbers. In the present comprehensive paper, we
discuss in detail the various special features of the reported nondegenerate
vector solitons. To bring out these details, we derive the exact forms of such
vector one-, two- and three-soliton solutions through Hirota bilinear method
and they are rewritten in more compact forms using Gram determinants. The
presence of distinct wave numbers allows the nondegenerate fundamental soliton
to admit various profiles such as double-hump, flat-top and single-hump
structures. We explain the formation of double-hump structure in the
fundamental soliton when the relative velocity of the two modes tends to zero.
More critical analysis shows that the nondegenerate fundamental solitons can
undergo shape preserving as well as shape altering collisions under appropriate
conditions. The shape changing collision occurs between the modes of
nondegenerate solitons when the parameters are fixed suitably. Then we observe
the coexistence of degenerate and nondegenerate solitons when the wave numbers
are restricted appropriately in the obtained two-soliton solution. In such a
situation we find the degenerate soliton induces shape changing behavior of
nondegenerate soliton during the collision process. By performing suitable
asymptotic analysis we analyze the consequences that occur in each of the
collision scenario. Finally we point out that the previously known class of
energy exchanging vector bright solitons, with identical wave numbers, turns
out to be a special case of the newly derived nondegenerate solitons.

researchers to develop self-propelled colloidal analogues to biological

study the behavior of half-platinum half-gold (Pt/Au) self-propelled rods in

Chemokinesis is distinct from chemotaxis in that no directional sensing or

work suggests a novel strategy of exploiting chemokinesis to effect

These materials have the half-metal ground states, where only the bands from
the spin-down channel present near the Fermi energy. The spin-down bands form a
pair of triply degenerate nodal points (TDNPs) if spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is
not included. Under SOC, one TDNP splits into two double-Weyl points featuring
quadratic dispersion along two momentum direction, and they are protected by
the three-fold rotation (C3) symmetry. Unlike most double-Weyl semimetals, the
Weyl points proposed here have the type-III dispersion with one of the crossing

well the nature of the Weyl points. These Weyl points are fully spin-polarized,
and are characterized with double Fermi arcs on the surface spectrum. Breaking

Many recently-proposed methods are specially designed to accommodate the

perform poorly in text recognition on scene images with texts in novel font
styles. To address this problem, we explore font-independent features of scene

Specifically, we introduce trainable font embeddings to shape the font styles
of generated glyphs, with the image feature of scene text only representing its
essential patterns. The generation process is directed by the spatial attention
mechanism, which effectively copes with irregular texts and generates
higher-quality glyphs than existing image-to-image translation methods.

is permanent. As for the converse statement (i.e., ability to swap implies

semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. Though many ZSL methods
rely on a direct mapping between the visual and the semantic space, the
calibration deviation and hubness problem limit the generalization capability
to unseen classes. Recently emerged generative ZSL methods generate unseen
image features to transform ZSL into a supervised classification problem.
However, most generative models still suffer from the seen-unseen bias problem
as only seen data is used for training. To address these issues, we propose a
novel bidirectional embedding based generative model with a tight
visual-semantic coupling constraint. We learn a unified latent space that
calibrates the embedded parametric distributions of both visual and semantic
spaces. Since the embedding from high-dimensional visual features comprise much
non-semantic information, the alignment of visual and semantic in latent space
would inevitably been deviated. Therefore, we introduce information bottleneck
(IB) constraint to ZSL for the first time to preserve essential attribute
information during the mapping. Specifically, we utilize the uncertainty
estimation and the wake-sleep procedure to alleviate the feature noises and
improve model abstraction capability. In addition, our method can be easily
extended to transductive ZSL setting by generating labels for unseen images. We
then introduce a robust loss to solve this label noise problem. Extensive
experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art

methods of trend estimation used in the electricity price modelling literature
either require an ambiguous definition of an extreme price, or lead to issues
when implementing model selection [23]. The first main contribution of this
paper is to design and infer a model which has a model-based definition of
extreme prices and permits the use of model selection criteria. Due to the
complexity of the MRS models inference is not straightforward. In the existing
literature an approximate EM algorithm is used [26]. Another contribution of
this paper is to implement exact inference in a Bayesian setting. This also
allows the use of posterior predictive checks to assess model fit. We
demonstrate the methodologies with South Australian electricity market.

creates a significant social problem for everyone whose photos are publicly

learning-based detection methods have been developed to identify these
deepfakes. However, these methods lack generalizability, because they perform
well only for a specific type of deepfake method. Therefore, those methods are
not transferable to detect other deepfake methods. Also, they do not take
advantage of the temporal information of the video. In this paper, we addressed
these limitations. We developed a Convolutional LSTM based Residual Network
(CLRNet), which takes a sequence of consecutive images as an input from a video

Through rigorous experimentations using the FaceForensics++ dataset, we showed

of all prime divisors of $n$ and $\pi(G)=\pi(|G|)$. The prime graph $\Gamma(G)$
of $G$, defined by Grenberg and Kegel, is a graph whose vertex set is $\pi(G)$,
two vertices $p,\ q$ in $\pi(G)$ joined by an edge if and only if $G$ contains
an element of order $pq$. In this article, a new characterization of sporadic
simple groups is obtained, that is, if $G$ is a finite group and $S$ a sporadic
simple group. Then $G\cong S$ if and only if $|G|=|S|$ and $\Gamma(G)$ is
disconnected. This characterization unifies the several characterizations that
can conclude the group has non-connected prime graphs, hence several known
characterizations of sporadic simple groups become the corollaries of this new

development of deep learning. However, modern person Re-ID is still challenged
by background clutter, occlusion and large posture variation which are common
in practice. Previous methods tackle these challenges by localizing pedestrians
through external cues (e.g., pose estimation, human parsing) or attention
mechanism, suffering from high computation cost and increased model complexity.
In this paper, we propose the Contextual Mutual Boosting Network (CMBN). It
localizes pedestrians and recalibrates features by effectively exploiting
contextual information and statistical inference. Firstly, we construct two
branches with a shared convolutional frontend to learn the foreground and
background features respectively. By enabling interaction between these two
branches, they boost the accuracy of the spatial localization mutually.
Secondly, starting from a statistical perspective, we propose the Mask
Generator that exploits the activation distribution of the transformation
matrix for generating the static channel mask to the representations. The mask
recalibrates the features to amplify the valuable characteristics and diminish
the noise. Finally, we propose the Contextual-Detachment Strategy to optimize
the two branches jointly and independently, which further enhances the
localization precision. Experiments on the benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the architecture compared the state-of-the-art.

being developed for improving transparency of NLP models. Meanwhile,
researchers also try to answer the question that whether the obtained
interpretation is faithful in explaining mechanisms behind model prediction?
Specifically, (Jain and Wallace, 2019) proposes that ""attention is not
explanation"" by comparing attention interpretation with gradient alternatives.
However, it raises a new question that can we safely pick one interpretation
method as the ground-truth? If not, on what basis can we compare different
interpretation methods? In this work, we propose that it is crucial to have a
concrete definition of interpretation before we could evaluate faithfulness of
an interpretation. The definition will affect both the algorithm to obtain
interpretation and, more importantly, the metric used in evaluation. Through
both theoretical and experimental analysis, we find that although
interpretation methods perform differently under a certain evaluation metric,
such a difference may not result from interpretation quality or faithfulness,
but rather the inherent bias of the evaluation metric.

video sequences captured under complex environments. Currently, this area is
dominated by a series of feature enhancement based methods, which distill
beneficial semantic information from multiple frames and generate enhanced
features through fusing the distilled information. However, the distillation
and fusion operations are usually performed at either frame level or instance
level with external guidance using additional information, such as optical flow
and feature memory. In this work, we propose a dual semantic fusion network

introduce a geometric similarity measure into the fusion process to alleviate
the influence of information distortion caused by noise. As a result, the
proposed DSFNet can generate more robust features through the multi-granularity
fusion and avoid being affected by the instability of external guidance. To
evaluate the proposed DSFNet, we conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet

the best of our knowledge, the best performance of 84.1\% mAP among the current

several appealing benefits. (1) It significantly improves flexibility of the

UXNet is carefully designed, enabling its searching scheme performed in an

effectiveness of UXNet compared with recent NAS methods for medical image
segmentation. The architecture discovered by UXNet outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models in terms of Dice on several public 3D medical image

of the previous study, but dealing carefully with the uncertainty of
strong-line calibration, performing reproducibility tests with mock data, and
monitoring the convergence of the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
From the mock-data tests, I found that the nebular emission-line color excess
$E(B-V)$ can be overestimated by as much as 2-$\sigma$ or more, although the
metallicity can recover the input value to within 1-$\sigma$. The new
metallicity estimates on the HPS data are from well-converged MCMC samples
(effective sample sizes $>$ 2000), and they are higher than the previous
estimates by $\sim$2-$\sigma$. Using the HPS data, I also showed that the MCMC
sampling can have the statistical accuracy as poor as the one near the
iteration start if done without convergence monitoring. The overestimation of
$E(B-V)$ indicates the overestimation of the star-formation rates (SFRs) in the
previous study, which can be as much as a factor of five. This finding
undermines the previous suggestion of a hitherto-unknown galaxy population
based on the locations of galaxies in the mass-SFR plane. I found that the

latter leads to an additional one-body term in the coarse-grained (CG) free
energy, defining a single-particle property distribution for an individual
polydisperse RC. We argue that in the equilibrium thermodynamic limit such a CG
system of RCs behaves like a conventional polydisperse system of non-responsive
particles. We then illustrate the action of external fields, which impose local
(position-dependent) property distributions leading to non-trivial effects on
the spatial one-body property and density profiles, even for an ideal
(non-interacting) gas of RCs. We finally apply density functional theory in the
local density approximation (LDA-DFT) to discuss the effects of particle
interactions for specific examples of i) a suspension of RCs in an external
field linear in both position and property, ii) a suspension of RCs with highly
localized properties (sizes) confined between two walls, and iii) a
two-component suspension where an inhomogeneously distributed (non-responsive)
cosolute component, as found, e.g., in the studies of osmolyte- or salt-induced
collapse/swelling transitions of thermosensitive polymers, modifies the local
properties and density of the RC liquid.

which the sender can securely and reliably transmit messages to the receiver
using multiple channels. An adversary can corrupt a subset of the channels and
commit eavesdropping and tampering attacks over the channels. In this work, we
introduce a game-theoretic security model for SMT in which adversaries have
some preferences for protocol execution. We define rational ""timid"" adversaries
who prefer to violate security requirements but do not prefer the tampering to
be detected.
  First, we consider the basic setting where a single adversary attacks the
protocol. We construct perfect SMT protocols against any rational adversary
corrupting all but one of the channels. Since minority corruption is required
in the traditional setting, our results demonstrate a way of circumventing the
cryptographic impossibility results by a game-theoretic approach.
  Next, we study the setting in which all the channels can be corrupted by
multiple adversaries who do not cooperate. Since we cannot hope for any
security if a single adversary corrupts all the channels or multiple
adversaries cooperate maliciously, the scenario can arise from a game-theoretic
model. We also study the scenario in which both malicious and rational
adversaries exist.

collection of group elements $G^*_1, \dots, G^*_n \in \mathcal{G}$ based on
noisy observations of a subset of all pairwise ratios of the form $G^*_i
{G^*_j}^{-1}$. Such a problem has gained much attention recently and finds many
applications across a wide range of scientific and engineering areas. In this
paper, we consider the class of synchronization problems in which the group is
a closed subgroup of the orthogonal group. This class covers many group
synchronization problems that arise in practice. Our contribution is fivefold.
First, we propose a unified approach for solving this class of group
synchronization problems, which consists of a suitable initialization step and
an iterative refinement step based on the generalized power method, and show
that it enjoys a strong theoretical guarantee on the estimation error under
certain assumptions on the group, measurement graph, noise, and initialization.
Second, we formulate two geometric conditions that are required by our approach
and show that they hold for various practically relevant subgroups of the
orthogonal group. The conditions are closely related to the error-bound
geometry of the subgroup -- an important notion in optimization. Third, we
verify the assumptions on the measurement graph and noise for standard random
graph and random matrix models. Fourth, based on the classic notion of metric
entropy, we develop and analyze a novel spectral-type estimator. Finally, we
show via extensive numerical experiments that our proposed non-convex approach
outperforms existing approaches in terms of computational speed, scalability,
and/or estimation error.

in-plane alignment of the c-axis lying along to the [100] direction. On
STO(100), two possible directions of the in-plane c-axis lead to a mosaic like,
quasi two-dimensional nanostructure, consisting of RP, rock-salt and perovskite
building blocks. With the use of a CMO buffer layer, RP-PCMO epitaxial films
with c-axis out-of-plane were realized. Different physical vapor deposition
techniques, i.e. ion beam sputtering (IBS), pulsed laser deposition (PLD) as

distinguish between the effect of growth conditions and intrinsic epitaxial
properties. For all deposition techniques, despite their very different growth

The relative importance of AC and DC heating in maintaining the
temperature of the corona is not well constrained. Aims. Investigate the
effects of the characteristic time scales of photospheric driving on the
injection and dissipation of energy within a coronal arcade. Methods. We have
conducted three dimensional MHD simulations of foot point driving imposed on an
arcade. We modified the typical driving time scales to understand the
efficiency of heating obtained using AC and DC drivers. We considered the
implications for the injected Poynting flux and the nature of the energy
release in dissipative regimes. Results. For the same driver amplitude and
complexity, long time scale motions are able to inject a much greater Poynting
flux into the corona. Consequently, in non-ideal regimes, slow stressing
motions result in a greater increase in plasma temperature than for wave-like
driving. In dissipative simulations, Ohmic heating is found to be much more
significant than viscous heating. For all drivers in our parameter space,
energy dissipation is greatest close to the base of the arcade where the
magnetic field strength is strongest and at separatrix surfaces, where the
field connectivity changes. Across all simulations, the background field is
stressed with random foot point motions (in a manner typical of DC heating
studies) and even for short time scale driving, the injected Poynting flux is
large given the small amplitude flows considered. For long time scale driving,
the rate of energy injection was comparable to the expected requirements in
active regions. The heating rates were found to scale with the perturbed
magnetic field strength and not the total field strength. Conclusions.
Alongside recent studies which show power within the corona is dominated by low
frequency motions, our results suggest that in the closed corona, DC heating is
more significant than AC heating.

based on hand-craft bounding boxes where images are precisely aligned. It is
unrealistic in practical applications, since the exploited object detection
algorithms often produce inaccurate bounding boxes. This will inevitably
degrade the performance of existing algorithms. To address these problems, we
put forward a novel person re-ID model that fuses high- and low-level

This paper presents a novel perturbation analysis for the truncated singular

expansions for the singular value truncation of order $r$. We extend
perturbation results for the singular subspace decomposition to derive the
first-order perturbation expansion of the truncated operator about a matrix
with rank greater than or equal to $r$. Observing that the first-order
expansion can be greatly simplified when the matrix has exact rank $r$, we
further show that the singular value truncation admits a simple second-order
perturbation expansion about a rank-$r$ matrix. Second, we introduce the
first-known error bound on the linear approximation of the truncated singular
value decomposition of a perturbed rank-$r$ matrix. Our bound only depends on
the least singular value of the unperturbed matrix and the norm of the
perturbation matrix. Intriguingly, while the singular subspaces are known to be
extremely sensitive to additive noises, the newly established error bound holds
universally for perturbations with arbitrary magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate
an application of our results to the analysis of the mean squared error

dialogue generation, where the model explicitly perceives the difference

employ a pretrained baseline model as a reference. During contrastive learning,
the target dialogue model is trained to give higher conditional probabilities
for the positive samples, and lower conditional probabilities for those
negative samples, compared to the reference model. To manage the multi-mapping
relations prevailed in human conversation, we augment contrastive dialogue
learning with group-wise dual sampling. Extensive experimental results show
that the proposed group-wise contrastive learning framework is suited for

that are subject to linear friction and coupled to heat baths at different
temperatures is used to study the dynamic approach to equilibrium and
non-equilibrium stationary states. Based on the exactly calculated dynamic
approach to the stationary distribution, the functional that governs this
approach, which is called the free entropy, is constructed. For the stationary
distribution the free entropy becomes maximal and its time derivative is
minimal and vanishes. Thus, the free entropy characterizes equilibrium as well
as non-equilibrium stationary distributions by their extremal and stability
properties. For an equilibrium system, i.e. if all heat baths have the same
temperature, the free entropy equals the negative free energy divided by
temperature. Using a systematic perturbative scheme for calculating velocity
and position correlations in the overdamped massless limit, explicit results
for few particles are presented: For two particles localization in position and
momentum space is demonstrated in the non-equilibrium stationary state,
indicative of a tendency to phase separate. For three elastically interacting
particles heat flows from a particle coupled to a cold reservoir to a particle
coupled to a warm reservoir if the third reservoir is sufficiently hot. Active
particle models can be described in the same general framework, which thereby
allows to characterize their entropy production not only in the stationary
state but also in the approach to the stationary non-equilibrium state.
Finally, the connection to non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulations that

using Diffusion maps to identify the subspace structure of the points on the

construct the transition matrix of a random walk on a graph connecting points

low-dimensional Grassmannian diffusion coordinates embedding the data into a

  Tests and Bounds.""",,,,"econ.EM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In regression discontinuity designs, manipulation threatens identification. A
known channel of harmful manipulations is precise control over the observed
assignment, but this channel is only an example. This study uncovers the only
other channel: sample selection by deciding manipulation precisely based on the
given assignment status. For example, in the assignment design of a
qualification exam, self-selection by allowing test retakes precisely based on
failing the exam is a precise decision. This precise decision harms
identification without precisely controlling the final assignment. For
instance, retaking the test never ensures passage, but it distorts the
qualification assignment because some students that failed then pass. However,
students that have already passed, never fail. This novel channel redefines the
justification for identification. Furthermore, under a new auxiliary condition,
McCrary (2008)'s test is able to confirm identification and the existing
worst-case bounds are nested within our new bounds. In a replication study,
another sample selection by analysts appears critical in the robustness of
their original conclusion.

  supported measures on compact spaces","57 pages, comments are welcome",,,,"math.FA math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The celebrated Josefson-Nissenzweig theorem implies that for a Banach space
$C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on an infinite compact space $K$
there exists a sequence of Radon measures $\langle\mu_n\colon\
n\in\omega\rangle$ on $K$ which is weakly* convergent to the zero measure on
$K$ and such that $\big\|\mu_n\big\|=1$ for every $n\in\omega$. We call such a
sequence of measures \textit{a Josefson-Nissenzweig sequence}. In this paper we
study the situation when the space $K$ admits a Josefson-Nissenzweig sequence
of measures such that its every element has finite support. We prove among the
others that $K$ admits such a Josefson-Nissenzweig sequence if and only if
$C(K)$ does not have the Grothendieck property restricted to functionals from
the space $\ell_1(K)$. We also investigate miscellaneous analytic and
topological properties of finitely supported Josefson-Nissenzweig sequences on
general Tychonoff spaces.
  We prove that various properties of compact spaces guarantee the existence of
finitely supported Josefson-Nissenzweig sequences. One such property is, e.g.,
that a compact space can be represented as the limit of an inverse system of
compact spaces based on simple extensions. An immediate consequence of this
result is that many classical consistent examples of Efimov spaces, i.e. spaces
being counterexamples to the famous Efimov problem, admit such sequences of
measures.
  Similarly, we show that if $K$ and $L$ are infinite compact spaces, then
their product $K\times L$ always admits a finitely supported
Josefson--Nissenzweig sequence. As a corollary we obtain a constructive proof
that the space $C_p(K\times L)$ contains a complemented copy of the space $c_0$
endowed with the pointwise topology--this generalizes results of Cembranos and
Freniche.
  Finally, we provide a direct proof of the Josefson-Nissenzweig theorem for
the case of Banach spaces $C(K)$.

empirical performance than upper confidence bound based algorithms. In this
paper, we study Thompson Sampling based algorithm for Unsupervised Sequential
Selection (USS) problem. The USS problem is a variant of the stochastic
multi-armed bandits problem, where the loss of an arm can not be inferred from
the observed feedback. In the USS setup, arms are associated with fixed costs
and are ordered, forming a cascade. In each round, the learner selects an arm
and observes the feedback from arms up to the selected arm. The learner's goal
is to find the arm that minimizes the expected total loss. The total loss is
the sum of the cost incurred for selecting the arm and the stochastic loss
associated with the selected arm. The problem is challenging because, without
knowing the mean loss, one cannot compute the total loss for the selected arm.
Clearly, learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred from the
problem structure. As shown in the prior work, learning is possible when the
problem instance satisfies the so-called `Weak Dominance' (WD) property. Under
WD, we show that our Thompson Sampling based algorithm for the USS problem
achieves near optimal regret and has better numerical performance than existing
algorithms.

maintain a database, also called catalogue, of objects on orbit. Among others,
surveillance radars which are constantly scanning a region of interest in the
sky are used for this purpose. The detections from such a radar which cannot be
assigned to an already known catalogue object might not contain enough
information to obtain a reliable initial orbit for a new catalogue entry from a
single measured pass, also called tracklet. Instead, two tracklets can be
combined to improve the quality of the initial orbit which leads to the
correlation problem. This means that it has to be tested whether two tracklets
belong to the same object and an initial orbit has to be derived by combining
the tracklets. A common approach to condense the information in the tracklet is
fitting them with so-called attributables. Because radar observations include
different types of observables, the fitting of these attributables has to be
considered as an important part of the entire correlation process. This paper
analyses the effect of the attributable fitting considering the achieved
accuracy and influence on the tracklet correlation. A new singularity-free
coordinate system is introduced, which improves the results of the fitting and
correlation. Finally, a test on a simulated survey scenario introduces two
additional filters to remove false positive correlations. It is shown that the
attributable-based approach can be applied successfully to tracklets of up to

$k$-space direction but the cubic dispersion in the plane perpendicular to it.
It is not yet clear, however, how the external perturbations can alter these
nontrivial carriers and ultimately induce a new distinct quantum phase. Here we
study the evolution of Dirac fermions, in particular the cubic Dirac crossing,
under external pressure in the representative quasi-one-dimensional

found that the topological properties, including the bulk Dirac crossings and
the topological surface states, change progressively under pressure up to 50
GPa where it undergoes a structural transition from the hexagonal phase to
body-centered tetragonal phase. Above 50 GPa, the system is more likely to be
topologically trivial. Further, we also investigate its phonon spectra, which
reveals a gradual depletion of the negative phonon modes with pressure,
consistent with the more three-dimensional Fermi surface in the high-pressure

Protoplanetary disks are known to host spiral features that are
observed in scattered light, ALMA continuum and more recently in CO gas
emission and gas dynamics. It is however unknown if spirals in gas and dust
trace the same morphology.
  Aims. We study the morphology and amplitude of dusty spirals as function of
Stokes number and the underlying mechanisms causing a difference from gas
spirals. We then construct a model to relate the deviation from Keplerian
rotation in the gas to a perturbation in surface density of gas and dust.
  Methods. We use FARGO-3D with dust implementation to numerically study the
spirals, after which the results are interpreted using a semi-analytical model.
This model is tested on observational data to predict the perturbation of the
spiral in gas dynamics based on the continuum data.
  Results. We find that the pitch angle of a spiral does not differ
significantly between gas and dust. The amplitude of the dust spiral decreases
with Stokes number (St) and starts to fade out at a typical St > 0.1 as the
dust becomes decoupled from the gas. The semianalytical model provides an
accurate and fast representation of the spiral in surface density of the dust
from the gas. We find a spiral in the TW Hya velocity residual map, never seen
before, which is a feature in the vertical velocity and has a kink at the
continuum gap, yielding strong evidence for a planet at 99 au.
  Conclusions. We built a model that gives an estimate of the underlying
dynamics of dust in a spiral, which can serve as a proof of planetary origin of
spirals and can be a probe for the Stokes number in the disk.

instead of their prior video recordings. This results in three major
challenges; large domain discrepancy between violence videos and ID-photos, the
lack of video examples for most individuals and limited training data
availability. To mimic such scenarios, we formulate a realistic domain-transfer
problem, where the goal is to transfer the recognition model trained on clean
posed images to the target domain of violent videos, where training videos are
available only for a subset of subjects. To this end, we introduce the
WildestFaces dataset, tailored to study cross-domain recognition under a

additionally formulate a self-attention based model for domain-transfer. We
establish a rigorous evaluation protocol for this clean-to-violent recognition

surveys, there is an increased need for highly accurate automated detection and
extraction of astronomical sources from images. This also means there is a need
for objective quality criteria, and automated methods to optimise parameter
settings for these software tools.
  We present a comparison of several tools which have been developed to perform
this task: namely SExtractor, ProFound, NoiseChisel, and MTObjects. In
particular, we focus on evaluating performance in situations which present
challenges for detection -- for example, faint and diffuse galaxies; extended
structures, such as streams; and objects close to bright sources. Furthermore,
we develop an automated method to optimise the parameters for the above tools.
  We present four different objective segmentation quality measures, based on
precision, recall, and a new measure for the correctly identified area of
sources. Bayesian optimisation is used to find optimal parameter settings for
each of the four tools on simulated data, for which a ground truth is known.
After training, the tools are tested on similar simulated data, to provide a
performance baseline. We then qualitatively assess tool performance on real
astronomical images from two different surveys.
  We determine that when area is disregarded, all four tools are capable of
broadly similar levels of detection completeness, while only NoiseChisel and
MTObjects are capable of locating the faint outskirts of objects. MTObjects
produces the highest scores on all tests on all four quality measures, whilst
SExtractor obtains the highest speeds. No tool has sufficient speed and
accuracy to be well-suited to large-scale automated segmentation in its current

the Kitaev chain to its equivalent spin version, and realizing the ground

only braiding operations, and can be achieved despite being restricted to
Clifford gates for the Ising anyons. The Majorana encoding is a quantum error

the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) using the ReMoCA

isotopolog, the lowest two excited vibrational states, v12 = 1 and v9 = 1, were

was not detected toward the hot cores Sgr B2(N1S) and Sgr B2(N2). The sensitive

least less abundant than formamide. This is markedly different from
methanethiol, which is only about two orders of magnitude less abundant than
methanol in both sources. The different behavior shown by methanethiol versus
thioformamide may be caused by the preferential formation of the latter (on
grains) at late times and low temperatures, when CS abundances are depressed.
This reduces the thioformamide-to-formamide ratio, because the HCS radical is
not as readily available under these conditions.

parameter values in a model of the dynamic evolution of expanded polyglutamine
(PolyQ) proteins in cells have been used to gain a better understanding of the
biological system, how to focus drug development and how to construct more
efficient designs of future laboratory-based in vitro experiments. However,
there is considerable uncertainty about the values of some of the parameters
governing the system. Currently, appropriate values are chosen by ad hoc
attempts to tune the parameters so that the model output matches experimental
data. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the data only offer a
partial insight into the underlying biological process: the data consist only
of the proportions of cell death and of cells with inclusion bodies at a few
time points, corrupted by measurement error.
  Developing inference procedures to estimate the model parameters in this
scenario is a significant task. The model probabilities corresponding to the
observed proportions cannot be evaluated exactly and so they are estimated
within the inference algorithm by repeatedly simulating realisations from the
model. In general such an approach is computationally very expensive and we
therefore construct Gaussian process emulators for the key quantities and
reformulate our algorithm around these fast stochastic approximations. We
conclude by examining the fit of our model and highlight appropriate values of
the model parameters leading to new insights into the underlying biological
processes such as the kinetics of aggregation.

d\Omega/d\sigma$, corresponds to a two body interaction with Coulomb potential.
It leads to the logarithmically divergence of the momentum transfer (or the
transport cross section) which is described by $$\int_{{\mathbb S}^2}
(1-\cos\theta) \frac{d\Omega}{d\sigma} d\sigma\sim \int_0^{\pi}

is the order of magnitude of the smallest angles for which the scattering can
still be regarded as Coulomb scattering. Under ad hoc cutoff $\theta \geq
\theta_{\min}$ on the deviation angle, L. D. Landau derived a new equation in
\cite{landau1936transport} for the weakly interacting gas which is now referred
to as the Fokker-Planck-Landau or Landau equation. In the present work, we
establish a unified framework to justify Landau's formal derivation in

data acquisition that arise from the constraints of a clinical workflow are
presenting new image reconstruction challenges. There are many classical
approaches to image reconstruction, but ameliorating the effects of incomplete
or imperfect data through the incorporation of accurate priors is challenging
and leads to slow algorithms. Recently, the application of Deep Learning, or
deep neural networks, to this problem has received a great deal of attention.
This paper reviews the literature on learned image reconstruction, summarising
the current trends, and explains how these new approaches fit within, and to
some extent have arisen from, a framework that encompasses classical
reconstruction methods. In particular, it shows how these new techniques can be
understood from a Bayesian perspective, providing useful insights. The paper
also provides a concise tutorial demonstration of three prototypical approaches
to learned image reconstruction. The code and data sets for these
demonstrations are available to researchers. It is anticipated that it is in in
vivo applications - where data may be sparse, fast imaging critical and priors
difficult to construct by hand - that Deep Learning will have the most impact.
With this in mind, the paper concludes with some indications of possible future
research directions.

between two successive ELM crashes below its natural value. Reliable ELM pacing
has been demonstrated experimentally in several devices increasing the ELM
frequency considerably. However, it was also shown that the frequency cannot be
increased arbitrarily due to a so-called lag-time. During this time after a
preceding natural or triggered ELM crash, neither a natural ELM crash occurs
nor the triggering of an ELM crash by pellet injection is possible. For this
article, pellet ELM triggering simulations are advanced beyond previous studies
in two ways. Firstly, realistic ExB and diamagnetic background flows are
included. And secondly, the pellet is injected at different stages of the
pedestal build-up. This allows to recover the lag-time for the first time in
simulations and investigate it in detail. A series of non-linear extended MHD
simulations is performed to investigate the plasma dynamics resulting from an
injection at different time points during the pedestal build-up. The
experimentally observed lag-time is qualitatively reproduced well. In
particular, a sharp transition is observed between the regime where no ELMs can
be triggered and the regime where pellet injection causes an ELM crash. Via
variations of pellet parameters and injection time, the two regimes are studied
and compared in detail revealing pronounced differences in the non-linear
dynamics. The toroidal mode spectrum is significantly broader when an ELM crash
is triggered enhancing the stochasticity and therefore also the losses of
thermal energy along magnetic field lines. In the heat fluxes to the divertor
targets, pronounced toroidal asymmetries are observed. In case of high
injection velocities leading to deep penetration, also the excitation of core

Given the significance of the astrophysical implications, it is important to
first understand how their masses are measured from gravitational-wave signals.
How accurate is the measurement? Are there elements missing in our current
model which may result in a bias? This chapter is dedicated to these questions.
In particular, we will highlight several astrophysical factors which are not
included in the standard model of GW sources but could result in a significant
bias in the estimation of the mass. These factors include strong gravitational
lensing, the relative motion of the source, a nearby massive object, and a

motions has attracted much attention recently. Most previous works conduct
music-to-dance synthesis via directly music to human skeleton keypoints
mapping. Meanwhile, human choreographers design dance motions from music in a
two-stage manner: they firstly devise multiple choreographic dance units
(CAUs), each with a series of dance motions, and then arrange the CAU sequence
according to the rhythm, melody and emotion of the music. Inspired by these, we
systematically study such two-stage choreography approach and construct a
dataset to incorporate such choreography knowledge. Based on the constructed
dataset, we design a two-stage music-to-dance synthesis framework ChoreoNet to
imitate human choreography procedure. Our framework firstly devises a CAU
prediction model to learn the mapping relationship between music and CAU
sequences. Afterwards, we devise a spatial-temporal inpainting model to convert
the CAU sequence into continuous dance motions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ChoreoNet outperforms baseline methods (0.622 in
terms of CAU BLEU score and 1.59 in terms of user study score).

to 280 characters, a drastic switch on one of the world's most influential
social media platforms. In the first long-term study of how the new length
limit was adopted by Twitter users, we ask: Does the effect of the new length
limit resemble that of the old one? Or did the doubling of the limit
fundamentally change how Twitter is shaped by the limited length of posted
content? By analyzing Twitter's publicly available 1% sample over a period of
around 3 years, we find that, when the length limit was raised from 140 to 280
characters, the prevalence of tweets around 140 characters dropped immediately,
while the prevalence of tweets around 280 characters rose steadily for about 6
months. Despite this rise, tweets approaching the length limit have been far
less frequent after than before the switch. We find widely different adoption
rates across languages and client-device types. The prevalence of tweets around
140 characters before the switch in a given language is strongly correlated
with the prevalence of tweets around 280 characters after the switch in the
same language, and very long tweets are vastly more popular on Web clients than
on mobile clients. Moreover, tweets of around 280 characters after the switch
are syntactically and semantically similar to tweets of around 140 characters
before the switch, manifesting patterns of message squeezing in both cases.
Taken together, these findings suggest that the new 280-character limit
constitutes a new, less intrusive version of the old 140-character limit. The
length limit remains an important factor that should be considered in all
studies using Twitter data.

process. It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics,
embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to
non-equilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the
quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility,
stemming from processes in physics, chemistry and biology. Notwithstanding its
fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for
general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated.
Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open
quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial
progress in such endeavour. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new
generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes
and the impact of entropy production on them. This paper aims to provide a
compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment and
manipulation of entropy production. We present both formal aspects of its
formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of
a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments.

ordinary differential equations, adapted from the Hindmarsh-Rose model, with
two dynamical variables x(t), y(t) and an input constant parameter J_0, to
which we added a random white noise, whose solutions for the x(t) variable
reproduce consistently the X-ray light curves of several variability classes as

show that changing only the value of J_0 the system moves from stable to
unstable solutions and the resulting light curves reproduce those of the
quiescent classes like phi and chi, the delta class and the spiking rho class.
Moreover, we found that increasing the values of J_0 the system induces high
frequency oscillations that evolve to QPO when it moves into another stable
region. This system of differential equations gives then a unified view of the
variability of GRS 1915+105 in term of transitions between stable and unstable

transfer on average. In contrast, the vertically stacked double-roll mode is
inefficient for heat transfer on average. The volume-averaged $Nu_{\text{vol}}$

reproduce the correlation of internal flow structures with heat transfer

unstable equilibrium patterns: characterised by series of spikes (class rho)

optimal operation, cyberphysical MGs regulate the onsite energy generation

significantly disrupt MG operation and electricity delivery as well as impact
the grid stability. In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of

scientific areas such as personalized medicine, outbreak tracing, and the
understanding of evolution. Unfortunately, it is currently bottlenecked by the
computational power and memory bandwidth limitations of existing systems, as
many of the steps in genome sequence analysis must process a large amount of
data. A major contributor to this bottleneck is approximate string matching
(ASM).
  We propose GenASM, the first ASM acceleration framework for genome sequence
analysis. We modify the underlying ASM algorithm (Bitap) to significantly
increase its parallelism and reduce its memory footprint, and we design the
first hardware accelerator for Bitap. Our hardware accelerator consists of
specialized compute units and on-chip SRAMs that are designed to match the rate
of computation with memory capacity and bandwidth.
  We demonstrate that GenASM is a flexible, high-performance, and low-power
framework, which provides significant performance and power benefits for three
different use cases in genome sequence analysis: 1) GenASM accelerates read
alignment for both long reads and short reads. For long reads, GenASM
outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 116x and
3.9x, respectively, while consuming 37x and 2.7x less power. For short reads,
GenASM outperforms state-of-the-art software and hardware accelerators by 111x

3.7x the performance of a state-of-the-art pre-alignment filter, while
consuming 1.7x less power and significantly improving the filtering accuracy.
3) GenASM accelerates edit distance calculation, with 22-12501x and 9.3-400x

and naturally obtained as solutions of a system of two ordinary differential
equations that is able to reproduce almost all variability classes of GRS
1515+105. We modified the Hindmarsh-Rose model and obtained a system with two
dynamical variables x(t), y(t), where the first one represents the X-ray flux
from the source, and an input function J(t), whose mean level J_0 and its time
evolution is responsible of the variability class. We found that for values of
J_0 around the boundary between the unstable and the stable interval, where the
equilibrium points are of spiral type, one obtain an oscillating behaviour in
the model light curve similar to the observed ones with a broad Lorentzian
feature in the power density spectrum and, occasionally, with one or two
harmonics. Rapid fluctuations of J(t), as those originating from turbulence,
stabilize the low-frequency quasi periodic oscillations resulting in a slowly
amplitude modulated pattern.To validate the model we compared the results with
real RXTE data which resulted remarkably similar to those obtained from the
mathematical model. Our results allow us to favour an intrinsic hypothesis on
the origin of LFQPOs in accretion discs ultimately related to the same

ultraviolet (EUV), and Ly-alpha emission for F, G, K, and M dwarfs, with masses
between 0.1 and 1.2 Msun, and provide our evolutionary code and a freely
available set of evolutionary tracks for use in planetary atmosphere studies.
  Methods. We develop a physical rotational evolution model constrained by
observed rotation distributions in young stellar clusters. Using rotation,
X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha measurements, we derive empirical relations for the
dependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of
X-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young
clusters.
  Results. A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha evolution is determined by its
mass and initial rotation rate, with initial rotation being less important for
lower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are significantly more X-ray
luminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators remain
highly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary
stages, habitable zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when
orbiting lower mass stars due to their longer evolutionary timescales. The
rates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass stars
flaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone
planets are likely influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars.
  Conclusions. Our results show that single decay-laws are insufficient to
describe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for a more
comprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation, including also
the effects of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances
from their host stars receive significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over
their lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars. (abstract incomplete)

unnoticed if only the total energy of the system was considered. In this
regard, the interaction between the methane molecule and its enclosing
dodecahedral water cage, CH$_4$(H$_2$O)$_{20}$, is a stringent test for
approximate methods, including density-functional theory (DFT) approximations.
Hybrid and semilocal DFT approximations behave erratically for this system,
with three- and four-body nonadditive terms having neither the correct sign nor
magnitude. Here we analyze to what extent these qualitative errors in different
MBE contributions are conveyed to post-Kohn-Sham random-phase approximation
(RPA). The results reveal a correlation between the quality of the DFT input
states and the RPA results. Moreover, the renormalized singles energy (RSE)
corrections play a crucial role in all orders of MBE. For dimers, RSE corrects
the RPA underbinding for every tested Kohn-Sham model: generalized-gradient
approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, (meta-)GGA hybrids, as well as the optimized
effective potential at the correlated level. Remarkably, the inclusion of
singles in RPA can also correct the wrong signs of three- and four-body
nonadditive energies as well as mitigate the excessive higher-order
contributions to the MBE. The RPA errors are dominated by the contributions of
compact clusters. As a workable method for large systems, we propose to replace
those compact contributions with CCSD(T) energies and to sum up the remaining
many-body contributions up to infinity with supermolecular or periodic RPA. As
a demonstration of this approach, we show that for RPA(PBE0)+RSE it suffices to
apply CCSD(T) to dimers and 30 compact, hydrogen-bonded trimers to get the
methane-water cage interaction energy to within 1.6% of the reference value.

Existing methods require extensive tuning of parameters that control the graph
sparsity and temporal smoothness. Furthermore, these methods are
computationally burdensome with time complexity $O(NP^3)$ for $P$ variables and
$N$ time points. As a remedy, we propose a low-complexity tuning-free Bayesian

spike-and-slab priors on the graphs such that they are sparse and varying
smoothly across time. A variational inference algorithm is then derived to
learn the graph structures from the data automatically. Owning to the
pseudo-likelihood and the mean-field approximation, the time complexity of BASS
is only $O(NP^2)$. Additionally, by identifying the frequency-domain
resemblance to the time-varying graphical models, we show that BASS can be
extended to learning frequency-varying inverse spectral density matrices, and
yields graphical models for multivariate stationary time series. Numerical
results on both synthetic and real data show that that BASS can better recover
the underlying true graphs, while being more efficient than the existing
methods, especially for high-dimensional cases.

This measurement is motivated by the difference between the previous Brookhaven

deviations, which hints at the possibility of physics beyond the Standard
Model. Muons are circulated in a storage ring, and the measurement requires a
precise determination of the muon anomalous precession frequency (spin
precession relative to momentum) from the resulting decay positron time and
energy measurements collected with calorimeters. The average magnetic field
seen by the muons needs to be known with high precision, and so the storage

with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes. Detailed Muon Campus beamline and
muon storage ring simulations are also required for quantifying beam dynamics

Recent NuSTAR, Swift-BAT and \textit{Chandra} hard X-ray surveys have provided
new constraints on the space density of heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). Using the new X-ray luminosity function derived from these data, we here
estimate the accretion efficiency of SMBHs and their contribution to
reionization. We calculate the total ionizing radiation from active galactic
nuclei (AGN) as a function of redshift, based on the X radiation and
distribution of obscuring column density, converted to UV wavelengths. Limiting
the luminosity function to unobscured AGN only, our results agree with current
UV luminosity functions of unobscured AGN. For realistic assumptions about the
escape fraction, the contribution of all AGN to cosmic reionization is $\sim4$
times lower than the galaxy contribution (23% at $z\sim6$). Our results also
offer an observationally constrained prescription that can be used in
simulations or models of galaxy evolution. To estimate the average efficiency
with which supermassive black holes convert mass to light, we compare the total
radiated energy, converted from X-ray light using a bolometric correction, to
the most recent local black hole mass density. The most likely value, $\eta

Collaborative Group Learning, an efficient framework that aims to diversify the
feature representation and conduct an effective regularization. Intuitively,
similar to the human group study mechanism, we induce students to learn and
exchange different parts of course knowledge as collaborative groups. First,
each student is established by randomly routing on a modular neural network,
which facilitates flexible knowledge communication between students due to
random levels of representation sharing and branching. Second, to resist the
student homogenization, students first compose diverse feature sets by
exploiting the inductive bias from sub-sets of training data, and then
aggregate and distill different complementary knowledge by imitating a random
sub-group of students at each time step. Overall, the above mechanisms are
beneficial for maximizing the student population to further improve the model
generalization without sacrificing computational efficiency. Empirical
evaluations on both image and text tasks indicate that our method significantly
outperforms various state-of-the-art collaborative approaches whilst enhancing

evolution of shock-multicloud systems consists of four stages: a
shock-splitting phase in which reflected and refracted shocks are generated, a
compression phase in which the forward shock compresses cloud material, an
expansion phase triggered by internal heating and shock re-acceleration, and a
mixing phase in which shear instabilities generate turbulence. We compare
multicloud layers with narrow ($\sigma_{\rho}=1.9\bar{\rho}$) and wide
($\sigma_{\rho}=5.9\bar{\rho}$) log-normal density distributions characteristic
of Mach $\approx 5$ supersonic turbulence driven by solenoidal and compressive
modes. Our simulations show that outflowing cloud material contains imprints of
the density structure of their native environments. The dynamics and disruption
of multicloud systems depend on the porosity and the number of cloudlets in the
layers. `Solenoidal' layers mix less, generate less turbulence, accelerate
faster, and form a more coherent mixed-gas shell than the more porous
`compressive' layers. Similarly, multicloud systems with more cloudlets quench
mixing via a shielding effect and enhance momentum transfer. Mass loading of
diffuse mixed gas is efficient in all models, but direct dense gas entrainment
is highly inefficient. Dense gas only survives in compressive clouds, but has
low speeds. If normalised with respect to the shock-passage time, the evolution
shows invariance for shock Mach numbers $\geq10$ and different cloud-generating
seeds, and slightly weaker scaling for lower Mach numbers and thinner cloud
layers. Multicloud systems also have better convergence properties than
single-cloud systems, with a resolution of $8$ cells per cloud radius being
sufficient to capture their overall dynamics.

distort the line profiles, causing high-velocity ($\gtrsim$500 m/s) wings, and
red/blue-shifted shoulders in the line profiles. During eclipse ingress, the
SO$_2$ flux density dropped exponentially, and the atmosphere reformed in a
linear fashion when re-emerging in sunlight, with a ""post-eclipse brightening""
after $\sim$10 minutes. While both the in-eclipse decrease and in-sunlight
increase in SO was more gradual than for SO$_2$, the fact that SO decreased at
all is evidence that self-reactions at the surface are important and fast, and
that in-sunlight photolysis of SO$_2$ is the dominant source of SO.
Disk-integrated SO$_2$ in-sunlight flux densities are $\sim$2--3 times higher
than in-eclipse, indicative of a roughly 30--50\% contribution from volcanic
sources to the atmosphere. Typical column densities and temperatures are $N
\approx (1.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $T \approx 220-320$ K both
in-sunlight and in-eclipse, while the fractional coverage of the gas is 2--3
times lower in-eclipse than in-sunlight. The low level SO$_2$ emissions present
during eclipse may be sourced by stealth volcanism or be evidence of a layer of
non-condensible gases preventing complete collapse of the SO$_2$ atmosphere.
The melt in magma chambers at different volcanoes must differ in composition to
explain the absence of SO and SO$_2$, but simultaneous presence of KCl over

field in modified theories of gravity. The KR field energy density is found to
decrease with the expansion of our universe at a faster rate in comparison to
radiation and matter components. Thus as the Universe evolves and cools down,
the contribution of the KR field on the evolutionary process reduces
significantly, and at present it almost does not affect the universe evolution.
However the KR field has a significant contribution during early universe, in
particular, it affects the beginning of inflation as well as increases the
amount of primordial gravitational radiation and hence enlarges the value of
tensor to scalar ratio in respect to the case when the KR field is absent. In
regard to the KR field couplings, it turns out that in four dimensional higher
curvature inflationary model the couplings of the KR field to other matter
fields is given by $1/M_{Pl}$ i.e same as the usual gravity-matter coupling.
However in higher dimensional higher curvature model the KR couplings get an
additional suppression over $1/M_{Pl}$ and thus gives a better explanation of
why the present universe carries practically no footprint of the Kalb-Ramond
field in comparison to the 4D higher curvature model. The higher curvature term
in 5D action acts as a suitable stabilizing agent in the dynamical
stabilization mechanism of the extra dimensional modulus field from the
perspective of effective on-brane theory. Based on the evolution of KR field,
one intriguing question can be - sitting in present day universe, how do we
confirm the existence of the Kalb-Ramond field which has considerably low
energy density in our present universe but has a significant impact during

magnetorotational core-collapse supernova simulations of a 20 $M_\odot$ star
with spectral neutrino transport. Our simulations treat self-consistently the
parity violation effects of weak interaction in the presence of external
magnetic field. The result shows a significant global asymmetry, mostly
confined in the proto-neutron star, with clearly reflecting the magnetic field
structure. The asymmetric property arises from two factors: the angle between
the neutrino flux and magnetic field, and the term, which is parallel to the
magnetic field and is also proportional to the deviation of distribution
function of neutrinos from thermal equilibrium. The typical correction value
amounts to $\sim1$ % relative to the total neutrino-matter interaction rate for
the magnetic field strength of $\sim 10^{15-16}$~G. Although these asymmetric
properties do not immediately affect the explosion dynamics, our results imply
that they would be significant once the neutrinos diffuse out the proto-neutron

vision and machine learning. Given a class, CIG takes the name of this class as
input and generates a set of images that belong to this class. In existing CIG
works, for different classes, their corresponding images are generated
independently, without considering the relationship among classes. In
real-world applications, the classes are organized into a hierarchy and their
hierarchical relationships are informative for generating high-fidelity images.
In this paper, we aim to leverage the class hierarchy for conditional image
generation. We propose two ways of incorporating class hierarchy: prior control
and post constraint. In prior control, we first encode the class hierarchy,
then feed it as a prior into the conditional generator to generate images. In
post constraint, after the images are generated, we measure their consistency
with the class hierarchy and use the consistency score to guide the training of
the generator. Based on these two ideas, we propose a TreeGAN model which
consists of three modules: (1) a class hierarchy encoder (CHE) which takes the
hierarchical structure of classes and their textual names as inputs and learns
an embedding for each class; the embedding captures the hierarchical
relationship among classes; (2) a conditional image generator (CIG) which takes
the CHE-generated embedding of a class as input and generates a set of images
belonging to this class; (3) a consistency checker which performs hierarchical
classification on the generated images and checks whether the generated images
are compatible with the class hierarchy; the consistency score is used to guide
the CIG to generate hierarchy-compatible images. Experiments on various
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

complexities by utilizing effective sparsification strategies together with an

flows was demonstrated in recent experimental and numerical studies. The
QC-region, which is characterized by relatively uniform velocity magnitude and
weak turbulence levels, occupies about $40\%$ of the cross-section at Reynolds
numbers $Re_\tau$ ranging from $1000$ to $4000$. The influence of the QC region
and its boundaries on transport and accumulation of inertial particles has
never been investigated before. Here, we first demonstrate that a QC is
unidentifiable at $Re_\tau = 180$, before an in-depth exploration of
particle-laden turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau = 600$ is performed. The
inertial spheres exhibited a tendency to accumulate preferentially in
high-speed regions within the QC, i.e. contrary to the well-known concentration
in low-speed streaks in the near-wall region. The particle wall-normal
distribution, quantified by means of Vorono\""i volumes and particle number
concentrations, varied abruptly across the QC-boundary and vortical flow
structures appeared as void areas due to the centrifugal mechanism. The
QC-boundary, characterized by a localized strong shear layer, appeared as a
\emph{barrier}, across which transport of inertial particles is hindered.
Nevertheless, the statistics conditioned in QC-frame show that the mean
velocity of particles outside of the QC was towards the core, whereas particles
within the QC tended to migrate towards the wall. Such upward and downward
particle motions are driven by similar motions of fluid parcels. The present
results show that the QC exerts a substantial influence on transport and
accumulation of inertial particles, which is of practical relevance in
high-Reynolds number channel flow.

for $\sim$1.4 billion sources, but light curves and variability properties are
available for only $\sim$0.5 million of them. Here, we provide a census of
large-amplitude variables with amplitudes larger than $\sim$0.2 mag in the $G$
band for objects with mean brightnesses between 5.5 and 19 mag. To achieve
this, we rely on variability amplitude proxies in $G$, $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$
computed from the uncertainties on the magnitudes published in DR2. We then
apply successive filters to identify two subsets containing respectively
sources with reliable mean $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$ (for studies using colours)
and sources having compatible amplitude proxies in $G$, $G_{BP}$ and $G_{RP}$
(for multi-band variability studies). The full catalogue gathers $23\,315\,874$
large-amplitude variable candidates, and the two subsets with increased levels
of purity contain respectively $1\,148\,861$ and $618\,966$ sources. A
multi-band variability analysis of the catalogue shows that different types of
variable stars can be globally categorized in four groups according to their
colour and blue-to-red amplitude ratios as determined from the $G$, $G_{BP}$
and $G_{RP}$ amplitude proxies. The catalogue constitutes the first census of
Gaia large-amplitude variable candidates, extracted from the public DR2
archive. The overview presented here illustrates the added-value of the mission
for multi-band variability studies even at this stage when epoch photometry is
not yet available for all sources. (Abridged abstract)

many-body wave function. However, those of fermionic models are hard to
evaluate in standard numerical methods because they suffer from finite size
effects. We show that a so-called density embedding theory (DET) can evaluate
them without size scaling analysis in comparably high quality with those
obtained by the large-size density matrix renormalization group analysis. This
method projects the large scale original many-body Hamiltonian to the small
number of basis sets defined on a local cluster, and optimizes the choice of
these bases by tuning the local density matrix. The DET entanglement spectrum
of one-dimensional interacting fermions perfectly reproduces the exact ones and
works as a marker of the phase transition point. It is further shown that the
phase transitions in two-dimension could be determined by the entanglement
entropy and the fidelity that reflects the change of the structure of the wave
function.

from the inner edge of the disk causes the accretion of the matter onto the
center. The exponential amplification of waves takes place in the resonance
region, $ \omega = (n\pm 1)\Omega $. Here $ \omega $ is the frequency of the
acoustic wave, $ n $ is its azimuthal wave number, $ \Omega (r) $ is the
angular frequency of rotation of the disk. The effect is similar to the inverse
Landau damping in a collisionless plasma. Energy comes from the energy of
rotation of the disk. That leads to decrease of the disk angular momentum and
to accretion of the matter. The value of the accretion rate $dM/dt$ is ${\dot
M} = \pi rc_s \Sigma_0 (c_s / v_{\phi 0})^2 W $. Here $ c_s $ is the speed of
sound of the disk gas, $ v_{\phi 0} $ is the Keplerian rotation velocity,

the hard state in reverse during the outburst decay. At the end of the
outburst, MAXI J1348-630 underwent two reflares with peak fluxes ~1 and ~2
orders of magnitude fainter than the main outburst, respectively. During the
reflares, the source remained in the hard state only, without undergoing any

Different types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed at different

industry continues to grow year over year, and it has been said that we are in
a new golden age of artificial intelligence research. However, neural networks
are still often seen as a ""black box"" where learning occurs but cannot be
understood in a human-interpretable way. Since these machine learning systems
are increasingly being adopted in security contexts, it is important to explore
these interpretations. We consider an Android malware traffic dataset for
approaching this problem. Then, using the information plane, we explore how
homeomorphism affects learned representation of the data and the invariance of
the mutual information captured by the parameters on that data. We empirically
validate these results, using accuracy as a second measure of similarity of
learned representations.
  Our results suggest that although the details of learned representations and
the specific coordinate system defined over the manifold of all parameters
differ slightly, the functional approximations are the same. Furthermore, our
results show that since mutual information remains invariant under
homeomorphism, only feature engineering methods that alter the entropy of the
dataset will change the outcome of the neural network. This means that for some
datasets and tasks, neural networks require meaningful, human-driven feature
engineering or changes in architecture to provide enough information for the
neural network to generate a sufficient statistic. Applying our results can
serve to guide analysis methods for machine learning engineers and suggests
that neural networks that can exploit the convolution theorem are equally
accurate as standard convolutional neural networks, and can be more
computationally efficient.

  Performance in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring",,,,,"cs.AI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a field of research focused on
segregating constituent electrical loads in a system based only on their
aggregated signal. Significant computational resources and research time are
spent training models, often using as much data as possible, perhaps driven by
the preconception that more data equates to more accurate models and better
performing algorithms. When has enough prior training been done? When has a
NILM algorithm encountered new, unseen data? This work applies the notion of
Bayesian surprise to answer these questions which are important for both
supervised and unsupervised algorithms. We quantify the degree of surprise
between the predictive distribution (termed postdictive surprise), as well as
the transitional probabilities (termed transitional surprise), before and after
a window of observations. We compare the performance of several benchmark NILM
algorithms supported by NILMTK, in order to establish a useful threshold on the
two combined measures of surprise. We validate the use of transitional surprise
by exploring the performance of a popular Hidden Markov Model as a function of
surprise threshold. Finally, we explore the use of a surprise threshold as a
regularization technique to avoid overfitting in cross-dataset performance.
Although the generality of the specific surprise threshold discussed herein may
be suspect without further testing, this work provides clear evidence that a
point of diminishing returns of model performance with respect to dataset size
exists. This has implications for future model development, dataset
acquisition, as well as aiding in model flexibility during deployment.

studies have explored the possibility of non-biological CH4 and CO2 and related
contextual clues. Here, we investigate whether magmatic volcanic outgassing on
terrestrial planets can produce atmospheric CH4 and CO2 with a thermodynamic
model. Our model suggests that volcanoes are unlikely to produce CH4 fluxes
comparable to biological fluxes. Improbable cases where volcanoes produce
biological amounts of CH4 also produce ample carbon monoxide. We show, using a
photochemical model, that high abiotic CH4 abundances produced by volcanoes
would be accompanied by high CO abundances, which could be a detectable false
positive diagnostic. Overall, when considering known mechanisms for generating
abiotic CH4 on terrestrial planets, we conclude that observations of
atmospheric CH4 with CO2 are difficult to explain without the presence of
biology when the CH4 abundance implies a surface flux comparable to modern
Earth's biological CH4 flux. A small or negligible CO abundance strengthens the
CH4+CO2 biosignature because life readily consumes atmospheric CO, while
reducing volcanic gases likely cause CO to build up in a planet's atmosphere.
Furthermore, the difficulty of volcanically-generated CH4-rich atmospheres
suitable for an origin of life may favor alternatives such as impact-induced
reducing atmospheres.

in mid-gap states (zero modes) of a topological superconductor as bound states

facing various fields, from finance and aerospace to the IT, security, and
medical domains. However, detecting anomalies in time series data is
particularly challenging due to the vague definition of anomalies and said
data's frequent lack of labels and highly complex temporal correlations.
Current state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning methods for anomaly
detection suffer from scalability and portability issues, and may have high
false positive rates. In this paper, we propose TadGAN, an unsupervised anomaly
detection approach built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To capture
the temporal correlations of time series distributions, we use LSTM Recurrent
Neural Networks as base models for Generators and Critics. TadGAN is trained
with cycle consistency loss to allow for effective time-series data
reconstruction. We further propose several novel methods to compute
reconstruction errors, as well as different approaches to combine
reconstruction errors and Critic outputs to compute anomaly scores. To
demonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach, we test
several anomaly scoring techniques and report the best-suited one. We compare
our approach to 8 baseline anomaly detection methods on 11 datasets from
multiple reputable sources such as NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter.
The results show that our approach can effectively detect anomalies and
outperform baseline methods in most cases (6 out of 11). Notably, our method
has the highest averaged F1 score across all the datasets. Our code is open
source and is available as a benchmarking tool.

probabilistic accuracy guarantees. For a property P, the goal is to distinguish
inputs that have P from those that are far from having P with high probability
correctly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the input. In
property testing on graphs, the distance is measured by the number of edge
modifications (additions or deletions), that are necessary to transform a graph
into one with property P. Much research has focussed on the query complexity of
such algorithms, i. e. the number of queries the algorithm makes to the input,
but in view of applications, the running time of the algorithm is equally
relevant.
  In (Adler, Harwath STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree
graph model of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was
introduced, and it was shown that on databases of bounded degree and bounded
tree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic second-order logic
with counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and sublinear
running time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running
time.
  In this paper we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree
model, but the distance measure allows both edge (tuple) modifications and
vertex (element) modifications. Our main theorem shows that on databases of
bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in
CMSO is testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in
the new model. We also show that every property that is testable in the
classical model is testable in our model with the same query complexity and
running time, but the converse is not true.
  We argue that our model is natural and our meta-theorem showing constant-time
CMSO testability supports this.

power-law with exponential cut-off, and an additional iron line component. We
find no obvious indications for a CRSF and therefore perform a detailed
cyclotron line search using statistical methods on the pulse phase-averaged as
well as phase-resolved spectra. The previously detected Type II X-ray bursts
are absent. Clear pulsations at a period of 2.141124(9) Hz are detected. The
pulse profile shows an indication of a secondary peak, which was not seen at
higher flux. The 4$\sigma$ upper limit for the strength of a CRSF in the 3-20
keV band is 0.07 keV, lower than the strength of the line found at higher
luminosity. The detection of pulsations shows that the source did not enter the
""propeller"" regime, even though the source flux of $4.15\times 10^{-10}$
erg/cm$^{2}$/s was almost one order of magnitude below the threshold for the
propeller regime claimed in previous studies on this source. The transition
into the propeller regime in GRO J1744-28 must therefore be below a luminosity
of $3.2\times 10^{36}$ erg/s, which implies a surface magnetic field $\lesssim
2.9\times 10^{11}$ G and mass accretion rate $\lesssim 1.7\times 10^{16}$ g/s.
A change of the CRSF depth as function of luminosity is not unexpected and has
been observed in other sources. This result possibly implies a change in
emission geometry as function of mass accretion rate to reduce the depth of the

this paper to estimate the resilience subject to parameter uncertainties with
arbitrary distributions. For the first time and of particular importance, is
our ability to identify the probability of a node in losing its resilience and
how the different model parameters contribute to this risk. We test this using
a generic networked bi-stable system and this will aid practitioners to both
understand macro-scale behaviour and make micro-scale interventions.

with research in fields such as gender studies and sociology. As a result, they
adopt a normative view of gender as a binary choice of 'male' or 'female,'
leaving planetary scientists whose genders do not fit within that model out of
such research entirely. Reductive frameworks of gender and an overemphasis on
quantification as an indicator of gendered phenomena are harmful to people of

multiple axes of marginalization such as race, disability, and socioeconomic

the left and right images. To exploit 3D cues within stereo images, recent CNN
based methods commonly use cost volume techniques to capture stereo
correspondence over large disparities. However, since disparities can vary
significantly for stereo cameras with different baselines, focal lengths and
resolutions, the fixed maximum disparity used in cost volume techniques hinders
them to handle different stereo image pairs with large disparity variations. In
this paper, we propose a generic parallax-attention mechanism (PAM) to capture
stereo correspondence regardless of disparity variations. Our PAM integrates
epipolar constraints with attention mechanism to calculate feature similarities
along the epipolar line to capture stereo correspondence. Based on our PAM, we
propose a parallax-attention stereo matching network (PASMnet) and a
parallax-attention stereo image super-resolution network (PASSRnet) for stereo
matching and stereo image super-resolution tasks. Moreover, we introduce a new

Experimental results show that our PAM is generic and can effectively learn
stereo correspondence under large disparity variations in an unsupervised
manner. Comparative results show that our PASMnet and PASSRnet achieve the

thorough numerical experiments on artificial and real datasets. For a fair

initial target acquisition once tracking begins, a constrained Hessian search
is used to find the maximum likelihood (ML) target vector, based on the

ML vector is used to give an initial approximation of the negative log
likelihood for the target vector distribution: corrections are applied if the
Hessian is not positive definite due to the near-far problem. Further
corrections are made by applying a transformation that matches the known
nonlinearity introduced by distance-only sensors. A set of integration points
is constructed using this information, which are used to estimate the mean and

under the worst-case scenarios based on known attacks is not comprehensive, not
to mention that some of them even rarely occur in the real world. In addition,
the distribution of safety-critical data is usually multimodal, while most
traditional attacks and evaluation methods focus on a single modality. To solve
the above challenges, we propose a flow-based multimodal safety-critical

generative model is optimized with weighted likelihood maximization and a
gradient-based sampling procedure is integrated to improve the sampling
efficiency. The safety-critical scenarios are generated by querying the task
algorithms and the log-likelihood of the generated scenarios is in proportion
to the risk level. Experiments on a self-driving task demonstrate our
advantages in terms of testing efficiency and multimodal modeling capability.
We evaluate six Reinforcement Learning algorithms with our generated traffic

establish fraud as a social phenomenon in the network and use the BiRank

fraud in motor insurance as the target variable. Although we build a model for
only motor insurance, the network includes claims from all available lines of

perform well when detecting fraud and even outperform the models using only the

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of
COVID-19 infected regions in Lung CT images. In the first stage, initially,
COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete
wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the
proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images
classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the
identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we
propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically
uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This
systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed
CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region
homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with
mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a
standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the
existing deep CNN models. The performance of the proposed CoV-CTNet is
evaluated using Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure (0.98) and that of
proposed CoV-RASeg using Dice Similarity (DS) score (0.95). The promising
results on an unseen test set suggest that the proposed framework has the

of applying supervised learning to represent unclosed terms, model
discrepancies and sub-filter scales are discussed in the context of RANS and
LES modeling. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the training
procedure on the consistency of ML augmentations with the underlying physical
model. Techniques to promote model-consistent training, and to avoid the
requirement of full fields of direct numerical simulation data are detailed.
This is followed by a discussion of physics-informed and mathematical

ML-augmented RANS and LES models, outstanding challenges are discussed, and
perspectives are provided. While the promise of ML-augmented turbulence
modeling is clear, and successes have been demonstrated in isolated scenarios,
a general consensus of this paper is that truly generalizable models require
model-consistent training with careful characterization of underlying
assumptions and imposition of physically and mathematically informed priors and
constraints to account for the inevitable shortage of data relevant to
predictions of interest. Thus, machine learning should be viewed as one tool in

Simulation (LES) which makes accurate predictions of most relevant physics, but
requires extensive computational resources. The next-fidelity model types are
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) which are two orders of magnitude
cheaper, but resolve only mean quantities and model the effect of turbulence.
They often fail to accurately predict key effects, such as the wake recovery
rate. Custom RANS closures designed for wind-farm wakes exist, but so far do
not generalize well: there is substantial room for improvement. In this article
we present the first steps towards a systematic data-driven approach to
deriving new RANS models in the wind-energy setting. Time-averaged LES data is
used as ground-truth, and we first derive optimal corrective fields for the
turbulence anisotropy tensor and turbulence kinetic energy (t.k.e.) production.
These fields, when injected into the RANS equations (with a baseline
$k-\epsilon$ model) reproduce the LES mean-quantities. Next we build a custom
RANS closure from these corrective fields, using a deterministic symbolic
regression method to infer algebraic correction as a function of the (resolved)
mean-flow. The result is a new RANS closure, customized to the training data.
The potential of the approach is demonstrated under neutral atmospheric
conditions for multi-turbine constellations at wind-tunnel scale. The results
show significantly improved predictions compared to the baseline closure, for
both mean velocity and the t.k.e. fields.

sentence-level classification. Our model performs multiple sequence labeling
tasks at once using a single, shared natural language output space. Unlike
prior discriminative methods, our model naturally incorporates label semantics
and shares knowledge across tasks. Our framework is general purpose, performing
well on few-shot, low-resource, and high-resource tasks. We demonstrate these
advantages on popular named entity recognition, slot labeling, and intent
classification benchmarks. We set a new state-of-the-art for few-shot slot
labeling, improving substantially upon the previous 5-shot ($75.0\% \rightarrow
90.9\%$) and 1-shot ($70.4\% \rightarrow 81.0\%$) state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, our model generates large improvements ($46.27\% \rightarrow
63.83\%$) in low-resource slot labeling over a BERT baseline by incorporating
label semantics. We also maintain competitive results on high-resource tasks,
performing within two points of the state-of-the-art on all tasks and setting a
new state-of-the-art on the SNIPS dataset.

Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) using the IBEX-Hi (0.3 -- 6 keV) instrument
since 2008. We have developed a numerical time-depended code to calculate
globally distributed flux (GDF) of hydrogen ENAs employing both 1) 3D
kinetic-MHD model of the global heliosphere and 2) reconstruction of atom
trajectories from 1 au, where they are observed by IBEX, to the point of their
origin in the inner heliosheath (IHS). The key factor in the simulation is a
detailed kinetic consideration of the pickup ions (PUIs), the supra-thermal
component of protons in the heliosphere, which is ""parental"" to the ENAs and
originates in the region of the supersonic solar wind being picked by the
heliospheric magnetic field. As a result of our study, we have concluded that
(1) the developed model is able to reproduce the geometry of the multi-lobe
structure seen in the IBEX-Hi GDF maps, (2) the GDF is extremely sensitive to
the form of the velocity distribution function of PUIs in the IHS, and the
accounting for the existence of an additional energetic population of PUIs is
essential to explain the data, (3) despite a relatively good agreement, there
are some quantitative differences between the model calculations and IBEX-Hi
data. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.

given market conditions? The standard approach based on Markowitz or other more
or less sophisticated financial rules aims to find the best portfolio
allocation thanks to forecasted expected returns and risk but fails to fully
relate market conditions to hedging strategies decision. In contrast, Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can tackle this challenge by creating a dynamic
dependency between market information and hedging strategies allocation
decisions. In this paper, we present a realistic and augmented DRL framework
that: (i) uses additional contextual information to decide an action, (ii) has
a one period lag between observations and actions to account for one day lag
turnover of common asset managers to rebalance their hedge, (iii) is fully
tested in terms of stability and robustness thanks to a repetitive train test
method called anchored walk forward training, similar in spirit to k fold cross
validation for time series and (iv) allows managing leverage of our hedging
strategy. Our experiment for an augmented asset manager interested in sizing
and timing his hedges shows that our approach achieves superior returns and
lower risk.

is an important step toward long term weather forecasting. Standard
atmosphere-ocean coupled numerical models provide accurate sea-surface
forecasts on the scale of a few days to a few weeks, but many important weather
systems require greater foresight. In this paper we propose machine-learning
approaches sea-surface temperature forecasting that are accurate on the scale
of dozens of weeks. Our approach is based in Koopman operator theory, a useful
tool for dynamical systems modelling. With this approach, we predict sea
surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico up to 180 days into the future based
on a present image of thermal conditions and three years of historical training
data. We evaluate the combination of a basic Koopman method with a
convolutional autoencoder, and a newly proposed ""consistent Koopman"" method, in
various permutations. We show that the Koopman approach consistently
outperforms baselines, and we discuss the utility of our additional assumptions
and methods in this sea-surface temperature domain.

a laser with external cavity, for which the information is fed via electrical
injection. A task independent quantification of the computational capability of
the reservoir system is done via a complete orthonormal set of basis functions.
Our results suggest that even for constant readout dimension the total memory
capacity is dependent on the ratio between the information input period, also
called the clock cycle, and the time delay in the system. Optimal performance
is found for a time delay about 1.6 times the clock cycle
