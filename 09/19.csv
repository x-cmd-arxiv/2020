traces, including security and concurrency properties. This paper introduces a
bounded model checking (BMC) algorithm for hyperproperties expressed in
HyperLTL, which - to the best of our knowledge - is the first such algorithm.
Just as the classic BMC technique for LTL primarily aims at finding bugs, our
approach also targets identifying counterexamples. BMC for LTL is reduced to
SAT solving, because LTL describes a property via inspecting individual traces.
HyperLTL allows explicit and simultaneous quantification over traces and
describes properties that involves multiple traces and, hence, our BMC approach
naturally reduces to QBF solving. We report on successful and efficient model
checking, implemented in a tool called HyperQube, of a rich set of experiments
on a variety of case studies, including security, concurrent data structures,
path planning for robots, and testing.

task in signal processing as it can be considered as a collection of static and
dynamic classification tasks. Recognition of emotions from speech data has been
heavily relied upon end-to-end feature extraction and classification using
machine learning models, though the absence of feature selection and
optimization have restrained the performance of these methods. Recent studies
have shown that Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) have been emerged as
one of the most relied feature extraction methods, though it circumscribes the
accuracy of classification with a very small feature dimension. In this paper,
we propose that the concatenation of features, extracted by using different
existing feature extraction methods can not only boost the classification
accuracy but also expands the possibility of efficient feature selection. We
have used Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) apart from the MFCC feature extraction
method, before feature merging. Besides, we have performed a novel application
of Manta Ray optimization in speech emotion recognition tasks that resulted in
a state-of-the-art result in this field. We have evaluated the performance of
our model using SAVEE and Emo-DB, two publicly available datasets. Our proposed
method outperformed all the existing methods in speech emotion analysis and
resulted in a decent result in these two datasets with a classification

prediction of mRNA expression both as a tumour average and in spatially
resolved manner. Individual deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were
optimised to predict the expression of 17,695 genes from hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs). Predictions for 9,334 (52.75%) genes
were significantly associated with RNA-sequencing estimates (FDR adjusted
p-value < 0.05). 1,011 of the genes were brought forward for validation, with
876 (87%) and 908 (90%) successfully replicated in internal and external test

were validated in 76 genes, out of which 59 (77.6%) had a significant

(ODL) state in CuIr2S4 as a high temperature precursor to the metal-insulator
transition (MIT) opens the door to a possible widespread presence of precursor
states in scarcely studied high-temperature regimes of transition metal based
quantum materials. Although in CuIr2S4 the ODL state comprises one orbital per
Ir, there is no fundamental reason to exclude multi-orbital ODL states in
general. The MgTi2O4 spinel exhibits a MIT on cooling at Ts ~250 K, accompanied
by Ti t2g orbital ordering (OO) and spin dimerization with the average symmetry
reducing to tetragonal. It shares with CuIr2S4 the pyrochlore transition metal
sublattice with active t2g orbitals. This, together with its different orbital
filling (t2g1 vs t2g5.5) make it a candidate for hosting a multi-orbital ODL
precursor state. By combining x-ray and neutron pair distribution function
analyses to track the evolution of the local atomic structure across the MIT we
find that local tetragonality already exists in the metallic globally cubic
phase at high temperature. Local distortions exist up to at least 500 K.
Significantly, the high temperature local state is not continuously connected
to the OO band insulator ground state, and so the transition cannot be
characterized as a trivial order-disorder type. The shortest Ti-Ti spin singlet
dimer bonds expand abruptly on warming across the transition but remain shorter
than those seen in the cubic structure. These seemingly contradictory
observations can be understood within the model of a local fluctuating
two-orbital t2g ODL precursor state. The ODL state in MgTi2O4 has a correlation
length of about 1 nm at high temperature. We discuss that this extended
character of the local distortions is consistent with the two-orbital nature of
the ODL state imposed by the charge filling and the bond charge repulsion.

biases built-in, which often impact performance in nontrivial ways. The model's
faithfulness is often measured by comparing the newly generated graph against
the source graph using any number or combination of graph properties.
Differences in the size or topology of the generated graph, therefore, indicate
a loss in the model. Yet, in many systems, errors encoded in loss functions are
subtle and not well understood. In the present work, we introduce the Infinity
Mirror test for analyzing the robustness of graph models. This straightforward
stress test works by repeatedly fitting a model to its own outputs. A
hypothetically perfect graph model would have no deviation from the source
graph; however, the model's implicit biases and assumptions are exaggerated by
the Infinity Mirror test, exposing potential issues that were previously
obscured. Through an analysis of thousands of experiments on synthetic and
real-world graphs, we show that several conventional graph models degenerate in
exciting and informative ways. We believe that the observed degenerative
patterns are clues to the future development of better graph models.

wavefunction methods that have been categorically shown to yield accurate
interaction energies for small organic molecules. These methods provide
valuable reference information for widely-used semi-empirical and machine
learning potentials, especially where experimental information is scarce.
However, agreement for systems beyond small molecules is a crucial remaining
milestone for cementing the benchmark accuracy of these methods. Approaching
such well-converged predictive power in larger molecules has motivated major
developments in CCSD(T) as well as DMC algorithms in the past years, resulting
in orders of magnitude time-to-solution reductions. Here, we show that CCSD(T)

polarizable supramolecules. Whilst agreement is found for some of the
complexes, in a few key systems disagreements of up to 8 kcal/mol remained.
This leads to differences of up to 6 orders of magnitude in the corresponding
binding association constant at room temperature for systems which are well
within the accustomed domain of applicability for both methods. These findings
thus indicate that more caution is required when aiming at reproducible
non-covalent interactions between extended molecules. Our data contradicts the
expectation that the most comprehensive and robust wavefunction methods predict
identical non-covalent interactions and indicate an unsolved challenge for

videos, and differentiated interaction, which can become sources of new kinds
of faults. This paper presents an overview of the main VR characteristics that
can have an impact on verification, validation, and testing (VV&T).
Furthermore, it analyzes some of the most successful VR open-source projects to
draw a picture concerning the danger of the lack of software testing
activities. We compared the current state of software testing practice in
open-source VR projects and evaluate how the lack of testing can be damaging to
the development of a product. We assessed the incidence of code smells and
verified how such projects behave concerning the tendency to present faults.
The results showed that the practice of software testing is not yet widespread
in the development of VR applications. It was also found that there is a high
incidence of code smells in VR projects. Regarding fault-proneness the results
showed that about 12.2% of the classes analyzed in VR projects are fault-prone.
Regarding the application of software testing techniques on VR projects, it was
observed that only a small number of projects are concerned about developing
test cases for VR projects, perhaps because we still do not have the necessary
tools to help in this direction. Concerning smells, we concluded that there is
a high incidence in VR projects, especially regarding implementing smells and
this high incidence can have a significant influence on faults. Finally, the
study related to fault proneness pointed out that the lack of software testing
activity is a significant risk to the success of the projects.

larger scale wave propagation problem. Pressure field and nonlinear loads on

extreme wave steepness, up to $H/\lambda=0.2$ ($H$ is the crest-to-trough wave

as the stress-strain curve of glasses under quasistatic shear. Here, instead of
a global shear, we consider an alternative driving protocol as recently
introduced in Ref. [1], which consists of randomly assigning a constant local
displacement on each particle, with a finite spatial correlation length. We
show that, in the infinite-dimension limit, the mean-field dynamics under such
a random forcing is strictly equivalent to that under global shear, upon a
simple rescaling of the accumulated strain. Moreover, the scaling factor is
essentially given by the variance of the relative local displacements on
interacting pairs of particles, which encodes the presence of a finite spatial
correlation. In this framework, global shear is simply a special case of a much
broader family of local forcing, that can be explored by tuning its spatial
correlations. We discuss specifically the implications on the quasistatic
driving of glasses -- initially prepared at a replica-symmetric equilibrium --
and how the corresponding 'stress-strain'-like curves and the elastic moduli
can be rescaled onto their quasistatic-shear counterparts. These results hint
at a unifying framework for establishing rigourous analogies, at the mean-field

a metallicity of [M/H] = $-0.2 - 0.0$. These values are consistent with
previous estimates from atmospheric modeling and the currently favored young
age of the system ($<$50 Myr). We derive a C/O ratio of 0.70$_{-0.24}^{+0.09}$

the slightly subsolar metallicity, implies a composition consistent with that

relationship between these perturbations and distributional shifts by
visualizing adversarial features. Our proposed method, Adversarial Batch
Normalization (AdvBN), is a single network layer that generates worst-case
feature perturbations during training. By fine-tuning neural networks on
adversarial feature distributions, we observe improved robustness of networks
to various unseen distributional shifts, including style variations and image
corruptions. In addition, we show that our proposed adversarial feature
perturbation can be complementary to existing image space data augmentation
methods, leading to improved performance. The source code and pre-trained

on two pillars: state aggregation -- as the algorithmic infrastructure; and
central-limit-theorem-type approximations -- as the mathematical underpinning
of optimality guarantees. The theory is grounded in recent work Braverman et al
(2020} that relates the solution of the Bellman equation to that of a PDE
where, in the spirit of the central limit theorem, the transition matrix is
reduced to its local first and second moments. Solving the PDE is
$\textit{not}$ required by our method. Instead, we construct a ""sister""
(controlled) Markov chain whose two local transition moments are approximately
identical with those of the focal chain. Because of this $\textit{moment
matching}$, the original chain and its ""sister"" are coupled through the PDE, a
coupling that facilitates optimality guarantees. Embedded into standard soft
aggregation algorithms, moment matching provided a disciplined mechanism to
tune the aggregation and disaggregation probabilities. The computational gains
arise from the reduction of the effective state space from $N$ to
$N^{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}$ is as one might intuitively expect from
approximations grounded in the central limit theorem.

ensembles of numerical simulations are necessary to give accurate theoretical
predictions of the statistics of observables. High-fidelity simulations come at
a towering computational cost. Therefore, approximate but fast simulations,
surrogates, are widely used to gain speed at the price of introducing model
error. We propose a general method that exploits the correlation between
simulations and surrogates to compute fast, reduced-variance statistics of
large-scale structure observables without model error at the cost of only a few
simulations. We call this approach Convergence Acceleration by Regression and
Pooling (CARPool). In numerical experiments with intentionally minimal tuning,
we apply CARPool to a handful of GADGET-III $N$-body simulations paired with
surrogates computed using COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA). We find
$\sim 100$-fold variance reduction even in the non-linear regime, up to
$k_\mathrm{max} \approx 1.2$ $h {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for the matter power spectrum.
CARPool realises similar improvements for the matter bispectrum. In the nearly
linear regime CARPool attains far larger sample variance reductions. By
comparing to the 15,000 simulations from the Quijote suite, we verify that the
CARPool estimates are unbiased, as guaranteed by construction, even though the
surrogate misses the simulation truth by up to $60\%$ at high $k$. Furthermore,
even with a fully configuration-space statistic like the non-linear matter
density probability density function, CARPool achieves unbiased variance
reduction factors of up to $\sim 10$, without any further tuning. Conversely,
CARPool can be used to remove model error from ensembles of fast surrogates by
combining them with a few high-accuracy simulations.

through blow-ups and singular perturbation, allows the extension of Filippov

switching manifold consists of an algebraic manifold with transversal
self-intersection are considered. This configuration, known as double
discontinuity, represents systems with two switches and whose singular part
consists of a straight line, where ordinary Filippov dynamics is not directly
applicable. For the general, non-linear case, beyond defining the so-called
fundamental dynamics over the singular part, general theorems on its

a representative set of stellar trajectories adaptable to the
integrals-of-motion space and it is designed to deal with non-parametric
stellar and DM densities. SMART's efficiency is demonstrated by application to
a realistic N-body merger simulation including supermassive black holes which
we model from five different projections. When providing the true viewing
angles, 3D stellar luminosity profile and normalized DM halo, we can (i)
reproduce the intrinsic velocity moments and anisotropy profile with a
precision of ~1% and (ii) recover the black hole mass, stellar mass-to-light
ratio and DM normalization to better than a few percent accuracy. This
precision is smaller than the currently discussed differences between
initial-stellar-mass functions and scatter in black hole scaling relations.
Further tests with toy models suggest that the recovery of the anisotropy in
triaxial galaxies is almost unique when the potential is known and full LOSVDs
are fitted. We show that orbit models even allow the reconstruction of full
intrinsic velocity distributions, which contain more information than the
classical anisotropy parameter. Surprisingly, the orbit library for the
analysed N-body simulation's gravitational potential contains orbits with net

We find that, after a few Alfv\'en times, magnetic field lines in the ergostar

both cases into a helical funnel within which matter begins to flow outward.
The maximum Lorentz factor in the outflow is $\Gamma_L \sim 2.5$, while the
force-free parameter holds at $B^2/8\pi\rho_0\lesssim 10$. These values are
incompatible with highly relativistic, magnetically-driven outflows (jets) and
short $\gamma$-ray bursts. We compare these results with those of a spinning
black hole surrounded by a magnetized, massless accretion disk that launches a
bona fide jet. Our simulations suggest that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for
launching relativistic jets only operates when a black hole is present, though
the Poynting luminosity in all cases is comparable. Therefore, one cannot
distinguish a magnetized, accreting black hole from a magnetized hypermassive
neutron star in the so-called mass-gap based solely on the value of the
observed Poynting luminosity. These results complement our previous studies of

prior to the epoch of reionization. However, such models rely on empirical
constraints for the X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star-forming
galaxies, which are currently lacking for low-metallicity galaxies. Using a
combination of Chandra, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR observations, we present new
constraints on the 0.3-30 keV SED of the low-metallicity starburst galaxy VV
114, which is known to host several ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with
luminosities above 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We use an archival Chandra
observation of VV 114 to constrain the contributions to the X-ray SED from the
major X-ray emitting components of the galaxy, and newly acquired, nearly
simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations to extend the spectral model
derived from Chandra to cover the 0.3-30 keV range. Using our best-fit
galaxy-wide spectral model, we derive the 0.3-30 keV SED of VV 114, which we
find is dominated by emission from the XRB population, and in particular ULXs,
at energies > 1.5 keV, and which we find to have an elevated galaxy-integrated
X-ray luminosity per unit star formation rate relative to higher-metallicity
star-forming galaxies. We discuss our results in terms of the effect of
metallicity on XRB populations and the hot ISM, and the importance of X-ray
emission from star-forming galaxies in the high redshift Universe.

observed tangential solar wind speeds as high as $\sim50$km/s in a localized

throughout the corona, it would imply that the solar wind angular momentum-loss
rate is an order of magnitude larger than all of those previous estimations. In
this letter, we evaluate the angular momentum flux in the solar wind, using
data from the first two orbits of PSP. The solar wind is observed to contain
both large positive (as seen during perihelion), and negative angular momentum
fluxes. We analyse two solar wind streams that were repeatedly traversed by
PSP; the first is a slow wind stream whose average angular momentum flux
fluctuates between positive to negative, and the second is an intermediate
speed stream containing a positive angular momentum flux (more consistent with
a constant flow of angular momentum). When the data from PSP is evaluated
holistically, the average equatorial angular momentum flux implies a global
angular momentum-loss rate of around $2.6-4.2\times 10^{30}$ erg (which is more
consistent with observations from previous spacecraft).

model, which shows an intimate relation to the non-diagonal conformal field
theory and has a constrained pattern of motion for bulk quasiparticles,
featuring a non-trivial interplay between charge symmetry and translation
symmetry. The non-diagonal state is established as a distinctive
symmetry-enriched topological order. Aside from the usual $U(1)$ charge sector,
there is an additional symmetry-enriched neutral sector described by the
quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, which relies on the presence
of both the $U(1)$ charge symmetry and the $\mathbb{Z}$ translation symmetry of
the wire model. Translation symmetry distinguishes non-diagonal states from
Laughlin states, in a way similar to how it distinguishes weak topological
insulators from trivial band insulators. Moreover, the translation symmetry in
non-diagonal states can be associated to the
$\mathbf{e}\leftrightarrow\mathbf{m}$ anyonic symmetry in
$\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, implying the role of dislocations as two-fold
twist-defects. The boundary theory of non-diagonal states is derived
microscopically. For the edge perpendicular to the direction of wires, the
effective Hamiltonian has two components: a chiral Luttinger liquid and a
generalized $p$-state clock model. Importantly, translation symmetry in the
bulk is realized as self-duality on the edge. The symmetric edge is thus either
gapless or gapped with spontaneously broken symmetry. For $p=2,3$, the
respective electron tunneling exponents are predicted for experimental probes.

the baryonic component of the galaxies, or they assume the properties of the
dark matter (DM) particle to depart from the CDM hypothesis. Here we propose an
alternative yet complementary explanation. We argue that cores are unavoidable
in the self-gravitating systems of maximum entropy resulting from non-extensive
statistical mechanics. Their structure follows from the Tsallis entropy,
suitable for systems with long-range interactions. Strikingly, the mass density
profiles predicted by such thermodynamic equilibrium match the observed cores
without any adjustment or tuning. Thus, the principle of maximum Tsallis
entropy explains the presence of cores in dwarf galaxies.

Using a fiducial density structure based on a typical ringed disk, we simulate
line emission for the hyperfine components of the CN $J = 1-0$ transition with
the POLARIS radiative transfer code. Since the expected magnetic field and
typical CN distribution in PPDs remain largely unconstrained, we produce models
with several different configurations. Corresponding integrated Stokes $I$ and
$V$ profiles and 0.4 km/s resolution, 1'' beam convolved channel maps are
presented. We demonstrate that the emission signatures from toroidally
dominated magnetic fields are distinguishable from vertically dominated
magnetic field based on channel map morphology. Due to line-of-sight and beam
cancellation effects, disks with toroidal $\boldsymbol{B}$-field configurations
result in significantly diminished Stokes $V$ emission. Complex magnetic fields
therefore render the traditionally used method for inferring line-of-sight
magnetic field strengths (i.e., fitting the derivative of the Stokes $I$ to the
Stokes $V$ profile) ambiguous, since a given intrinsic field strength can yield
a variety of Stokes $V$ amplitudes depending on the magnetic field geometry. In
addition, gas gaps can create structure in the integrated Stokes $V$ profile
that might mimic magnetic substructure. This method should therefore be applied
with caution in PPD environments, and can only confidently be used as a measure

  Studies",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In genome-wide association studies (GWASs), there is an increasing need for
detecting the associations between a genetic variant and multiple traits. In
studies of complex diseases, it is common to measure several potentially
correlated traits in a single GWAS. Despite the multivariate nature of the
studies, single-trait-based methods remain the most widely-adopted analysis
procedure, owing to their simplicity for studies with multiple traits as their
outcome. However, the association between a genetic variant and a single trait
sometimes can be weak, and ignoring the actual correlation among traits may
lose power. On the contrary, multiple-trait analysis, a method analyzes a group
of traits simultaneously, has been proven to be more powerful by incorporating
information from the correlated traits. Although existing methods have been
developed for multiple traits, several drawbacks limit their wide application
in GWASs. In this paper, we propose a multiple-trait adaptive Fisher's (MTAF)
method to test associations between a genetic variant and multiple traits at
once, by adaptively aggregating evidence from each trait. The proposed method
can accommodate both continuous and binary traits and it has reliable
performance under various scenarios. Using a simulation study, we compared our
proposed method with several existing methods and demonstrated its
competitiveness in terms of type I error control and statistical power. By
applying the method to the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE)
dataset, we successfully identified several genes associated with substance
dependence.

that such triaxial dark matter halos should exhibit steady figure rotation or
tumbling motions for durations of several gigayears. The angular frequency of
figure rotation predicted by cosmological simulations is described by a
log-normal distribution of pattern speed with a median value 0.15hkm/s/kpc (~
0.15h rad/Gyr ~ 9h deg/Gyr) and a width of 0.83km/s/kpc. These pattern speeds
are so small that they have generally been considered both unimportant and
undetectable. In this work we show that even this extremely slow figure
rotation can significantly alter the structure of extended stellar streams
produced by the tidal disruption of satellites in the Milky Way halo. We
simulate the behavior of a Sagittarius-like polar tidal stream in triaxial dark
matter halos with different shapes, when the halos are rotated about the three
principal axes. For pattern speeds typical of cosmological halos we
demonstrate, for the first time, that a Sagittarius-like tidal stream would be
altered to a degree that is detectable even with current observations. This
discovery will potentially allow for a future measurement of figure rotation of
the Milky Way's dark halo, and perhaps enabling the first evidence of this

expressed as a sum of noninteracting quasi-spins imposed by an effective time
dependent magnetic field (Schwinger-Rabi model). The calculated Chern number
indicates that there is a topological transition from nonadiabatic to adiabatic
regime. In the adiabatic regime, the quasi-spins trace the time dependent
effective magnetic field and then oscillate between spin up and down states.
While in the nonadiabatic regime, the quasi-spins cannot follow the time
dependent effective magnetic field and feel an average magnetic field. We find
the range of driving frequency over which the quasi-spins experience adiabatic
cyclic processes. Moreover, we obtain the exact expression of the Loschmidt

The results represent that both pure and mixed states dynamical phase

minimum required driving frequency for the appearance of Floquet DQPT is equal
to the threshold frequency needed for transition from nonadiabatic to adiabatic

of nonlinear shear flows multiplied by a stationary, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)

white noise or plug flows. For the former case with linear shear, recent
studies \cite{camassa2019symmetry} numerically demonstrated that the decaying
passive scalar's long time limiting probability distribution function (PDF)
could be negatively skewed in the presence of impermeable channel boundaries,
in contrast to rigorous results in free space which established the limiting
PDF is positively skewed \cite{mclaughlin1996explicit}. Here, the role of
boundaries in setting the long time limiting skewness of the PDF is established
rigorously for the above class using the long time asymptotic expansion of the
$N$-point correlator of the random field obtained from the ground state
eigenvalue perturbation approach proposed in \cite{bronski1997scalar}. Our
analytical result verifies the conclusion for the linear shear flow obtained
from numerical simulations in \cite{camassa2019symmetry}. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the limiting distribution is negatively skewed for any shear
flow at sufficiently low P\'eclet number. We show that the long time limit of
the first three moments depends explicitly on the value of $\gamma$, which is
in contrast to the conclusion in \cite{vanden2001non} for the limiting PDF in

a package vulnerability is assigned a low threat level if it was hidden or
still unknown at the time it was used in the dependent application (t), medium
threat level if the vulnerability was reported but not yet published at t, and
high if it was publicly announced at t. Then, we perform an empirical study
involving 6,673 real-world, active, and mature open source Node.js
applications. Our findings show that although 67.93% of the examined
applications depend on at least one vulnerable package, 94.91% of the
vulnerable packages in those affected applications are classified as having low
threat. Moreover, we find that in the case of vulnerable packages classified as
having high threat, it is the application's lack of updating that makes them
vulnerable, i.e., it is not the existence of the vulnerability that is the real
problem. Furthermore, we verify our findings at different stages of the
application's lifetime and find that our findings still hold. Our study argues
that when it comes to software vulnerabilities, things may not be as bad as
they seem and that considering vulnerability threat is key.

from a group of distributed clients under the privacy-preserving constraint. In
this work, we show that this paradigm might inherit the adversarial
vulnerability of the centralized neural network, i.e., it has deteriorated
performance on adversarial examples when the model is deployed. This is even
more alarming when federated learning paradigm is designed to approximate the
updating behavior of a centralized neural network. To solve this problem, we
propose an adversarially robust federated learning framework, named Fed_BVA,
with improved server and client update mechanisms. This is motivated by our
observation that the generalization error in federated learning can be
naturally decomposed into the bias and variance triggered by multiple clients'
predictions. Thus, we propose to generate the adversarial examples via
maximizing the bias and variance during server update, and learn the
adversarially robust model updates with those examples during client update. As
a result, an adversarially robust neural network can be aggregated from these
improved local clients' model updates. The experiments are conducted on
multiple benchmark data sets using several prevalent neural network models, and
the empirical results show that our framework is robust against white-box and

of the near-horizon modification to a black hole geometry manifests itself as
delayed echoes in the ringdown (i.e. the postmerger phase) of a binary black

sampling technique called Vector Quantization (VQ) is adapted for this data as
well. VQ has recently given promising results for genome data.
  The novelty of our SC with Pivotal Sampling algorithm is in constructing the
crucial similarity matrix for the clustering algorithm and defining
probabilities for the sampling technique. Although our algorithm can be applied
to any plant genotypes, we test it on the phenotypic data obtained from about
2400 Soybean genotypes. SC with Pivotal Sampling achieves substantially more
accuracy (in terms of Silhouette Values) than all the other proposed
competitive clustering with sampling algorithms (i.e. SC with VQ, HC with
Pivotal Sampling, and HC with VQ). The complexities of our SC with Pivotal
Sampling algorithm and these three variants are almost same because of the
involved sampling. In addition to this, SC with Pivotal Sampling outperforms
the standard HC algorithm in both accuracy and computational complexity. We
experimentally show that we are up to 45% more accurate than HC in terms of
clustering accuracy. The computational complexity of our algorithm is more than

generate template emission spectra from a 3D atmospheric circulation model of

because they show extreme enrichments of heavy elements such as Ge, Sr, Y, and
Zr, strikingly similar in both stars. Also their light oscillations are
similar, but occur at periods incompatible with standard pulsation theory. We
investigate the metal abundances in both stars and validate the pulsations in
Feige 46 using its recent TESS light curve. High-resolution spectroscopy is
combined with non-LTE model atmospheres calculated with Tlusty and Synspec to
determine metal abundances consistently. Many lines are identified with
transitions originating from Ga III, Ge III-IV, Se III, Kr III, Sr II-III, Y
III, Zr III-IV, and Sn IV, most of which have not been observed so far in any

metals being slightly more abundant in Feige 46 while Zr, Sn, and Pb are
slightly less enhanced compared to LS IV$-$14$^\circ$116. Both abundance
patterns are distinctively different from those of He-poor subdwarfs of similar
temperature. The enrichment in heavy metals of more than 4 dex compared to the
Sun is likely the result of strong atmospheric diffusion processes while the
stars' similar patterns of C, N, O, and Ne abundances might provide clues to
their as yet unclear evolutionary history. Finally, we find that the periods of
the pulsation modes in Feige 46 are stable to better than $\dot{P} \lesssim

new insight is provided by revisiting the P3HT:PCBM blend, which is still one
of the best performers regarding reduced recombination. By changing small
details in the annealing procedure, two model morphologies were prepared that
vary in phase separation, molecular order and phase purity, as revealed by
electron tomography and optical spectroscopy. Both systems behave very
similarly with respect to charge generation and transport, but differ
significantly in bimolecular recombination. Only the system containing P3HT
aggregates of high crystalline quality and purity is found to achieve
exceptionally low recombination rates. The high-quality aggregates support
charge delocalization, which assists the re-dissociation of interfacial
charge-transfer states formed upon the encounter of free carriers. For devices
with the optimized morphology, an exceptional long hole diffusion length is
found, which allows them to work as Shockley-type solar cells even in thick
junctions of 300 nm. In contrast, the encounter rate and the size of the
phase-separated domains appears to be less important.

  https://github.com/mossr/CrossEntropyVariants.jl",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The cross-entropy (CE) method is a popular stochastic method for optimization
due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Designed for rare-event simulations
where the probability of a target event occurring is relatively small, the
CE-method relies on enough objective function calls to accurately estimate the
optimal parameters of the underlying distribution. Certain objective functions
may be computationally expensive to evaluate, and the CE-method could
potentially get stuck in local minima. This is compounded with the need to have
an initial covariance wide enough to cover the design space of interest. We
introduce novel variants of the CE-method to address these concerns. To
mitigate expensive function calls, during optimization we use every sample to
build a surrogate model to approximate the objective function. The surrogate
model augments the belief of the objective function with less expensive
evaluations. We use a Gaussian process for our surrogate model to incorporate
uncertainty in the predictions which is especially helpful when dealing with
sparse data. To address local minima convergence, we use Gaussian mixture
models to encourage exploration of the design space. We experiment with
evaluation scheduling techniques to reallocate true objective function calls
earlier in the optimization when the covariance is the largest. To test our
approach, we created a parameterized test objective function with many local
minima and a single global minimum. Our test function can be adjusted to
control the spread and distinction of the minima. Experiments were run to
stress the cross-entropy method variants and results indicate that the
surrogate model-based approach reduces local minima convergence using the same
number of function evaluations.

rank-1 moments requires an analytic approximation for the rank-2 and higher

fundamental analytic closure assumptions, quantify proposed closure errors, and
test an extension of the MEFD closure to the rank-3 moment. We demonstrate that
the fundamental assumptions employed in all analytic closures are strongly

equatorial disk and the evacuated polar regions. Finally, we calculate the
neutrino momentum and energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation,
and demonstrate that a moment-based annihilation power calculation is accurate
to at most ~20% if the rank-2 and higher moments are neglected. Out of a
selection of 8 closures in the literature, we demonstrate that different
closures reproduce different aspects of the radiation field (pressure tensor,
rank-3 tensor, pair annihilation rate), though the MEFD, Levermore, and Janka 2

enriching the intergalactic medium, and shaping the circumgalactic gas.
However, the long-term evolution of these winds remains mostly unknown. We

luminosities, temperatures, and densities indicate that the emission comes from
shocked material, and the O/Fe ratio implies that the X-ray emitting gas is
enriched by Type II supernovae. If so, the speed inferred from simple shock
models is about 500 km/s, which is sufficient to escape the galaxy. However,
the inferred kinetic energy in the wind from visible components is

the majority of the decision burden remains on the user. To relieve this
burden, researchers are working on closed-loop solutions that combine a
continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump with a control algorithm in an

amount of insulin. Here, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for
automated blood glucose control. Through a series of experiments, we compare
the performance of different deep RL approaches to non-RL approaches. We
highlight the flexibility of RL approaches, demonstrating how they can adapt to
new individuals with little additional data. On over 2.1 million hours of data
from 30 simulated patients, our RL approach outperforms baseline control
algorithms: leading to a decrease in median glycemic risk of nearly 50% from
8.34 to 4.24 and a decrease in total time hypoglycemic of 99.8%, from 4,610
days to 6. Moreover, these approaches are able to adapt to predictable meal
times (decreasing average risk by an additional 24% as meals increase in
predictability). This work demonstrates the potential of deep RL to help people

error ellipse of the previously unassociated Fermi Large Area Telescope
$\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J0407.7--5702. A 22 ksec observation from
XMM-Newton/EPIC shows an X-ray light curve with rapid variability and flaring.
The X-ray spectrum is well-fit by a hard power law with $\Gamma = 1.7$. Optical
photometry taken over several epochs is dominated by aperiodic variations of
moderate amplitude. Optical spectroscopy with SOAR and Gemini reveals a blue
continuum with broad and double-peaked H and He emission, as expected for an
accretion disk around a compact binary. Overall, the optical, X-ray, and
$\gamma$-ray properties of 4FGL J0407.7--5702 are consistent with a
classification as a transitional millisecond pulsar in the sub-luminous disk
state. We also present evidence that this source is more distant than other
confirmed or candidate transitional millisecond pulsar binaries, and that the
ratio of X-ray to $\gamma$-ray flux is a promising tool to help identify such
binaries, indicating that a more complete census for these rare systems is
becoming possible.

  Functions for Safe Automated Driving",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a stochastic prediction-control framework to promote safety in
automated driving by directly controlling the joint state probability density
functions (PDFs) subject to the vehicle dynamics via trajectory-level state
feedback. To illustrate the main ideas, we focus on a multi-lane highway
driving scenario although the proposed framework can be adapted to other
contexts. The computational pipeline consists of a PDF prediction layer,
followed by a PDF control layer. The prediction layer performs moving horizon
nonparametric forecasts for the ego and the non-ego vehicles' stochastic
states, and thereby derives safe target PDF for the ego. The latter is based on
the forecasted collision probabilities, and promotes the probabilistic safety
for the ego. The PDF control layer designs a feedback that optimally steers the
joint state PDF subject to the controlled ego dynamics while satisfying the
endpoint PDF constraints. Our computation for the PDF prediction layer
leverages the structure of the controlled Liouville PDE to evolve the joint PDF
values, as opposed to empirically approximating the PDFs. Our computation for
the PDF control layer leverages the differential flatness structure in vehicle
dynamics. We harness recent theoretical and algorithmic advances in optimal
mass transport, and the Schr\""{o}dinger bridge. The numerical simulations
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

through multi-pass coding. Referenceless prediction-based methods show
practical benefits compared with multi-pass coding to avoid excessive
computational resource consumption, especially in low-latency circumstances.
However, most of them fail to predict precisely due to the complex inner
structure of modern codecs. Therefore, to improve the fidelity of prediction,
we propose a referenceless prediction-based R-QP modeling (PmR-QP) method to
estimate bitrate by leveraging a deep learning algorithm with only one-pass
coding. It refines the global rate-control paradigm in modern codecs on
flexibility and applicability with few adjustments as possible. By exploring
the potentials of bitstream and pixel features from the prerequisite of
one-pass coding, it can reach the expectation of bitrate estimation in terms of
precision. To be more specific, we first describe the R-QP relationship curve
as a robust quadratic R-QP modeling function derived from the Cauchy-based
distribution. Second, we simplify the modeling function by fastening one
operational point of the relationship curve received from the coding process.
Third, we learn the model parameters from bitstream and pixel features, named
them hybrid referenceless features, comprising texture information,
hierarchical coding structure, and selected modes in intra-prediction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method significantly decreases
the proportion of samples' bitrate estimation error within 10% by 24.60% on
average over the state-of-the-art.

accumulation of active particles in low activity regions has led to the general

ability to process information and to control motion. We show that
self-propelled particles display chemotaxis and move into regions of higher
activity, if the particles perform work on passive objects, or cargo, to which
they are bound. The origin of this cooperative chemotaxis is the exploration of
the activity gradient by the active particle when bound to a load, resulting in
an average excess force on the load in the direction of higher activity. Using
a minimalistic theoretical model, we capture the most relevant features of
these active-passive dimers and in particular we predict the crossover between
anti-chemotactic and chemotactic behaviour. Moreover we show that merely
connecting active particles to chains is sufficient to obtain the crossover
from anti-chemotaxis to chemotaxis with increasing chain length. Such an active
complex is capable of moving up a gradient of activity such as provided by a
gradient of fuel and to accumulate where the fuel concentration is at its
maximum. The observed transition is of significance to proto-forms of life
enabling them to locate a source of nutrients even in the absence of any

new root grid. This new root grid contains similar structures as the original,
but allows for a smaller box volume and different grid resolution that can be
tuned to best suit a given simulation code. To minimally disturb the zoom
region, the dark matter particles and gas cells from the original zoom region
are placed within the new root grid, with no modification other than a bulk
velocity offset to match the systemic velocity of the corresponding region in
the new root grid. We validate this method using a zoom-in initial condition
containing a Local Group analog. We run collisionless simulations using the
original and modified initial conditions, finding good agreement. The dark
matter halo masses of the two most massive galaxies at $z=0$ match the original
to within 15%. The times and masses of major mergers are reproduced well, as
are the full dark matter accretion histories. While we do not reproduce
specific satellite galaxies found in the original simulation, we obtain
qualitative agreement in the distributions of the maximum circular velocity and
the distance from the central galaxy. We also examine the runtime speedup
provided by this method for full hydrodynamic simulations with the ART code. We
find that reducing the root grid cell size improves performance, but the
increased particle and cell numbers can negate some of the gain. We test
several realizations, with our best runs achieving a speedup of nearly a factor
of two.

attacks, where an attacker can monitor access patterns of a victim by evicting
victim cache lines using cache-set conflicts. Recent mitigations propose
randomized mapping of addresses to cache lines to obfuscate the locations of
set-conflicts. However, these are vulnerable to new attacks that discover
conflicting sets of addresses despite such mitigations, because these designs
select eviction-candidates from a small set of conflicting lines.
  This paper presents Mirage, a practical design for a fully associative cache,
wherein eviction candidates are selected randomly from all lines resident in
the cache, to be immune to set-conflicts. A key challenge for enabling such
designs in large shared caches (containing tens of thousands of cache lines) is
the complexity of cache-lookup, as a naive design can require searching through
all the resident lines. Mirage achieves full-associativity while retaining
practical set-associative lookups by decoupling placement and replacement,
using pointer-based indirection from tag-store to data-store to allow a newly
installed address to globally evict the data of any random resident line. To
eliminate set-conflicts, Mirage provisions extra invalid tags in a
skewed-associative tag-store design where lines can be installed without
set-conflict, along with a load-aware skew-selection policy that guarantees the
availability of sets with invalid tags. Our analysis shows Mirage provides the
global eviction property of a fully-associative cache throughout system
lifetime (violations of full-associativity, i.e. set-conflicts, occur less than
once in 10^4 to 10^17 years), thus offering a principled defense against any
eviction-set discovery and any potential conflict based attacks. Mirage incurs
limited slowdown (2%) and 17-20% extra storage compared to a non-secure cache.

loss, as modern client processors operate across a wide spectrum of power

workloads by dynamically allocating PDNs to processor domains. FlexWatts is
based on three key ideas. First, it combines IVRs and LDOs in a novel way to
share multiple on-chip and off-chip resources. This hybrid PDN is allocated for
processor domains with a wide power consumption range and it dynamically
switches between two modes: IVR-Mode and LDO-Mode, depending on the power
consumption. Second, for all other processor domains, FlexWatts statically
allocates off-chip VRs. Third, FlexWatts introduces a prediction algorithm that
switches the hybrid PDN to the mode that is the most beneficial. To evaluate

whether [C II] is indeed a robust indicator of global star formation. We
describe [C II] and far-infrared observations using the FIFI-LS instrument on

Despite similar far-infrared luminosities, the [C II] to far-infrared
luminosity ratio, L([C II])/L(FIR) varies by a factor of at least 140 among
these four clumps. In particular, for AGAL313.576+0.324, no [C II] line
emission is detected despite a FIR luminosity of 24,000 L_sun.
AGAL313.576+0.324 lies a factor of more than 100 below the empirical
correlation curve between L([C II])/L(FIR) and S_\nu (63 micron)/S_\nu (158
micron) found for galaxies. AGAL313.576+0.324 may be in an early evolutionary
""protostellar"" phase with insufficient ultraviolet flux to ionize carbon, or in
a deeply embedded ``hypercompact' H II region phase where dust attenuation of
UV flux limits the region of ionized carbon to undetectably small volumes.
Alternatively, its apparent lack of \cii\, emission may arise from deep
absorption of the \cii\, line against the 158 micron continuum, or
self-absorption of brighter line emission by foreground material, which might
cancel or diminish any emission within the FIFI-LS instrument's broad spectral
resolution element (~250 km/s)

low-criticality ones (e.g., logging), which results in low utilization.
  In this paper, we present Akita, a hypervisor CPU scheduler that delivers
predictable performance at high utilization. Akita allows virtual machines
(VMs) to be categorized into high- and low-criticality VMs. Akita provides
strong guarantees on the ability of cloud providers to meet SLOs of

necessary. Akita, therefore, allows the co-existence of high and

forecasting, which is an iterative method that starts with a base model, and
explains the model's errors through regression trees. At each iteration, the
path leading to highest error is added as a new variable to the base model. In

the line centroid is more (less) blueshifted than 30 km/s with respect to the
stellar radial velocity. Unlike for the [OI] where a HVC is often accompanied
by a LVC, all 17 sources with a [NeII] detection have either a HVC or a LVC.
[NeII] HVCs are preferentially detected toward high accretors (Macc > 10$^{-8}$
Msun/yr) while LVCs are found in sources with low Macc, low [OI] luminosity,
and large infrared spectral index (n13-31). Interestingly, the [NeII] and [OI]
LVC luminosities display an opposite behaviour with n13-31: as the inner dust
disk depletes (higher n13-31) the [NeII] luminosity increases while the [OI]
weakens. The [NeII] and [OI] HVC profiles are generally similar with centroids
and FWHMs showing the expected behaviour from shocked gas in micro-jets. In
contrast, the [NeII] LVC profiles are typically more blueshifted and narrower
than the [OI] profiles. The FWHM and centroid vs. disk inclination suggest that
the [NeII] LVC predominantly traces unbound gas from a slow, wide-angle wind
that has not lost completely the Keplerian signature from its launching region.
We sketch an evolutionary scenario that could explain the combined [OI] and
[NeII] results and includes screening of hard (~1keV) X-rays in inner, mostly
molecular, MHD winds.

human brain signal. It provides an assistive technology that enables persons
with motor disabilities to communicate with the world and also empowers them to
lead independent lives. The common BCI devices use Electroencephalography (EEG)
electrical activity recorded from the scalp. EEG signals are noisy owing to the
presence of many artifacts, namely, eye blink, head movement, and jaw movement.
Such artifacts corrupt the EEG signal and make EEG analysis challenging. This
issue is addressed by locating the artifacts and excluding the EEG segment from
the analysis, which could lead to a loss of useful information. However, we
propose a practical BCI that uses the artifacts which has a low signal to noise
ratio.
  The objective of our work is to classify different types of artifacts, namely
eye blink, head nod, head turn, and jaw movements in the EEG signal. The
occurrence of the artifacts is first located in the EEG signal. The located
artifacts are then classified using linear time and dynamic time warping
techniques. The located artifacts can be used by a person with a motor
disability to control a smartphone. A speech synthesis application that uses
eyeblinks in a single channel EEG system and jaw clinches in four channels EEG
system are developed. Word prediction models are used for word completion, thus
reducing the number of artifacts required.

imaging in regards to material separation and imaging of multiple contrast
agents. However, many PCCT setups are under development and are not optimized
for specific contrast agents or use cases. Here, we demonstrate how
experimental system parameters may be varied in order to enhance performance
and we propose a set of recommendations to achieve this based on contrast
agent.
  Approach: A table-top PCCT system with a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)
detector capable of separating six energy bins was used to image multiple
contrast agents in a small phantom. The contrast agents were separated and the
concentration was quantified using K-edge subtraction. To increase system
performance, we investigated three parameters: beam filter type and thickness,
projection acquisition time, and energy bin width. The results from the
parameters were compared based on PCCT signal and contrast to noise ratio (CNR)
or noise in K-edge images. The concentrations of the contrast agents were
quantified in K-edge images and compared to known concentrations.
  Results: The bench-top PCCT system was able to successfully quantify the
contrast agents through K-edge subtraction. Decreasing projection acquisition
time showed a decrease in K-edge CNR. However, it did not scale as the square
root of time. Filter type and bin width demonstrated a dependence on the
specific contrast agent.
  Conclusions: The presented bench-top system demonstrated the ability to
separate contrast agents using K-edge subtraction and accurately determine
contrast concentration in K-edge images. Specific parameters for future use
will be chosen based on contrast agent.

they represent systems where complex behaviors emerge from simple local

proposing instances of complex cellular automata; however, most of the proposed
methods are based on a careful search or a meticulous construction of evolution
rules.
  This paper presents the emergence of complex behaviors based on reversible
cellular automata. In particular, this paper shows that reversible cellular
automata represent an adequate framework to obtain complex behaviors adding
only new random states.
  Experimental results show that complexity can be obtained from reversible
cellular automata appending a proportion of about two times more states at
random than the original number of states in the reversible automaton. Thus, it
is possible to obtain complex cellular automata with dozens of states.
Complexity appears to be commonly obtained from reversible cellular automata,
and using other operations such as permutations of states or row and column
permutations in the evolution rule. The relevance of this paper is to present
that reversibility can be a useful structure to implement complex behaviors in
cellular automata.

measure diffraction pattern images in order to determine a crystal structure
and orientation. In nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) we scan a moderately
converged electron probe over the sample to acquire thousands or even millions
of sequential diffraction images, a technique that is especially appropriate
for polycrystalline samples. However, due to the large Ewald sphere of TEM,
excitation of Bragg peaks can be extremely sensitive to sample tilt, varying
strongly for even a few degrees of sample tilt for crystalline samples. In this
paper, we present multibeam electron diffraction (MBED), where multiple probe
forming apertures are used to create mutiple STEM probes, all of which interact
with the sample simultaneously. We detail designs for MBED experiments, and a
method for using a focused ion beam (FIB) to produce MBED apertures. We show
the efficacy of the MBED technique for crystalline orientation mapping using
both simulations and proof-of-principle experiments. We also show how the
angular information in MBED can be used to perform 3D tomographic
reconstruction of samples without needing to tilt or scan the sample multiple
times. Finally, we also discuss future opportunities for the MBED method.

Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to

parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and
highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose
a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention
mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight
sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more
efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the
weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling
strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using
this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while
being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight

surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by
0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger

presents a multi-user secret key generation in massive MIMO wireless networks.
We provide a beam domain channel model, in which different elements represent

derive a closed-form expression under independent channel conditions. To
maximize the sum secret key rate, we provide the optimal conditions for the

apparent alignment of the disturbed gas with nearby, large scale filamentary
structure at the edge of the Local Void. We consider several scenarios for the
origin of the disturbed gas, including gas stripping via ram pressure or

well understood though debated, massive black hole formation at later cosmic
epochs has not been adequately explored. We present a gas accretion driven
mechanism that can build up black hole masses rapidly in dense, gas-rich
nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Wind-fed supra-exponential accretion of an
initially wandering black hole in NSCs can lead to extremely fast growth,
scaling stellar mass remnant seed black holes up to intermediate mass black
holes (IMBHs). Operating throughout cosmic time, growth via this new channel is
modulated by the gas supply, and premature termination results in the formation
of lower mass black holes with masses in the range of 50 - few 100 solar
masses, filling in the so-called mass gap. However, in most gas-rich NSCs,
growth is unimpeded, inevitably leading to the formation of IMBHs with masses
ranging from 100 - 100,000 solar masses. A spate of new detection spanning the
full range of the IMBH mass function - from the LIGO-VIRGO source GW190521 to
the emerging population of 10^5 solar mass black holes harbored in low-mass
dwarf galaxies - are revealing this elusive population. Naturally accounting
for the detected presence of off-center IMBHs in low-mass dwarfs, this new
pathway also predicts the existence of an extensive population of wandering
non-central black holes in more massive galaxies would be detectable via tidal
disruption events and as GW sources. Gas-rich NSCs serve as incubators for the
continual formation of black holes over a wide range in mass throughout cosmic
time.

fundamental problem. We consider a broad setting where we allow severe degree
heterogeneity and a wide range of sparsity levels, and propose Stepwise
Goodness-of-Fit (StGoF) as a new approach. This is a stepwise algorithm, where
for $m = 1, 2, \ldots$, we alternately use a community detection step and a
goodness-of-fit (GoF) step. We adapt SCORE \cite{SCORE} for community
detection, and propose a new GoF metric. We show that at step $m$, the GoF
metric diverges to $\infty$ in probability for all $m < K$ and converges to
$N(0,1)$ if $m = K$. This gives rise to a consistent estimate for $K$. Also, we
discover the right way to define the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for our
problem and show that consistent estimates for $K$ do not exist if
$\mathrm{SNR} \goto 0$, and StGoF is uniformly consistent for $K$ if
$\mathrm{SNR} \goto \infty$. Therefore, StGoF achieves the optimal phase
transition.
  Similar stepwise methods (e.g., \cite{wang2017likelihood, ma2018determining})

Non-Splitting Property (NSP)}. Primarily due to a non-tractable rotation of
eigenvectors dictated by the Davis-Kahan $\sin(\theta)$ theorem, the NSP is
non-trivial to prove and requires new techniques we develop.

convolutional neural network(CNN), which can dynamically adjust the computation
for each input sample. One of the ways to achieve dynamic inference is to use
multi-stage neural network, which contains a sub-network with prediction layer
at each stage. The inference of a input sample can exit from early stage if the
prediction of the stage is confident enough. However, design a multi-stage CNN
architecture is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we introduce a general
framework, ENAS4D, which can efficiently search for optimal multi-stage CNN
architecture for dynamic inference in a well-designed search space. Firstly, we
propose a method to construct the search space with multi-stage convolution.
The search space include different numbers of layers, different kernel sizes
and different numbers of channels for each stage and the resolution of input
samples. Then, we train a once-for-all network that supports to sample diverse
multi-stage CNN architecture. A specialized multi-stage network can be obtained
from the once-for-all network without additional training. Finally, we devise a
method to efficiently search for the optimal multi-stage network that trades
the accuracy off the computational cost taking the advantage of once-for-all
network. The experiments on the ImageNet classification task demonstrate that
the multi-stage CNNs searched by ENAS4D consistently outperform the
state-of-the-art method for dyanmic inference. In particular, the network
achieves 74.4% ImageNet top-1 accuracy under 185M average MACs.

estimation have shown that signal recovery is even feasible under strong
non-linear distortions in the observation process. An important characteristic
of associated guarantees is uniformity, i.e., recovery succeeds for an entire
class of structured signals with a fixed measurement ensemble. However, despite
significant results in various special cases, a general understanding of
uniform recovery from non-linear observations is still missing. This paper
develops a unified approach to this problem under the assumption of i.i.d.
sub-Gaussian measurement vectors. Our main result shows that a simple
least-squares estimator with any convex constraint can serve as a universal
recovery strategy, which is outlier robust and does not require explicit
knowledge of the underlying non-linearity. Based on empirical process theory, a
key technical novelty is an approximative increment condition that can be
implemented for all common types of non-linear models. This flexibility allows
us to apply our approach to a variety of problems in non-linear compressed
sensing and high-dimensional statistics, leading to several new and improved
guarantees. Each of these applications is accompanied by a conceptually simple
and systematic proof, which does not rely on any deeper properties of the
observation model. On the other hand, known local stability properties can be
incorporated into our framework in a plug-and-play manner, thereby implying
near-optimal error bounds.

is now understood that some topological invariants used to classify equilibrium

Indeed, in Floquet systems the additional gap arising from the periodicity of
the quasienergy Brillouin zone often leads to unique topological phenomena
without equilibrium analogues. In the context of Floquet Weyl semimetal, Weyl
points may be induced at both quasienergy zero and $\pi/T$ ($T$ being the
driving period) and these two types of Weyl points can be very close to each
other in the momentum space. Because of their momentum-space proximity, the
chirality of each individual Weyl point may become hard to characterize in both
theory and experiments, thus making it challenging to determine the system's
overall topology. In this work, inspired by the construction of dynamical
winding numbers in Floquet Chern insulators, we propose a dynamical invariant
capable of characterizing and distinguishing between Weyl points at different
quasienergy values, thus advancing one step further in the topological
characterization of Floquet Weyl semimetals. To demonstrate the usefulness of
such a dynamical topological invariant, we consider a variant of the
periodically kicked Harper model (the very first model in studies of Floquet
topological phases) that exhibits many Weyl points, with the number of Weyl
points rising unlimitedly with the strength of some system parameters.
Furthermore, we investigate the two-terminal transport signature associated

information at both local and global levels. By employing attention mechanism
to characterize the importance among spatially neighboring regions, the most

helps encode the spatial context to form the graph information at local level.
Moreover, we utilize multiple pathways for local-level graph convolution, in
order to leverage the merits from the diverse spatial context of HSI and to
enhance the expressive power of the generated representations. To reconstruct
the global contextual relations, our MGCN-AGL encodes the long range
dependencies among image regions based on the expressive representations that
have been produced at local level. Then inference can be performed along the
reconstructed graph edges connecting faraway regions. Finally, the multi-level
information is adaptively fused to generate the network output. In this means,
the graph learning and image classification can be integrated into a unified
framework and benefit each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted on
three real-world hyperspectral datasets, which are shown to outperform the
state-of-the-art methods.

perception systems, and a comprehensive investigation of the potential risks of
the rain to DNNs is of great importance. However, it is rather difficult to
collect or synthesize rainy images that can represent all rain situations that
would possibly occur in the real world. To this end, in this paper, we start
from a new perspective and propose to combine two totally different studies,
i.e., rainy image synthesis and adversarial attack. We first present an
adversarial rain attack, with which we could simulate various rain situations
with the guidance of deployed DNNs and reveal the potential threat factors that
can be brought by rain. In particular, we design a factor-aware rain generation
that synthesizes rain streaks according to the camera exposure process and
models the learnable rain factors for adversarial attack. With this generator,
we perform the adversarial rain attack against the image classification and
object detection. To defend the DNNs from the negative rain effect, we also
present a defensive deraining strategy, for which we design an adversarial rain
augmentation that uses mixed adversarial rain layers to enhance deraining
models for downstream DNN perception. Our large-scale evaluation on various
datasets demonstrates that our synthesized rainy images with realistic
appearances not only exhibit strong adversarial capability against DNNs, but
also boost the deraining models for defensive purposes, building the foundation
for further rain-robust perception studies.

(DARTS) has recently attracted much attention due to its high efficiency. It
defines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which
represents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the
network and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method
finds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a
model with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the
resulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we
propose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a
model with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization
with the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion.
Specifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS
selects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M

simple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images
without hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch
filtering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although
famously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial
domain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required
for the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to
reproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We
adopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the
periodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free
fake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a
specialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images
with high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we also
use the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidance
map to add noise intelligently. Our large-scale evaluation on 3 representative
state-of-the-art DeepFake detection methods (tested on 16 types of DeepFakes)

interpretability via uncertainty analysis. This article introduces and
discusses two methods which straddle the areas of probabilistic Bayesian
schemes and kernel methods for regression: Gaussian Processes and Relevance
Vector Machines. Our focus is on developing a common framework with which to
view these methods, via intermediate methods a probabilistic version of the
well-known kernel ridge regression, and drawing connections among them, via
dual formulations, and discussion of their application in the context of major
tasks: regression, smoothing, interpolation, and filtering. Overall, we provide
understanding of the mathematical concepts behind these models, and we
summarize and discuss in depth different interpretations and highlight the
relationship to other methods, such as linear kernel smoothers, Kalman
filtering and Fourier approximations. Throughout, we provide numerous figures
to promote understanding, and we make numerous recommendations to
practitioners. Benefits and drawbacks of the different techniques are
highlighted. To our knowledge, this is the most in-depth study of its kind to
date focused on these two methods, and will be relevant to theoretical
understanding and practitioners throughout the domains of data-science, signal

halo with the median $T \simeq 0.24 $. We group DM halos in 3 different
categories. Simple halos (32% of population) establish principal axes whose
ordering in magnitude does not change with radius and whose orientations are
almost fixed throughout the halo. Twisted halos (32% of population), experience
levels of gradual rotations throughout their radial profiles. Finally,
stretched halos (36% of population) demonstrate a stretching in their principal
axes lengths where the ordering of different eigenvalues change with radius.
Subsequently, the halo experiences a ""rotation"" of $\sim$90 deg where the
stretching occurs. Visualizing the 3D ellipsoid of each halo, for the first
time, we report signs of re-orienting ellipsoid in twisted and stretched halos.
We examine the impact of baryonic physics on DM halo shape through a comparison
to dark matter only (DMO) simulations. This suggests a triaxial (prolate) halo.
We analyze the impact of substructure on DM halo shape in both hydro and DMO
simulations and confirm that their impacts are subdominant. We study the
distribution of satellites in our sample. In simple and twisted halos, the
angle of satellites' angular momentum with galaxy's angular momentum grows with
radius. However, stretched halos show a flat distribution of angles. Overlaying
our theoretical outcome on the observational results presented in the

leading-order SM contribution to this CPV vertex appears at two-loop level. By
summing over the quark flavor indices in the two loop integrals analytically,
we can estimate the order of the corresponding Wilson coefficient to be $c^{\rm

probed at the LHC and planned future colliders. Then we investigate this CPV
$hW^+ W^-$ interaction in two Beyond the Standard Model benchmark models: the

happens for the SM, the dominant contributions in both models arise at the

${\cal O}(10^{-9})$ in the former model and of ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ for the
latter. In light of such a large CPV effect in the $hW^+W^-$ coupling, we also
give the formulae for the leading one-loop contribution to the related CPV

performances of downstream predictive tasks. Recently, multi-agent reinforced
feature selection (MARFS) has been introduced to automate feature selection, by
creating agents for each feature to select or deselect corresponding features.
Although MARFS enjoys the automation of the selection process, MARFS suffers
from not just the data complexity in terms of contents and dimensionality, but
also the exponentially-increasing computational costs with regard to the number
of agents. The raised concern leads to a new research question: Can we simplify
the selection process of agents under reinforcement learning context so as to
improve the efficiency and costs of feature selection? To address the question,
we develop a single-agent reinforced feature selection approach integrated with
restructured choice strategy. Specifically, the restructured choice strategy
includes: 1) we exploit only one single agent to handle the selection task of
multiple features, instead of using multiple agents. 2) we develop a scanning
method to empower the single agent to make multiple selection/deselection
decisions in each round of scanning. 3) we exploit the relevance to predictive
labels of features to prioritize the scanning orders of the agent for multiple
features. 4) we propose a convolutional auto-encoder algorithm, integrated with
the encoded index information of features, to improve state representation. 5)
we design a reward scheme that take into account both prediction accuracy and
feature redundancy to facilitate the exploration process. Finally, we present
extensive experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
of the proposed method.

However, RFIs are usually affected by the widely existing camera exposure while
the robustness of DNNs to the exposure is rarely explored. In this paper, we
study this problem from the viewpoint of adversarial attack and identify a
totally new task, i.e., adversarial exposure attack generating adversarial
images by tuning image exposure to mislead the DNNs with significantly high
transferability. To this end, we first implement a straightforward method,
i.e., multiplicative-perturbation-based exposure attack, and reveal the big
challenges of this new task. Then, to make the adversarial image naturalness,
we propose the adversarial bracketed exposure fusion that regards the exposure
attack as an element-wise bracketed exposure fusion problem in the

propose the convolutional bracketed exposure fusion where the element-wise
multiplicative operation is extended to the convolution. We validate our method

growing demand for highly accurate real-time 3D object recognition. Considering
the expansion of robot applications in more complex and dynamic environments,it
is evident that it is not possible to pre-program all object categories and
anticipate all exceptions in advance. Therefore, robots should have the
functionality to learn about new object categories in an open-ended fashion
while working in the environment.Towards this goal, we propose a deep transfer
learning approach to generate a scale- and pose-invariant object representation
by considering shape and texture information in multiple colorspaces. The
obtained global object representation is then fed to an instance-based object
category learning and recognition,where a non-expert human user exists in the
learning loop and can interactively guide the process of experience acquisition
by teaching new object categories, or by correcting insufficient or erroneous
categories. In this work, shape information encodes the common patterns of all
categories, while texture information is used to describes the appearance of
each instance in detail.Multiple color space combinations and network
architectures are evaluated to find the most descriptive system. Experimental
results showed that the proposed network architecture out-performed the
selected state-of-the-art approaches in terms of object classification accuracy
and scalability. Furthermore, we performed a real robot experiment in the
context of serve-a-beer scenario to show the real-time performance of the
proposed approach.

the normal-superconductor phase transition. We establish that these variances
have their origin in the differing pinning properties in two different
dimensions. We obtain the pinning strength quantitatively in both the
dimensions from two independent transport measurements performed in two
different regimes of vortex-motion -- (i) thermally assisted flux-flow (TAFF)
regime and (ii) flux flow (FF) regime. Both the measurements consistently show
that both the pinning potential and the zero-field free-energy barrier to
depinning in the 3D superconductor are at least an order of magnitude stronger
than that in the 2D superconductor. Further, we probed the dynamics of pinning
in both 2D and 3D superconductor through voltage fluctuation spectroscopy. We
find that the mechanism of vortex pinning-depinning is qualitatively similar
for the 3D and 2D superconductors. The voltage-fluctuations arising from
vortex-motion are found to be correlated only in the 2D superconductor. We
establish this to be due to the presence of long-range phase fluctuations near
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type superconducting transition in
2-dimensional superconductors.

Existing methods often make specific assumptions of the rain model, which can
hardly cover many diverse circumstances in the real world, making them have to
employ complex optimization or progressive refinement. This, however,
significantly affects these methods' efficiency and effectiveness for many
efficiency-critical applications. To fill this gap, in this paper, we regard
the single-image deraining as a general image-enhancing problem and originally
propose a model-free deraining method, i.e., EfficientDeRain, which is able to
process a rainy image within 10~ms (i.e., around 6~ms on average), over 80
times faster than the state-of-the-art method (i.e., RCDNet), while achieving
similar de-rain effects. We first propose the novel pixel-wise dilation
filtering. In particular, a rainy image is filtered with the pixel-wise kernels
estimated from a kernel prediction network, by which suitable multi-scale
kernels for each pixel can be efficiently predicted. Then, to eliminate the gap
between synthetic and real data, we further propose an effective data
augmentation method (i.e., RainMix) that helps to train network for real rainy
image handling.We perform comprehensive evaluation on both synthetic and
real-world rainy datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
our method. We release the model and code in

for exploiting the highest possible angular resolution of any single optical
telescope available in the next decade, either on Earth or in space, and with
sensitivity comparable to (or better than) larger aperture facilities. MAVIS
uses two deformable mirrors in addition to the deformable secondary mirror of
the AOF, providing a mean V-band Strehl ratio of >10% (goal >15%) across a
relatively large (30 arc second) science field. This equates to a resolution of
<20mas at 550nm - comparable to the K-band diffraction limit of the next
generation of extremely large telescopes, making MAVIS a genuine optical
counterpart to future IR-optimised facilities like JWST and the ELT. Moreover,
MAVIS will have unprecedented sky coverage for a high-order AO system,
accessing at least 50% of the sky at the Galactic Pole, making MAVIS a truly
general purpose facility instrument. As such, MAVIS will have both a
Nyquist-sampled imager (30x30 arcsec field), and a powerful integral field
spectrograph with multiple spatial and spectral modes spanning 370-1000nm. This

turbulence. In this work, we use simulation samples produced by the hybrid
cosmological hydrodynamical/N-body code, to investigate on what scale the
deviation of spatial distributions between baryons and dark matter is caused by
turbulence. For this purpose, we do not include the physical processes such as
star formation, supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback
into our code, so that the effect of turbulence heating for IGM can be
exhibited to the most extent. By computing cross-correlation functions $r_m(k)$
for the density field and $r_v(k)$ for the velocity field of both baryons and
dark matter, we find that deviations between the two matter components for both
density field and velocity field, as expected, are scale-dependent. That is,
the deviations are the most significant at small scales and gradually diminish
on larger and larger scales. Also, the deviations are time-dependent, i.e. they
become larger and larger with increasing cosmic time. The most emphasized
result is that the spatial deviations between baryons and dark matter revealed
by velocity field are more significant than that by density field. At z = 0, at
the 1% level of deviation, the deviation scale is about 3.7 $h^{-1}$Mpc for
density field, while as large as 23 $h^{-1}$Mpc for velocity field, a scale
that falls within the weakly non-linear regime for the structure formation
paradigm. Our results indicate that the effect of turbulence heating is indeed
comparable to that of these processes such as SN and AGN feedback.

  positioning time comparison: A case study using simulated observations",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to general relativity theory (GRT), the geopotential difference
(GD) can be determined by comparing the change in time difference between
precise clocks using the precise point positioning (PPP) time transfer
technique, referred to as the relativistic PPP time comparison approach. We
focused on high-precision time comparison between two precise clocks for
determining the GD using the relativistic PPP time transfer,and conducted
simulation experiments to validate the approach. In the experiments, we
consider three cases to evaluate the performance of the approach using clocks
with different stabilities, namely, the frequency stabilities of the clocks
equipped at three selected ground stations are respectively (Case 1), (Case 2),
and (Case 3) at time period. Conclusions are drawn from the experimental
results. First, high-precision clocks can significantly improve the accuracy
for PPP time transfer, but the improvement is limited by measurement noises.
Compared to Case 1, the long-term stabilities of OPMT-BRUX as well as PTBB-BRUX
are improved in Cases 2 and 3. The frequency stabilities of Cases 1-3 are
approximately 4.28*10-16, 4.00*10-17, and 3.22*10-17 at 10-day averaging time
for OPMT-BRUX, respectively, and for PTBB-BRUX, these values are approximately
3.73*10-16, 8.17*10-17, and 4.64*10-17. Second, the geopotential difference
between any two stations can be determined at the decimeter level, with its
accuracy being consistent with the stabilities of the time links in Cases 1-3.
In Case 3, the determined geopotential differences between OPMT and BRUX
deviate from the EIGEN-6C4 model values by -0.64 m2/s2 with an uncertainty of
1.11 m2/s2, whereas the deviation error between PTBB and BRUX is 0.76 m2/s2
with an uncertainty of 1.79 m2/s2. The approach proposed in this study can be
also applied to testing GRT.

efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the
improper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray
images while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which
definitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In
this paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and
propose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the
bias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations
for fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally
tune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its
spatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict
each other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome
this challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can
locally tune the bias field with joint smooth & adversarial constraints. As a
result, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but
also retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real

decision making to optimization, where they provide a 'belief' (opinion) to

(or maximize) some cost or loss (conversely, utility or gain). The goal is to
reach an objective by exploiting the temporal relation inherent to the nature's

designed that perform asymptotically optimal for various applications. However,
if the framework of the problem is not stationary, i.e., the nature's state
sometimes changes arbitrarily, the past cumulative belief revision done by the

greatly complicate the analytical treatment and interpretation of models, they
are usually neglected or taken to be uniform, leading to a lack in the
comprehension of the effects of delays in neural systems. This paper shows that
heterogeneous transmission delays make small groups of neurons respond
selectively to inputs with differing frequency spectra. By studying a single

how the frequency response is linked to both the strengths and delay times of
the afferent connections. The results show that incorporating delays alters the

another remarkable feature associated with the Alfv\'enic spikes. How the
prototype of these coincident phenomena is generated intermittently in the

introducing guide-field discontinuity into the interchange magnetic
reconnection between open funnels and closed loops with different magnetic
helicities. The modified interchange reconnection model not only can accelerate
jet flows from the newly opening closed loop but also excite and launch
Alfv\'enic wave pulses along the newly-reconnected and post-reconnected open

observational features: (1) Alfv\'en disturbance is pulsive in time and
asymmetric in space; (2) Alfv\'enic pulse is compressible with temperature
enhancement and density variation inside the pulse. We point out that three
physical processes co-happening with Alfv\'en wave propagation can be
responsible for the temperature enhancement: (a) convection of heated jet flow
plasmas (decrease in density), (b) propagation of compressed slow-mode waves
(increase in density), and (c) conduction of heat flux (weak change in
density). We also suggest that the radial nonlinear evolution of the Alfv\'enic
pulses should be taken into account to explain the formation of magnetic
switchback geometry.

image based on its pure visual appearance without metadata. In visual place
recognition, the challenges lie upon not only the changes in lighting
conditions, camera viewpoint, and scale but also the characteristic of
scene-level images and the distinct features of the area. To resolve these
challenges, one must consider both the local discriminativeness and the global
semantic context of images. On the other hand, the diversity of the datasets is
also particularly important to develop more general models and advance the
progress of the field. In this paper, we present a fully-automated system for
place recognition at a city-scale based on content-based image retrieval. Our
main contributions to the community lie in three aspects. Firstly, we take a
comprehensive analysis of visual place recognition and sketch out the unique
challenges of the task compared to general image retrieval tasks. Next, we
propose yet a simple pooling approach on top of convolutional neural network
activations to embed the spatial information into the image representation
vector. Finally, we introduce new datasets for place recognition, which are
particularly essential for application-based research. Furthermore, throughout
extensive experiments, various issues in both image retrieval and place
recognition are analyzed and discussed to give some insights into improving the
performance of retrieval models in reality.

  Co-Salient Object Detection","Accepted to CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) has recently achieved significant
progress and played a key role in retrieval-related tasks. However, it
inevitably poses an entirely new safety and security issue, i.e., highly
personal and sensitive content can potentially be extracting by powerful CoSOD
methods. In this paper, we address this problem from the perspective of
adversarial attacks and identify a novel task: adversarial co-saliency attack.
Specially, given an image selected from a group of images containing some
common and salient objects, we aim to generate an adversarial version that can
mislead CoSOD methods to predict incorrect co-salient regions. Note that,
compared with general white-box adversarial attacks for classification, this
new task faces two additional challenges: (1) low success rate due to the
diverse appearance of images in the group; (2) low transferability across CoSOD
methods due to the considerable difference between CoSOD pipelines. To address
these challenges, we propose the very first black-box joint adversarial
exposure and noise attack (Jadena), where we jointly and locally tune the
exposure and additive perturbations of the image according to a newly designed
high-feature-level contrast-sensitive loss function. Our method, without any
information on the state-of-the-art CoSOD methods, leads to significant
performance degradation on various co-saliency detection datasets and makes the
co-salient objects undetectable. This can have strong practical benefits in
properly securing the large number of personal photos currently shared on the
Internet. Moreover, our method is potential to be utilized as a metric for
evaluating the robustness of CoSOD methods.

at run-time, a key requirement for Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems. We report
production results from this method along with several other algorithms. We
found that bid shading, in general, can deliver significant value to
advertisers, reducing price per impression to about 55% of the unshaded cost.
Further, the particular approach described in this paper captures 7% more
profit for advertisers, than do benchmark methods of just bidding the most
probable winning price. We also report 4.3% higher surplus than an industry
Sell-Side Platform shading service. Furthermore, we observed 3% - 7% lower

feature description of the tunnel failure process. The failure characteristics
of tunnels under explosive loading are described by using discrete element
method and persistent homology-based machine learning. Firstly, the discrete
element model of shallow buried tunnel was established in the discrete element
software, and the explosive load was equivalent to a series of uniformly
distributed loads acting on the surface by Saint-Venant principle, and the
dynamic response of the tunnel under multiple explosive loads was obtained
through iterative calculation. The topological characteristics of surrounding
rock is studied by persistent homology-based machine learning. The geometric,
physical and interunit characteristics of the tunnel subjected to explosive
loading are extracted, and the nonlinear mapping relationship between the
topological quantity of persistent homology, and the failure characteristics of
the surrounding rock is established, and the results of the intelligent
description of the failure characteristics of the tunnel are obtained. The
research shows that the length of the longest Betty 1 bar code is closely
related to the stability of the tunnel, which can be used for effective early
warning of the tunnel failure, and an intelligent description of the tunnel
failure process can be established to provide a new idea for tunnel engineering
protection.

to 118), the expectation distance to the nucleus is zero thus putting an end to
the periodic table for Z = 118 nicely matching the last element discovered
(Oganesson).

solving ubiquitous combinatorial optimization problems. Although some
artificial spins to support large-scale Ising machine is reported, e.g.
superconducting qubits in quantum annealers and short optical pulses in
coherent Ising machines, the spin coherence is fragile due to the ultra-low
equivalent temperature or optical phase sensitivity. In this paper, we propose
to use short microwave pulses generated from an optoelectronic parametric
oscillator as the spins to implement the Ising machine with large scale and
also high coherence under room temperature. The proposed machine supports
10,000 spins, and the high coherence leads to accurate computation. Moreover,
the Ising machine is highly compatible with high-speed electronic devices for
programmability, paving a low-cost, accurate, and easy-to-implement way toward
to solve real-world optimization problems.
