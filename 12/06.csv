distance-based formation controllers with a secondary constraint for the
purpose of preventing 3D formation ambiguities. Specifically, we introduce
three controlled variables that form an orthogonal space and uniquely
characterize a tetrahedron formation in 3D. This orthogonal space incorporates
constraints on the inter-agent distances and the signed volume of tetrahedron
substructures. The formation is modeled using a directed graph with a
leader-follower type configuration and single-integrator dynamics. We show that
the proposed decentralized formation controller ensures the \textit{global}
asymptotic stability and the local exponential stability of the desired
formation for an \textit{n}-agent system with no ambiguities. Unlike previous
work, this result is achieved without conditions on the tetrahedrons that form
the desired formation or on the control gains.

Intermolecular interactions are the basis of the tunability of the optical and
electronic properties of these compounds, whose prediction and exploitation
benefit from the knowledge of the crystal structure and the packing
architecture. Polymorphism can occur due to the weak intermolecular
interactions, asking for detailed structural analysis clarifying the origin of
observed material property modifications. Here, two silylethyne-substituted
anthracene compounds are characterized by single-crystal synchrotron X-ray

microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy confirm the results
obtained by the X-ray diffraction characterization, i.e., shifting the
substituents towards the external benzene rings of the anthracene unit favours
{\pi}-{\pi} interactions, impacting on both the morphology and the microscopic
optical properties of the crystals. The compounds with more isolated anthracene
units feature shorter lifetime and emission spectra more similar to those ones
of isolated molecules. The crystallographic study, supported by the optical

categorify questions regarding L-functions, as well as make their construction

  Let $F$ be a number field, and let $\mathfrak{X}(F)$ be the space of Hecke

$\mathfrak{X}(F)$ and an $\mathscr{S}$-module $\mathscr{L}$ of zeta integrals
on $\mathfrak{X}(F)$. Using a canonical trivialization of the line bundle
$\mathscr{L}$ in some localization $\mathscr{S}'$ of $\mathscr{S}$, we show
that the module of zeta integrals $\mathscr{L}$ contains the same information

challenging to access and use the information in historical maps, due to their
forms of paper-based maps or scanned images. It is even more time-consuming and
labor-intensive to conduct an analysis that requires a synthesis of the
information from multiple historical maps. To facilitate the use of the
geographic information contained in historical maps, one way is to build a

workflow for completing one important step of building such a GKG, namely
aligning the same geographic entities from different maps. We present this
workflow and the related methods for implementation, and systematically
evaluate their performances using two different datasets of historical maps.
The evaluation results show that machine learning and deep learning models for

by the LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration (LVC) with a total mass of

mass, GW190425 stands at five standard deviations away from the total mass
distribution of Galactic BNSs of $2.66\pm 0.12$ M$_{\odot}$. LVC suggested that
this system could be a BNS formed from a fast-merging channel rendering its
non-detection at radio wavelengths due to selection effects. BNSs with orbital
periods less than a few hours - progenitors of LIGO/Virgo mergers - are prime
target candidates for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). If
GW190425-like binaries exist in the Milky Way, LISA will detect them within the
volume of our Galaxy and will measure their chirp masses to better than 10% for
those binaries with gravitational wave frequencies larger than 2 mHz. This work
explores how we can probe a population of Galactic GW190425-like BNSs with LISA
and investigate their origin. We assume that the Milky Way's BNS population
consists of two distinct sub-populations: a fraction $w_1$ that follows the
observed Galactic BNS chirp mass distribution and $w_2$ that resembles chirp
mass of GW190425. We show that LISA's accuracy on recovering the fraction of
GW190425-like binaries depends on the BNS merger rate. For the merger rates
reported in the literature, $21 - 212\,$Myr$^{-1}$, the error on the recovered
fractions varies between $\sim 30 - 5$%.

description of what the world is like. But what does it mean? In this chapter,
we focus on the ontological and metaphysical aspects of this discussion. That
is, we are concerned with the following questions: what there is, according to
our best scientific theories? And how are these things that theories say exist?
We start from the assumption that a genuine scientific realism must deal with
these issues. Taking non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a case study, we
discuss some of the challenges currently faced by a genuinely realistic stance.
We argue, first, that in the ontological aspect, realists are in the same boat
as science, that is, without sufficient epistemic justification to adopt the
belief in the entities postulated by a single quantum theory, given that
experience (currently) is not able to decide between rival theories; in the
metaphysical aspect, realists also encounter problems with theory choice, given
the possibility of associating more than one metaphysical theory with the
description of the entities postulated by each quantum theory. The same goes
for structuralist alternatives, since, even if we accept that scientific
theories are committed to the existence of structures, but not objects, we
still do not know what structures are, metaphysically. Finally, we move forward
in the discussion with the meta-Popperian method, which serves to reduce the
metaphysical alternatives associated with the ontological postulates of
scientific theories. We may not know what the correct alternative is, but we
have been able to progressively check which metaphysical alternatives are
incompatible with each scientific theory.

ecosystems and have important implications for the environment. These ecosystem
shifts have been largely attributed to nutrient dynamics and food web
interactions. Contamination with heavy metals such as copper can modulate such
ecological interactions which in turn may impact ecosystem functioning.
Motivated by this, we explored the effect of copper enrichment on such regime
shifts in planktonic systems. We integrated copper contamination to a minimal
phytoplankton-zooplankton model which is known to demonstrate abrupt
transitions between ecosystem states. Our results suggest that both the toxic
and deficient concentration of copper in water bodies can lead to regime shift
to an algal dominated alternative stable state. Further, interaction with fish
density can also lead to collapse of population cycles thus leading to algal
domination in the intermediate copper ranges. Environmental stochasticity may
result in state transition much prior to the tipping point and there is a
significant loss in the bimodality on increasing intensity and redness of
noise. Finally, the impending state shifts due to contamination cannot be
predicted by the generic early warning indicators unless the transition is
close enough. Overall the study provides fresh impetus to explore regime shifts
in ecosystems under the influence of anthropogenic changes like chemical
contamination.

uncertainty with similar behaviour as established - but computationally more

that explicitly captures the balance between game and exploration costs and
that it always converges to the set of quantal-response equilibria (QRE), the
standard solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted
potential games with heterogeneous learning agents. In our main task, we then
turn to measure the effect of exploration in collective system performance. We
characterize the geometry of the QRE surface in low-dimensional MAL systems and
link our findings with catastrophe (bifurcation) theory. In particular, as the
exploration hyperparameter evolves over-time, the system undergoes phase
transitions where the number and stability of equilibria can change radically
given an infinitesimal change to the exploration parameter. Based on this, we
provide a formal theoretical treatment of how tuning the exploration parameter
can provably lead to equilibrium selection with both positive as well as
negative (and potentially unbounded) effects to system performance.

annotated. Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has recently embraced
self-supervised learning as a powerful approach to learn representations from
unlabeled text, in large part due to the attention-based context-aware
Transformer models. In this work we present a modification to the RoBERTa model
by inputting during pre-training a mixture of binding and non-binding protein
sequences (from STRING database). However, the sequence pairs have no label to
indicate their binding status, as the model relies solely on Masked Language
Modeling (MLM) objective during pre-training. After fine-tuning, such approach
surpasses models trained on single protein sequences for protein-protein
binding prediction, TCR-epitope binding prediction, cellular-localization and
remote homology classification tasks. We suggest that the Transformer's
attention mechanism contributes to protein binding site discovery. Furthermore,
we compress protein sequences by 64% with the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
vocabulary consisting of 10K subwords, each around 3-4 amino acids long.
Finally, to expand the model input space to even larger proteins and
multi-protein assemblies, we pre-train Longformer models that support 2,048
tokens. Further work in token-level classification for secondary structure

Dicke-Ising model, which generalizes the Dicke and Ising models for annealed
complex networks presuming spin-spin interaction. The model accounts the
interaction between a spin (two-level) system and external classical (magnetic)
and quantized (transverse) fields. We examine regular, random, and scale-free
network structures characterized by the delta-function, random (Poisson), and
power-law exponent degree distributions, respectively. To describe paramagnetic
(PM) - ferromagnetic (FM) and superradiant (SR) phase transitions we introduce
two order parameters: the total weighted spin z-component and the normalized
transverse field amplitude, which correspond to the spontaneous magnetization
in z and x directions, respectively. Due to the interplay between the spin
interaction and the finite size effects in the networks we first elucidate
novel features of the SR state in the presence of the PM-FM phase transition.
We reveal that the critical temperature of the SR phase transition grows
monotonically from some certain value that corresponds to the critical number
of nodes. For the scale-free networks we find that this critical temperature
rises with the degree exponent increase accompanied both by establishing
spontaneous magnetization in a quantum transverse field and vanishing of the
collective spin component in z direction. In addition, we establish the
conditions for the network parameters to obtain a quantum phase transition in
the spin system when the critical temperature approaches zero. The fundamental
features, which involve critical values of the classical and quantum field
parameters, are discussed for the occurrence of the superradiance phase in this
limit.

experimental results running on an AMD server with four Geforce RTX 2080Ti GPUs
show that our algorithm can achieve 3x speedup plus 19% energy savings on VGG

noiseless and noisy projective measurement data for both pure and mixed states,
we demonstrate quantum state estimation from partial measurement results that

state estimation of large quantum systems where preprocessing is
computationally infeasible due to the exponential scaling of quantum system

non-radiative decay. This is combined with effective waveguiding, optical gain,
and tailored mode confinement to promote morphologically-controlled lasing in

computation. This design choice goes directly against at least three key trends
in computing that cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: (1)
data access is a key bottleneck as many important applications are increasingly
data-intensive, and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, (2) energy
consumption is a key limiter in almost all computing platforms, especially
server and mobile systems, (3) data movement, especially off-chip to on-chip,
is very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than
computation. These trends are especially severely-felt in the data-intensive
server and energy-constrained mobile systems of today. At the same time,
conventional memory technology is facing many technology scaling challenges in
terms of reliability, energy, and performance. As a result, memory system
architects are open to organizing memory in different ways and making it more
intelligent, at the expense of higher cost. The emergence of 3D-stacked memory
plus logic, the adoption of error correcting codes inside the latest DRAM
chips, proliferation of different main memory standards and chips, specialized
for different purposes (e.g., graphics, low-power, high bandwidth, low
latency), and the necessity of designing new solutions to serious reliability
and security issues, such as the RowHammer phenomenon, are an evidence of this
trend. This chapter discusses recent research that aims to practically enable
computation close to data, an approach we call processing-in-memory (PIM). PIM
places computation mechanisms in or near where the data is stored (i.e., inside
the memory chips, in the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory, or in the memory
controllers), so that data movement between the computation units and memory is
reduced or eliminated.

free-boson models is ubiquitous in theoretical descriptions of low-energy
properties in one-dimensional quantum systems. In this work, we develop a
squeezed-field path-integral description for gapless one-dimensional systems
beyond the free-boson picture of the TLL paradigm. In the squeezed-field
description, the parameter of the Bogoliubov transformation for the TL
Hamiltonian becomes a dynamical squeezing field, and its fluctuations give rise
to corrections to the free-boson results. We derive an effective nonlinear
Lagrangian describing the dispersion relation of the squeezing field, and
interactions between the excitations of the TLL and the squeezing modes. Using
the effective Lagrangian, we analyze the imaginary-time correlation function of
a vertex operator in the non-interacting limit. We show that a side-band branch
emerges due to the fluctuation of the squeezing field, in addition to the
standard branch of the free-boson model of the TLL paradigm. Furthermore, we
perturbatively analyze the spectral function of the density fluctuations for an
ultracold Bose gas in one dimension. We evaluate the renormalized values of the
phase velocities and spectral weights of the TLL and side-band branches due to
the interaction between the TLL and the squeezing modes. At zero temperature,
the renormalized dispersion relations are linear in the momentum, but at
nonzero temperatures, these acquire a nonlinear dependence on the momentum due
to the thermal population of the excitation branches.

particular phenotypes that are associated with high risk of cancer. Identifying
relevant phenotypes is complicated by the variation in body position and body
composition. In the brain, standardized coordinate systems (e.g., atlases) have
enabled separate consideration of local features from gross/global structure.
To date, no analogous standard atlas has been presented to enable spatial
mapping and harmonization in chest computational tomography (CT). In this
paper, we propose a thoracic atlas built upon a large low dose CT (LDCT)
database of lung cancer screening program. The study cohort includes 466 male
and 387 female subjects with no screening detected malignancy (age 46-79 years,
mean 64.9 years). To provide spatial mapping, we optimize a multi-stage
inter-subject non-rigid registration pipeline for the entire thoracic space. We
evaluate the optimized pipeline relative to two baselines with alternative
non-rigid registration module: the same software with default parameters and an
alternative software. We achieve a significant improvement in terms of
registration success rate based on manual QA. For the entire study cohort, the
optimized pipeline achieves a registration success rate of 91.7%. The
application validity of the developed atlas is evaluated in terms of
discriminative capability for different anatomic phenotypes, including body
mass index (BMI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary
artery calcification (CAC).

complete lattice was initiated in \cite{2020}. The notion of a closure
operator, closed morphism and its near allies investigated in \cite{2021-clos}.
The present paper provides structural conditions on the triplet $(\mathbb{A},
\mathsf{E}, \mathsf{M})$ (with $\mathbb{A}$ lextensive) equivalent to the set
of $\mathsf{M}$-subobjects of an object closed under finite sums. Equivalent
conditions for the set of closed embeddings (closed morphisms) closed under
finite sums is also provided. In case when lattices of admissible subobjects
(respectively, closed embeddings) are closed under finite sums, the join
semilattice of admissible subobjects (respectively, closed embeddings) of a
finite sum is shown to be a biproduct of the component join semilattices.
Finally, it is shown whenever the set of closed morphisms is closed under
finite sums, the set of proper (respectively, separated) morphisms are also
closed under finite sums. This leads to equivalent conditions for the full
subcategory of compact (respectively, Hausdorff) preneighbourhood spaces to be
closed under finite sums.

Newtonian and viscoelastic carrier fluids are examined using particle resolved
simulations. Comparison to neutrally buoyant particles in the same
configuration highlights the effect of settling. The particle volume fraction
is $5\%$, and a gravity field acts counter to the flow direction. Despite a
modest density ratio ($\rho_r = 1.15$), qualitative changes arise due to the
relative velocity between the particle and fluid phases. While dense particles
are homogeneously distributed in the core of the channel, the mean
concentration profile peaks in the near-wall region due to a competition
between shear- and rotation-induced lift forces. These forces act in the
cross-stream directions, and are analyzed by evaluating conditional averages
along individual particle trajectories. The correlation between the angular and
translational velocities of the particles highlights the significance of the
Magnus lift force in both the spanwise and wall-normal directions. The
collective behaviour of the particles is also intriguing. Using a \Voro
analysis, strong clustering is identified in dense particles near the wall,
which is shown to alter their streamwise velocities. This clustering is
attributed to the preferential transport of aggregated particles towards the
wall. The practical implication of the non-uniformity of particle distribution
is a significant increase in drag. When the carrier fluid is viscoelastic, the
particle migration is enhanced which leads to larger stresses, thus negating
the capacity of viscoelasticity to reduce turbulent drag.

an overall well-defined folded structure. In particular, studies have shown
that the core structure of globular proteins differs in small, but significant
ways when they are solved by x-ray crystallography versus solution-based NMR
spectroscopy. Given these discrepancies, it is unclear whether molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations can accurately recapitulate protein conformations. We
therefore perform extensive MD simulations across multiple force fields and
sampling techniques to investigate the degree to which computer simulations can
capture the ensemble of conformations observed in experiments. By analyzing
fluctuations in the atomic coordinates and core packing, we show that
conformations sampled in MD simulations both move away from and sample a larger
conformational space than the ensemble of structures observed in NMR
experiments. However, we find that adding inter-residue distance restraints
that match those obtained via Nuclear Overhauser Effect measurements enables
the MD simulations to sample more NMR-like conformations, though significant
differences between the core packing features in restrained MD and the NMR
ensemble remain. Given that the protein structures obtained from the MD
simulations possess smaller and less dense protein cores compared to those
solved by NMR, we suggest that future improvements to MD forcefields should aim
to increase the packing of hydrophobic residues in protein cores.

simultaneously allows for extraction probability to be negligibly close to

three types of attackers which can select the seed nodes in a deterministic or
random fashion and manipulate almost half of them to adopt a positive opinion
toward the product (that is, to choose black color). We say that an attacker
succeeds if a majority of nodes are black at the end of the process. Our main
purpose is to characterize classes of graphs where an attacker cannot succeed.
In particular, we prove that if the maximum degree of the underlying graph is
not too large or if it has strong expansion properties, then it is fairly
resilient to such attacks.
  Furthermore, we prove tight bounds on the stabilization time of the process
(that is, the number of rounds it needs to end) in both settings of choosing
the seed nodes deterministically and randomly. We also provide several hardness
results for some optimization problems regarding stabilization time and choice
of seed nodes.

media. A qualitative approach was used to conduct this study, where data were
collected through a literature review. Stress is caused by the inability of a
person to adapt between desires and reality. All forms of stress are basically
caused by a lack of understanding of human's own limitations. Inability to
fight limitations that will cause frustration, conflict, anxiety, and guilt.
Too much stress can threaten a person's ability to deal with the environment.
As a result, employees develop various kinds of stress symptoms that can
interfere with their work performance. Thus, the management of work stress is
important to do, one of which uses humor. However, in the digital age, the
spread of humor can be easily facilitated. The results of this review article
find new perspectives to reduce stress through digital humor, namely
interactive humor, funny photos, manipulations, phanimation, celebrity
soundboards, and PowerPoint humor. The research shows that the use of humor as
a coping strategy is able to predict positive affect and well-being
work-related. Moreover, digital humor which has various forms as well as easy,

human actions in Atari games. Vast evidence suggests that our eye movement
convey a wealth of information about the direction of our attention and mental
states and encode the information necessary to complete a task. Based on this
evidence, we hypothesize that selective use of eye-gaze, as a clue for
attention direction, will enhance the learning from demonstration. For this
purpose, we propose a selective eye-gaze augmentation (SEA) network that learns
when to use the eye-gaze information. The proposed network architecture
consists of three sub-networks: gaze prediction, gating, and action prediction
network. Using the prior 4 game frames, a gaze map is predicted by the gaze
prediction network which is used for augmenting the input frame. The gating
network will determine whether the predicted gaze map should be used in
learning and is fed to the final network to predict the action at the current
frame. To validate this approach, we use publicly available Atari Human
Eye-Tracking And Demonstration (Atari-HEAD) dataset consists of 20 Atari games
with 28 million human demonstrations and 328 million eye-gazes (over game
frames) collected from four subjects. We demonstrate the efficacy of selective
eye-gaze augmentation in comparison with state of the art Attention Guided
Imitation Learning (AGIL), Behavior Cloning (BC). The results indicate that the
selective augmentation approach (the SEA network) performs significantly better
than the AGIL and BC. Moreover, to demonstrate the significance of selective
use of gaze through the gating network, we compare our approach with the random
selection of the gaze. Even in this case, the SEA network performs
significantly better validating the advantage of selectively using the gaze in
demonstration learning.

response drives the local bus voltage angle toward a trajectory that tracks the
angle of the center of inertia. The center-of-inertia angle is estimated in
real time from wide-area measurements. The main objectives are to stabilize
transient disturbances and increase the amount of power that can be safely
transferred over key transmission paths without loss of synchronism. Here we
envision the actuators as utility-scale energy storage systems; however,
equivalent examples could be developed for partially-curtailed photovoltaic
generation and/or Type 4 wind turbine generators. The strategy stems from a
time-varying linearization of the equations of motion for a synchronous
machine. The control action produces synchronizing torque in a special
reference frame that accounts for the motion of the center of inertia. This
drives the system states toward the desired trajectory and promotes rotor angle
stability. For testing we employ a reduced-order dynamic model of the North

often suffer from one or more significant deficiencies: (1) significant design
overhead; (2) difficulty to configure and integrate based on
application-specific requirements; (3) vulnerability to model-building attacks;
and (4) spatial locality to a specific region of a chip. These factors limit
their application in the authentication of designs used in diverse
applications. In this work, we propose MeLPUF: Memory-in-Logic PUF; a
low-overhead, distributed PUF that leverages the existing logic gates in a
design to create cross-coupled inverters (i.e., memory cells) in a logic
circuit as an entropy source. It exploits these memory cells' power-up states
as the entropy source to generate device-specific unique fingerprints. A
dedicated control signal governs these on-demand memory cells. They can be
dispersed across the combinational logic of a design to achieve distributed
authentication. They can also be synthesized with a standard logic synthesis
tool to meet the target area, power, and performance constraints. We evaluate
the quality of MeLPUF signatures with circuit-level simulations and
experimental measurements using FPGA silicon (TSMC 55nm process). Our analysis
shows the high quality of the PUF in terms of uniqueness, randomness, and
robustness while incurring modest overhead. We further demonstrate the
scalability of MeLPUF by aggregating power-up states from multiple memory
cells, thus creating PUF signatures or digital identifiers of varying lengths.
Additionally, we suggest optimization techniques that can be leveraged to boost

weight based on BDMPS formalism, a phenomenological analysis of the nuclear
Drell-Yan differential cross section ratio as a function of Feynman variable is
performed from Fermilab E906 and E866 experimental data. With the nuclear
geometry effect on nuclear Drell-Yan process and the quark transport

experimental measurements. It is found that nuclear geometry effect has a
significant impact on the quark transport coefficient in cold nuclear matter.
It is necessary to consider the detailed nuclear geometry in studying the
nuclear Drell-Yan process. Our calculated results reveal that the difference in
the values of quark transport coefficient exists from E906 and E866

interfere Bob by sending a jamming signal. Considering that the jamming plus
noise at Bob is colored, an enhanced receive beamforming (RBF),
whitening-filter-based maximum ratio combining (MRC) (WFMRC), is proposed.
Subsequently, two RBFs of maximizing the secrecy rate (Max-SR) and minimum mean
square error (MMSE) are presented to show the same performance as WFMRC. To
reduce the computational complexity of conventional MMSE, a low-complexity MMSE
is also proposed. Eventually, to completely remove the jamming signal from
Mallory and transform the residual interference plus noise to a white one, a
new RBF, null-space projection (NSP) based maximizing WF receive power, called

efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of
large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make
DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image
classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss
function for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC
margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square
loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic
optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method

of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii)
classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii)
classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv)
classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies
demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing
cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than
optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification
tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford

map a molecular dynamics trajectory undergoing thermophysical treatment such as
cooling, heating, drying, or compression to a lower dimension. A supervised
deep neural network is subsequently developed based on the lower dimensional
data to characterize the phases and phase transition. As a proof of concept, we
employ this framework to study coil to globule transition of a model polymer
system. We conduct coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to collect
molecular dynamics trajectories of a single polymer chain over a wide range of
temperatures and use dPOLY framework to predict polymer phases. The dPOLY
framework accurately predicts the critical temperatures for the coil to globule
transition for a wide range of polymer sizes. This method is generic and can be
extended to capture various other phase transitions and dynamical crossovers in
polymers and other soft materials.

experimental realization of asymmetrical distribution of Berry curvature in a

The second-harmonic Hall signals show quadratic dependence on electric field,

calculate near-field radiative angular momentum transfer between finite-sized

the presence of an applied magnetic field (T-symmetry breaking). Furthermore,
even in global thermal equilibrium, two particles with misaligned gyrotropic

resulting from significant up- and down-stream costs for obtaining pure CO2,
separation of reaction products and increased logistical effort. We have
discovered a method for economically viable recycling of waste CO2 that
addresses these challenges. Our approach is based on integration of a CO2R unit
into an existing manufacturing process: ethylene oxide (EO) production, which
emits CO2 as a by-product. The standard EO process separates waste CO2 from gas
stream, hence the substrate for electroreduction is available at an EO plant at
no additional cost. CO2 can be converted into an ethylene-rich stream and
recycled on-site back to the EO reactor, which uses ethylene as a raw material,
and also the anode product (oxygen) can be simultaneously valorized for the EO
production reaction. If powered by a renewable electricity source, the process
will significantly (ca. 80%) reduce the CO2 emissions of an EO manufacturing
plant. A sensitivity analysis shows that the recycling approach can be
economically viable in the short term and that its payback time could be as low
as 1-2 years in the regions with higher carbon taxes and/or with access to
low-cost electricity sources.

Kahneman's two-systems model as a framework to understand the computational

happens at two levels, i.e. fast and slow thinking. This paper illustrates
through examples that CT activities can be represented and analyzed using

ellipsoidal-collapse model of halo to explain the dark matter abundance by the
PBH merger estimated from the gravitational waves detections via the Advanced
LIGO (aLIGO) detectors. We have indicated that the PBH merger rate within each
halo for the ellipsoidal models is more significant than for the spherical
models. We have specified that the PBH merger rate per unit time and per unit
volume for the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models is about one order of magnitude
higher than the corresponding spherical models. Moreover, we have calculated
the evolution of the PBH total merger rate as a function of redshift. The
results indicate that the evolution for the ellipsoidal halo models is more
sensitive than spherical halo models, as expected from the models. Finally, we
have presented a constraint on the PBH abundance within the context of
ellipsoidal and spherical models. By comparing the results with the aLIGO
mergers during the third observing run (O3), we have shown that the merger rate
in the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models falls within the aLIGO window, while
the same result is not valid for the spherical-collapse ones. Furthermore, we
have compared the total merger rate of PBHs in terms of their fraction in the
ellipsoidal-collapse halo models for several masses of PBHs. The results
suggest that the total merger rate of PBHs changes inversely with their masses.
We have also estimated the relation between the fraction of PBHs and their
masses in the ellipsoidal-collapse halo model and have shown it for a narrow
mass distribution of PBHs. The outcome shows that the constraint inferred from
the PBH merger rate for the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models can be potentially
stronger than the corresponding result obtained for the spherical-collapse
ones.

a parametric physical model of reservoir behaviour, derived from the solution
for fluid flow in a general class of reservoirs. This permits joint parametric
Bayesian inference for both the reservoir parameters and the true pressure and

Using a set of flexible priors for the reservoir parameters to restrict the
solution space to physical behaviours, samples from the posterior are generated
using MCMC. Summaries and visualisations of the reservoir parameters'
posterior, response, and true pressure and rate values can be produced,
interpreted, and model selection can be performed. The method is validated

facing step was investigated using high speed videography and time-resolved
X-Ray densitometry, along with static and dynamic pressure measurements. The
measurements are used to inform the understanding of underlying mechanisms of
observed flow dynamics as they are related to shock wave induced instabilities.
The differences in cavity topology and behaviour at different cavitation

spanwise vortices in the shear layer and propagating bubbly shock front. The
shock speeds at different cavitation conditions are estimated based on
void-fraction measurements using the X-T diagram and compared to those computed
using the one-dimensional Rankine Hugoniot jump condition. The two
speeds(computed and measured) are found to be comparable. The effect of
compressibility of the bubbly mixture is determined by estimating the local
speed of sound using homogeneous `frozen model' and homogeneous `equilibrium

determine the local speed of sound is closer to the classic `frozen model' than
the `equilibrium model' of speed of sound.

outperform shallow learning such as kernel methods is one of the biggest issues
in the deep learning literature. Towards answering this question, we evaluate
excess risk of a deep learning estimator trained by a noisy gradient descent
with ridge regularization on a mildly overparameterized neural network, and
discuss its superiority to a class of linear estimators that includes neural
tangent kernel approach, random feature model, other kernel methods, $k$-NN
estimator and so on. We consider a teacher-student regression model, and
eventually show that any linear estimator can be outperformed by deep learning
in a sense of the minimax optimal rate especially for a high dimension setting.
The obtained excess bounds are so-called fast learning rate which is faster
than $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ that is obtained by usual Rademacher complexity analysis.
This discrepancy is induced by the non-convex geometry of the model and the
noisy gradient descent used for neural network training provably reaches a near
global optimal solution even though the loss landscape is highly non-convex.
Although the noisy gradient descent does not employ any explicit or implicit
sparsity inducing regularization, it shows a preferable generalization
performance that dominates linear estimators.

splines are assembled by transforming multiple sets of NURBS basis functions

sets of NURBS are allowed to have different polynomial degrees and weight
functions. Tensor products of the univariate splines yield multivariate
splines. In the bivariate setting, we describe how similar

singularities. The material is self-contained, and is presented such that all
tools can be easily implemented by CAD or CAE practitioners within existing

superconducting (SC) phase coexists with metallic and spin density wave phases
in the form of domains. Using the Maxwell-Garnett approximation (MGA), we
provide a method to calculate the volume ratio and the shape of these embedded
SC domains from resistivity data. Due to percolation of SC domains, the zero
resistance can be achieved even when the SC volume ratio $\phi =\phi_c \ll 1$.
This percolation threshold $\phi_c$ depends on the shape and size of SC domains
and of the sample, and may be anisotropic. Using our theory we find $\phi$ for
various cooling rates of (TMTSF)$_{2}$ClO$_{4}$ samples. We also analyze the
effect of disorder on the shape of SC domains. We found that the SC domains
have oblate shape, being the shortest along the interlayer z-axis. This
contradicts the widely assumed filamentary superconductivity along z-axis, used
to explain the anisotropic superconductivity onset. We show that this
anisotropic resistivity drop at the SC transition can be described by the
analytical MGA theory with anisotropic background resistance, while the
anisotropic $T_c$ can be
explained\cite{kochev-AnisotropicZeroresistanceOnset-2020} by considering a
finite size and flat shape of the samples. Due to a flat/needle sample shape,
the probability of percolation via SC domains is the highest along the shortest
sample dimension (z-axis), and the lowest along the sample length (x-axis). Our
theory can be applied to other heterogeneous superconductors, where the size
$d$ of SC domains is much larger than the SC coherence length $\xi$, e.g.
cuprates, iron based or organic superconductors. It is also applicable when the
spin/charge-density wave domains are embedded inside a metallic background, or

Z$_{p}\approx$ 0.8, Z$_{eq}^{f}\approx$ -0.3 and Z$_{eq}^{b}\approx$ 2.2. These
behaviors of redshifts and Kerr parameter are approximately independent of EOS.
The observed behaviors must evaluate by other EOSs to find universal relations
for these quantities. Also, a limit value was found for each of these

learning. To address these challenges, key features of how the brain works
should be taken into account. First, perception is an active process based in
detection of errors in hierarchical predictions of sensory data and action
outcomes. Reading is a particular case of this non-linear predictive process.
Second, emotions play a key role in underlying cognitive functioning, including
oral and written language. Negative emotions undermine motivation to learn.
Third, there is not the fundamental difference between listening/speaking and
reading/writing often alleged on the basis of evolutionary arguments. Both are
socio-cultural practices that are driven through the communication imperative
of the social brain. Fourth, both listening and reading are contextually
occurring pyscho-social practices of understanding, shaped by current knowledge
and cutlural contexts and practices. Fifth, the natural operation of the brain
is not rule-based, as is supposed in the standard view of linguistics: it is
prediction, based on statistical pattern recognition. This all calls into
question narrow interpretations of the widely quoted ""Simple View of Reading"",
which argues that explict decoding is the necessary route to comprehension. One
of the two neural routes to reading does not involve such explicit decoding
processes, and can be activated from the earliest years. An integrated view of
brain function reflecting the non-linear contextual nature of the reading
process implies that an ongoing focus on personal meaning and understanding
from the very beginning provides positive conditions for learning all aspects
of reading and writing.

combustion, a novel continuous fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model is
developed in this paper. The fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model already
in place is known that has a fixed first-order derivative that impairs the
predictive performance to some extent. To address this problem, in the newly
proposed model, a flexible variable is introduced into the order of derivative,
freeing it from integer-order accumulation. In order to further improve the
performance of the newly proposed model, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely
Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), is determined to the emerging coefficients. To
demonstrate the effectiveness, two real examples and China's fuel
combustion-related CO$_2$ emissions are used for model validation by comparing
with other benchmark models, the results show the proposed model outperforms

  Unet (DDAUnet)",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Manual or automatic delineation of the esophageal tumor in CT images is known
to be very challenging. This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and
adjacent tissues, the anatomical variation of the esophagus, as well as the
occasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians
therefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic findings,
clinical history, additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his
additional information is time-consuming, while the results are error-prone and
might lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we aim to investigate if
and to what extent a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone, allows one
to automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufficient quality. For this
purpose, we present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation
method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network,
called Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet), leverages spatial and channel
attention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on determinant
feature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU
memory and increase the network receptive field. We collected a dataset of 792
scans from 288 distinct patients including varying anatomies with \mbox{air
pockets}, feeding tubes and proximal tumors. Repeatability and reproducibility
studies were conducted for three distinct splits of training and validation
sets. The proposed network achieved a $\mathrm{DSC}$ value of $0.79 \pm 0.20$,
a mean surface distance of $5.4 \pm 20.2mm$ and $95\%$ Hausdorff distance of
$14.7 \pm 25.0mm$ for 287 test scans, demonstrating promising results with a
simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone. Our code is publicly available

By addressing the delay concern, a platoon control approach is proposed to

of the radio parameters such as massive MIMO antennas and frequency band on the

reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system,
where a legitimate transmitter (Alice) applies NOMA for downlink and uplink
transmissions with a covert user (Bob) and a public user (Roy) aided by an IRS.
Specifically, we propose new IRS-assisted downlink and uplink NOMA schemes to
hide the existence of Bob's covert transmission from a warden (Willie), which
cost-effectively exploit the phase-shift uncertainty of the IRS and the
non-orthogonal signal transmission of Roy as the cover medium without requiring
additional uncertainty sources. Assuming the worst-case covert communication
scenario where Willie can optimally adjust the detection threshold for his
detector, we derive an analytical expression for the minimum average detection
error probability of Willie achieved by each of the proposed schemes. To
further enhance the covert communication performance, we propose to maximize
the covert rates of Bob by jointly optimizing the transmit power and the IRS
reflect beamforming, subject to given requirements on the covertness against
Willie and the quality-of-service (QoS) at Roy. Simulation results demonstrate
the covertness advantage of the proposed schemes and confirm the accuracy of
the derived analytical results. Interestingly, it is found that covert
communication is impossible without using IRS or NOMA for the considered setup

However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after a user click. This
may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In
previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting
positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample
on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when a conversion happens
later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels
and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike
a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback
Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion
distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the
expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the
elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight
for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR
prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive

results confirm that our method consistently outperforms the previous

not have adjustable apertures, further limiting the ability to produce the
necessary training data. We address the data capture bottleneck by proposing a
procedure to generate realistic DP data synthetically. Our synthesis approach
mimics the optical image formation found on DP sensors and can be applied to
virtual scenes rendered with standard computer software. Leveraging these
realistic synthetic DP images, we introduce a recurrent convolutional network

observed, which is sufficient to distinguish a cancerous region. The

strategic agents. A prime example is signaling in online ad auctions: what
information should a platform signal to an advertiser regarding a user when
selling the opportunity to advertise to her? Practical considerations such as
preventing discrimination, protecting privacy or acknowledging limited
attention of the information receiver impose constraints on information
sharing. In this work, we propose and analyze a simple way to mathematically
model such constraints as restrictions on Receiver's admissible posterior
beliefs.
  We consider two families of constraints - ex ante and ex post, where the
latter limits each instance of Sender-Receiver communication, while the former
more general family can also pose restrictions in expectation. For the ex ante
family, Doval and Skreta establish the existence of an optimal signaling scheme
with a small number of signals - at most the number of constraints plus the
number of states of nature; we show this result is tight and provide an
alternative proof for it. For the ex post family, we tighten a bound of
V{\o}lund, showing that the required number of signals is at most the number of
states of nature, as in the original Kamenica-Gentzkow setting. As our main
algorithmic result, we provide an additive bi-criteria FPTAS for an optimal
constrained signaling scheme assuming a constant number of states; we improve
the approximation to single-criteria under a Slater-like regularity condition.
The FPTAS holds under standard assumptions; relaxed assumptions yield a PTAS.
Finally, we bound the ratio between Sender's optimal utility under convex ex
ante constraints and the corresponding ex post constraints. This bound applies
to finding an approximately welfare-maximizing constrained signaling scheme in
ad auctions.

global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. While governments and healthcare
agencies are eager to mandate the deployment of such applications en-masse,
they face increasing scrutiny from the popular press, security companies, and
human rights watch agencies that fear the exploitation of these technologies as
surveillance tools. Finding the optimal balance between community safety and
privacy has been a challenge, and strategies to address these concerns have
varied among countries. This paper describes two important attacks that affect
a broad swath of contact-tracing applications. The first, referred to as
contact-isolation attack, is a user-privacy attack that can be used to identify
potentially infected patients in your neighborhood. The second is a
contact-pollution attack that affects the integrity of contact tracing
applications by causing them to produce a high volume of false-positive alerts.
We developed prototype implementations and evaluated both attacks in the
context of the DP-3T application framework, but these vulnerabilities affect a
much broader class of applications. We found that both attacks are feasible and
realizable with a minimal attacker work factor. We further conducted an impact
assessment of these attacks by using a simulation study and measurements from
the SafeGraph database. Our results indicate that attacks launched from a
modest number (on the order of 10,000) of monitoring points can effectively
decloak between 5-40\% of infected users in a major metropolis, such as
Houston.

territories safe by isolating themselves from others, limiting non-essential
travel and imposing mandatory quarantines for travelers. While large-scale
quarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is unsustainable
over long periods as it exerts enormous costs on societies. As a result,
governments which have been able to partially control the spread of the disease
have been deciding to reopen businesses. However, the WHO has warned about the
risks of re-opening prematurely, as is playing out in some countries such as
Spain, France and various states in the US such as California, Florida,
Arizona, and Texas. Thus, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy that
limits transmission without requiring large scale and damaging quarantines.
Here, we have designed a multi-level quarantine process based on the mobility
patterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in the US. By
identifying the natural boundaries of social mobility, policymakers can impose
travel restrictions that are minimally disruptive to social and economic
activity. The dynamics of social fragmentation during the COVID-19 outbreak are
analyzed by applying the Louvain method with modularity optimization to weekly
mobility networks. In a multi-scale community detection process, using the
locations of confirmed cases, natural break points as well as high risk areas
for contagion are identified. At the smaller scales, for communities with a
higher number of confirmed cases, contact tracing and associated quarantine
policies is increasingly important and can be informed by the community
structure.

indicates that the broadband low-frequency unsteadiness is predominantly
two-dimensional, and can be isolated via spanwise averaging. Empirically
derived transfer functions are computed using the averaged flow field, and
indicate the occurrence of a feedback mechanism between downstream flow regions
and shock fluctuations. The transfer functions are also used as an estimation
tool to predict the shock motion accurately; for the largest streamwise
separation between input and output signals, correlations above 0.6 are
observed between predicted and LES data. Computation of spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes confirms the existence of upstream
traveling waves in the leading spectral mode. Finally, the spectral modes
obtained using selected flow regions downstream of the shock enable the
reconstruction of a significant portion of the energy in the interaction zone.
The current results shed further light on the physical mechanisms driving the
shock motion, pointing towards a causal behavior between downstream areas and
the characteristic unsteady fluctuations at the approximate shock position.

fundamental domains of all such groups satisfy a very special analytic
property: the Dirichlet eigenfunctions for the Laplace eigenvalue equation are
all trigonometric functions. In 2008, McCartin proved that in two dimensions,
this special analytic property has both an equivalent algebraic formulation, as
well as an equivalent geometric formulation. Here we generalize the results of
B\'erard and McCartin to all dimensions. We prove that the following are

despite numerous optimizations of the underlying transport protocol, a user's
utilization of network bandwidth and is thus the user's perceived quality still

1 (a), it is impossible to accurately forecast the values, meaning that the
solutions coming from deterministic approaches could lead to infeasible
operations (i.e., constraint violations). Therefore, stochastic optimization
approaches [8] should be utilized to fi nd optimal solution strategies while
considering uncertain parameters.

cells) can be utilized in electric vehicles to store and provide energy in the
e-powertrain through power electronic devices [1-6]. The lifetime of the
components in the e-powertrain depends on their load profile [7,8]. For
instance, the lifetime of a battery highly depends on the depth of discharge
and the number of charge/discharge cycles [9-13]. The lifetime of an inverter
mostly depends on the variations in the active-reactive power passing through
it. This means that the expended life cost of the components can be decreased
by allocating an optimal share of the total power to each energy source and
power electronic device at an optimal time instance. In addition, the driving
range of a vehicle can be prolonged by decreasing the energy loss i.e.,
operating the components in their high-efficiency region. Therefore, it is
necessary to perform Optimal Power Flow (OPF) in the operation of the

which uses the resonant absorption of neutrons in the epithermal range to infer

the past made use of large, expensive accelerator facilities to achieve precise

describe a series of NRTA experiments where we use a compact, low-cost

from five elements -- silver, cadmium, tungsten, indium, and $^{238}$U --
clearly show the corresponding absorption lines in the 1-30 eV range. The
experiments show the applicability of NRTA in this simplified configuration,
and prove the feasibility of this compact and low-cost approach. This could
significantly broaden the applicability of NRTA, and make it practical and
applicable in many fields, such as material science, nuclear engineering, and

$k\in\mathbb{N}$, the $k$-disc of a vertex $v\in V$ is defined as the rooted
subgraph of $G$ that is induced by all vertices whose distance to $v$ is at
most $k$. The $k$-disc frequency distribution vector of $G$, denoted by
$\text{freq}_{k}(G)$, is a vector indexed by all isomorphism types of rooted
$k$-discs. For each such isomorphism type $\Gamma$, the corresponding entry in
$\text{freq}_{k}(G)$ counts the fraction of vertices in $V$ that have a
$k$-disc isomorphic to $\Gamma$. In a sense, $\text{freq}_{k}(G)$ is one way to
represent the ""local structure"" of $G$. The graph $G$ can be arbitrarily large,
and so a natural question is whether given $\text{freq}_{k}(G)$ it is possible
to construct a small graph $H$, whose size is independent of $|V|$, such that
$H$ has a similar local structure. N. Alon proved that for any $\epsilon>0$
there always exists a graph $H$ whose size is independent of $|V|$ and whose
frequency vector satisfies
$||\text{freq}_{k}(G)-\text{freq}_{k}(H)||_{1}\le\epsilon$. However, his proof
is only existential and does not imply that there is a deterministic algorithm
to construct such a graph $H$. He gave the open problem of finding an explicit
deterministic algorithm that finds $H$, or proving that no such algorithm
exists. Our main result is that Alon's problem is undecidable if and only if a
much more general problem (involving directed edges and edge colors) is
undecidable. We also prove that both problems are decidable for the special
case when $G$ is a path. We show that the local structure of any directed
edge-colored path $G$ can be approximated by a suitable fixed-size directed
edge-colored path $H$ and we give explicit bound on the size of $H$.

then calibrated and validated against the available data. In addition to the
observed data, the DPD framework can utilize available prior physical models,

can discover an additive or multiplicative correction term represented
symbolically. The correction term can be a function of the existing input

model is not available, the DPD framework discovers a new data-based standalone
model governing the observations. We demonstrate the performance of the

alloys or composites are referred to as high-entropy materials (HEMs) and are
here presented primarily in context of structural applications. For each output
property of interest, the corresponding driving (input) factors are identified.
These input factors may include the material composition, heat treatment,
manufacturing process, microstructure, temperature, strain rate, environment,
or testing mode. The framework assumes the selection of an optimization
technique suitable for the application at hand and the data available.
Physics-based models are presented, such as for predicting the ultimate tensile
strength (UTS) or fatigue resistance. We devise models capable of accounting
for physics-based dependencies. We factor such dependencies into the models as
a priori information. In case that an artificial neural network (ANN) is deemed
suitable for the applications at hand, it is suggested to employ custom kernel
functions consistent with the underlying physics, for the purpose of attaining
tighter coupling, better prediction, and for extracting the most out of the -

detecting relapse. Here, a highly enhanced plasmonic biosensor that can
overcome this challenge using atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) phase change

atomically thin materials, the phase singularity has been successfully achieved
with a significantly enhanced lateral position shift effect. Based on our
knowledge, it is the first experimental demonstration of a lateral position
signal change > 340 {\mu}m at a sensing interface from all optical techniques.
With this enhanced plasmonic effect, the detection limit has been
experimentally demonstrated to be 10-15 mol L-1 for TNF-{\alpha} cancer marker,
which has been found in various human diseases including inflammatory diseases
and different kinds of cancer. The as-reported novel integration of atomically
thin Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) with plasmonic substrate, which results in a phase
singularity and thus a giant lateral position shift, enables the detection of
cancer markers with low molecular weight at femtomolar level. These results
will definitely hold promising potential in biomedical application and clinical
diagnostics.

convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been utilized for different types of
image fusion tasks such as medical image fusion, infrared-visible image fusion
for autonomous driving as well as multi-focus and multi-exposure image fusion
for satellite imagery. However, it is challenging to analyze the reliability of
these CNNs for the image fusion tasks since no groundtruth is available. This
led to the use of a wide variety of model architectures and optimization
functions yielding quite different fusion results. Additionally, due to the
highly opaque nature of such neural networks, it is difficult to explain the
internal mechanics behind its fusion results. To overcome these challenges, we
present a novel real-time visualization tool, named FuseVis, with which the
end-user can compute per-pixel saliency maps that examine the influence of the
input image pixels on each pixel of the fused image. We trained several image
fusion based CNNs on medical image pairs and then using our FuseVis tool, we
performed case studies on a specific clinical application by interpreting the
saliency maps from each of the fusion methods. We specifically visualized the
relative influence of each input image on the predictions of the fused image
and showed that some of the evaluated image fusion methods are better suited
for the specific clinical application. To the best of our knowledge, currently,
there is no approach for visual analysis of neural networks for image fusion.
Therefore, this work opens up a new research direction to improve the
interpretability of deep fusion networks. The FuseVis tool can also be adapted
in other deep neural network based image processing applications to make them
interpretable.

photovoltaics obey a distinct law of detailed balance1. Since radiative
processes depend on only two independent variables that are the chemical
potential and the temperature, the detailed balance, and the two laws of
