as a promising material for advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices such

integrated in a silicon (Si) chip via back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes, the
stability of monolayer $WS_2$ in BEOL fabrication conditions should be studied.
In this work, the thermal stability of monolayer single-crystal $WS_2$ at
typical BEOL conditions is investigated; namely (i) heating temperature of
$300$ $^\circ C$, (ii) pressures in the medium- ($10^{-3}$ mbar) and high-
($10^{-8}$ mbar) vacuum range; (iii) heating times from $30$ minutes to $20$
hours. Structural, optical and chemical analyses of $WS_2$ are performed via
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL)
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that monolayer
single-crystal $WS_2$ is intrinsically stable at these temperature and
pressures, even after $20$ hours of thermal treatment. The thermal stability of
$WS_2$ is also preserved after exposure to low-current electron beam ($12$ pA)
or low-fluence laser ($0.9$ $mJ/\mu m^2$), while higher laser fluencies cause
photo-activated degradation upon thermal treatment. These results are
instrumental to define fabrication and in-line monitoring procedures that allow
the integration of $WS_2$ in device fabrication flows without compromising the
material quality.

(mainshocks), and dependent (clustered) events, and is an integral component of
many seismicity studies, including seismic hazard assessment. We assess the
effect of declustering on the frequency-magnitude distribution of mainshocks.
In particular, we examine the dependence of the b-value of declustered catalogs
on the choice of declustering approach and algorithm-specific parameters. Using
the catalog of earthquakes in California since 1980, we show that the b-value
decreases by up to 30% due to declustering with respect to the undeclustered
catalog. The extent of the reduction is highly dependent on the declustering
method and parameters applied. We then reproduce a similar effect by
declustering synthetic earthquake catalogs with known b-value, which have been
generated using an Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model. Our analysis
suggests that the observed decrease in b-value must, at least partially, arise
from the application of the declustering algorithm on the catalog, rather than
from differences in the nature of mainshocks versus fore- or aftershocks. We
conclude that declustering should be considered as a potential source of bias
in seismicity and hazard studies.

able to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any

network. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific

Sapienza University of Rome (2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning models heavily rely on large scale annotated datasets for
training. Unfortunately, datasets cannot capture the infinite variability of
the real world, thus neural networks are inherently limited by the restricted
visual and semantic information contained in their training set. In this
thesis, we argue that it is crucial to design deep architectures that can
operate in previously unseen visual domains and recognize novel semantic
concepts. In the first part of the thesis, we describe different solutions to
enable deep models to generalize to new visual domains, by transferring
knowledge from a labeled source domain(s) to a domain (target) where no labeled
data are available. We will show how variants of batch-normalization (BN) can
be applied to different scenarios, from domain adaptation when source and
target are mixtures of multiple latent domains, to domain generalization,
continuous domain adaptation, and predictive domain adaptation, where
information about the target domain is available only in the form of metadata.
In the second part of the thesis, we show how to extend the knowledge of a
pretrained deep model to new semantic concepts, without access to the original
training set. We address the scenarios of sequential multi-task learning, using
transformed task-specific binary masks, open-world recognition, with end-to-end
training and enforced clustering, and incremental class learning in semantic
segmentation, where we highlight and address the problem of the semantic shift
of the background class. In the final part, we tackle a more challenging
problem: given images of multiple domains and semantic categories (with their
attributes), how to build a model that recognizes images of unseen concepts in
unseen domains? We also propose an approach based on domain and semantic mixing
of inputs and features, which is a first, promising step towards solving this

computation. A particularly popular gate set in the literature on quantum
computing consists of arbitrary single-qubit gates and 2-qubit CNOT gates. A
CNOT gate is however not always the natural multi-qubit interaction that can be
implemented on a given physical quantum computer, necessitating a compilation
step that transforms these CNOT gates to the native gate set. A particularly
interesting case where compilation is necessary is for ion trap quantum
computers, where the natural entangling operation can act on more than 2 qubits
and can even act globally on all qubits at once. This calls for an entirely
different approach to constructing efficient circuits. In this paper we study
the problem of converting a given circuit that uses 2-qubit gates to one that
uses global gates. Our three main contributions are as follows. First, we find
an efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary circuit consisting of
Clifford gates and arbitrary phase gates into a circuit consisting of
single-qubit gates and a number of global interactions proportional to the
number of non-Clifford phases present in the original circuit. Second, we find
a general strategy to transform a global gate that targets all qubits into one
that targets only a subset of the qubits. This approach scales linearly with
the number of qubits that are not targeted, in contrast to the exponential
scaling reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018). Third, we improve on the
number of global gates required to synthesise an arbitrary n-qubit Clifford
circuit from the 12n-18 reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018) to 6n-8.

the $2\pi{n}$ periodicity of the phase potential of the junction results in a
significant suppression of the maximal current $I_m$ for an insulating regime

finite-size system with avoided level crossings characterized by splitting
$\delta$. We consider two limiting cases: when the phase evolution may be
considered adiabatic, which results in decreased periodicity of the effective
potential, and the opposite case, when Landau-Zener transitions restore the
$2\pi{n}$ periodicity of the phase potential. The resulting current $I_m$ is
exponentially different in the opposite limits, which allows us to propose a
new detection method to establish the appearance of parafermions in the system

function of experimental parameters, such as the incident wavelength,
scattering angle, pressure and temperature is analyzed, as well as the
dependence on thermodynamic properties of the gas, as the shear viscosity, the
thermal conductivity, the internal heat capacity and the bulk viscosity.
Measurements are performed in a scattering geometry detecting at a scattering
angle $\theta=55.7^\circ$ and an incident wavelength of $\lambda_i=532.22$ nm,
at which the Brillouin features become more pronounced than in a right angles
geometry and for ultraviolet light. For pressure conditions of 1 - 3 bar the
RB-spectra, measured at high signal-to-noise ratio, are compared to Tenti-S6
model calculations and values for the bulk viscosity of air are extracted.
Values of $\eta_b$ are found to exhibit a linear dependence on temperature over
the measurement interval in the range $1.0 - 2.0 \times 10^{-5}$ Pa$\cdot$s. A
temperature dependent value is deduced from a collection of experiments to
yield: $\eta_{\rm b} = (0.86 \times 10^{-5}) + 1.29 \times 10^{-7} \cdot (T -

for the low pressure conditions ($p < 1$ bar) relevant for the Earth's
atmosphere. As a result we demonstrate that the RB-scattering spectral profiles
for air under sub-atmospheric conditions can be generated via the Tenti-S6
model, for given gas-phase and detection conditions ($p$, $T$, $\lambda_i$, and
$\theta$), and for values for the gas transport coefficients.

well with observations, the modeled CME moves beyond the inner simulation
boundary after several hours. The model therefore accurately describes the
acceleration processes in the low corona and resolves the sites of most rapid
acceleration close to the Sun. Plots of integral flux envelopes from multiple
simulated observers near Earth further improve the comparison to observations
and increase potential for predicting solar particle events. Broken-power-law
fits to fluence spectra agree with diffusive acceleration theory over the low
energy range. Over the high energy range, they demonstrate the variability in
acceleration rate and mirror the inter-event variability observed solar-cycle
23 GLEs. We discuss ways to improve STAT predictions, including using corrected
GOES energy bins and computing fits to the seed spectrum. This paper
demonstrates a predictive tool for simulating low-coronal SEP acceleration.

differentiation is classical and goes back to Marcel Riesz. In this paper, we
analyze a nonlocal nonlinear partial differential equation formally derived by

differentiation. Interestingly, the same equation has also been recently
obtained formally by Dimitri Shlyakhtenko and Terence Tao as the evolution
equation for free fractional convolution of a measure - an object in free
probability that is also related to minor processes for random matrices. The
partial differential equation bears striking resemblance to hydrodynamic models
used to describe the collective behavior of agents (such as birds, fish or
robots) in mathematical biology. We consider periodic setting and show global
regularity and exponential in time convergence to uniform density for solutions
corresponding to strictly positive smooth initial data. In the second part of
the paper we connect rigorously solutions of the Steinerberger's PDE and
evolution of roots under differentiation for a class of trigonometric
polynomials. Namely, we prove that the distribution of the zeros of the
derivatives of a polynomial and the corresponding solutions of the PDE remain
close for all times. The global in time control follows from the analysis of
the propagation of errors equation, which turns out to be a nonlinear
fractional heat equation with the main term similar to the modulated
discretized fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{1/2}$.

galaxy morphologies in the early universe, measuring galaxy structure can be
challenging. Non-parametric measurements such as the CAS system have thus
become an important tool due to both their model-independent nature and their
utility as a straightforward computational process. Recently, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be adept at image analysis, and are
beginning to supersede traditional measurements of visual morphology and
model-based structural parameters. In this work, we take a further step by
extending CNNs to measure well known non-parametric structural quantities:
concentration ($C$) and asymmetry ($A$). We train CNNs to predict $C$ and $A$
from individual images of $\sim 150,000$ galaxies at $0 < z < 7$ in the CANDELS
fields, using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to select suitable network
architectures. Our resulting networks accurately reproduce measurements
compared with standard algorithms. Furthermore, using simulated images, we show
that our networks are more stable than the standard algorithms at low
signal-to-noise. While both approaches suffer from similar systematic biases
with redshift, these remain small out to $z \sim 7$. Once trained, measurements
with our networks are $> 10^3$ times faster than previous methods. Our approach
is thus able to reproduce standard measures of non-parametric morphologies and
shows the potential of employing neural networks to provide superior results in
substantially less time. This will be vital for making best use of the large
and complex datasets provided by upcoming galaxy surveys, such as Euclid and
Rubin-LSST.

over $T \gtrsim M$. In this work, we address the impact of the high-temperature
regime on the dark matter production rate, where the dark and Standard Model
particles are ultra-relativistic and nearly light-like. In this setting,
multiple soft scatterings, as well as $2 \to 2$ processes, are found to give a

heavier scalar $-$ with mass splitting $\Delta M$ $-$ which shares interactions
with the visible sector, the energy density can be dramatically underestimated

effective $1 \leftrightarrow 2$ and $2 \to2$ high-temperature contributions to
dark-matter production give $\mathcal{O}(10)$ (20\%) corrections for $\Delta M

networks. A structured network is a family of structured systems (called node
systems) that are interconnected by means of a structured interconnection law.
The node systems and their structured interconnection law are given by pattern
matrices. It is shown that a structured network is strongly structurally
controllable if and only if an associated structured system is. This structured
system will in general have a very large state space dimension, and therefore
existing tests for verifying strong structural controllability are not
tractable. The main result of this paper circumvents this problem. We show that
controllability can be tested by replacing the original network by a new
network in which all original node systems have been replaced by (auxiliary)
node systems with state space dimensions either 1 or 2. Hence, controllability
of the original network can be verified by testing controllability of a
structured system with state space dimension at most twice the number of node
systems, regardless of the state space dimensions of the original node systems.

entanglement in the laboratory without having the prior knowledge of the full

entangled in such detections in the presence of wrong measurements or loss in
detectors. Measurement-device-independent entanglement witnesses (MDI-EWs)
never detect fake entanglement even under wrong measurements and for a
particular kind of lossy detectors. A crucial assumption in the case of
faithful detection of entanglement employing MDI-EWs is that the preparation
devices producing ""quantum inputs"" - which are inputs additional to the quantum
state whose entanglement is to be detected - are perfect and there is no noise
during their transmission. Here, we relax these assumptions and provide a
general framework for studying the effect of noise on the quantum inputs,
invoking uniform and non-uniform noise models. We derive sufficient conditions
on the uniform noisy map for retaining the characteristic of MDI-EWs. We find
that in the context of non-uniform and entangling noise, fake entanglement
detection is possible even by MDI-EWs. We also investigate various paradigmatic
models of local noise and find conditions of revealing entanglement in the

micron high-contrast lenslet integral-field spectrograph (IFS) driven by
exoplanet characterization science requirements and will operate at W. M. Keck
Observatory. Its fully cryogenic optical train uses a custom silicon lenslet
array, selectable coronagraphs, and dispersive prisms to carry out integral
field spectroscopy over a 2.2 arcsec field of view at Keck with low ($<300$)
spectral resolution. A small, dedicated section of the lenslet array feeds an
image slicer module that allows for medium spectral resolution ($5000-10 000$),
which has not been available at the diffraction limit with a coronagraphic
instrument before. Unlike previous IFS exoplanet instruments, SCALES is capable
of characterizing cold exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres ($<600$ K) at
bandpasses where these bodies emit most of their radiation while capturing
relevant molecular spectral features.

by biological materials such as algae and leaves therefore exhibits a small
amount of circular polarization that strongly depends on wavelength. Our Life
Signature Detection polarimeter (LSDpol) is optimized to measure these
signatures of life. LSDpol is a compact spectropolarimeter concept with no
moving parts that instantaneously measures linear and circular polarization
averaged over the field of view with a sensitivity of better than 1e-4. We
expect to launch the instrument into orbit after validating its performance on
the ground and from aircraft.
  LSDpol is based on a spatially varying quarter-wave retarder that is
implemented with a patterned liquid-crystal. It is the first optical element to
maximize the polarimetric sensitivity. Since this pattern as well as the
entrance slit of the spectrograph have to be imaged onto the detector, the slit
serves as the aperture, and an internal field stop limits the field of view.
The retarder's fast axis angle varies linearly along one spatial dimension. A
fixed quarter-wave retarder combined with a polarization grating act as the
disperser and the polarizing beam-splitter. Circular and linear polarization
are thereby encoded at incompatible modulation frequencies across the spectrum,
which minimizes the potential cross-talk from linear into circular
polarization.

enabling technologies of 5G and beyond networks. While prior work indicates
that mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant
capacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing
(FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks
are the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead
associated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information
(CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize
assumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular
reciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable
and low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams
architecture. The key idea behind our scheme lies in the exploitation of the
near-common signal propagation paths that are often found across several mobile
users located in nearby regions, through a coordination mechanism. In doing so,
we leverage the recently specified device-to-device communications capability
in 5G networks. Specifically, we design beam selection algorithms capable of
striking a balance between CSI acquisition overhead and multi-user interference
mitigation. The selection exploits statistical information, through so-called
covariance shaping. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms, which prove particularly well-suited to rapidly-varying
channels with short coherence time.

  When adopting the stellar parameters published with data release DR2 of XSL,
we find that the SEDs of the models are consistent with those of the data at
Teff > 5000 K. Below 5000 K, there are significant discrepancies in the SEDs.
When leaving the stellar parameters free to adjust, satisfactory
representations of the SEDs are obtained down to about 4000 K. However, in
particular below 5000 K and in the UVB spectral range, strong local residuals
associated with intermediate resolution spectral features are then seen; the
necessity of a compromise between reproducing the line spectra and reproducing
the SEDs leads to dispersion between the parameters favored by various spectral
ranges. We describe the main trends observed and we point out localized offsets
between the parameters preferred in this global fit to the SEDs and the
parameters in DR2. These depend in a complex way on position in the HR diagram

light-matter coupling by means of tight confinement of resonant electromagnetic
fields. Investigation of such resonators however often presents experimental
difficulties, particularly at terahertz (THz) frequencies. A single
subwavelength resonator weakly interacts with THz beams, making it difficult to
probe it using far-field methods; whereas arrays of resonators exhibit
inter-resonator coupling, which affects the resonator spectral signature and
field confinement. Here, traditional far-field THz spectroscopy is
systematically compared with aperture-type THz near-field microscopy for
investigating complementary THz resonators. Whilst the far-field method proves
impractical for measuring single resonators, the near-field technique gives
high signal-to-noise spectral information, only achievable in the far-field
with resonator arrays. At the same time, the near-field technique allows us to
analyze single resonators - free from inter-resonator coupling present in
arrays - without significant interaction with the near-filed probe.
Furthermore, the near-field technique allows highly confined fields and surface
waves to be mapped in space and time. This information gives invaluable insight
into resonator spectral response in arrays. This near-field microscopy and
spectroscopy method enables investigations of strong light-matter coupling at
THz frequencies in the single-resonator regime.

the Clausius theorem are preserved due to the fact that heat and work are
related based on conservation of energy. As a demonstration we consider the

non-stationary processes, applying time-and-space averages to characterize
non-ergodic effects in heterogeneous systems where energy barriers such as
compositional gradients are present. We show that the derived theory can be

increasingly used to either score or rank agents in order to decide which ones
should receive either resources (e.g., homeless services) or scrutiny (e.g.,
child welfare investigations) from social services agencies. An agency's
scoring function typically operates on a feature vector that contains a
combination of self-reported features and information available to the agency
about individuals or households.This can create incentives for agents to
misrepresent their self-reported features in order to receive resources or
avoid scrutiny, but agencies may be able to selectively audit agents to verify
the veracity of their reports.
  We study the problem of optimal auditing of agents in such settings. When
decisions are made using a threshold on an agent's score, the optimal audit
policy has a surprisingly simple structure, uniformly auditing all agents who
could benefit from lying. While this policy can, in general, be hard to compute
because of the difficulty of identifying the set of agents who could benefit
from lying given a complete set of reported types, we also present necessary
and sufficient conditions under which it is tractable. We show that the scarce
resource setting is more difficult, and exhibit an approximately optimal audit
policy in this case. In addition, we show that in either setting verifying
whether it is possible to incentivize exact truthfulness is hard even to
approximate. However, we also exhibit sufficient conditions for solving this
problem optimally, and for obtaining good approximations.

dimension, they suffer more severe corrosion by the electrolyte solution than
the thin-film counterparts. Thus, short-term durability is the major obstacle
for using these NWs for practical water splitting applications. Here, we
demonstrated for the first time that a thin layer (~7 nm thick) of compact
TiO$_2$ deposited by atomic layer deposition can provide robust protection to
III-V NWs. The protected GaAs NWs maintain 91.4% of its photoluminescence
intensity after 14 months of storage in ambient atmosphere, which suggests the
TiO$_2$ layer is pinhole-free. Working as a photocathode for water splitting,
they exhibited a 45% larger photocurrent density compared with un-protected
counterparts and a high Faraday efficiency of 91%, and can also maintain a
record-long highly-stable performance among narrow-bandgap III-V NW
photoelectrodes; after 67 hours photoelectrochemical stability test reaction in
strong acid electrolyte solution (pH = 1), they show no apparent indication of
corrosion, which is in stark contrast to the un-protected NWs that are fully
failed after 35-hours. These findings provide an effective way to enhance both
stability and performance of III-V NW based photoelectrodes, which are highly

of the integral of the measure over the separable states to its integral over
all (separable and entangled) states to be 0.0288. This can be contrasted with
the considerably larger separability ratios (probabilities) of $\frac{8}{33} =

use of the prominent Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures measures, respectively. The
questions of whether the ratio in the QSE setting can be more precisely
obtained or even exactly computed, as well as whether a metric can be
constructed, the volume element of which yields the measure, remain to be
addressed. We also investigate related issues pertaining to absolute
separability. Further, we examine the behavior of the separability
probability--constant in the Hilbert-Schmidt case and decreasing in the
Bures--as a function of the Bloch vector norm in the QSE instance. It appears
to increase approaching the pure state boundary.

  Learning","8 pages, +4 pages appendix",,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurately predicting the dynamics of robotic systems is crucial for
model-based control and reinforcement learning. The most common way to estimate
dynamics is by fitting a one-step ahead prediction model and using it to
recursively propagate the predicted state distribution over long horizons.
Unfortunately, this approach is known to compound even small prediction errors,
making long-term predictions inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new
parametrization to supervised learning on state-action data to stably predict
at longer horizons -- that we call a trajectory-based model. This
trajectory-based model takes an initial state, a future time index, and control
parameters as inputs, and directly predicts the state at the future time index.
Experimental results in simulated and real-world robotic tasks show that
trajectory-based models yield significantly more accurate long term

reward. With these improved prediction properties, we conclude with a
demonstration of methods for using the trajectory-based model for control.

in natural language based on the rationales. NLEs have been shown to capture
human reasoning better, but not as beneficial for natural language inference

currently used to train explanation generators for language inference tasks. We
find that the explanation generators do not take into account the variability
inherent in human explanation of labels, and that the current explanation
generation models generate spurious explanations. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel framework, LIREx, that incorporates both a
rationale-enabled explanation generator and an instance selector to select only
relevant, plausible NLEs to augment NLI models. When evaluated on the
standardized SNLI data set, LIREx achieved an accuracy of 91.87%, an
improvement of 0.32 over the baseline and matching the best-reported
performance on the data set. It also achieves significantly better performance
than previous studies when transferred to the out-of-domain MultiNLI data set.
Qualitative analysis shows that LIREx generates flexible, faithful, and

Return-oriented programming (ROP) gained popularity as one of the most

These galaxies, which live at the centers of galaxy groups and clusters, have
star formation and black hole activity that is primarily fueled by gas
condensing out of the hot intracluster medium. For a sample of 46 galaxies
spanning 5 orders of magnitude in BHAR and SFR, we find a mean ratio of
log(BHAR/SFR) = -1.45 +/- 0.2, independent of the methodology used to constrain
both SFR and BHAR. This ratio is significantly higher than most
previously-published values for field galaxies. We investigate whether these
high BHAR/SFR ratios are driven by high BHAR, low SFR, or a different accretion
efficiency in radio galaxies. The data suggest that the high BHAR/SFR ratios
are primarily driven by boosted black hole accretion in spheroidal galaxies
compared to their disk counterparts. We propose that angular momentum of the
cool gas is the primary driver in suppressing BHAR in lower mass galaxies, with
massive galaxies accreting gas that has condensed out of the hot phase on
nearly radial trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate that the relationship
between specific BHAR and SFR has much less scatter over 6 orders of magnitude
in both parameters, due to competing dependence on morphology between the
M_BH--M_* and BHAR--SFR relations. In general, active galaxies selected by
typical techniques have sBHAR/sSFR ~ 10, while galactic nuclei with no clear

distribution of the Higgs boson when produced in association with a
top-anti-top quark pair for the Large Hadron Collider operating at 13 TeV. We
show that different choices for the threshold variable result in differences at
next-to-leading power, i.e. contributions that are down by one power of the
threshold variable. These contributions are noticeable numerically, although
their effect on the resummed observables lies within the scale uncertainty of
those observables. The average central results, obtained after combining
several central-scale choices, agree remarkably well for different choices of
the threshold variable. However, different threshold choices do effect the
resulting scale uncertainty. To compute our results, we introduce a novel
numerical method that we call the deformation method, which aids the
stabilization of the inverse Mellin transform in cases where the analytical
Mellin transform of the partonic cross section is unknown. We show that this
method leads to a factor of 10 less function evaluations, while gaining a
factor of 4-5 in numerical precision when compared to the standard method.

With
improved proper motions provided by Gaia EDR3, we show that the orbits of 23
Galactic stellar streams are highly clustered in orbital phase space. Based on
their energies and angular momenta, most streams in our sample can plausibly be
associated with a specific (disrupted) dwarf galaxy host that brought them into
the Milky Way. For eight streams we also identify likely globular cluster
progenitors (four of these associations are reported here for the first time).
Some of these stream progenitors are surprisingly far apart, displaced from
their tidal debris by a few to tens of degrees. We identify stellar streams
that appear spatially distinct, but whose similar orbits indicate they likely
originate from the same progenitor. If confirmed as physical discontinuities,
they will provide strong constraints on the mass-loss from the progenitor. The
nearly universal ex-situ origin of existing stellar streams makes them valuable
tracers of galaxy mergers and dynamical friction within the Galactic halo.
Their phase-space clustering can be leveraged to construct a precise global map
of dark matter in the Milky Way, while their internal structure may hold clues
to the small-scale structure of dark matter in their original host galaxies.

galaxies based on recent data showing a tight relationship between dark matter
halo virial masses and GC numbers. While a simple base model forming GCs in
low-mass haloes reproduces this relation, we show that a second formation
pathway for GCs is needed to account for observed younger GC populations. We
confirm previous works that reported the observed linear correlation as being a
consequence of hierarchical merging and its insensitivity to the exact GC
formation processes at higher virial masses, even for a dual formation
scenario. We find that the scatter of the linear relation is strongly
correlated with the relative amount of smooth accretion: the more dark matter
is smoothly accreted, the fewer GCs a halo has compared to other haloes of the
same mass. This scatter is smaller than that introduced by halo mass
measurements, indicating that the number of GCs in a galaxy is a good tracer
for its dark matter mass. Smooth accretion is also the reason for a lower
average dark matter mass per GC in low-mass haloes. Finally, we successfully
reproduce the observed general trend of GCs being old and the tendency of more
massive haloes hosting older GC systems. Including the second GC formation
mechanism through gas-rich mergers leads to a more realistic variety of GC age
distributions and also introduces an age inversion in the halo virial mass
range $\log M_\mathrm{vir}/\mathrm{M}_\odot = 11{-}13$.

These dwarfs were discovered as part of our Subaru+Hyper Suprime-Cam MADCASH

a previously unknown dwarf galaxy near NGC 4214 (D~3.0 Mpc). Our HST data reach
>3.5 mag below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) of each dwarf, allowing
us to derive their structural parameters and assess their stellar populations.
We measure TRGB distances ($D=3.41^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ Mpc for MADCASH-1, and
$D=3.00^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$ Mpc for MADCASH-2), and confirm their associations
with their host galaxies. MADCASH-1 is a predominantly old, metal-poor stellar
system (age ~13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), similar to many Local Group dwarfs.
Modelling of MADCASH-2's CMD suggests that it contains mostly ancient,
metal-poor stars (age ~13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), but that ~10% of its stellar
mass was formed 1.1--1.5 Gyr ago, and ~1% was formed 400--500 Myr ago. Given
its recent star formation, we search MADCASH-2 for neutral hydrogen using the
Green Bank Telescope, but find no emission and estimate an upper limit on the
HI mass of $<4.8\times10^4 M_{\odot}$. These are the faintest dwarf satellites
known around host galaxies of LMC mass outside the Local Group
($M_{V,\text{MADCASH-1}}=-7.81\pm0.18$, $M_{V,\text{MADCASH-2}}=-9.15\pm0.12$),
and one of them shows signs of recent environmental quenching by its host. Once
the MADCASH survey for faint dwarf satellites is complete, our census will
enable us to test CDM predictions for hierarchical structure formation, and
discover the physical mechanisms by which low-mass hosts influence the
evolution of their satellites.

measure an effective shape noise of $\sigma_\gamma = 0.024 \pm 0.007$,

wide range of possible extra sectors. It is common to posit that such moduli

the visible sector generically puts the visible sector in a mixed state, with
coupling constants drawn from a quantum statistical ensemble. An observable
consequence of this entanglement between visible and extra sectors is that the
reported values of couplings will appear to have an irreducible variance.
Including this variance in fits to experimental data gives an important

nucleus (AGN) previously selected as a double AGN candidate on the basis of the
double-peaked [OIII] emission line. The NIR adaptive optics-assisted
observations were obtained at the Large Binocular Telescope with the LUCI+FLAO

characterized by a double-peaked profile, mainly produced by AGN
photoionization. Our spectroscopical analysis disfavors the hypothesis that the
double-peaked emission lines in the source are the signatures of outflow
kinematics, leaving open the possibility that we are detecting either the
rotation of a single narrow-line region or the presence of two SMBHs orbiting
around a common central potential. The latter scenario is further supported by
the high-spatial resolution NIR imaging: after subtracting the dominant
contribution of the stellar bulge component in the host galaxy, we detect two
faint nuclear sources at r<0.5 kpc projected separation. Interestingly, the two
sources have a position angle consistent with that defined by the two regions
where the [OIII] double peaks most likely originate. Aside from the discovery
of a promising sub-kiloparsec scale dual AGN, our analysis shows the importance

the dark-matter halo is below a golden mass of $M_{\rm v} \sim 10^{12} \rm
M_\odot$, and rapid above it. The early suppression is primarily due to gas
removal by supernova (SN) feedback in the shallow potential well, predicting
that BHs of $\sim 10^5 \rm M_\odot$ tend to lie below the linear relation with
bulge mass. Rapid BH growth is allowed when the halo is massive enough to lock
in the SN ejecta by its deep potential well and its heated circum-galactic
medium (CGM). The onset of BH growth between these two zones is triggered by a
wet-compaction event, caused, e.g., by mergers or counter-rotating streams. It
brings gas that lost angular momentum into the inner-$1\rm kpc$ ""blue nugget""
and causes major transitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and
compositional properties, including the onset of star-formation quenching. The
compaction events are confined to the golden mass by the same mechanisms of SN
feedback and hot CGM. The onset of BH growth is associated with its sinkage to
the center due to the compaction-driven deepening of the potential well and the
associated dynamical friction. The galaxy golden mass is thus imprinted as a
threshold for rapid BH growth, allowing the AGN feedback to keep the CGM hot
and maintain long-term quenching. AGN feedback is not causing the onset of
quenching; they are both caused by a compaction event when the mass is between
the SN and hot-CGM zones.

approaching the atomic scale, enabling quantum defects-by-design. These defects
are frequently described as artificial atoms and are emerging
optically-addressable spin qubits. However, interactions and coupling of such
artificial atoms with each other, in the presence of the lattice, is remarkably
underexplored. Here we present the formation of artificial molecules in solids,
introducing a new degree of freedom in control of quantum optoelectronic
materials. Specifically, in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride as our model
system, we observe configuration- and distance-dependent dissociation curves
and hybridization of defect orbitals within the bandgap into bonding and
antibonding orbitals, with splitting energies ranging from $\sim$ 10 meV to
nearly 1 eV. We calculate the energetics of $cis$ and $trans$ out-of-plane
defect pairs CH$_\textrm{B}$-CH$_\textrm{B}$ against an in-plane defect pair
C$_\textrm{B}$-C$_\textrm{B}$ and find that in-plane defect pair interacts more
strongly than out-of-plane pairs. We demonstrate an application of this
chemical degree of freedom by varying the distance between C$_\textrm{B}$ and
V$_\textrm{N}$ of C$_\textrm{B}$V$_\textrm{N}$ and observe changes in the
predicted peak absorption wavelength from the visible to the near-infrared
spectral band. We envision leveraging this chemical degree of freedom of defect
complexes to precisely control and tune defect properties towards engineering
robust quantum memories and quantum emitters for quantum information science.

reionization. However, in order to expedite the large volume simulations
relevant for 21-cm observations, many models of galaxies within reionization
codes are entirely subgrid and/or rely on halo abundances only. In this work,
we explore the extent to which resolving and modeling individual galaxy
formation histories affects predictions both for the galaxy populations
detectable by upcoming surveys and the signatures of reionization accessible to
upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that a common approach, in which galaxy
luminosity is assumed to be a function of halo mass only, is biased with
respect to models in which galaxy properties are evolved through time via
semi-analytic modeling and thus reflective of the diversity of assembly
histories that naturally arise in $N$-body simulations. The diversity of galaxy
formation histories also results in scenarios in which the brightest galaxies
do \textit{not} always reside in the centers of large ionized regions, as there
are often relatively low-mass halos undergoing dramatic, but short-term,
growth. This has clear implications for attempts to detect or validate the
21-cm background via cross correlation. Finally, we show that a hybrid approach
-- in which only halos hosting galaxies bright enough to be detected in surveys
are modeled in detail, with the rest modeled as an unresolved field of halos
with abundance related to large-scale overdensity -- is a viable way to
generate large-volume `simulations` well-suited to wide-area surveys and

$0.18^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ planets per single star, and $0.12\pm0.04$ planets per

binaries with separation $a_B<100$ AU. The similarity in the planet occurrence
rate around single stars and wide primaries implies that wide binary systems
should host more planets than single star systems, since they have more
potential host stars. We estimated a system-wide planet occurrence rate of 0.3
planets per wide binary system for binaries with separations $a_B > 100$ AU.
Finally, we found evidence that giant planets in binary systems have a
different semi-major axis distribution than their counterparts in single star

However, after gravity is turned on, as long as Equivalence Principle holds,
one finds that global monopoles have a negative mass, $M \sim -
\eta/\sqrt{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the field theory coupling. This could
catalyze an instability in the space of a global monopole, by the production of
additional global monopole-antimonopole pairs along with normal particles,
leading to energy production {\it ab nihilo}, if the pair energy is dominated
by their negative rest masses. In a theory with unbroken local Poincar\'e

description of rotating astrophysical objects like black holes, stars, etc. In
gravitational theories that venture beyond the usual Riemannian geometry by
allowing independent connection components, the notion of symmetry concerns,
not just the metric, but also the connection. As discovered recently, in
teleparallel geometries, axial symmetry can be realised in two branches, while
only one of these has a continuous spherically symmetric limit. In the current
paper, we consider a very generic $f(T,B,\phi,X)$ family of teleparallel
gravities, whose action depends on the torsion scalar $T$ and the boundary term
$B$, as well as a scalar field $\phi$ with its kinetic term $X$. As the field
equations can be decomposed into symmetric and antisymmetric (spin connection)
parts, we thoroughly analyse the antisymmetric equations and look for solutions
of axial spacetimes which could be used as ans\""atze to tackle the symmetric
part of the field equations. In particular, we find solutions corresponding to
a generalisation of the Taub-NUT metric, and the slowly rotating Kerr
spacetime. Since this work also concerns a wider issue of how to determine the
spin connection in teleparallel gravity, we also show that the method of
""turning off gravity"" proposed in the literature, does not always produce a
solution to the antisymmetric equations.

scenario whereby the WHIM has been heated up via accretion shocks and galactic
outflows, and is concentrated towards the filaments of the Cosmic Web.
  Aims. Our aim is to improve the observational search of the poorly detected
hot WHIM.
  Methods. We detect the filamentary structure within the EAGLE simulation by
applying the Bisous formalism to the galaxy distribution. In addition, we use
the MMF/NEXUS+ classification of the large scale environment of the dark matter
component in EAGLE. We then study the spatio-thermal distribution of the hot
baryons within the extracted filaments.
  Results. While the filaments occupy only 5% of the full simulation volume,
the diffuse hot intergalactic medium in filaments amounts to 23% $-$ 25% of the
total baryon budget, or 79% $-$ 87% of all the hot WHIM. The most optimal
filament sample, with a missing baryon mass fraction of 82%, is obtained by
selecting Bisous filaments with a high galaxy luminosity density. For these
filaments we derived analytic formulae for the radial gas density and
temperature profiles, consistent with recent Planck SZ and CMB lensing
observations within the central $r$~ 1 Mpc.
  Conclusions. Results from EAGLE suggest that the missing baryons are strongly
concentrated towards the filament axes. Since the filament finding methods used
here are applicable to galaxy surveys, a large fraction of the missing baryons
can be localised by focusing the observational efforts on the central 1 Mpc
regions of the filaments. Moreover, focusing on high galaxy luminosity density
regions will optimise the observational signal.

determined from quasars within 20 degrees from M31 and a correction from
systemic biases. Accounting for the Solar reflex motion we deduce a relative
velocity between Andromeda and the Milky way (in a non-rotating frame at the
current location of the Sun) of 42.2 +/- 39.3 km/s along right ascension (40.0

transverse velocity of V_trans = 82.4 +/- 31.2 km/s. These values are
consistent with (but more accurate than) earlier Hubble Space Telescope

note a surprisingly large difference in the derived proper motion between the

theory. We show that the observable dependence of anomalous dimensions in SCETI

performed by solving a two-dimensional system of RGEs in the collinear and soft

of the rapidity renormalization group. We study the properties of SCETI with

and the underlying physical parameters of the system. We test the possibility
of the formation of the crescent-shaped asymmetry in the HD 163296 disk through
planet-disk interaction. The goal is to obtain constraints on planet masses and
eccentricities and disk viscosities. Two dimensional, multi-fluid,
hydrodynamical simulations are performed with the FARGO3D code including three
embedded planets. Dust is described with the pressureless fluid approach and is
distributed over eight size bins. Resulting grids are post-processed with the
radiative transfer code RADMC-3D and the CASA software to model synthetic
observations. We find that the crescent-shaped asymmetry can be qualitatively
modeled with a Jupiter mass planet at a radial distance of 48 au. Dust is
trapped preferably in the trailing Lagrange point L5 with a mass of 10 to 15
earth masses. Increased values of eccentricity of the innermost Jupiter mass
planet damages the stability of the crescent-shaped feature and does not
reproduce the observed radial proximity to the first prominent ring in the
system. Generally, a low level of viscosity ($\alpha \leq 2\cdot10^{-3}$) is
necessary to allow the existence of such a feature. Including dust feedback the
leading point L4 can dominantly capture dust for dust grains with an initial
Stokes number $\leq 3.6\cdot 10^{-2}$. The observational results suggest a
negligible effect of dust feedback since only one such feature has been

injection. This new protocol also suggests performing UE handover from
terrestrial to UxNB as a group. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is
no authentication solution between BSs according to LTE and 5G standards. The
proposed scheme provides a solution for the authentication of UxNB by the
terrestrial BS. Additionally, a credential sharing phase for each UE in
handover is not required in the proposed method. The absence of a credential
sharing step saves resources by reducing the number of communications between
BSs. Moreover, many UE handover operations are completed in concise time within
the proposed group handover method.

  Functions and Queueing Delay",,,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Network Utility Maximization (NUM) studies the problems of allocating traffic
rates to network users in order to maximize the users' total utility subject to
network resource constraints. In this paper, we propose a new NUM framework,
Learning-NUM, where the users' utility functions are unknown apriori and the
utility function values of the traffic rates can be observed only after the
corresponding traffic is delivered to the destination, which means that the
utility feedback experiences \textit{queueing delay}.
  The goal is to design a policy that gradually learns the utility functions
and makes rate allocation and network scheduling/routing decisions so as to
maximize the total utility obtained over a finite time horizon $T$. In addition
to unknown utility functions and stochastic constraints, a central challenge of
our problem lies in the queueing delay of the observations, which may be
unbounded and depends on the decisions of the policy.
  We first show that the expected total utility obtained by the best dynamic
policy is upper bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem.
Without the presence of feedback delay, we design an algorithm based on the
ideas of gradient estimation and Max-Weight scheduling. To handle the feedback
delay, we embed the algorithm in a parallel-instance paradigm to form a policy
that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$-regret, i.e., the difference between the
expected utility obtained by the best dynamic policy and our policy is in
$\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. Finally, to demonstrate the practical applicability of
the Learning-NUM framework, we apply it to three application scenarios
including database query, job scheduling and video streaming. We further
conduct simulations on the job scheduling application to evaluate the empirical
performance of our policy.

LongRunMIP GCMs that the hemispherically symmetric component of
global-mean-normalized, zonal-mean warming ($T^*_\mathrm{sym}$) under
4\(\times\)CO$_2$ changes weakly or becomes moderately more polar-amplified
from the first decade to near-equilibrium. Conversely, the antisymmetric
warming component ($T^*_\mathrm{asym}$) weakens with time in all models,
moderately in some including FAMOUS but effectively vanishing in others
including CESM1. We explore mechanisms underlying the robust $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$
behavior with a diffusive moist energy balance model (MEBM), which given
radiative feedback parameter ($\lambda$) and ocean heat uptake ($\mathcal{O}$)
fields diagnosed from CESM1 adequately reproduces the CESM1 $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$
and $T^*_\mathrm{asym}$ fields. In further MEBM simulations perturbing
$\lambda$ and $\mathcal{O}$, $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ is sensitive to their symmetric
components only, and more to that of $\lambda$. A three-box, two-timescale
model fitted to FAMOUS and CESM1 reveals a curiously short Antarctic
fast-response timescale in FAMOUS. In additional CESM1 simulations spanning a
broader range of forcings, $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ changes modestly across
2-16\(\times\)CO$_2$, and $T^*_\mathrm{sym}$ in a Pliocene-like simulation is
more polar-amplified but likewise approximately time-invariant. Determining the
real-world relevance of these behaviors -- which imply that a surprising amount
of information about near-equilibrium polar amplification emerges within
decades -- merits further study.

regulation, a new genetic programming (GP) technique that allows programs to
dynamically adjust which code modules to express. Tags are evolvable labels
that provide a flexible mechanism for referencing code modules. Tag-based
genetic regulation extends existing tag-based naming schemes to allow programs
to ""promote"" and ""repress"" code modules in order to alter expression patterns.
This extension allows evolution to structure a program as a gene regulatory
network where modules are regulated based on instruction executions. We
demonstrate the functionality of tag-based regulation on a range of program
synthesis problems. We find that tag-based regulation improves problem-solving
performance on context-dependent problems; that is, problems where programs
must adjust how they respond to current inputs based on prior inputs. Indeed,
the system could not evolve solutions to some context-dependent problems until
regulation was added. Our implementation of tag-based genetic regulation is not
universally beneficial, however. We identify scenarios where the correct
response to a particular input never changes, rendering tag-based regulation an
unneeded functionality that can sometimes impede adaptive evolution. Tag-based
genetic regulation broadens our repertoire of techniques for evolving more
dynamic genetic programs and can easily be incorporated into existing
tag-enabled GP systems.

paper, we cast the registration task as a surface-to-surface translation
problem, and design a model to reliably capture the latent geometric
information directly from raw 3D face scans. We introduce Shape-My-Face (SMF),
a powerful encoder-decoder architecture based on an improved point cloud
encoder, a novel visual attention mechanism, graph convolutional decoders with
skip connections, and a specialized mouth model that we smoothly integrate with
the mesh convolutions. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art learning
algorithms for non-rigid registration of face scans, SMF only requires the raw
data to be rigidly aligned (with scaling) with a pre-defined face template.
Additionally, our model provides topologically-sound meshes with minimal
supervision, offers faster training time, has orders of magnitude fewer
trainable parameters, is more robust to noise, and can generalize to previously
unseen datasets. We extensively evaluate the quality of our registrations on
diverse data. We demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our model
with in-the-wild face scans across different modalities, sensor types, and
resolutions. Finally, we show that, by learning to register scans, SMF produces
a hybrid linear and non-linear morphable model. Manipulation of the latent
space of SMF allows for shape generation, and morphing applications such as
expression transfer in-the-wild. We train SMF on a dataset of human faces

(uBAM), an automatic deep learning algorithm for analysing behaviour by
discovering and magnifying deviations. A central aspect is unsupervised
learning of posture and behaviour representations to enable an objective
comparison of movement. Besides discovering and quantifying deviations in
behaviour, we also propose a generative model for visually magnifying subtle
behaviour differences directly in a video without requiring a detour via
keypoints or annotations. Essential for this magnification of deviations even
across different individuals is a disentangling of appearance and behaviour.
Evaluations on rodents and human patients with neurological diseases
demonstrate the wide applicability of our approach. Moreover, combining
optogenetic stimulation with our unsupervised behaviour analysis shows its
suitability as a non-invasive diagnostic tool correlating function to brain
plasticity.

applications of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A recent study of quantum
algorithms for early simulations of the Hubbard model [Kivlichan \textit{et
al.} Quantum 4 296 (2019)] found that the lowest resource costs were achieved
by split-operator Trotterization combined with the fast-fermionic Fourier
transform (FFFT) on an $L \times L$ lattice with length $L=2^k$. On lattices
with length $L \neq 2^k$, Givens rotations can be used instead of the FFFT but
lead to considerably higher resource costs. We present a new analytic approach
to bounding the simulation error due to Trotterization that provides much
tighter bounds for the split-operator FFFT method, leading to $16 \times$
improvement in error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce plaquette Trotterization
that works on any size lattice and apply our improved error bound analysis to
show competitive resource costs. We consider a phase estimation task and show
plaquette Trotterization reduces the number of non-Clifford gates by a factor
$5.5\times$ to $9 \times$ (depending on the parameter regime) over the best
previous estimates for $8 \times 8$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices and a much
larger factor for other lattice sizes not of the form $L=2^k$. In conclusion,
we find there is a potentially useful application for fault-tolerant quantum
computers using around one million Toffoli gates.

zonal problem is intimately linked to the concept of frozen orbits and proper
eccentricity, we provide frozen-orbit initial conditions in osculating element

minimizing space occupancy in a realistic model including tesseral harmonics,
third-body perturbations, solar radiation pressure, and drag. The corresponding

the challenging Semantic Scene Completion task - which entails the inference of
dense 3D structure and associated semantic labels from ""sparse"" representations

dense point clouds or dense depth maps often fused with semantic segmentation
maps from RGB images. However, the performance of these systems drop
drastically when applied to large outdoor scenes characterized by dynamic and
exponentially sparser conditions. Likewise, processing of the entire sparse
volume becomes infeasible due to memory limitations and workarounds introduce
computational inefficiency as practitioners are forced to divide the overall
volume into multiple equal segments and infer on each individually, rendering
real-time performance impossible. In this work, we formulate a method that
subsumes the sparsity of large-scale environments and present S3CNet, a sparse

an L2 regularization variant with rising penalty factors and show it can bring
significant accuracy gains compared with its one-shot counterpart, even when

approach to exploit the Hessian information for more accurate pruning without

treatment effects has been proposed as a way to improve asymptotic efficiency.
However, only linear regression has been proven to form an estimate of the
average treatment effect that is asymptotically no less efficient than the
treated-minus-control difference in means regardless of the true data
generating process. Randomized treatment assignment provides this ""do-no-harm""
property, with neither truth of a linear model nor a generative model for the
outcomes being required. We present a general calibration method which confers
the same no-harm property onto estimators leveraging a broad class of nonlinear
models. This recovers the usual regression-adjusted estimator when ordinary
least squares is used, and further provides non-inferior treatment effect
estimators using methods such as logistic and Poisson regression. The resulting
estimators are non-inferior to both the difference in means estimator and to
treatment effect estimators that have not undergone calibration. We show that
our estimator is asymptotically equivalent to an inverse probability weighted
estimator using a logit link with predicted potential outcomes as covariates.
In a simulation study, we demonstrate that common nonlinear estimators without
our calibration procedure may perform markedly worse than both the calibrated
estimator and the unadjusted difference in means.

strength set by the temperature difference $\Delta = T_b - T_t$ (the Rayleigh

compared to standard Rayleigh-B\'enard convection is the density inversion
parameter $\theta_m \equiv (T_m - T_t ) / \Delta$. The crucial response
parameters are the relative mean mid-height temperature $\theta_c$ and the
overall heat transfer (i.e., the Nusselt number $Nu$). We theoretically derive
the universal (i.e., $Ra$-independent) dependence $\theta_c (\theta_m)
=(1+\theta_m^2)/2$, which holds for $\theta_m$ below a $Ra$-dependent critical
value, beyond which $\theta_c (\theta_m)$ sharply decreases and drops down to
$\theta_c=1/2$ at $\theta_m=\theta_{m,c}$. Our direct numerical simulations
with $Ra$ up to $10^{10}$ are consistent with these results. The critical
density inversion parameter $\theta_{m,c}$ can be precisely predicted by a
linear stability analysis. The heat flux $Nu(\theta_m)$ monotonically decreases
with increasing $\theta_m$ and we can theoretically derive a universal relation
for the relative heat flux $Nu(\theta_m)/Nu(0)$. Finally, we numerically
identify and discuss rare transitions between different turbulent flow states

better features. Specifically, our method should handle unbalanced and
unlabeled data better than existing contrastive learning methods, because the
randomly chosen negative set might include many samples that are semantically
similar to the query image. In this case, our method labels them as highly
similar while standard contrastive methods label them as negative pairs. Our

and environments. We present MSL-RAPTOR, a two-stage algorithm for tracking a
rigid body with a monocular camera. The image is first processed by an
efficient neural network-based front-end to detect new objects and track 2D
bounding boxes between frames. The class label and bounding box is passed to
the back-end that updates the object's pose using an unscented Kalman filter
(UKF). The measurement posterior is fed back to the 2D tracker to improve
robustness. The object's class is identified so a class-specific UKF can be
used if custom dynamics and constraints are known. Adapting to track the pose
of new classes only requires providing a trained 2D object detector or labeled
2D bounding box data, as well as the approximate size of the objects. The
performance of MSL-RAPTOR is first verified on the NOCS-REAL275 dataset,
achieving results comparable to RGB-D approaches despite not using depth
measurements. When tracking a flying drone from onboard another drone, it
outperforms the fastest comparable method in speed by a factor of 3, while
giving lower translation and rotation median errors by 66% and 23%

drag on the particle itself. Besides, it affects the motion of other particles,
inducing non-equilibrium correlations between them. We study the induced
non-equilibrium correlations and forces, acting on constituent particles of the
bunch or cluster of impurities exposed to a gas stream. Such induced
correlations exhibit many striking features that are determined by the
properties of particle bunch collective scattering in a medium. The
characteristics of collective scattering are determined by the structure of the
bunch itself, that is associated with scattering on inhomogeneities, i.e., on
fluctuations of the number of particles (scatterers) in a correlation volume.
This is well-known, e.g., in optics and have been shown for gas scattering in
our recent work [1]. In particular, a random cluster of impurities experiences
much stronger Stokes drag than a regular one. Inhomogeneity of the cluster also
determines the presence of giant local fluctuations of the scattered field
inside a cluster, that was shown for gas stream scattering in [1]. This, in
turn, should lead to strong local fluctuations of induced gradient forces
inside the cluster, which can determine its stability. Moreover, the
description of a cluster in terms of effective parameters (penetration index,
effective diffusion coefficient, etc.) brakes down due to the presence of such
fluctuations.

line drift and negative peaks (due to improper phasing) are among some of these
variations. Furthermore, some instrument dependent alterations, such as
incorrect shimming, are also embedded in the recorded spectrum. The
unpredictable nature of these alterations of the signal has rendered the
automated and instrument independent computer analysis of these spectra
unreliable. In this paper, a novel method of extracting the information content
of a signal (in this paper, frequency domain 1H-NMR spectrum), called the
frequency-information transformation (FIT), is presented and compared to a
previously used method (SPUTNIK). FIT can successfully extract the relevant
information to a pattern matching task present in a signal, while discarding
the remainder of a signal by transforming a Fourier transformed signal into an
information spectrum (IS). This technique exhibits the ability of decreasing
the inter-class correlation coefficients while increasing the intra-class
correlation coefficients. Different spectra of the same molecule, in other
words, will resemble more to each other while the spectra of different
molecules will look more different from each other. This feature allows easier

given a knowledge base $KB_1$ entailing a formula $\varphi$ and a second
knowledge base $KB_2$ not entailing it, model reconciliation seeks an
explanation, in the form of a cardinality-minimal subset of $KB_1$, whose
integration into $KB_2$ makes the entailment possible. Our approach, based on
ideas originating in the context of analysis of inconsistencies, exploits the
existing hitting set duality between minimal correction sets (MCSes) and
minimal unsatisfiable sets (MUSes) in order to identify an appropriate
explanation. However, differently from those works targeting inconsistent
formulas, which assume a single knowledge base, MCSes and MUSes are computed
over two distinct knowledge bases. We conclude our paper with an empirical
evaluation of the newly introduced approach on planning instances, where we
show how it outperforms an existing state-of-the-art solver, and generic
non-planning instances from recent SAT competitions, for which no other solver
exists.

detector array (TIARA for Time-of-flight Imaging ARrAy) for the online

between a beam monitor placed upstream and the Prompt-Gamma (PG) detector, our
goal is to reconstruct the PG vertex distribution to detect a possible
deviation of proton beam delivery. In this paper, two non-iterative
reconstruction strategies are proposed. The first is based on the resolution of
an analytical formula describing the PG vertex distribution in 3D. Here, it was
resolved under a one-dimensional approximation in order to measure a potential
proton range shift along the beam direction. The second is based on the
calculation of the Centre-Of-Gravity (COG) of the TIARA pixel detectors counts
and also provides 3D information on a possible beam displacement. The PG vertex
reconstruction was evaluated in two different scenarios. A coincidence time
resolution of 100 ps (rms) can be attained in single proton regime (operating a
reduction of the beam current) and using an external beam monitor to provide a
start trigger for the TOF measurement. Under these conditions, MC simulations
have shown that a millimetric proton range shift sensitivity can be achieved at
2$\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons. This level of accuracy would allow to
act in real-time if the treatment does not conform to treatment plan. A worst
case scenario of a 1 ns (rms) TOF resolution was also considered to demonstrate
that a degraded timing information can be compensated by increasing the
acquisition statistics: in this case, a 2 mm range shift would be detectable at
2$\sigma$ with 10$^{9}$ incident protons. The COG method has shown excellent
capabilities of detecting lateral beam displacements: a 2 mm sensitivity was
found at 2$\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons.

supervised disentanglement metrics and thoroughly analyze them. We propose a
new taxonomy in which all metrics fall into one of three families:
intervention-based, predictor-based and information-based. We conduct extensive

learning in medical image analysis. Deep convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have
shown great promise in achieving clinically applicable image segmentation

either 2D or 3D convolutions on input images, with pros and cons associated
with each method: 2D convolution is fast, less memory-intensive but inadequate
for extracting 3D contextual information from volumetric images, while the
opposite is true for 3D convolution. To fit a 3D CNN model on CT or MRI images
on commodity GPUs, one usually has to either downsample input images or use
cropped local regions as inputs, which limits the utility of 3D models for
multi-organ segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework for
combining 3D and 2D models, in which the segmentation is realized through
high-resolution 2D convolutions, but guided by spatial contextual information
extracted from a low-resolution 3D model. We implement a self-attention
mechanism to control which 3D features should be used to guide 2D segmentation.
Our model is light on memory usage but fully equipped to take 3D contextual

demonstrate that by taking advantage of both 2D and 3D models, our method is
consistently outperforms existing 2D and 3D models in organ segmentation

reverse from northern winter to northern summer; spatial distributions of

(e.g., seasonally-reversing Hadley cells, polar stratospheric vortex formation,
equatorial stratospheric oscillations, and inter-hemispheric transport); and
upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols exhibited changes in optical

and redistributing it in the wild to fool the final user into installing the
repackaged app instead of the original one. In this way, an attacker can embed
malicious payload into a legitimate app for different aims, such as access to
premium features, redirect revenue, or access to user's private data. In the
Android ecosystem, apps are available on public stores, and the only
requirement for an app to execute properly is to be digitally signed. Due to
this, the repackaging threat is widely spread. Anti-repackaging techniques aim
to make harder the repackaging process for an attack adding logical controls -
called detection node - in the app at compile-time. Such controls check the app
integrity at runtime to detect tampering. If tampering is recognized, the
detection nodes lead the repackaged app to fail (e.g., throwing an exception).
From an attacker's standpoint, she must detect and bypass all controls to
repackage safely. In this work, we propose a novel anti-repackaging scheme -
called ARMAND - which aims to overcome the limitations of the current
protection schemes. We have implemented this scheme into a prototype - named
ARMANDroid - which leverages multiple protection patterns and relies on native
code. The evaluation phase of ARMANDroid on 30.000 real-world Android apps
showed that the scheme is robust against the common attack vectors and
efficient in terms of time and space overhead.

domain, it has incorporated 8 representative attacks, 14 state-of-the-art

transferability of attacks). We further explore improving the existing

triggers often suffice; (ii) training from scratch often outperforms perturbing
benign models to craft trojan models; (iii) optimizing triggers and trojan

for classification with respect to individual image inputs. In this work, we
propose a notion of global correctness for neural network perception models
performing regression with respect to a generative neural network with a
semantically meaningful latent space. That is, against an infinite set of
images produced by a generative model over an interval of its latent space, we
employ neural network verification to prove that the model will always produce
estimates within some error bound of the ground truth. Where the perception
model fails, we obtain semantically meaningful counter-examples which carry
information on concrete states of the system of interest that can be used
programmatically without human inspection of corresponding generated images.
Our approach, Generate and Verify, provides a new technique to gather insight
into the failure cases of neural network perception systems and provide
meaningful guarantees of correct behavior in safety critical applications.

switch magnetization collinear with the spin polarization in the absence of
external magnetic fields. However, an external magnetic field is required to
switch the magnetization along x and z-axes via SOT generated by y-spin

unconventional SOT in magnetron-sputtered thin film MnPd3. In addition to the
conventional in-plane anti-damping-like torque due to the y-spin polarization,
out-of-plane and in-plane anti-damping-like torques originating from z-spin and

spin torque efficiency corresponding to the y-spin polarization from MnPd3 thin

account three-body losses, atomic feeding and quantum fluctuations (up to a
novel high-density term). A variational approximation (VA) is used to study the
behavior of a Gaussian pulse in a static double-well potential. Direct
numerical solutions of the mGPE corroborate that the center of the pulse
exhibits an oscillatory behavior (as the VA predicts), and show a novel
phenomenon of fragmentation and regeneration (FR). It is shown that this FR
process is destroyed if we consider a potential with a time-dependent quadratic
term, but the FR survives if the time dependence is introduced in a cubic term.
Comparison between the VA and the numerical solution revealed an excellent
agreement when the oscillations of the pulse remain in one of the potential

revolution, but AI systems still struggle to extrapolate outside of their

domain of science, where scientists have been able to develop theories which
show remarkable ability to extrapolate and sometimes predict the existence of
phenomena which have never been observed before. According to David Deutsch,
this type of extrapolation, which he calls ""reach"", is due to scientific
theories being hard to vary. In this work we investigate Deutsch's hard-to-vary
principle and how it relates to more formalized principles in deep learning
such as the bias-variance trade-off and Occam's razor. We distinguish internal
variability, how much a model/theory can be varied internally while still
yielding the same predictions, with external variability, which is how much a
model must be varied to accurately predict new, out-of-distribution data. We
discuss how to measure internal variability using the size of the Rashomon set
and how to measure external variability using Kolmogorov complexity. We explore
what role hard-to-vary explanations play in intelligence by looking at the
human brain and distinguish two learning systems in the brain. The first system
operates similar to deep learning and likely underlies most of perception and
motor control while the second is a more creative system capable of generating
hard-to-vary explanations of the world. We argue that figuring out how
replicate this second system, which is capable of generating hard-to-vary
explanations, is a key challenge which needs to be solved in order to realize
artificial general intelligence. We make contact with the framework of

zero) values of the anisotropy constant. However, this explains little about
the dramatic drop in coercivity in FeNi alloys at a non-zero anisotropy value.
Here, we develop a theoretical and computational tool to investigate the
fundamental interplay between material constants that govern coercivity in bulk
magnetic alloys. The two distinguishing features of our coercivity tool are
that: (a) we introduce a large localized disturbance, such as a spike-like
magnetic domain, that provides a nucleation barrier for magnetization reversal;
and (b) we account for magneto-elastic energy -- however small -- in addition
to the anisotropy and magnetostatic energy terms. We apply this coercivity tool
to show that the interactions between local instabilities and material
constants, such as anisotropy and magnetostriction constants, are key factors
that govern magnetic coercivity in bulk alloys. Using our model, we show that
coercivity is minimum at the permalloy composition (Fe-21.5Ni-78.5) at which
the alloy's anisotropy constant is not zero. We systematically vary the values
of the anisotropy and magnetostriction constants, around the permalloy
composition, and identify new combinations of material constants at which
coercivity is small. More broadly, our coercivity tool provides a theoretical
framework to potentially discover novel magnetic materials with low coercivity.

large spectral bandwidths depending on the choice of materials and design
parameters. This effect has been known for decades, observed theoretically and
experimentally via one-dimensional and two-dimensional structures commonly
known as resonant gratings, metamaterials, and metasurfaces. The physical cause
of this extraordinary phenomenon is guided-mode resonance mediated by lateral
Bloch modes excited by evanescent diffraction orders in the subwavelength
regime. In recent years, hundreds of papers have declared Fabry-Perot or Mie
resonance to be basis of the perfect reflection possessed by periodic
metasurfaces. Treating a simple one-dimensional cylindrical-rod lattice, here
we show clearly and unambiguously that Mie resonance does not cause perfect
reflection. In fact, the spectral placement of the Bloch-mode-mediated
zero-order reflectance is primarily controlled by the lattice period by way of
its direct effect on the homogenized effective-medium refractive index of the
lattice. In general, perfect reflection appears away from Mie resonance.
However, when the lateral leaky-mode field profiles approach the
isolated-particle Mie field profiles, the resonance locus tends towards the Mie
resonance wavelength. The fact that the lattice fields remember the isolated
particle fields is referred here as Mie modal memory. On erasure of the Mie
memory by an index-matched sublayer, we show that perfect reflection survives
with the resonance locus approaching the homogenized effective-medium waveguide
locus. The results presented here will aid in clarifying the physical basis of
general resonant photonic lattices.

  Images","Accepted by IPMI2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local discriminative representation is needed in many medical image analysis
tasks such as identifying sub-types of lesion or segmenting detailed components
of anatomical structures. However, the commonly applied supervised
representation learning methods require a large amount of annotated data, and
unsupervised discriminative representation learning distinguishes different
images by learning a global feature, both of which are not suitable for
localized medical image analysis tasks. In order to avoid the limitations of
these two methods, we introduce local discrimination into unsupervised
representation learning in this work. The model contains two branches: one is
an embedding branch which learns an embedding function to disperse dissimilar
pixels over a low-dimensional hypersphere; and the other is a clustering branch
which learns a clustering function to classify similar pixels into the same
cluster. These two branches are trained simultaneously in a mutually beneficial
pattern, and the learnt local discriminative representations are able to well
measure the similarity of local image regions. These representations can be
transferred to enhance various downstream tasks. Meanwhile, they can also be
applied to cluster anatomical structures from unlabeled medical images under
the guidance of topological priors from simulation or other structures with
similar topological characteristics. The effectiveness and usefulness of the
proposed method are demonstrated by enhancing various downstream tasks and
clustering anatomical structures in retinal images and chest X-ray images.

deploying a multi-robot team in an environment and optimizing the sensing
quality of the overall environment. As real-world environments involve a
variety of sensory information, and individual robots are limited in their
available number of sensors, successful multi-robot sensor coverage requires
the deployment of robots in such a way that each individual team member's
sensing quality is maximized. Additionally, because individual robots have
varying complements of sensors and both robots and sensors can fail, robots
must be able to adapt and adjust how they value each sensing capability in
order to obtain the most complete view of the environment, even through changes
in team composition. We introduce a novel formulation for sensor coverage by
multi-robot teams with heterogeneous sensing capabilities that maximizes each
robot's sensing quality, balancing the varying sensing capabilities of
individual robots based on the overall team composition. We propose a solution
based on regularized optimization that uses sparsity-inducing terms to ensure a
robot team focuses on all possible event types, and which we show is proven to
converge to the optimal solution. Through extensive simulation, we show that

London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home

significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth

electronic nematic phase transition, and in gauge theories for a U(1) spin
liquid. It leads to a short fermion life-time, violating Landau's criterion for
a Fermi liquid. In spite of this, transport can be described by a Boltzmann
equation. We include momentum relaxation by umklapp scattering, supplemented by
weak impurity scattering. We find that above a very low temperature which
scales with $\Delta_q^3$, where $\Delta_q$ is the minimum umklapp scattering
vector, the resistivity is linear in $T$ with a coefficient which is
independent of the amount of disorder. We compare the relaxation time
approximation with an exact numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation.
Surprisingly we find that unlike the resistivity, the Hall Coefficient strongly
deviates from the relaxation time approximation and shows a strong reduction
with increasing temperature. We comment on possible comparisons with

spectrum from microwaves through ultraviolet through hard x-rays that are
either seeded or start from noise. FELs can produce a variety of different
optical polarizations of the output radiation ranging from linear through
elliptic to circular polarization depending upon the characteristics of the
undulators used. For example, x-ray FELs use long undulator lines composed of a
series of relatively short undulators. Most such FELs use linearly polarized
undulators due to the ease of manufacture and tuning; hence the optical output
is linearly polarized. However, elliptic or circular polarizations are possible
by varying the orientation of the undulators along the line. Alternately,
APPLE-II or Delta undulator designs allow for producing undulating magnetic
fields with arbitrary polarizations. Here, we present a three-dimensional,
time-dependent formulation that self-consistently models two independent
optical polarizations and, therefore, completely treats any given sequence or
combination of undulator, undulator imperfections, and undulator degradation
There are two principal characteristics of the formulation that underpin this
capability. In the first place, the particle trajectories are integrated by
means of the full Lorentz force equations using three-dimensional analytic
models of the undulators fields. This permits an accurate model of the
interaction of the electrons with a large variety of undulator fields and
orientations. In the second place, the formulation allows the electrons to
couple simultaneously to two independent polarizations of the electromagnetic
wave and, therefore, allows the optical polarization to evolve
self-consistently along the undulator line. After first describing the
numerical model, we proceed to give some examples using different undulator
configurations that are of interest.

ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML
approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and
performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at
identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures.
Method: We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and

the integration of data-driven and behaviour-driven approaches should be
explored; (ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size
evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental ML model training should be incorporated
in countermeasures; (iv) resilience to adversarial learning should be

study assumes that multiple fast-charging stations are managed by a single
entity and that the demand for these stations are interrelated. To manage the
system of stations, the study proposes and tests dynamic demand-responsive
price adjustment (DDRPA) schemes based on station queue lengths. The study
applies the modeling framework to a system of EV fast-charging stations in
Southern California. The results indicate that DDRPA strategies are an
effective mechanism to balance charging demand across fast-charging stations.
Specifically, compared to the no DDRPA scheme case, the quadratic DDRPA scheme
reduces average wait time by 26%, increases charging station revenue (and user
costs) by 5.8%, while, most importantly, increasing social welfare by 2.7% in
the base scenario. Moreover, the study also illustrates that the modeling
framework can evaluate the allocation of EV fast-charging station capacity, to
identify stations that require additional chargers and areas that would benefit
from additional fast-charging stations.

important area of research due to the increasing EV penetration in today's
transportation systems. Under appropriate management of EV charging and
discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a
considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability
and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy
storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under
time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an
EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling
of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model
is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging
stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the
grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and
discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability
of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours
when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and
potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price
periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian
relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search
heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible
solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature
are provided. The proposed heuristic is also evaluated on a case study of an EV
fleet providing grocery delivery at the region of Kitchener-Waterloo in

efficient spintronic devices. In systems comprising magnetic insulators and

systems with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). Here, we
quantitatively study the SOT efficiency and iDMI in a series of gadolinium
gallium garnet (GGG) / thulium iron garnet (TmIG) / platinum (Pt)
heterostructures with varying TmIG and Pt thicknesses. We find that the
non-monotonic SOT efficiency as a function of the magnetic layer thickness is
not consistent with the 1/thickness dependence expected from a simple
interfacial SOT mechanism. Moreover, considering the insulating nature of TmIG,
our results cannot be explained by the SOT mechanism established for metallic
magnets where the transverse charge spin current can inject and dephase in the
magnetic layers. Rather we can explain this non-monotonic behavior by a model
based on the interfacial spin mixing conductance that is affected by the
thickness-dependent exchange splitting energy by determining the phase
difference of the reflected spin-up and spin-down electrons at the TmIG / Pt
interface. By studying the Pt thickness dependence, we find that the effective
DMI for GGG / TmIG / Pt does not depend on the Pt thickness, which indicates
that the GGG / TmIG interface is the source of the iDMI in this system. Our
work demonstrates that SOT and DMI can originate from two different interfaces,
which enables independent optimization of DMI and SOT for advanced chiral
spintronics with low damping magnetic insulators.

However, to obtain high-rate and stable Fe-N-C remains challenging. A novel and
facile approach to fabricate Fe-N-C catalyst (PC-Fe-50) with outstanding ORR

build privacy preserving DNN models from either algorithmic perspective or

of cryptographic techniques, i.e., secret sharing and homomorphic encryption,
for the isolated data holders to conduct private data related computations
privately and cooperatively. Furthermore, we implement SPNN in a decentralized

for the propagation of gravitational fields which may originate from a high
energy source. Motivated by loop quantum gravity, we propose the polymer
quantization scheme to derive the effective propagation of such waves on a
classical Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. To overcome the
challenge of polymer quantizing a time-dependent Hamiltonian, we rewrite such a
Hamiltonian in a time-independent manner in the extended phase space,
polymerize it, and then transform it back to the usual phase space. In this way
we obtain a time-dependent polymer Hamiltonian for the gravitational waves. We
then derive the effective equations of motion and show that (i) the form of the
waves is modified, (ii) the speed of the waves depends on their frequencies,
and (iii) quantum effects become more apparent as waves traverse longer
distances.

computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Global Shape-aware
Network (SGSNet) considering both feature similarity and proximity for

way is taken to aggregate global context. In the first level, each position in
the whole feature map only aggregates contextual information in vertical and
horizontal directions according to both similarity and proximity. And then the
result is input into the second level to do the same operations. By this
hierarchical way, each central position gains supports from all other
positions, and the combination of similarity and proximity makes each position
gain supports mostly from the same semantic object. Moreover, we also propose a
linear time algorithm for the aggregation of contextual information, where each
of rows and columns in the feature map is treated as a binary tree to reduce
similarity computation cost. Experiments on semantic segmentation and image
retrieval show that adding SGSNet to existing networks gains solid improvements

design an image generation module. Image content and style are disentangled and
embedded in a clustering-friendly space to utilize their distributions. New
images are synthesized by sampling and cross-combining contents and styles.
Second, we devise an effective data selection policy for judiciously sampling
the generated images: (1) to make the generated training set better cover the

are covered more; (2) to make the training process more effective, we identify
and oversample the images of ""hard cases"" in the data for which annotated

Indeed, not every member of a population may own a cell phone or have a DCT app

(w.r.t. the training one). Designing a general OoD generalization framework to
a wide range of applications is challenging, mainly due to possible correlation
shift and diversity shift in the real world. Most of the previous approaches
can only solve one specific distribution shift, such as shift across domains or
the extrapolation of correlation. To address that, we propose DecAug, a novel
decomposed feature representation and semantic augmentation approach for OoD
generalization. DecAug disentangles the category-related and context-related
features. Category-related features contain causal information of the target
object, while context-related features describe the attributes, styles,
backgrounds, or scenes, causing distribution shifts between training and test
data. The decomposition is achieved by orthogonalizing the two gradients
(w.r.t. intermediate features) of losses for predicting category and context
labels. Furthermore, we perform gradient-based augmentation on context-related

results show that DecAug outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various

transformation via data denoising and reconstruction (denoted as $F+$ inverse
$F$, $F-IF$ Framework). In particular, we categorize these denoising strategies
from three aspects (i.e. denoising in the spatial domain, frequency domain, and
latent space, respectively). Typically, defense is performed on the entire
adversarial example, both image and perturbation are modified, making it
difficult to tell how it defends against the perturbations. To evaluate the
robustness of these denoising strategies intuitively, we directly apply them to
defend against adversarial noise itself (assuming we have obtained all of it),
which saving us from sacrificing benign accuracy. Surprisingly, our
experimental results show that even if most of the perturbations in each
dimension is eliminated, it is still difficult to obtain satisfactory
robustness. Based on the above findings and analyses, we propose the adaptive
compression strategy for different frequency bands in the feature domain to
improve the robustness. Our experiment results show that the adaptive

inference, must be compared with a similarly convolved theory model. In this
work, we directly estimate the unwindowed power spectrum multipoles using
quadratic estimators akin to those introduced in the late 1990s. Under Gaussian
assumptions, these are optimal and free from the leading-order effects of
pixellization and non-Poissonian shot-noise. They may be straightforwardly
computed given the survey data-set and a suite of simulations of known
cosmology. We implement the pixel-based maximum-likelihood estimator and a
simplification based on the FKP weighting scheme, both of which can be computed
via FFTs and conjugate gradient descent methods. Furthermore, the estimators
allow direct computation of spectrum coefficients in an arbitrary linear
compression scheme, without needing to first bin the statistic. Applying the
technique to a subset of the BOSS DR12 galaxies, we find that the pixel-based
quadratic estimators give statistically consistent power spectra, compressed
coefficients, and cosmological parameters to those obtained with the usual
windowed approaches. Due to the sample's low number density and compact window
function, the optimal weighting scheme gives little improvement over the
simplified form; this may change for dense surveys or those focusing on
primordial non-Gaussianity. The technique is shown to be efficient and robust,
and shows significant potential for measuring the windowless power spectrum and
bispectrum in the presence of weak non-Gaussianity.

up to $25.8\times$ faster to train on its original dataset, while removing the

various text classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, natural language
inference, and semantic textual similarity. However, the reliability of the
fine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For
instance, one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD)
samples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain
shifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the
over-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords, instead of looking
at the whole context. In particular, we find that (a) OOD samples often contain
in-distribution keywords, while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain
keywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In
light of this observation, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning
method, coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER), that facilitates
context-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the
keywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without
enough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (e.g.,
BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection

the large-scale setting where an oracle provides the stochastic gradients of
the constituent functions, and the goal is to solve the problem with a minimal
number of calls to the oracle. Owing to the compositional form, the stochastic
gradients provided by the oracle do not yield unbiased estimates of the
objective or constraint gradients. Instead, we construct approximate gradients
by tracking the inner function evaluations, resulting in a quasi-gradient
saddle point algorithm. We prove that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to
find the optimal and feasible solution almost surely. We further establish that
the proposed algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ data samples in
order to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximate optimal point while also ensuring
zero constraint violation. The result matches the sample complexity of the
stochastic compositional gradient descent method for unconstrained problems and
improves upon the best-known sample complexity results for the constrained
settings. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is tested on both fair
classification and fair regression problems. The numerical results show that
the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of

(e.g., sub-6GHz) channel. The unreliable channel is modeled as a
time-correlated Gilbert-Elliot channel at a high rate when the channel is in

noise types. Most of the existing methods are focused on modelling the speech
rather than the noise. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to model speech
and noise simultaneously in a two-branch convolutional neural network, namely
SN-Net. In SN-Net, the two branches predict speech and noise, respectively.
Instead of information fusion only at the final output layer, interaction
modules are introduced at several intermediate feature domains between the two
branches to benefit each other. Such an interaction can leverage features
learned from one branch to counteract the undesired part and restore the
missing component of the other and thus enhance their discrimination
capabilities. We also design a feature extraction module, namely
residual-convolution-and-attention (RA), to capture the correlations along
temporal and frequency dimensions for both the speech and the noises.
Evaluations on public datasets show that the interaction module plays a key
role in simultaneous modeling and the SN-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art
by a large margin on various evaluation metrics. The proposed SN-Net also shows
superior performance for speaker separation.

Based on the concept of digital halftoning, this paper proposes a green noise
binary masking scheme which can greatly reduce the high frequency content of
the masks while fulfilling the randomness requirement. The experimental results
show that the proposed green noise binary masking scheme outperform the
traditional ones when using in a DMD-based coded diffraction pattern phase

the theories of order statistics and stochastic geometry, the outage
performances of both BU-SGF and CS-SGF schemes are analyzed. Theoretical
results show that both schemes can achieve full diversity orders only when the

photospheric magnetic flux due to flux emergence is accompanied by a rise of
the coronal emission of the CBP loops, that is a heating episode. We also
observe enhanced chromospheric activity associated with the occurrence of new
HLs and mottles. While the coronal emission and magnetic flux increases appear
to be co-temporal, the response of the Halpha counterpart of the CBP occurs
with a small delay of less than 3 min. A sharp temperature increase is found in
one of the HLs and in one of the CBP footpoints estimated at 46% and 55% with

of one-parametric density matrices of arbitrary dimensionality, which model
equivalent quantum subsystems being equally connected (EC-) with each other by
means of a single entnaglement parameter $ p $. In particular, for the family
of such EC-density matrices it has been found that there exists a number of $ N
$- and $ D $-dependent separability (or entanglement) thresholds $ p_{th}(N,D)
$ which in the case of a qubit-pair density matrix in $ \mathcal{H}_{2} \otimes
\mathcal{H}_{2} $ Hilbert space are shown to reduce to well-known results
obtained earlier by Peres [5] and Horodecki [6]. As the result, a number of
remarkable features of the entanglement thresholds for EC-density matrices has
been described for the first time. All novel results being obtained for the
family of arbitrary EC-density matrices are shown to be applicable for a wide
range of both interacting and non-interacting multi-partite quantum systems,
such as arrays of qubits, spin chains, ensembles of quantum oscillators,
strongly correlated quantum many-body systems with the possibility of many-body
localization, etc.

interaction with the same cavity excitation mode, will radiate coherently,
which effect is termed superradiance. In several cases, especially if the
density of oscillators is high, the superradiance may dominate the intrinsic
relaxation processes. This limit can be achieved, e.g., with cyclotron
resonance in two-dimensional electron gases. In those experiments, the
cyclotron resonance is coupled to the electric field of light, while the
oscillator density can be easily controlled by varying the gate voltage.
However, in the case of magnetic oscillators, to achieve the dominance of
superradiance is more tricky, as material parameters limit the oscillator
density, and the magnetic coupling to the light wave is rather small. Here we
present quasi-optical magnetic resonance experiments on thin films of yttrium
iron garnet. Due to the simplicity of experimental geometry, the intrinsic
damping and the superradiance can be easily separated in the transmission
spectra. We show that with increasing film thickness, the losses due to
coherent radiation prevail the system's internal broadening.

knowledge sharing is a promising approach. Image feature learning can be
considered as a multitask problem because different tasks may have a similar
feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image
feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods
solve one task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP
method has been developed for image feature learning. Therefore, this paper
develops a multitask GP approach to image feature learning for classification
with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new
knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is
developed to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and
to improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a
common tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With
the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features
extracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing
task-specific features. To learn the best common and task-specific trees, a new
evolutionary process and new fitness functions are developed. The performance
of the proposed approach is examined on six multitask problems of 12 image
classification datasets with limited training data and compared with three GP
and 14 non-GP-based competitive methods. Experimental results show that the new
approach outperforms these compared methods in almost all the comparisons.
Further analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective
common trees with high effectiveness and transferability.

estimated gas mass fractions and depletion timescales are $f_{\rm gas}=$
0.20-0.75 and $t_{\rm dep}=$ 0.09-1.55 Gyr, respectively. Although the galaxies
appear to tightly distribute around the star-forming main sequence at
$z\sim3.3$, both quantities show a wider spread at a fixed stellar mass than
expected from the scaling relation, suggesting a large diversity of fundamental
gas properties among star-forming galaxies apparently on the main sequence.
Comparing gas mass fraction and gas-phase metallicity between the star-forming

completion time in parallel graph processing systems. Among the various
partition strategies, edge partition has demonstrated more promising
performance in power-law graphs than vertex partition and thereby has been more
widely adopted as the default partition strategy by existing graph systems. The
graph edge partition problem, which is to split the edge set into multiple
balanced parts to minimize the total number of copied vertices, has been widely
studied from the view of optimization and algorithms. In this paper, we study
local search algorithms for this problem to further improve the partition
results from existing methods. More specifically, we propose two novel
concepts, namely adjustable edges and blocks. Based on these, we develop a
greedy heuristic as well as an improved search algorithm utilizing the property
of the max-flow model. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we first
provide adequate theoretical analysis in terms of the approximation quality. We
significantly improve the previously known approximation ratio for this
problem. Then we conduct extensive experiments on a large number of benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art edge partition strategies. The results show that
our proposed local search framework can further improve the quality of graph
partition by a wide margin.

unprecedented accuracy, models for the interior structure of the planet are
putted to the test. While equations of state based on first principles or ab

elements constituting the envelope, hydrogen and helium, significant
discrepancies remain regarding the predictions of the inner structure of
Jupiter. The differences are severe enough to clutter the analysis of Juno's
data and even cast doubts on the usefulness of these computationally expensive
EOSs for the modeling of the interior of Jupiter and exoplanets at large. Using
our newly developed equations of state for hydrogen and helium, we asses the ab
initio equations of state currently available and establish their efficiency at
predicting the interior structure of Jupiter in a two-layers model. By
adjusting our free energy parameterization to reproduce previous ab initio EOS
behavior, we identify the source of the disagreement previously reported for
the interior structure of Jupiter. We further point to area where care should
be taken when building EOS for the modeling of giant planets. This concerns the
interpolation between the ab initio results and the physical models used to
cover the low density range as well as the interpolation of the {\sl ab initio}
simulation results at high densities. This sensitivity falls well within the
uncertainties of the ab initio simulations. This suggests that hydrogen EOS
should be carefully benchmarked using a simple planetary model before being
used in the more advanced planetary models needed to interpret the Juno data.

a convergent behavior in learning and planning. Unfortunately, the performance
bound for the fixed point it converges to remains unclear, and in practice, its

topological insulators (TTIs), which is protected by the sublattice symmetry
and spacetime inversion ($\mathcal P\mathcal T$) symmetry. The required
symmetries for the TTIs can be realized on any bipartite lattice where the
inversion exchanges sublattices. The protecting symmetries lead to the
classifying space of Hamiltonians being unitary symmetric matrices, and
therefore Takagi's factorization can be performed. Particularly, the global
Takagi's factorization can (cannot) be done on a $3$D ($2$D) sphere. In 3D,
there is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant corresponding to the parity of
the winding number of Takagi's unitary-matrix factor over the entire Brillouin
zone, where the $\mathbb Z_2$ nature comes from the $O(N)$ gauge degrees of
freedom in Takagi's factorization. In 2D, the obstruction for a global Takagi's
factorization is characterized by another $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant,
equivalent to the second Stiefel-Whitney number. For the third-order
topological phases, the $3$D TTIs feature a parity condition for corner
zero-modes, i.e., there always exist odd $\mathcal P\mathcal T$ pairs of
corners with zero-modes. Moreover, for any $\mathcal P\mathcal T$ invariant
sample geometry, all configurations of corner zero-modes satisfying the parity
condition can exist with the same nontrivial bulk topological invariant.
Actually, without closing the bulk gap, the boundary phase diagram have a
cellular structure, where each topological boundary phase associated with a

manifestation of Poynting's effect in large strain elasticity. Here, we
construct an analogous treatment for an active rubber fibre actuated via an
axisymmetric pattern of spontaneous distortion. We start by constructing an
exact large-deformation solution to the equations of elasticity for such fibre
subject to imposed twist and stretch, which reveals spontaneous warping and
twisting of the fibre cross-section absent in passive rubbers. We then compute
the corresponding non-linear elastic energy, which encompasses the Poynting
effect, but is minimized by a finite spontaneous twist and stretch. In the
second half of the paper, we apply these results to understand the
twist-contraction actuation of nematic elastomer fibres fabricated with
director-fields that encode helical patterns of contraction on heating. We
first consider patterns making a constant angle with respect to the local
cylindrical coordinate system (conical spiral director curves) and verify the
predicted spontaneous twist, contraction and cross-section deformation via
finite elements. Secondly, we consider realistic director distributions for the
experimentally reported fibres fabricated by cross-linking while simultaneously
applying stretch and twist. Counter-intuitively, we find that maximum actuation
twist is produced by applying a finite optimal twist during fabrication.
Finally, we illustrate that spontaneously twisting fibres will coil into
spring-like shapes on actuation if the ends are prevented from twisting
relative to each other. Such twist-torsion coupling would allow to make a
tendril-like ""soft-spring"" actuator with low force and high linear stroke

uncertainties in projections of future climate change remain. Climate
projections are produced with increasingly complex models which attempt to
represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic
circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea-ice, vegetation and interactions
with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes
feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate
models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major
improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to
doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than three. Here we review
a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the
uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system. The emergent
constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between
an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend
in the contemporary climate. This review summarises previous published work on
emergent constraints, and discusses the huge promise and potential dangers of
the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be
based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. It is hoped that this review will stimulate physicists to contribute
to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections,
bringing to it much needed rigour and physical insights.

high mortality rate with patients commonly present with the disease at stage 3
and above. There are only relatively few methods that simultaneously detect and
classify nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, very few
studies have used semi-supervised learning for lung cancer prediction. This
study presents a complete end-to-end scheme to detect and classify lung nodules
using the state-of-the-art Self-training with Noisy Student method on a
comprehensive CT lung screening dataset of around 4,000 CT scans.
  Methods: We used three datasets, namely LUNA16, LIDC and NLST, for this
study. We first utilise a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network
model to detect lung nodules in the detection stage. The classification model
known as Maxout Local-Global Network uses non-local networks to detect global
features including shape features, residual blocks to detect local features
including nodule texture, and a Maxout layer to detect nodule variations. We
trained the first Self-training with Noisy Student model to predict lung cancer
on the unlabelled NLST datasets. Then, we performed Mixup regularization to
enhance our scheme and provide robustness to erroneous labels.
  Results and Conclusions: Our new Mixup Maxout Local-Global network achieves
an AUC of 0.87 on 2,005 completely independent testing scans from the NLST
dataset. Our new scheme significantly outperformed the next highest performing
method at the 5% significance level using DeLong's test (p = 0.0001). This
study presents a new complete end-to-end scheme to predict lung cancer using
Self-training with Noisy Student combined with Mixup regularization. On a
completely independent dataset of 2,005 scans, we achieved state-of-the-art
performance even with more images as compared to other methods.

are used to resolve uncertainties. Each of $n$ data items has an unknown value,
which is known to lie in a given interval. We can pay a query cost to learn the
actual value, and we may allow an error threshold in the sorting. The goal is
to find a nearly-sorted permutation by performing a minimum-cost set of
queries.
  We show that an offline optimum query set can be found in poly time, and that
both oblivious and adaptive problems have simple competitive algorithms. The
competitive ratio for the oblivious problem is $n$ for uniform query costs, and
unbounded for arbitrary costs; for the adaptive problem, the ratio is 2.
  We present a unified adaptive strategy for uniform costs that yields the
following improved results: (1) a 3/2-competitive randomized algorithm; (2) a
5/3-competitive deterministic algorithm if the dependency graph has no
2-components after some preprocessing, which has competitive ratio
$3/2+\mathrm{O}(1/k)$ if the components obtained have size at least $k$; and
(3) an exact algorithm for laminar families of intervals. The first two results

that the 2-competitive deterministic adaptive algorithm can be generalized for

using the local ratio technique. Moreover, we prove that the advice complexity
of the adaptive problem is $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ if no error threshold is

  This paper provides two contributions to this research field. Firstly, a
nomenclature is proposed to understand the main initiatives in studying
language emergence and grounding, accounting for the variations in assumptions
and constraints. Secondly, a PyTorch based deep learning framework is
introduced, entitled ReferentialGym, which is dedicated to furthering the
exploration of language emergence and grounding. By providing baseline

driven-dissipative lattices acting as directional amplifiers. Our theory relies
on a mapping from the optical non-Hermitian coupling matrix to an effective
topological insulator Hamiltonian. This mapping is based on the singular value
decomposition of non-Hermitian coupling matrices, whose inverse matrix
determines the linear input-output response of the system. In topologically
non-trivial regimes, the input-output response of the lattice is dominated by
singular vectors with zero singular values that are the equivalent of
zero-energy states in topological insulators, leading to directional
amplification of a coherent input signal. In such topological amplification
regime, our theoretical framework allows us to fully characterize the
amplification properties of the quantum device such as gain, bandwidth, added
noise, and noise-to-signal ratio. We exemplify our ideas in a one-dimensional
non-reciprocal photonic lattice, for which we derive fully analytical
predictions. We show that the directional amplification is near quantum-limited
with a gain growing exponentially with system size, $N$, while the
noise-to-signal ratio is suppressed as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This points out to
interesting applications of our theory for quantum signal amplification and
single-photon detection.

relying only on numerical and analytical tools. Experimental tests are of
paramount importance for improving the current comprehension and validate
existing models. However, experiments involving blast scenarios are, at
present, partial and limited in number, compared to tests under different
dynamic conditions, such as earthquakes. The reason lies on the fact that
full-scale blast experiments present many difficulties, mainly due to the
nature of the loading action. Experiments in reduced-scale offer instead
greater flexibility. Nevertheless, appropriate scaling laws for the response of
masonry structures under blast excitations are needed before performing such
tests. We propose here new scaling laws for the dynamic, rigid-body response
and failure modes of masonry structures under blast loads. This work takes its
roots from previous studies, where closed-form solutions for the rocking
response of slender blocks due to explosions have been derived and validated
against numerical and experimental tests. The proposed scaling laws are here
validated with detailed numerical simulations accounting for combined rocking,
up-lifting, and sliding mechanisms of monolithic structures. Then, the
application to multi-drum stone columns is considered. In particular, we show
that, whilst the presence of complex behaviors, such as wobbling and impacts,
similarity is assured. The developments demonstrate their applicability in the
design of reduced-scale experiments of masonry structures.

particle distribution is very intriguing. Given that FRB 121102 is likely
driven by a neutron star, we explored orbits of charged particles trapped in a
dipole magnetic field (the St\""ormer problem). Most previous studies focused on
particles with relatively low energies so that the guiding center approximation
may be applied. High energy particles usually have chaotic orbits except those
on a periodic orbit or near stable periodic orbits. Via evaluation of the
maximum Lyapunov exponent of orbits of particles launched from the equatorial
plane with an axial velocity (the angular velocity sets the length and energy
scales of the system), we found prominent regions of quasi-periodic orbits
around stable periodic orbits in the equatorial plane at high-energies.
Particles in these orbits oscillate around the equatorial plane and their
radial distance from the dipole can vary by a factor of/,2. Relativistic
electrons in such orbits may be responsible for the almost 100% polarized
emission from FRB 121102.

coordinates of joints in a group-wise manner, where less-related joints are
automatically categorized into different groups and exhibit different features.
This is different from the previous methods where all the joints are considered
holistically and share the same feature. The benefits of our method are
illustrated by the principle of multi-task learning (MTL), i.e., by separating
less-related joints into different groups (as different tasks), our method
learns different features for each of them, therefore efficiently avoids the
negative transfer (among less related tasks/groups of joints). The key of our
method is a novel binary selector that automatically selects related joints
into the same group. We implement such a selector with binary values
stochastically sampled from a Concrete distribution, which is constructed using
Gumbel softmax on trainable parameters. This enables us to preserve the
differentiable property of the whole network. We further exploit features from
those less-related groups by carrying out an additional feature fusing scheme
among them, to learn more discriminative features. This is realized by
implementing multiple 1x1 convolutions on the concatenated features, where each
joint group contains a unique 1x1 convolution for feature fusion. The detailed
ablation analysis and the extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Besides, our method achieves top-1 among all

at lags equal to the candidate locations' time-differences of arrival (TDOAs).
Due to the dense grid of candidate locations, each of which requires inverse
Fourier transform (IFT) evaluations, conventional SRP exhibits a high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SRP
approach based on Nyquist-Shannon sampling. Noting that on the one hand the
range of possible TDOAs is physically bounded, while on the other hand the GCCs
are bandlimited, we critically sample the GCCs around their TDOA interval and
approximate the SRP map by interpolation. In usual setups, the number of sample
points can be orders of magnitude less than the number of candidate locations

limited interpolation cost. Simulations comparing the proposed approximation
with conventional SRP indicate low approximation errors and equal localization

adversarial examples (AEs), which poses security concerns on clinical decision
making. Luckily, medical AEs are also easy to detect in hierarchical feature
space per our study herein. To better understand this phenomenon, we thoroughly
investigate the intrinsic characteristic of medical AEs in feature space,
providing both empirical evidence and theoretical explanations for the
question: why are medical adversarial attacks easy to detect? We first perform
a stress test to reveal the vulnerability of deep representations of medical
images, in contrast to natural images. We then theoretically prove that typical
adversarial attacks to binary disease diagnosis network manipulate the
prediction by continuously optimizing the vulnerable representations in a fixed
direction, resulting in outlier features that make medical AEs easy to detect.
However, this vulnerability can also be exploited to hide the AEs in the
feature space. We propose a novel hierarchical feature constraint (HFC) as an
add-on to existing adversarial attacks, which encourages the hiding of the
adversarial representation within the normal feature distribution. We evaluate
the proposed method on two public medical image datasets, namely {Fundoscopy}
and {Chest X-Ray}. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
adversarial attack method as it bypasses an array of state-of-the-art
adversarial detectors more easily than competing attack methods, supporting
that the great vulnerability of medical features allows an attacker more room

raises the question of designing efficient parallel algorithms for sampling. We
show that sampling arborescences can be done in RNC.

of the symbols of the modern astronomy because they can allow big
collaborations, exploiting multiple facilities and shared knowledge. The new
generation of extremely large telescopes will play a key role because of their
angular resolution and their capability in collecting the light of faint
sources. Our simulations combine technical, tomographic and observational
information, and benefit of the Global-Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (GMCAO)
approach, a well demonstrated method that exploits only natural guide stars to
correct the scientific field of view from the atmospheric turbulence. By
simulating K-band observations of 6000 high redshift galaxies in the Chandra
Deep Field South area, we have shown how an ELT can carry out photometric
surveys successfully, recovering morphological and structural parameters. We
present here a wide statistics of the expected performance of a GMCAO-equipped
ELT in 22 well-known surveys in terms of SR.

for the magnetic reversal regime, where domain wall motion dominated reversal

of 1.35~deg$^2$ to a redshift depth of 0.16, using a total on-source
integration time of over 700 hours. The long integration time and small
observation area makes it one of the most sensitive HI surveys, with a noise
level of $\sim 75$~$\mu$Jy per 21.4~kHz (equivalent to 4.5~km~s$^{-1}$ at
redshift $z=0$). We detect 247 galaxies in the survey, more than doubling the
number already detected in AUDS60. The mass range of detected galaxies is
$\log(M_{\rm HI}~[h_{70}^{-2}{\rm M}_\odot]) = 6.32 - 10.76$. A modified
maximum likelihood method is employed to construct an HI mass function (HIMF).
The best fitting Schechter parameters are: low-mass slope $\alpha = -1.37 \pm
0.05$, characteristic mass $\log(M^*~[h_{70}^{-2}{\rm M}_\odot]) = 10.15 \pm
0.09$, and density $\Phi_* = (2.41 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-3}
h_{70}^3$~Mpc$^{-3}$~dex$^{-1}$. The sample was divided into low and high
redshift bins to investigate the evolution of the HIMF. No change in low-mass
slope $\alpha$ was measured, but an increased characteristic mass $M^*$, was
noted in the higher-redshift sample. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data
to define relative galaxy number density, the dependence of the HIMF with
environment was also investigated in the two AUDS regions. We find no
significant variation in $\alpha$ or $M^*$. In the surveyed region, we measured
a cosmic HI density $\Omega_{\rm HI} = (3.55 \pm 0.30) \times 10^{-4}
h_{70}^{-1}$. There appears to be no evolutionary trend in $\Omega_{\rm HI}$
above $2\sigma$ significance between redshifts of 0 and 0.16.

out under the assumption of the linear water wave theory and small-amplitude
wave response. The Fourier--Bessel series expansion of the velocity potential
is derived for regions enclosed under the open-water and cage systems and in
the immediate vicinity. Further, the scattering between the cages is accounted
for by employing Graf's addition theorem. The porous flexible cage system is
modelled using Darcy's law and the three-dimensional membrane equation. The
edges of the cages are moored along its circumferences to balance its position
in the deep sea. The unknown coefficients in the potentials are obtained by
employing the matched eigenfunction method in conjunction with the
least-squares approximation method. In addition, the far-field scattering
coefficients for the entire system are obtained by expanding the Bessel and
Hankel functions in the plane wave representation form. Numerical results such
as the hydrodynamic forces, scattering coefficients, and power dissipation are
investigated for various cage and wave parameters. The wave loading on the cage
system can be significantly damped by the spatial arrangement, membrane
tension, and porous-effect parameter. Moreover, the far-field results suggest
that the cage system can also be used as a breakwater.

functioning of many spintronic devices. An attractive design of spin injectors
into semiconductors is based on a spin pumping from a precessing ferromagnet,
typically excited by a microwave magnetic field leading to a high power
consumption of the device. Here we describe theoretically a spin injector with
greatly reduced energy losses, in which the magnetic dynamics is excited by an
elastic wave injected into a ferromagnet-semiconductor heterostructure. To
demonstrate the efficient functioning of such an injector, we perform
micromagnetoelastic simulations of the coupled elastic and magnetic dynamics in
Ni films and Ni/GaAs bilayers. For thick Ni films, it is shown that a
monochromatic acoustic wave generates a spin wave with the same frequency and
wavelength, which propagates over distances of several micrometers at the
excitation frequencies close to the frequency of ferromagnetic resonance. The
simulations of Ni/GaAs bilayers with Ni thicknesses comparable to the
wavelength of the injected acoustic wave demonstrate the development of a
steady-state magnetization precession at the Ni/GaAs interface. The amplitude
of such a precession has a maximum at Ni thickness amounting to three quarters
of the wavelength of the elastic wave, which is explained by an analytical
model. Using simulation data obtained for the magnetization precession at the
Ni/GaAs interface, we evaluate the spin current pumped into GaAs and calculate
the spin accumulation in it by solving the spin diffusion equation. Then the
electrical signals resulting from the spin flow and the inverse spin Hall
effect are determined via the numerical solution of the Laplace's equation. It
is shown that amplitudes of these ac signals are large enough for experimental
measurement, which indicates an efficient acoustically driven spin pumping into
GaAs.

on surface Dyakonov-Cherenkov radiation, i.e. the emission of directional
Dyakonov surface waves from a swift charged particle moving atop a birefringent
crystal. This new type of Cherenkov radiation is highly susceptible to both the
particle velocity and trajectory, e.g. we observe a sharp radiation enhancement
when the particle trajectory falls in the vicinity of a particular direction.
Moreover, close to the Cherenkov threshold, such a radiation enhancement can be
orders of magnitude higher than that obtained in traditional Cherenkov
detectors. These distinct properties allow us to determine simultaneously the

only criterion for selection, the procedure satisfies desired fairness and
independence properties. We show that when affirmative action policies are
introduced, the established methods of reserves and procedures used in Brazil,
France, and Australia, fail to satisfy those properties. We then present a new

information on 3D data such as video sequences. However, due to the convolution
and pooling mechanism, the information loss seems unavoidable. To improve the
visual explanations and classification in 3D CNN, we propose two approaches; i)
aggregate layer-wise global to local (global-local) discrete gradients using
trained 3DResNext network, and ii) implement attention gating network to
improve the accuracy of the action recognition. The proposed approach intends
to show the usefulness of every layer termed as global-local attention in 3D
CNN via visual attribution, weakly-supervised action localization, and action
recognition. Firstly, the 3DResNext is trained and applied for action
classification using backpropagation concerning the maximum predicted class.
The gradients and activations of every layer are then up-sampled. Later,
aggregation is used to produce more nuanced attention, which points out the
most critical part of the predicted class's input videos. We use contour
thresholding of final attention for final localization. We evaluate spatial and
temporal action localization in trimmed videos using fine-grained visual
explanation via 3DCam. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
produces informative visual explanations and discriminative attention.
Furthermore, the action recognition via attention gating on each layer produces
better classification results than the baseline model.

capturing diphthong than monophthong vowel information, while also differences
in the amount of information captured for different types of consonants were
observed. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the effectiveness
of the back-end in capturing a phoneme's information and the quality of the
cross-lingual phone labels assigned to the phoneme. The AF-level analysis
together with t-SNE visualization results showed that the proposed approach is
better than MFCC and APC features in capturing manner and place of articulation

non-Markovian heat bath for various temperatures. We showed that when changes
to the external perturbation occurred sufficiently slowly, the system always
reached thermal equilibrium. Thus, we calculated the Boltzmann entropy and the
von Neumann entropy for an isothermal process, as well as various thermodynamic
variables, such as changes of internal energies, heat, and work, for a system
in quasi-static equilibrium based on the HEOM. We found that, although the
characteristic features of the system entropies in the Boltzmann and von
Neumann cases as a function of the system--bath coupling strength are similar,
those for the total entropy production are completely different. The total
entropy production in the Boltzmann case is always positive, whereas that in
the von Neumann case becomes negative if we chose a thermal equilibrium state
of the total system (an unfactorized thermal equilibrium state) as the initial
state. This is because the total entropy production in the von Neumann case
does not properly take into account the contribution of the entropy from the
system--bath interaction. Thus, the Boltzmann entropy must be used to
investigate entropy production in the fully quantum regime. Finally, we
examined the applicability of the Jarzynski equality.

processes in a full-resolution manner, resulting in two problems when deployed
for practical applications. First, parallel acceleration of the autoregressive
entropy model cannot be achieved due to serial decoding. Second,
full-resolution inference often causes the out-of-memory(OOM) problem with
limited GPU resources, especially for high-resolution images. Block partition
is a good design choice to handle the above issues, but it brings about new
challenges in reducing the redundancy between blocks and eliminating block
effects. To tackle the above challenges, this paper provides a learned
block-based hybrid image compression (LBHIC) framework. Specifically, we
introduce explicit intra prediction into a learned image compression framework
to utilize the relation among adjacent blocks. Superior to context modeling by
linear weighting of neighbor pixels in traditional codecs, we propose a
contextual prediction module (CPM) to better capture long-range correlations by
utilizing the strip pooling to extract the most relevant information in
neighboring latent space, thus achieving effective information prediction.
Moreover, to alleviate blocking artifacts, we further propose a boundary-aware
postprocessing module (BPM) with the edge importance taken into account.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LBHIC codec outperforms the
VVC, with a bit-rate conservation of 4.1%, and reduces the decoding time by
approximately 86.7% compared with that of state-of-the-art learned image
compression methods.

significantly progressed by Liebeck, Praeger and Saxl in 2010.

groups shows that, if $G=HK$ is a classical group of Lie type and $H,K$ are
nonsolvable, then $H$ or $K$ is `almost maximal', with only a couple of
exceptions.
  As applications of the classification result,
  (1) a classification is given of quasiprimitive groups containing a regular
simple group;

Using these metrics, we calculate the tension between DES Year 1 $3\times 2$pt

business process modeling and execution. It defines clearly how to articulate
its concepts, but do not provide mechanism to represent the semantics of the
produced models. This paper addresses the problem of how to improve the
expressiveness of BPMN models, proposing a definition for the semantics of a
business process within a BPMN model, and improving the completeness of the
models in a systematic manner, so that models can describe far more situations
with few extra managed complexity. We conceive a framework based on the
business transaction patterns available in the enterprise ontology body of
knowledge to prescribe the foundations of semantic BPMN models. A tool has been
developed to automate the framework. Then, two industrial proof-of-concepts are
used to measure its coverage, both positive and negative, and to argue about
our proposal's usefulness. After that, the proposal is compared with others
using a systematic literature review. A full BPMN pattern is proposed
encompassing the happy flow, the declinations, the rejections and the
revocations, without adding any new element to the BPMN specification. A
software tool has been developed, and made publicly available, to support the
automatic generation of the BPMN models from the proposed patterns. Our
semantified BPMN pattern allowed the identification of a large amount of
implicit, and other not implemented, situations in both proof-of-concepts. It
is concluded that the usage of a semantic solution, grounded on a sound
pattern, allows the systematic enrichment of the BPMN models with a bounded
effort. Moreover, to simplify the BPMN executable models' implementation, its
elements could be classified as implicit, explicit, or not implemented yet.
Finally, related work indicates that this work is demanded, but no full

Wall (LoW) for fluid dynamic momentum boundary layers. The latter typically
follows from a strongly simplified, unidirectional shear flow under a constant
stress assumption. We first derive the adjoint companion of the simplified
momentum equation, while distinguishing between two strategies. Using
mixing-length arguments, we demonstrate that the frozen turbulence strategy and
a LoW-consistent (differentiated) approach provide virtually the same adjoint
momentum equations, that differ only in a single scalar coefficient controlling
the inclination in the logarithmic region. Moreover, it is seen that an adjoint
LoW can be derived which resembles its primal counterpart in many aspects. The
strategy is also compatible with wall-function assumptions for prominent
RANS-type two-equation turbulence models, which ground on the mixing-length
hypothesis. As a direct consequence of the frequently employed assumption that
all primal flow properties algebraically scale with the friction velocity, it
is demonstrated that a simple algebraic expression provides a consistent
closure of the adjoint momentum equation in the logarithmic layer. This
algebraic adjoint closure might also serve as an approximation for more general
adjoint flow optimization studies using standard one- or two-equation
Boussinesq-viscosity models for the primal flow. Results obtained from the
suggested algebraic closure are verified against the primal/adjoint LoW
formulations for both, low- and high-Re settings. Applications included in this
paper refer to two- and three-dimensional shape optimizations of internal and
external engineering flows. Related results indicate that the proposed adjoint
algebraic turbulence closure accelerates the optimization process and provides
improved optima in comparison to the frozen turbulence approach.

across domains, and form the backbone of the modern computing landscape.
e-Infrastructure is a broad term used for large, medium and small scale
computing environments. The increasing sophistication and complexity of
applications have led to even small-scale data centers consisting of thousands
of interconnects. However, efficient utilization of resources in data centers
remains a challenging task, mainly due to the complexity of managing physical
nodes, network equipment, cooling systems, electricity, etc. This results in a
very strong carbon footprint of this industry. In recent years, efforts based
on machine learning approaches have shown promising results towards reducing
energy consumption of data centers. Yet, practical solutions that can help data
center operators in offering energy efficient services are lacking. This
problem is more visible in the context of medium and small scale data center
operators (the long tail of e-infrastructure providers). Additionally, a
disconnect between solution providers (machine learning experts) and data
center operators has been observed. This article presents a community-driven
open source software framework that allows community members to develop better
understanding of various aspects of resource utilization. The framework
leverages machine learning models for forecasting and optimizing various
parameters of data center operations, enabling improved efficiency, quality of
service and lower energy consumption. Also, the proposed framework does not
require datasets to be shared, which alleviates the extra effort of organizing,
describing and anonymizing data in an appropriate format.

understanding of the nature of GW190814 event will offer rich information
concerning open issues, the speed of sound and the possible phase transition
into other degrees of freedom. In the present work, we made an effort to probe
the nuclear equation of state along with the GW190814 event. Firstly, we
examine possible constraints on the nuclear equation of state inferred from the
consideration that the low mass companion is a slow or rapidly rotating neutron
star. In this case, the role of the upper bounds on the speed of sound is
revealed, in connection with the dense nuclear matter properties. Secondly, we
systematically study the tidal deformability of a possible high mass candidate
existing as an individual star or as a component one in a binary neutron star
system. As the tidal deformability and radius are quantities very sensitive on
the neutron star equation of state, they are excellent counters on dense matter
properties. We conjecture that similar isolated neutron stars or systems may
exist in the Universe and their possible future observation will shed light on
the maximum neutron star mass problem.

two-dimensional solids, very good results can be obtained with an embedded
strong discontinuity quadrilateral finite element that has incompatible modes.
Even more importantly, we demonstrate that these results can be obtained
without using a crack tracking algorithm. Therefore, the simulation of crack
patterns with several cracks, including branching, becomes possible. The
avoidance of a tracking algorithm is mainly enabled by the application of a
novel, local (Gauss-point based) criterion for crack nucleation, which
determines the time of embedding the localisation line as well as its position
and orientation. We treat the crack evolution in terms of a thermodynamical
framework, with softening variables describing internal dissipative mechanisms
of material degradation. As presented by numerical examples, many elements in
the mesh may develop a crack, but only some of them actually open and/or slide,
dissipate fracture energy, and eventually form the crack pattern. The novel
approach has been implemented for statics and dynamics, and the results of
computed difficult examples (including Kalthoff's test) illustrate its very
satisfying performance. It effectively overcomes unfavourable restrictions of
the standard embedded strong discontinuity formulations, namely the simulation
of the propagation of a single crack only. Moreover, it is computationally fast
and straightforward to implement. Our numerical solutions match the results of
experimental tests and previously reported numerical results in terms of crack
pattern, dissipated fracture energy, and load-displacement curve.

field fluctuations and matter over-densities, our estimates depend on the mass
function, the physical field generation mechanism by each PBH constituent, and
the characteristic PBH separation. After computing the power spectrum of
magnetic field fluctuations, we apply our formalism to study the plausibility
that two particular field generation mechanisms could have given rise to the
expected seed fields according to current observational constraints. The first
mechanism is the Biermann battery and the second one is due to the accretion of
magnetic monopoles at PBH formation, constituting magnetic PBHs. Our results
show that, for monochromatic distributions, it does not seem to be possible to
generate sufficiently intense seed fields in any of the two field generation
mechanisms. For extended distributions, it is also not possible to generate the
required seed field by only assuming a Biermann battery mechanism. In fact, we
report an average seed field by this mechanism of about 10^{-47} G, at z = 20.
For the case of magnetic monopoles we instead assume that the seed values from
the literature are achieved and calculate the necessary number density of
monopoles. In this case we obtain values that are below the upper limits from

different lattice discretizations as well as a continuum approach with
Pauli-Villars regularization. Within lattice field theory, we also perform a
full minimization of the effective action, allowing for arbitrary 1-dimensional
modulations of the order parameter. For all methods special attention is paid
to the role of cutoff effects. For one of the two lattice discretizations, no
inhomogeneous phase was found. For the other lattice discretization and within
the continuum approach with a finite Pauli-Villars cutoff parameter $\Lambda$,
we find a region in the phase diagram where an inhomogeneous order parameter is
favored. This inhomogeneous region shrinks, however, when $a$ is decreased or
$\Lambda$ is increased, and finally diappears for all non-zero temperatures

induction methods, information fades away with depth. This has to be taken into
account when interpreting models estimated from such measurements. For that
reason, a measurement sensitivity analysis and determining the depth of
investigation are standard steps during geophysical data processing. In
deterministic gradient-based inversion, the most used sensitivity measure, the
differential sensitivity, is readily available since these inversions require
the computation of Jacobian matrices. In contrast, differential sensitivity may
not be readily available in Monte Carlo inversion methods, since these methods
do not necessarily include a linearization of the forward problem. Instead, a
prior ensemble is used to simulate an ensemble of forward responses. Then, the
prior ensemble is updated according to Bayesian inference. We propose to use
the covariance between the prior ensemble and the forward response ensemble for
constructing sensitivity measures. In Monte Carlo approaches, the estimation of
this covariance does not require additional computations of the forward model.
Normalizing this covariance by the variance of the prior ensemble, one obtains
a simplied regression coefficient. We investigate differences between this
simplified regression coefficient and differential sensitivity using simple
forward models. For linear forward models, the simplied regression coefficient
is equal to differential sensitivity, except for the influences of the sampling
error and of the correlation structure of the prior distribution. In the
non-linear case, the behaviour of the simplified regression coefficient as
sensitivity measure is analysed for a simple non-linear forward model and a
frequency-domain electromagnetic forward model. [...]

neural network models including CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM-CRF, and CNN-CRF are
investigated on two prediction tasks: (i) entity detection on multiple data

these models with other standard approaches on both real and synthetic data,
with respect to F1-score, precision, recall, and throughput. The real datasets
include internal structured data and public email data with manually tagged

suitable candidate model to be deployed in the production environment(s).
Finally, we provide several lessons learned on data limitations, data labelling

Traditional ranking methods summarize interactions across time, using only
aggregate counts. Instead, we take advantage of the interaction timestamps,
proposing a series of network point process models with latent ranks. We
carefully design these models to incorporate important characteristics of
animal interaction data, including the winner effect, bursting and pair-flip
phenomena. Through iteratively constructing and evaluating these models we
arrive at the final cohort Markov-Modulated Hawkes process (C-MMHP), which best
characterizes all aforementioned patterns observed in interaction data. We
compare all models using simulated and real data. Using statistically developed
diagnostic perspectives, we demonstrate that the C-MMHP model outperforms other
methods, capturing relevant latent ranking structures that lead to meaningful

challenging when the likelihood function is intractable. The standard approach
to this problem involves sophisticated algorithms for extraction and clustering
of multipath components, following which, point estimates of the model
parameters can be obtained using specialized estimators. We propose a
likelihood-free calibration method using approximate Bayesian computation. The
method is based on the maximum mean discrepancy, which is a notion of distance
between probability distributions. Our method not only by-passes the need to
implement any high-resolution or clustering algorithm, but is also automatic in
that it does not require any additional input or manual pre-processing from the

on the value of the parameters, rather than a simple point estimate. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed method by fitting two different

propagation graph model, to both simulated and measured data. The proposed
method is able to estimate the parameters of both the models accurately in
simulations, as well as when applied to 60 GHz indoor measurement data.

reaching the full potential of these new estimators requires accurate modeling
of the physics of baryons as the extra nonGaussian information mostly resides
at small scales. We present one such modeling based on the Magneticum
hydrodynamical simulation for the KiDS-450 and DES-Y1 surveys and a Euclid-like
survey. We compute the bias due to baryons on the lensing PDF and the
distribution of peaks and voids in $M_{\rm ap}$ maps and propagate it to the
cosmological forecasts on the structure growth parameter $S_8$, the matter
density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and the dark energy equation of state $w_0$
using the SLICS and cosmo-SLICS sets of dark-matter-only simulations. We report
a negative bias of a few percent on $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and also measure
a positive bias of the same level on $w_0$ when including a tomographic
decomposition. These biases reach $\sim 5$% when combining $M_{\rm ap}$
statistics with the $\gamma$-2PCF as these estimators show similar dependency
on the AGN feedback. We verify that these biases constitute a less than
$1\sigma$ shift on the probed cosmological parameters for current cosmic shear
surveys. However, baryons need to be accounted for at the percentage level for
future Stage IV surveys and we propose to include the uncertainty on the AGN
feedback amplitude by marginalizing over this parameter using multiple
simulations such as those presented in this paper. Finally, we explore the
possibility of mitigating the impact of baryons by filtering the $M_{\rm ap}$
map but find that this process would require to suppress the small-scale

meaning to Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. In early
2000's Oleg Smolyanov noticed that Chernoff's theorem may be used to obtain
approximations to solutions of initial-value problems for linear partial
differential equations (LPDEs) of evolution type with variable coefficients,
including parabolic equations, Schr\""odinger equation, and some other. Chernoff
expressions are explicit formulas containing variable coefficients of LPDE and
the initial condition, hence they can be used as a numerical method for solving
LPDEs. However, the speed of convergence of such approximations at the present
time is understudied which makes it risky to employ this class of numerical
methods. In the present paper we take two equations with known solutions (heat
equation and transport equation) and study both analytically and numerically
the speed of decay of the norm of the difference between Chernoff
approximations and exact solutions. We also provide graphical illustrations of
convergence and its rate. These model examples, being relatively simple, allow
to demonstrate general properties of Chernoff approximations. The observations
obtained build a base for the future employment of the approach based on
Chernoff's theorem to the problem of construction of new numerical methods for
solving initial-value problem for parabolic LPDEs with variable coefficients.

the values measured in the AP state, as the vortex core has a lower probability

problems in power systems operation. AC-OPF is traditionally cast as a
constrained optimization problem that seeks optimal generation set points
whilst fulfilling a set of non-linear equality constraints -- the power flow
equations. With increasing penetration of renewable generation, grid operators
need to solve larger problems at shorter intervals. This motivates the research
interest in learning OPF solutions with neural networks, which have fast
inference time and is potentially scalable to large networks. The main
difficulty in solving the AC-OPF problem lies in dealing with this equality
constraint that has spurious roots, i.e. there are assignments of voltages that
fulfill the power flow equations that however are not physically realizable.
This property renders any method relying on projected-gradients brittle because
these non-physical roots can act as attractors. In this paper, we show
efficient strategies that circumvent this problem by differentiating through
the operations of a power flow solver that embeds the power flow equations into
a holomorphic function. The resulting learning-based approach is validated
experimentally on a 200-bus system and we show that, after training, the
learned agent produces optimized power flow solutions reliably and fast.
Specifically, we report a 12x increase in speed and a 40% increase in
robustness compared to a traditional solver. To the best of our knowledge, this
approach constitutes the first learning-based approach that successfully
respects the full non-linear AC-OPF equations.

Coarse-grained selection is a basic module in a retrieval-based chatbot, which
constructs a rough candidate set from the whole database to speed up the
interaction with customers. So far, there are two kinds of approaches for
coarse-grained selection module: (1) sparse representation; (2) dense
representation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic comparison
between these two approaches in retrieval-based chatbots, and which kind of
method is better in real scenarios is still an open question. In this paper, we
first systematically compare these two methods from four aspects: (1)
effectiveness; (2) index stoarge; (3) search time cost; (4) human evaluation.
Extensive experiment results demonstrate that dense representation method
significantly outperforms the sparse representation, but costs more time and
storage occupation. In order to overcome these fatal weaknesses of dense
representation method, we propose an ultra-fast, low-storage, and highly
effective Deep Semantic Hashing Coarse-grained selection method, called DSHC
model. Specifically, in our proposed DSHC model, a hashing optimizing module
that consists of two autoencoder models is stacked on a trained dense
representation model, and three loss functions are designed to optimize it. The
hash codes provided by hashing optimizing module effectively preserve the rich
semantic and similarity information in dense vectors. Extensive experiment
results prove that, our proposed DSHC model can achieve much faster speed and
lower storage than sparse representation, with limited performance loss
compared with dense representation. Besides, our source codes have been
publicly released for future research.

the insurer's risk exposure determined by a monetary risk measure is minimized
over the class of reinsurance treaties represented by increasing Lipschitz
retained loss functions. In this paper, we consider a dynamic extension of this
reinsurance problem in discrete time which can be viewed as a risk-sensitive
Markov Decision Process. The model allows for both insurance claims and premium
income to be stochastic and operates with general risk measures and premium
principles. We derive the Bellman equation and show the existence of a
Markovian optimal reinsurance policy. Under an infinite planning horizon, the
model is shown to be contractive and the optimal reinsurance policy to be
stationary. The results are illustrated with examples where the optimal policy

achieve electronic band engineering in all three spatial dimensions. For many
two dimensional van der Waals materials, twisting two adjacent layers with
respect to each other leads to flat electronic bands in the two corresponding
spatial directions -- a notion sometimes referred to as twistronics as it
enables a wealth of physical phenomena. Within this two dimensional plane,
large moir\'e patterns of nanometer size form. The basic concept we propose
here is to stack multiple twisted layers on top of each other in a predefined
pattern. If the pattern is chosen such that with respect to the stacking
direction of layers, the large spatial moir\'e features are spatially shifted
from one twisted layer to the next, the system exhibits twist angle controlled
flat bands in all of the three spatial directions. With this, our proposal
extends the use of twistronic to three dimensions. We exemplify the general
concept by considering graphitic systems, boron nitride and WSe$_2$ as
candidate materials, but the approach is applicable to any two-dimensional van
der Waals material. For hexagonal boron nitride we develope an ab initio fitted
tight binding model that captures the corresponding three dimensional
low-energy electronic structure. We outline that interesting three dimensional
correlated phases of matter can be induced and controlled following this route,
including quantum magnets and unconventional superconducting states.

as well as environmental impact; precision application of chemicals in place of
blanket application reduces operational costs for the growers while reducing
the amount of chemicals which may enter the environment unnecessarily.
Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of loss and therefore boosts
crop production during a given season. With this in mind, we collect sequences
of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to
detect and predict NDS across the field. Our work sits at the intersection of
agriculture, remote sensing, and modern computer vision and deep learning.
First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the
impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and
sampling strategy. We then quantify the amount of information available at
different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a
UNet. Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which
combines a UNet with a convolutional LSTM layer, to accurately detect regions
of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53.
Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of
the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight -- potentially more
than three weeks in the future -- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47-0.51
depending on how far in advance the prediction is made. We will also release a

cell filamentation. This phenotype is triggered by an imbalance in deoxy
nucleotide levels, most prominently a disproportionate drop in the
intracellular dTTP. We show that a highly cooperative (Hill coefficient 2.5) in

memory bandwidth necessary for a fully-pipelined implementation and hits the
roofline performance model, achieving the potential maximum throughput. The
fully pipelined matching architecture was designed based on the consine angle
distance method. Our architecture was optimized for 16-bit fixed-point
operations and implemented on hardware using a Xilinx Zynq-based FPGA
development board. Our proposed architecture shows a noticeable reduction of
area resources compared with its counterparts in literature, while maintaining
high throughput by alleviating memory bandwidth restrictions. The results show
a reduction in consumed device resources of up to 91 percent in LUTs and 79
percent of BRAMs. Our hardware implementation is 15.7 times faster than the
comparable software approach.

proposed utilizing a transfer learning approach consisting of an encoder where
a high performing pre-trained model has been used to initialize it for

silicene-class crystals can be continuously tuned by a perpendicular electric
field. By direct calculation of the $Z_2$ invariant, we confirm that an
electronic phase transition from a topological insulator to a band insulator
occurs when the electric field passes a critical value. In a device setting
with asymmetric gate voltages, this field-tunable Berry curvature generates a
large spin current transverse to the charge current. When the electric field
strength surpasses the critical value, the bulk spin current is found to change
direction and greatly decrease in magnitude. This finding of a large magnitude,
switchable spin current suggests that the silicene family of 2D crystals could
be an attractive candidate for field-tunable charge-spin conversion. Such
field-tunable phase transitions between topologically distinct phases could be
useful for robust qubits as well.

challenging to train. This is in particular caused by their highly non-convex
optimization space leading to a number of instabilities. Among them, mode
collapse stands out as one of the most daunting ones. This undesirable event
occurs when the model can only fit a few modes of the data distribution, while
ignoring the majority of them. In this work, we combat mode collapse using
second-order gradient information. To do so, we analyse the loss surface
through its Hessian eigenvalues, and show that mode collapse is related to the
convergence towards sharp minima. In particular, we observe how the eigenvalues
of the $G$ are directly correlated with the occurrence of mode collapse.
Finally, motivated by these findings, we design a new optimization algorithm
called nudged-Adam (NuGAN) that uses spectral information to overcome mode
collapse, leading to empirically more stable convergence properties.

problems by mapping these onto a binary representation, sparked mostly by the
use of quantum annealing machines. Such binary representation is reminiscent of
a discrete physical two-state system, such as the Ising model. As such,
physics-inspired techniques -- commonly used in fundamental physics studies --
are ideally suited to solve optimization problems in a binary format. While
binary representations can be often found for paradigmatic optimization
problems, these typically result in k-local higher-order unconstrained binary
optimization cost functions. In this work, we discuss the effects of locality
reduction needed for the majority of the currently available quantum and
quantum-inspired solvers that can only accommodate 2-local (quadratic) cost
functions. General locality reduction approaches require the introduction of
ancillary variables which cause an overhead over the native problem. Using a
parallel tempering Monte Carlo solver on Microsoft Azure Quantum, as well as
k-local binary problems with planted solutions, we show that post reduction to
a corresponding 2-local representation the problems become considerably harder
to solve. We further quantify the increase in computational hardness introduced
by the reduction algorithm by measuring the variation of number of variables,
statistics of the coefficient values, and the population annealing entropic
family size. Our results demonstrate the importance of avoiding locality

community due to the lack of gold standard labelled datasets. This paper
presents a new dataset of 30,000 user comments tagged by crowd sourcing and
varified by experts. All the comments are collected from YouTube and Facebook
comment section and classified into seven categories: sports, entertainment,
religion, politics, crime, celebrity and TikTok & meme. A total of 50
annotators annotated each comment three times and the majority vote was taken
as the final annotation. Nevertheless, we have conducted base line experiments
and several deep learning models along with extensive pre-trained Bengali word

shift-invariant planar graphs whose maximum degree is three. We prove
delocalisation for models induced by convex nearest-neighbour potentials, under
the condition that each potential function is an excited potential, that is, a
convex symmetric potential function $V$ with the property that $V(\pm1)\leq
V(0)+\log2$. Examples of such models include the discrete Gaussian and
solid-on-solid models at inverse temperature $\beta\leq\log2$, as well as the
uniformly random $K$-Lipschitz function for fixed $K\in\mathbb N$. In fact,
$\beta V$ is an excited potential for any convex symmetric potential function
$V$ whenever $\beta$ is sufficiently small. To arrive at the result, we develop
a new technique for symmetry breaking, and then study the geometric percolation
properties of sets of the form $\{\varphi\geq a\}$ and $\{\varphi\leq a\}$,
where $\varphi$ is the random height function and $a$ a constant. Along the
same lines, we derive delocalisation for models induced by convex symmetric
nearest-neighbour potentials which force the parity of the height of
neighbouring vertices to be distinct. This includes models of uniformly random
graph homomorphisms on the honeycomb lattice and the truncated square tiling,
as well as on the same graphs with each edge replaced by $N$ edges linked in
series. The latter resembles cable-graph constructions which appear in the
analysis of the Gaussian free field.

  Using Reachability Analysis","Submitted to Navigation: Journal of the Institute of Navigation",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trajectory planning under uncertainty is an active research topic. Previous
works predict state and state estimation uncertainties along trajectories to
check for collision safety. They assume either stochastic or bounded sensing
uncertainties. However, GNSS pseudoranges are typically modeled to contain
stochastic uncertainties with additional biases in urban environments. Thus,
given bounds for the bias, the planner needs to account for both stochastic and
bounded sensing uncertainties. In our prior work we presented a reachability
analysis to predict state and state estimation uncertainties under stochastic
and bounded uncertainties. However, we ignored the correlation between these
uncertainties, leading to an imperfect approximation of the state uncertainty.
In this paper we improve our reachability analysis by predicting state
uncertainty as a function of independent quantities. We design a metric for the
predicted uncertainty to compare candidate trajectories during planning.
Finally, we validate the planner for GNSS-based urban navigation of fixed-wing
UAS.

shown its important role in a variety of image recognition tasks. Besides, RNN
plays an essential role in the image captioning task. We introduce a
AutoCaption method to better design the decoder module of the image captioning

We use the reinforcement learning method based on shared parameters for
automatic design the AutoRNN efficiently. The search space of the AutoCaption

detected electrons per output Analogue to Digital Unit (ADU). This is normally
determined by finding the statistical variances from a series of flat-field
exposures with nearly constant levels over substantial areas, and making use of
the fact that photon (Poisson) noise has variance equal to the mean. However,
when a CCD has been installed in a spectroscopic instrument fed by numerous
optical fibres, or with an echelle format, it is no longer possible to obtain
illumination that is constant over large areas. Instead of making do with
selected small areas, it is shown here that the wide variation of signal level
in a spectroscopic `flat-field' can be used to obtain accurate values of the
CCD gain, needing only a matched pair of exposures (that differ in their
realisation of the noise). Once the gain is known, the CCD readout noise (in
electrons) is easily found from a pair of bias frames. Spatial stability of the

extremely abundant and occurs at low optical depth. This means that mapping
temperature and methane abundance as a function of position and depth will
inform us on how convection organizes in an atmosphere with no surface and
condensates that are heavier than the surrounding air, a general feature of
giant planets. Owing to the spatial and temporal variability of these

atmospheric profile to lift ambiguities inherent to remote observations. It
would also measure the abundances of noble gases which can be used to
reconstruct the history of planet formation in the Solar System. Finally,
mapping the planets' gravity and magnetic fields will be essential to constrain

unilaterally enforce linear relations between expected payoffs of players.
Recently, the concept of zero-determinant strategies was extended to the class
of memory-$n$ strategies with $n\geq 1$, which enables more complicated control
of payoffs by one player. However, what we can do by memory-$n$
zero-determinant strategies is still not clear. Here, we show that memory-$n$
zero-determinant strategies in repeated games can be used to control
conditional expectations of payoffs. Equivalently, they can be used to control
expected payoffs in biased ensembles, where a history of action profiles with
large value of bias function is more weighted. Controlling conditional
expectations of payoffs is useful for strengthening zero-determinant
strategies, because players can choose conditions in such a way that only
unfavorable action profiles to one player are contained in the conditions. We
provide several examples of memory-$n$ zero-determinant strategies in the
repeated prisoner's dilemma game. We also explain that a deformed version of
zero-determinant strategies is easily extended to the memory-$n$ case.

exciting opportunity to study black hole physics. Since a black hole's event
horizon absorbs all electromagnetic waves, it is difficult to actively probe
the horizon's existence. However, with the help of a family of extremely
compact, horizon-less objects, named gravastars"", whose external space-times
nearly identical to those of black holes, one can test the absence of event
horizons: absences of additional features that arise due to the existence of
the gravastar, or its surface, can be used as quantitative evidence for black
holes. We apply Gralla et al.'s approach to studying black hole images to study
the images of two types of gravastars: transparent ones and reflective ones. In
both cases, the transmission of rays through gravastars, or their reflections
on their surfaces, lead to more rings in their images. For simple emission
models, where the redshifted emissivity of the disk is peaked at a particular
radius r-peak, the position of a series of rings can be related in a simple
manner to light ray propagation: a ring shows up around impact parameter b
whenever rays incident from infinity at b intersects the disk at r-peak. We
show that additional rings will appear in the images of transparent and
reflective gravastars. In particular, one of the additional rings for the
reflective gravastar is due to the prompt reflection of light on the gravastar
surface and appears to be well separated from the others. This can be a robust
feature, which may be reliably used to constrain the reflectivity of the black
hole's horizon.

counterfactual definiteness is an unnecessary and inconsistent assumption.
Counterfactual definiteness is not equivalent to realism or determinism neither

counterfactual reasoning. Being incompatible with falsifiability, it
constitutes an unjustified assumption that goes against the scientific method's
rigor. Correct formulations of the Bell theorem's bases show it is absent
either as a fundamental hypothesis or as a consequence of something else. Most
importantly, we present a coherent Bell inequality derivation carefully devised
to show explicitly and convincingly the absence of incompatible experiments or
counterfactual reasoning. Thus, even admitting that counterfactual definiteness
could be a consistent assumption, the necessary conclusion is that it is
irrelevant for the inequality formulation and can be safely ignored when
discussing Bell's inequality philosophical and physical implications.

cells and tissues. Spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) is a highly
sensitive QPI method, due to its partially coherent illumination and common
path interferometry geometry. However, its acquisition rate is limited because
of the four-frame phase-shifting scheme. On the other hand, off-axis methods
like diffraction phase microscopy (DPM), allows for single-shot QPI. However,
the laser-based DPM system is plagued by spatial noise due to speckles and
multiple reflections. In a parallel development, deep learning was proven
valuable in the field of bioimaging, especially due to its ability to translate
one form of contrast into another. Here, we propose using deep learning to
produce synthetic, SLIM-quality, high-sensitivity phase maps from DPM,
single-shot images as input. We used an inverted microscope with its two ports
connected to the DPM and SLIM modules, such that we have access to the two
types of images on the same field of view. We constructed a deep learning model
based on U-net and trained on over 1,000 pairs of DPM and SLIM images. The
model learned to remove the speckles in laser DPM and overcame the background
phase noise in both the test set and new data. Furthermore, we implemented the
neural network inference into the live acquisition software, which now allows a
DPM user to observe in real-time an extremely low-noise phase image. We
demonstrated this principle of computational interference microscopy (CIM)
imaging using blood smears, as they contain both erythrocytes and leukocytes,
in static and dynamic conditions.

from the literature to very different real-life sector coupled energy systems.
We systematically compare the aggregation techniques with respect to solution
quality and simulation time. Furthermore, we propose two new clustering
approaches with promising results. We show that the aggregation techniques
result in consistent solution time savings between 75% and 90%. Also, the
quality of the aggregated solutions is generally very good. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to analyze and conclude that a weighted
representation of clusters is beneficial. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to recommend a clustering technique with good
performance across very different energy systems: the k-means with Euclidean
distance measure, clustering days and with weighted selection, where the
median, maximum and minimum elements from clusters are selected. A deeper
analysis of the results reveal that the aggregation techniques excel when the
investment decisions correlate well with the overall behavior of the energy
system. We propose future research directions to remedy when this is not the

on humanities and social sciences, which are usually considered softer and
further away from abstractions and (abstract) machines. Specifically, we focus
on conceptual modeling as a software engineering tool (e.g., UML) in the area
of stories and movie scripts. Researchers in the humanities and social sciences
might not use the same degree of formalization that engineers do, but they
still find conceptual modeling useful. Current modeling techniques (e.g., UML)
fail in this task because they are geared toward the creation of software
systems. Similar Conceptual Modeling Language (e.g., ConML) has been proposed
with the humanities and social sciences in mind and, as claimed, can be used to
model anything. This study is a venture in this direction, where a software
modeling technique, Thinging Machine (TM), is applied to movie scripts and
stories. The paper presents a novel approach to developing diagrammatic
static/dynamic models of movie scripts and stories. The TM model diagram serves
as a neutral and independent representation for narrative discourse and can be
used as a communication instrument among participants. The examples presented

illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7%

clusters and then representing the video by aggregating residuals of frames
with respect to the mean of each cluster. Since some clusters may see very
little video-specific data, these features can be noisy. In this paper, we
propose a new cluster-and-aggregate method which we call smoothed Gaussian

which we call deep smoothed Gaussian mixture model (DSGMM). SGMM represents
each video by the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained for that

sensitive to small number of training samples. We show, through extensive
experiments on the YouTube-8M classification task, that SGMM/DSGMM is
consistently better than VLAD/NetVLAD by a small but statistically significant
margin. We also show results using a dataset created at LinkedIn to predict if

community in the past few years. An adverse sample is an artificial data point
coming from an imperceptible modification of a sample point aiming at
misleading. Surprisingly, in financial research, little has been done in
relation to this topic from a concrete trading point of view. We show that
those adversarial samples can be implemented in a trading environment and have
a negative impact on certain market participants. This could have far reaching
implications for financial markets either from a trading or a regulatory point
of view.

tracking with Algorithm X for optimal association search was developed using
Python. The code is intended for scientific applications that do not require
online processing. Directed graph framework is used and multiple scans with
progressively increasing time window width are used for edge construction for
maximum likelihood trajectories. The current version of the code was developed
for applications in multiphase hydrodynamics, e.g. bubble and particle
tracking, and is capable of resolving object motion, merges and splits.
Feasible object associations and trajectory graph edge likelihoods are
determined using weak mass and momentum conservation laws translated to
statistical functions for object properties. The code is compatible with
n-dimensional motion with arbitrarily many tracked object properties. This
framework is easily extendable beyond the present application by replacing the
currently used heuristics with ones more appropriate for the problem at hand.
The code is open-source and will be continuously developed further.

control and management planes from data plane of the forwarding devices by
implementing both the control and management planes at logically centralized
entity, called controller. This helps to make simple and easy both the network
control and management. Failure of links occurs frequently in a computer
network. To deal with the link failures, the existing approaches computes and
installs multiple paths for a flow at the switches in SDN without considering
the reliability value of the primary path. This incurs extra computation to
compute multiple paths, and both increased computation time and traffic to
install extra flow rules in the network. In this research work we propose a new
approach that calculates the link reliability and then installs the number of
multiple paths based on the reliability value of the primary path. More
specifically, if a primary path has higher reliability then a smaller number of
alternative paths should be installed. This shall decrease the path
computational time and flow rule installation load at controller. Resultantly
there shall be less flow rule entries in switch flow table which in turn will
avoid the overflow of the flow table. Through simulation results, our proposed
approach performs better as compared to the existing approach in term of
computational overhead at controller, end-to-end delay for packet deliver and
the traffic overhead for flow rule installation.
