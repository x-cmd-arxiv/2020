hide or reveal its presence depending on the waveform of the
received/transmitted signal. This unconventional behavior is achieved through
the use of a novel waveform-selective cloaking metasurface exploiting a
meander-like unit cell loaded with a lumped-element circuit capable to engineer
the scattering of the antenna depending on the waveform of the impinging
signal. Due to the time-domain response of the lumped-element circuit, the
antenna is able switching its scattering behavior when interacts with either a
pulsed wave (PW) or a continuous wave (CW) signal. The proposed configuration
paves the way to a new generation of cloaking devices for intelligent antenna
systems, extending the concept of antenna as a device capable to sense the
external environment and change its electromagnetic behavior accordingly.

derive ""bias-aware"" confidence intervals (CIs) based on these estimators, which
take into account possible bias when forming the critical value. We show that
these estimators and CIs are near-optimal in finite samples for mean squared

provide conditions for asymptotic validity with unknown and possibly

high-dimensional asymptotics that allow the number of regressors to increase
more quickly than the number of observations.

The collimation of relativistic jets in galaxies is a poorly understood
process. Detailed radio studies of the jet collimation region have been
performed so far in few individual objects, providing important constraints for
jet formation models. However, the extent of the collimation zone as well as
the nature of the external medium possibly confining the jet are still debated.
Methods. In this article we present a multi-frequency and multi-scale analysis
of the radio galaxy NGC 315, including the use of mm-VLBI data up to 86 GHz,
aimed at revealing the evolution of the jet collimation profile. We then
consider results from the literature to compare the jet expansion profile in a
sample of 27 low-redshift sources, mainly comprising radio galaxies and BL
Lacs, classified based on the accretion properties as low-excitation (LEG) and
high-excitation (HEG) galaxies. Results.The jet collimation in NGC 315 is
completed on sub-parsec scales. A transition from a parabolic to conical jet
shape is detected at $z_{t}=0.58\pm0.28$ parsecs or ${\sim}5\times 10^3$
Schwarzschild radii ($R_{S}$) from the central engine, a distance which is much
smaller than the Bondi radius, $r_{B}{\sim}92$ $\rm pc$, estimated based on
X-ray data. The jet in this and in few other LEGs in our sample may be
initially confined by a thick disk extending out to ${\sim}10^3$-$10^4$
$R_{S}$. A comparison between the mass-scaled jet expansion profiles of all
sources indicates that jets in HEGs are surrounded by thicker disk-launched
sheaths and collimate on larger scales with respect to jets in LEGs. These
results suggest that disk winds play an important role in the jet collimation
mechanism, particularly in high-luminosity sources. The impact of winds for the
origin of the FRI/FRII dichotomy in radio galaxies is also discussed.

comprehensively with particular focus on their coupling. Finally, three

main novelty is the extension of existing contact formulations to chemical
contact, the presented formulation also sheds new light on thermo-mechanical

by optimizing the transmission time-on-air allocation, the energy harvesting
time allocation and the power allocation; subject to a maximum transmit power

application at finite temperatures inaccurate. In this work, we formulate a
general functional renormalization group approach based on Majorana fermions to
overcome these difficulties. We, particularly, implement spin operators via an
$SO(3)$ symmetric Majorana representation which does not introduce any
unphysical states and, hence, remains applicable to quantum spin models at
finite temperatures. We apply this scheme, dubbed pseudo Majorana functional
renormalization group (PMFRG) method, to frustrated Heisenberg models on small
spin clusters as well as square and triangular lattices. Computing the finite
temperature behavior of spin correlations and thermodynamic quantities such as
free energy and heat capacity, we find good agreement with exact
diagonalization and the high-temperature series expansion down to moderate
temperatures. We, particularly, observe a significantly enhanced accuracy of
the PMFRG compared to the PFFRG at finite temperatures. More generally, we
conclude that the development of functional renormalization group approaches
with Majorana fermions considerably extends the scope of applicability of such
methods.

  welcome!",,,,"math.AG math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the Hadamard topology on the Witt ring of rational functions,
giving a simultaneous refinement of the weight and point-counting topologies.
Zeta functions of algebraic varieties over finite fields are elements of the
rational Witt ring, and the Hadamard topology allows for a conjectural
unification of results in arithmetic and motivic statistics: The completion of
the Witt ring for the Hadamard topology can be identified with a space of
meromorphic functions which we call Hadamard functions, and we make the
meta-conjecture that any ""natural"" sequence of zeta functions which converges
to a Hadamard function in both the weight and point-counting topologies
converges also in the Hadamard topology. For statistics arising from Bertini
problems, zero-cycles or the Batyrev-Manin conjecture, this yields an explicit
conjectural unification of existing results in motivic and arithmetic
statistics that were previously connected only by analogy. As evidence for our
conjectures, we show that Hadamard convergence holds for many natural
statistics arising from zero-cycles, as well as for the motivic height zeta
function associated to the motivic Batyrev-Manin problem for split toric
varieties.

tensor models. Specifically, in the Tucker low-rank tensor PCA or regression
model, provided with any estimates achieving some attainable error rate, we
develop the data-driven confidence regions for the singular subspace of the
parameter tensor based on the asymptotic distribution of an updated estimate by
two-iteration alternating minimization. The asymptotic distributions are
established under some essential conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio (in
PCA model) or sample size (in regression model). If the parameter tensor is
further orthogonally decomposable, we develop the methods and non-asymptotic
theory for inference on each individual singular vector. For the rank-one
tensor PCA model, we establish the asymptotic distribution for general linear
forms of principal components and confidence interval for each entry of the
parameter tensor. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to corroborate
our theoretical discoveries.
  In all these models, we observe that different from many matrix/vector
settings in existing work, debiasing is not required to establish the
asymptotic distribution of estimates or to make statistical inference on
low-rank tensors. In fact, due to the widely observed
statistical-computational-gap for low-rank tensor estimation, one usually
requires stronger conditions than the statistical (or information-theoretic)
limit to ensure the computationally feasible estimation is achievable.
Surprisingly, such conditions ``incidentally"" render a feasible low-rank tensor
inference without debiasing.

important challenges in the field of robust Model Predictive Control (MPC). To
address the challenge, we propose a flexible robust MPC scheme by synergizing
the multi-stage and tube-based MPC approaches. The key idea is to exploit the
non-conservatism of the multi-stage MPC and the simplicity of the tube-based
MPC. The proposed scheme provides two options for the user to determine the
trade-off depending on the application: the choice of the robust horizon and
the classification of the uncertainties. Beyond the robust horizon, the
branching of the scenario-tree employed in multi-stage MPC is avoided with the
help of tubes. The growth of the problem size with respect to the number of
uncertainties is reduced by handling \emph{small} uncertainties via an
invariant tube that can be computed offline. This results in linear growth of
the problem size beyond the robust horizon and no growth of the problem size
concerning small magnitude uncertainties. The proposed approach helps to
achieve a desired trade-off between optimality and complexity compared to
existing robust MPC approaches. We show that the proposed approach is robustly
asymptotically stable. Its advantages are demonstrated for a CSTR example.

protoplanetary disks (PPDs) have shorter lifetimes for heavier host stars.
Since PPDs around high-mass stars are irradiated by strong ultra-violet
radiation, photoevaporation may provide an explanation for the observed trend.
We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations of photoevaporation of PPDs for
a wide range of host star mass of $M_* =0.5$-$7.0 M_{\odot}$. We derive disk
mass-loss rate $\dot{M}$, which has strong stellar dependence as $\dot{M}
\approx 7.30\times10^{-9}(M_{*}/M_{\odot})^{2}M_{\odot}\rm{yr}^{-1}$. The
absolute value of $\dot{M}$ scales with the adopted far-ultraviolet and X-ray
luminosities. We derive the surface mass-loss rates and provide polynomial
function fits to them. We also develop a semi-analytic model that well
reproduces the derived mass-loss rates. The estimated inner disk lifetime
decreases as the host star mass increases, in agreement with the observational
trend. We thus argue that photoevaporation is a major physical mechanism for
PPD dispersal for a wide range of the stellar mass and can account for the
observed stellar mass dependence of the inner disk lifetime.

Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have been developed for both
problems, and tested numerically with classical resources either by emulation
of Pasqal's Rydberg atom based quantum device or using Atos Quantum Learning
Machine. In both cases, quantum algorithms exhibit the same approximation
ratios than conventional approximation algorithms, or improve them. These are
very encouraging results, although still for instances of limited size as
allowed by studies on classical computing resources. The next step will be to
confirm them on larger instances, on actual devices, and for more complex
versions of the problems addressed.

the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and
the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were
known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different
notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric
uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving
upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable
for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER
by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the
quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the
rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under
realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the
generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.
The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a
parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of
the model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in
model parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction
uncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting
with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along
the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning

be generated radiatively in such a case, an example of which is a two-Higgs

radiatively enhance the strength of the $H^+ W^- Z$ interaction. We compute the

shows a spectacular and complex distribution of emission across the nebula,
with multiple structures such as filaments, shells, and fronts across a wide
range of size scales. The ionization fronts have advanced far into the southern

more accurate than single models this property naturally transfers to TNN
regression. We show that TNNs are able to compete or yield more accurate

consists of a single pillar with a half-cylinder cross-section which partially
obstructs a flow channel so that initially centred, propagating capsules deform
and circumvent the obstacle into an expanding channel (or diffuser). We perform
experiments with millimetric capsules of fixed size which indicate that the
deviation of the capsule in the diffuser varies monotonically with a capillary
number - the ratio of viscous to elastic stresses - where the elastic stresses
are measured independently to include the effects of pre-inflation, membrane
thickness and material properties. We find that soft capsules with resistance
to deformation differing by a factor of 1.5 can be reliably separated in the
diffuser but that experimental variability increases significantly with capsule
stiffness. We extend the study to populations of microcapsules with size
polydispersity. We find that the combined effects of increasing capsule
deformability and relative constriction of the device with increasing capsule
size enable the tuning of the imposed flow so that capsules can be separated

recent works [1], [2], [3] explored the alternative to sequentially stacking
decision tree/random forest building blocks in a purely feed-forward way, with
no need of back propagation. Since decision trees enjoy inherent reasoning
transparency, such deep forest models can also facilitate the understanding of
the internaldecision making process. This paper further extends the deep forest
idea in several important aspects. Firstly, we employ a probabilistic tree
whose nodes make probabilistic routing decisions, a.k.a., soft routing, rather
than hard binary decisions.Besides enhancing the flexibility, it also enables
non-greedy optimization for each tree. Second, we propose an innovative
topology learning strategy: every node in the ree now maintains a new learnable
hyperparameter indicating the probability that it will be a leaf node. In that
way, the tree will jointly optimize both its parameters and the tree topology
during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that our
empowered deep forests can achieve better or comparable performance than

water distribution systems (WDS), in this research, a control algorithm is
proposed for our previously designed robot [4]. Our size adaptable robot has an
under-actuated modular design that can be used for both leak detection and
quality monitoring. First, nonlinear dynamical governing equations of the robot
are derived with the definition of two perpendicular planes, and two sets of
states are defined for the robot for stabilization and mobilization. For
stabilization, we calculated the auxiliary system matrices and designed a
stabilizer controller based on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller,
and combined it with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) based controller
for mobilization. The controller scheme is validated with simulation in MATLAB
in various operation conditions in three iterations. The simulation results
show that the controller can stabilize the robot inside the pipe by converging
the stabilizing states to zero and keeping them in zero with initial values
between -25 degree and +25 degree and tracking velocities of 10cm/s, 30cm/s,
and 50cm/s which makes the robot agile and dexterous for operation in
pipelines.

sophisticated ways to address ever more challenging and diverse sampling
problems. Its success stems from the flexibility brought by the fact that its
verification and sampling implementation rests on a local ``detailed balance''
condition, as opposed to a global condition in the form of a typically
intractable integral equation. While checking the local condition is routine in
the simplest scenarios, this proves much more difficult for complicated
applications involving auxiliary structures and variables. Our aim is to
develop a framework making establishing correctness of complex Markov chain
Monte Carlo kernels a purely mechanical or algebraic exercise, while making
communication of ideas simpler and unambiguous by allowing a stronger focus on
essential features -- a choice of embedding distribution, an involution and
occasionally an acceptance function -- rather than the induced, boilerplate
structure of the kernels that often tends to obscure what is important. This
framework can also be used to validate kernels that do not satisfy detailed
balance, i.e. which are not reversible, but a modified version thereof.

energy distribution (IED) control is critical for precise material
modification, especially in atomic-level technologies such as atomic layer
etching. Since this control should be done in real time, it requires real-time
feedback using fast process sensors. In the general case of an industrial
plasma reactor, when direct IED measurement is not possible, the IED can be
estimated using the concept of a virtual IED sensor. In this paper, a similar
virtual IED sensor is considered using an asymmetric dual-frequency (df) rf CCP
discharge as an example. It is based on a fast calculation method of the IED at
an rf-biased electrode. This approach uses the experimentally measured sheath
voltage waveform and plasma density (or ion flux) as input data, and also
includes Monte-Carlo simulation of ion motion in the sheath to take into
account the effect of ion-neutral collisions. To validate this approach,
experiments were carried out using various plasma diagnostics in several gases:
argon and xenon as examples of plasma with atomic ions and nitrogen as an
example of plasma with molecular ions. It is shown that in all cases it is
possible to obtain an adequate IED estimation, close to the experimental one,
in a reasonably short time (~ tens of seconds when using a modern PC). The
results obtained demonstrate the possibility of using a virtual IED sensor in
real plasma processing.

heavy-hitters problem. In this problem, there are many clients and a small set
of data-collection servers. Each client holds a private bitstring. The servers
want to recover the set of all popular strings, without learning anything else
about any client's string. A web-browser vendor, for instance, can use Poplar
to figure out which homepages are popular, without learning any user's
homepage. We also consider the simpler private subset-histogram problem, in
which the servers want to count how many clients hold strings in a particular
set without revealing this set to the clients.
  Poplar uses two data-collection servers and, in a protocol run, each client
send sends only a single message to the servers. Poplar protects client privacy
against arbitrary misbehavior by one of the servers and our approach requires
no public-key cryptography (except for secure channels), nor general-purpose
multiparty computation. Instead, we rely on incremental distributed point
functions, a new cryptographic tool that allows a client to succinctly
secret-share the labels on the nodes of an exponentially large binary tree,
provided that the tree has a single non-zero path. Along the way, we develop
new general tools for providing malicious security in applications of

wt. % of cationic surfactants that are deposited on textile fibers during the

topical formulations, the concentration of cationic surfactants is reduced by
half, this reduction being compensated by the addition of environment-friendly
polysaccharides. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and ellipsometry, the deposition of
formulations with or without polysaccharides on model cellulose substrates is
studied. We found that 180 nm long cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) deposited by
spin-coating on amorphous silicon dioxide or on quartz crystal sensors provide
a good model of cellulose surfaces. QCM-D results reveal strong electrostatic
interactions of the surfactant vesicles and polysaccharides with the CNC layer.
In the presence of polysaccharides, the adsorbed quantities are less (by 60%)
than the sum of the respective amounts of each component, the structure of the
interface being however more homogenous and rigid. This outcome suggests that
surface techniques coupled with CNC coated substrates are promising for
studying interactions of current formulations with cellulose surfaces.

(CC) interactions of the electron flavored neutrinos and antineutrinos as well

material such as lead with a relatively large neutron excess produces neutrons
dominantly through the CC interaction of the $\nu_e$s, whereas a material such
as iron with small neutron excess produces neutrons dominantly through the
combined NC interaction of all the six neutrino and antineutrino species. This
raises the interesting possibility of probing the fraction of mu- and tau
flavored neutrinos (which interact only through NC interaction) in the
supernova neutrino flux by means of simultaneous detection of a supernova in a

this paper, we focus on hate speech detection in multi-modal memes wherein
memes pose an interesting multi-modal fusion problem. We aim to solve the
Facebook Meme Challenge \cite{kiela2020hateful} which aims to solve a binary
classification problem of predicting whether a meme is hateful or not. A
crucial characteristic of the challenge is that it includes ""benign
confounders"" to counter the possibility of models exploiting unimodal priors.
The challenge states that the state-of-the-art models perform poorly compared
to humans. During the analysis of the dataset, we realized that majority of the
data points which are originally hateful are turned into benign just be
describing the image of the meme. Also, majority of the multi-modal baselines
give more preference to the hate speech (language modality). To tackle these
problems, we explore the visual modality using object detection and image
captioning models to fetch the ""actual caption"" and then combine it with the
multi-modal representation to perform binary classification. This approach
tackles the benign text confounders present in the dataset to improve the
performance. Another approach we experiment with is to improve the prediction
with sentiment analysis. Instead of only using multi-modal representations
obtained from pre-trained neural networks, we also include the unimodal
sentiment to enrich the features. We perform a detailed analysis of the above
two approaches, providing compelling reasons in favor of the methodologies

velocity mapping from multiple long-slit spectra with proper motion
measurements from multi-epoch imaging. We find that the nebula has five
distinct ejection axes. The first is the axis of the bipolar, wind-blown inner
shell, while the second is the axis of the lop-sided, elliptical, fainter, but
more massive intermediate shell. A further two axes are bipolar flows that form
the point symmetric, high-ionization outer lobes, all with inclinations close
to the plane of the sky. The final axis, which is inclined close to the line of
sight, traces collimated outflows of low-ionization knots. We detect major
changes in outflow directions during the planetary nebula phase, starting at or

majority of redshifted low-ionization knots have kinematic ages greater than
2000 years, whereas the majority of blueshifted knots have ages younger than

Probability density functions are computed from planes of the WMLES solutions

Sensitivity to SGS model is alleviated when the fraction of total wall stress

to automatically design industrial objects, such as beams, rudders or wings.
Topology optimization, as it is often called, computes the best configuration
of material over a 3D space, typically represented as a grid, in order to
satisfy or optimize physical parameters. Designers using these automated
systems often seek to understand the interaction of physical constraints with
the final design and its implications for other physical characteristics. Such
understanding is challenging because the space of designs is large and small
changes in parameters can result in radically different designs. We propose to
address these challenges using a visualization approach for exploring the space
of design solutions. The core of our novel approach is to summarize the space
(ensemble of solutions) by automatically selecting a set of examples and to
represent the complete set of solutions as combinations of these examples. The
representative examples create a meaningful parameterization of the design
space that can be explored using standard visualization techniques for
high-dimensional spaces. We present evaluations of our subset selection
technique and that the overall approach addresses the needs of expert

see in nature is probably one of the biggest open questions in science,
attracting attention from different fields, from Theoretical Ecology to
Mathematics and Physics. In this context, modeling the stable coexistence of
species competing for limited resources is a particularly challenging task.
From a mathematical point of view, coexistence in competitive dynamics can be
achieved when dominance among species forms intransitive loops. However, these
relationships usually lead to species' relative abundances neutrally cycling
without converging to a stable equilibrium. Although in recent years several
mechanisms have been proposed, models able to explain species coexistence in
competitive communities are still limited. Here we identify locality in the
interactions as one of the simplest mechanisms leading to stable species
coexistence. We consider a simplified ecosystem where individuals of each
species lay on a spatial network and interactions are possible only between
nodes within a certain distance. Varying such distance allows to interpolate
between local and global competition. Our results demonstrate, within the scope
of our model, that species coexist reaching a stable equilibrium when two
conditions are met: individuals are embedded in space and can only interact
with other individuals within a short distance. On the contrary, when one of
these ingredients is missing, large oscillations and neutral cycles emerge.

large-scale first principles simulations and capture effects of different

Hubbard U correction [npj Comput. Mater. 6, 180 (2020)]. To facilitate direct
comparison with ARPES results, we implemented a ""bulk unfolding"" scheme by
projecting the calculated band structure of a supercell surface slab model onto

significant band bending and produces an electron pocket, whereas oxidation of

based on tailored machine learning (ML) models, circumvents combinational logic
locking with high accuracy and is amongst the most potent attacks as it does
not require a functional IC acting as an oracle. In this work, we propose
UNSAIL, a logic locking technique that inserts key-gate structures with the
specific aim to confuse ML models like those used in SAIL. More specifically,
UNSAIL serves to prevent attacks seeking to resolve the structural
transformations of synthesis-induced obfuscation, which is an essential step
for logic locking. Our approach is generic; it can protect any local structure
of key-gates against such ML-based attacks in an oracle-less setting. We
develop a reference implementation for the SAIL attack and launch it on both
traditionally locked and UNSAIL-locked designs. In SAIL, a change-prediction
model is used to determine which key-gate structures to restore using a
reconstruction model. Our study on benchmarks ranging from the ISCAS-85 and
ITC-99 suites to the OpenRISC Reference Platform System-on-Chip (ORPSoC)
confirms that UNSAIL degrades the accuracy of the change-prediction model and
the reconstruction model by an average of 20.13 and 17 percentage points (pp)
respectively. When the aforementioned models are combined, which is the most
powerful scenario for SAIL, UNSAIL reduces the attack accuracy of SAIL by an
average of 11pp. We further demonstrate that UNSAIL thwarts other oracle-less
attacks, i.e., SWEEP and the redundancy attack, indicating the generic nature
and strength of our approach. Detailed layout-level evaluations illustrate that
UNSAIL incurs minimal area and power overheads of 0.26% and 0.61%,

Mathur-Mukhi-Sen (MMS) program, identifies a rational conformal field theory by
two numbers: $(n, l)$. $n$ is the number of characters of the rational
conformal field theory. The characters form linearly independent solutions to a
modular linear differential equation (which is also labelled by $(n, l)$); the
Wronskian index $l$ is a non-negative integer associated to the structure of
zeroes of the Wronskian.
  In this paper, we compute the $(n, l)$ values for three classes of well-known
CFTs viz. the WZW CFTs, the Virasoro minimal models and the $\mathcal{N} = 1$
super-Virasoro minimal models. For the latter two, we obtain exact formulae for
the Wronskian indices. For WZW CFTs, we get exact formulae for small ranks
(upto 2) and all levels and for all ranks and small levels (upto 2) and for the
rest we compute using a computer program. We find that any WZW CFT at level 1
has a vanishing Wronskian index as does the $\mathbf{\hat{A}_1}$ CFT at all
levels. We find intriguing coincidences such as: (i) for the same level CFTs
with $\mathbf{\hat{A}_2}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{G}_2}$ have the same $(n,l)$
values, (ii) for the same level CFTs with $\mathbf{\hat{B}_r}$ and
$\mathbf{\hat{D}_r}$ have the same $(n,l)$ values for all $r \geq 5$.
  Classifying all rational conformal field theories for a given $(n, l)$ is one
of the aims of the MMS program. We can use our computations to provide partial
classifications. For the famous $(2, 0)$ case, our partial classification turns
out to be the full classification (achieved by MMS three decades ago). For the
$(3, 0)$ case, our partial classification includes two infinite series of CFTs

associated, yet the extent to which economic prosperity (GDP per capita) causes
improved health remains disputed. The purpose of this article is to analyze the
impact of sovereign debt crises (SDC) on child mortality, using a sample of 57
low- and middle-income countries surveyed by the Demographic and Health Survey
between the years 1990 and 2015. These surveys supply 229 household data and
containing about 3 million childbirth history records. This focus on SDC
instead of GDP provides a quasi-experimental moment in which the influence of
unobserved confounding is less than a moment analyzing the normal fluctuations
of GDP. This study measures child mortality at six thresholds: neonatal,
under-one (infant), under-two, under-three, under-four, and under-five
mortality. Using a machine-learning (ML) model for causal inference, this study
finds that while an SDC causes an adverse yet statistically insignificant
effect on neonatal mortality, all other child mortality group samples are
adversely affected between a probability of 0.12 to 0.14 (all statistically
significant at the 95-percent threshold). Through this ML, this study also
finds that the most important treatment heterogeneity moderator, in the entire
adjustment set, is whether a child is born in a low-income country.

reuse in the target domain of any form of source policy, including classical

attains optimality under suitable theoretical conditions, and (3) guarantees
improvement over the source policy in the target MDP. These are achieved by
packaging the source policy as a black-box option in the target MDP and
providing a theoretically grounded way to learn the option's initiation set

the black-box option where it is already optimal. We show that these two

performs excellently in sparse reward problems given (sub-)optimal source

stochastic optimization problems. A majority of existing works assume no

stochastic optimization problems with expectation constraints. For these
problems, it is often extremely expensive to perform projection onto the
feasible set. Several SGMs in the literature can be applied to solve the
expectation-constrained stochastic problems. We propose a novel primal-dual
type SGM based on the Lagrangian function. Different from existing methods, our
method incorporates an adaptiveness technique to speed up convergence. At each
iteration, our method inquires an unbiased stochastic subgradient of the
Lagrangian function, and then it renews the primal variables by an adaptive-SGM
update and the dual variables by a vanilla-SGM update. We show that the
proposed method has a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ in terms of the
objective error and the constraint violation. Although the convergence rate is
the same as those of existing SGMs, we observe its significantly faster
convergence than an existing non-adaptive primal-dual SGM and a primal SGM on
solving the Neyman-Pearson classification and quadratically constrained
quadratic programs. Furthermore, we modify the proposed method to solve
convex-concave stochastic minimax problems, for which we perform adaptive-SGM
updates to both primal and dual variables. A convergence rate of
$O(1/\sqrt{k})$ is also established to the modified method for solving minimax

were postponed and eventually made up during the summer months of 2020.
Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare
the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games,
played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has
used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential
changes to the home advantage. But because soccer outcomes are non-linear, we
argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate. We
begin by using simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression reduces
absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of
soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85 percent. Next, with
data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models
estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans.
In contrast to current research that overwhelmingly suggests a drop in the home
advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a
decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen. Altogether, this
suggests a more complex causal mechanism for the impact of fans on sporting
events.

type of classification error, say the type I error. The cost-sensitive paradigm
is widely used and has straightforward implementations that do not require
sample splitting; however, it demands an explicit specification of the costs of
the type I and II errors, and an open question is what specification can
guarantee a high-probability control on the population type I error. In
contrast, the Neyman-Pearson paradigm can train classifiers to achieve a
high-probability control of the population type I error, but it relies on
sample splitting that reduces the effective training sample size. Since the two
paradigms have complementary strengths, it is reasonable to combine their
strengths for classifier construction. In this work, we for the first time
study the methodological connections between the two paradigms, and we develop
the TUBE-CS algorithm to bridge the two paradigms from the perspective of

results suggest that performance depends on the shape of the statistical
distribution of the coordinates but not necessarily on its variance
corroborated by the cases of uniform and normal distributions. On the other
hand, a study with different power laws (different decay exponents) for the
coordinates always produces different performances. We show that the
performance of the simulated annealing, even in its best version, is not
improved when the distribution of the coordinates does not have the first
moment. However, surprisingly, we still observe improvements in situations
where the second moment is not defined but not where the first one is not

anomaly detection approach (Deep Fair SVDD) and train it using an adversarial
network to de-correlate the relationships between the sensitive attributes and
the learned representations. This differs from how fairness is typically added
namely as a regularizer or a constraint. Further, we propose two effective
fairness measures and empirically demonstrate that existing deep anomaly
detection methods are unfair. We show that our proposed approach can remove the
unfairness largely with minimal loss on the anomaly detection performance.
Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to show the strength and limitations of
our proposed model, including parameter analysis, feature visualization, and
run-time analysis.

situations of crises by investigating a policy U-turn of a major Austrian
right-wing party (FPOE) during the Covid-19 pandemic. My analysis suggests the
existence of both i) a ""Downsian"" effect, which causes voters to adapt their
party preferences based on policy congruence and ii) a ""party identification""
effect, which causes partisans to realign their policy preferences based on
""their"" party's platform. Specifically, I use individual-level panel data to
show that i) ""corona skeptical"" voters who did not vote for the FPOE in the
pre-Covid-19 elections of 2019 were more likely to vote for the party after it
embraced ""corona populism"", and ii) beliefs of respondents who declared that
they voted for the FPOE in 2019 diverged from the rest of the population in
three out of four health-dimensions only after the turn, causing them to
underestimate the threat posed by Covid-19 compared to the rest of the
population. Using aggregate-level panel data, I study whether the turn has
produced significant behavioral differences which could be observed in terms of
reported cases and deaths per capita. Paradoxically, after the turn the FPOE
vote share is significantly positively correlated with deaths per capita, but
not with the reported number of infections. I hypothesize that this due to a
self-selection bias in testing, which causes a correlation between the number
of ""corona skeptics"" and the share of unreported cases after the turn. I find
empirical support for this hypothesis in individual-level data from a Covid-19
prevalence study that involves information about participants' true vs.
reported infection status. I finally study a simple heterogeneous mixing
epidemiological model and show that a testing bias can indeed explain the
apparent paradox of an increase in deaths without an increase in reported

empirically validate that K-matrices can be automatically learned within
end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures, in order to improve
model quality. For example, replacing channel shuffles in ShuffleNet improves
classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 5%. K-matrices can also simplify
hand-engineered pipelines -- we replace filter bank feature computation in
speech data preprocessing with a learnable kaleidoscope layer, resulting in
only 0.4% loss in accuracy on the TIMIT speech recognition task. In addition,
K-matrices can capture latent structure in models: for a challenging permuted
image classification task, a K-matrix based representation of permutations is
able to learn the right latent structure and improves accuracy of a downstream
convolutional model by over 9%. We provide a practically efficient

modelling the multi-wavelength emission of MAXI J1836-194 during its 2011

a robust joint-fitting method to better isolate the jet's physical properties.
Our results demonstrate that the jet base can produce power-law hard X-ray

that the temperatures of the emitting electrons are sub-relativistic. Because
of energetic considerations, our model favours mildly pair-loaded jets carrying

each domain. We further validate this approach with real-time experiments on a

unable to reach, spontaneously, the ferroelectric (FE) ground state at low
temperature where a residual Pauling entropy persists. Upon light doping with
KOH at low temperature, the transition to FE ice takes place, but its
microscopic mechanism still needs clarification. We introduce a lattice model
based on dipolar interactions plus a competing, frustrating term that enforces
the ice rule (IR). In the absence of IR-breaking defects, standard Monte Carlo
(MC) simulation leaves this ice model stuck in a state of disordered proton
ring configurations with the correct Pauling entropy. A replica exchange
accelerated MC sampling strategy succeeds, without open path moves, interfaces,
or off-lattice configurations, in equilibrating this defect-free ice, reaching
its low-temperature FE order through a well-defined first-order phase
transition. When proton vacancies mimicking the KOH impurities are planted into
the IR-conserving lattice, they enable standard MC simulation to work,
revealing the kinetics of evolution of ice from proton disorder to partial FE
order below the transition temperature. Replacing ordinary nucleation, each
impurity opens up a proton ring generating a linear string, an actual FE
hydrogen bond wire that expands with time. Reminiscent of those described for
spin ice, these impurity-induced strings are proposed to exist in doped water
ice too, where IRs are even stronger. The emerging mechanism yields a
dependence of the long-time FE order fraction upon dopant concentration, and
upon quenching temperature, that compares favorably with that known in

evaporate via Hawking radiation (HR) and produce all the particles in a given
theory regardless of their other interactions. If the right handed (RH)
neutrinos are produced from PBH evaporation, successful baryogenesis via
leptogenesis predicts mass scale of RH neutrinos as well as black holes. We
show that, given the lepton number violation (generation of RH neutrino masses)
in the theory is a consequence of a gauged $U(1)$ breaking which is then
followed by the formation of PBHs, a network of cosmic strings naturally gives
rise to strong stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at the sensitivity
level of pulsar timing arrays (PTA) and LIGO5. Besides, due to a transient
period of black hole domination in the early universe, for which baryon
asymmetry is independent of initial PBH density, a break in the GW spectra
occurs around MHz frequency. Therefore, to observe the break along with the
usual GW signal by the emission of gravitons via HR, GW detectors at higher
frequencies are called for. The recent finding by the NANOGrav PTA of a
stochastic common spectrum process (interpreted as GWs) across many pulsars is
in tension with PBH baryogenesis for large cosmic string loops ($\alpha\simeq
0.1$).

However, the features selected are dependant on the training data, and their

if used for feature ranking, that degrades the model interpretability and
extension. In this study, an intuitive idea is put at the end of multiple times
of data splitting and elastic net based feature selection. It concerns the
frequency of selected features and uses the frequency as an indicator of
feature importance. After features are sorted according to their frequency,
linear support vector machine performs the classification in an incremental
manner. At last, a compact subset of discriminative features is selected by
comparing the prediction performance. Experimental results on breast cancer
data sets (BCDR-F03, WDBC, GSE 10810, and GSE 15852) suggest that the proposed

consistent selection of fewer features. How to further enhance its consistency
on high-dimension small-sample-size data sets should be paid more attention in

transferred to the Joule heating process in the CS. In the other configuration,
we observe that negative energy is dissipated in the CS, which is usually
observed in magnetospheres on rotating black holes. This means that energy is
extracted simultaneously from the central star and the CS to power the output
Poynting flux at infinity. We interpret the extraction of energy from the CS as
that thermal energy of charged particles in the CS is transferred to the
ordered kinetic energy of these particles drifting in the force-free (FF)
electromagnetic fields. Hence, the CS is like an ``air conditioner"" in the sky,
which can heat up or cool down, depending on the configurations.

without the equivalence principle the looped quantum evolution cannot be

principle is formulated in terms of the gauge transformations and is analyzed
for particles acquiring an appropriate phases associated with the actions over

equivalence principle. This proves importance of the quantized versions of this
fundamental gravitational principle for quantum information processing.

immediate vicinity of the resonance poles. It naturally has a zero in the
low-energy region, analogous to the Ramsauer-Townsend effect. For a broad
resonance, the leading-order amplitude is nonperturbative almost everywhere in
the regime of validity of the EFT. We regain the results of an EFT without the

large scattering length and effective range. We also consider an additional
fine tuning leading to a low-energy amplitude zero even for a broad resonance.
We show that in all cases the requirement of renormalizability when the

half of the complex momentum plane, as expected by other arguments. The
systematic character of the EFT expansion is exemplified with a toy model

resolved is what control should be used, with the two candidates being the
congestion window and the pacing rate. BBR is a new delay based congestion
control algorithm that uses a pacing rate as its primary control and the

realism, where for spacelike separated measurements the assumption of
macroscopic noninvasive measurability is justified by that of macroscopic
locality. We give a mapping between the Bell and Leggett-Garg experiments for
microscopic qubits based on spin $1/2$ eigenstates and gedanken experiments for
macroscopic qubits based on two macroscopically distinct coherent states (cat
states). In this mapping, the unitary rotation of the Stern-Gerlach analyzer is
realized by an interaction $H=\Omega\hat{n}^{4}$ where $\hat{n}$ is the number
of quanta. By adjusting the time of interaction, one alters the measurement
setting. We thus predict violations of Leggett-Garg and Bell inequalities in a
macroscopic regime where coarse-grained measurements $\hat{M}$ need only
discriminate between two macroscopically distinct coherent states. To interpret
the violations, we distinguish between subtly different definitions of
macroscopic realism. Deterministic macroscopic local realism (dMR) assumes a
definite outcome for the measurement $\hat{M}$ prior to the unitary rotation
created by the analyser, and is negated by the violations. Weak macroscopic
realism (wMR) assumes a definite outcome for systems prepared in a
superposition $\psi_{pointer}$ of two macroscopically-distinct eigenstates of
$\hat{M}$, after the unitary rotation. We find that wMR can be viewed as
consistent with the violations. A model is presented, in which wMR holds, and
for which the macroscopic violations emerge over the course of the unitary
dynamics. Finally, we point out an EPR-type paradox, that a weak
macro-realistic description for the system prior to the measurement $\hat{M}$
is inconsistent with the completeness of quantum mechanics.

theory gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The gauge theory gravity
is a gravity theory under gauge formulation in the language of geometric
algebra. In contrast to general relativity, the background spacetime in gauge
theory gravity is flat, the gauge freedom comes from the fact that equations in
terms of physical quantities should be kept in a covariant form under spacetime
displacement and rotation. Similar to the electromagnetism, the gauge
formulation enables us to interpret the gravitational force as a gauge force on
the background flat spacetime. The dynamical fields that describe the
gravitational interactions are those position and rotation gauge fields
introduced as the requirement of the gauge covariance. The gravitational field
equations can be derived from the least action principle with the action as a
gauge invariant quantity built from the covariant field strength. We discuss
the gravitational wave solutions of the field equations with a negative
cosmological constant, and show that these solutions are of Petrov type-N. We
also discuss the velocity memory effect by calculating the velocity change of
an initially free falling massive particle due to the presence of the
gravitational waves.

classical task in combinatorial optimization. We develop a set of techniques
for partitioning and grouping jobs based on their starting and ending times,
that enable us to view an instance of interval scheduling on many jobs as a
union of multiple interval scheduling instances, each containing only a few
jobs. Instantiating these techniques in dynamic and local settings of
computation leads to several new results.
  For $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of job scheduling of $n$ jobs on a single
machine, we develop a fully dynamic algorithm with
$O(\frac{\log{n}}{\varepsilon})$ update and $O(\log{n})$ query worst-case time.
Further, we design a local computation algorithm that uses only
$O(\frac{\log{N}}{\varepsilon})$ queries when all jobs are length at least $1$
and have starting/ending times within $[0,N]$. Our techniques are also
applicable in a setting where jobs have rewards/weights. For this case we
design a fully dynamic deterministic algorithm whose worst-case update and
query time are $\operatorname{poly}(\log n,\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$.
Equivalently, this is the first algorithm that maintains a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the maximum independent set of a collection
of weighted intervals in $\operatorname{poly}(\log n,\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
time updates/queries. This is an exponential improvement in $1/\varepsilon$
over the running time of a randomized algorithm of Henzinger, Neumann, and
Wiese ~[SoCG, 2020], while also removing all dependence on the values of the
jobs' starting/ending times and rewards, as well as removing the need for any
randomness.

  Variational Autoencoder",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  User attributes, such as gender and education, face severe incompleteness in
social networks. In order to make this kind of valuable data usable for
downstream tasks like user profiling and personalized recommendation, attribute
inference aims to infer users' missing attribute labels based on observed data.
Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), an end-to-end deep generative model,
has shown promising performance by handling the problem in a semi-supervised
way. However, VAEs can easily suffer from over-fitting and over-smoothing when
applied to attribute inference. To be specific, VAE implemented with
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can only reconstruct input data but fail in
inferring missing parts. While using the trending graph neural networks (GNNs)
as encoder has the problem that GNNs aggregate redundant information from
neighborhood and generate indistinguishable user representations, which is
known as over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose an attribute
\textbf{Infer}ence model based on \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{VAE}
(Infer-AVAE) to cope with these issues. Specifically, to overcome
over-smoothing, Infer-AVAE unifies MLP and GNNs in encoder to learn positive
and negative latent representations respectively. Meanwhile, an adversarial
network is trained to distinguish the two representations and GNNs are trained
to aggregate less noise for more robust representations through adversarial
training. Finally, to relieve over-fitting, mutual information constraint is
introduced as a regularizer for decoder, so that it can make better use of
auxiliary information in representations and generate outputs not limited by
observations. We evaluate our model on 4 real-world social network datasets,
experimental results demonstrate that our model averagely outperforms baselines
by 7.0$\%$ in accuracy.

network of power grid sensors to quickly detect, in real-time, when any unusual
events, whether natural faults or malicious, occur on the power grid. Existing
bad-data detectors in the industry lack the sophistication to robustly detect
broad types of anomalies, especially those due to emerging cyber-attacks, since
they operate on a single measurement snapshot of the grid at a time. New ML

actively exploits the geometrical information of lines that exist in abundance
in an indoor space. By using a strong line tracker and adaptive selection of
feature-based tightly coupled optimization, it is possible to perform robust
localization in a variable texture environment. The structural characteristics
of ALVIO are as follows: First, the proposed optical flow-based line tracker
performs robust line feature tracking and management. By using epipolar
geometry and trigonometry, accurate 3D lines are recovered. These 3D lines are
used to calculate the line re-projection error. Finally, with the
sensitivity-analysis-based adaptive feature selection in the optimization
process, we can estimate the pose robustly in various indoor environments. We
validate the performance of our system on public datasets and compare it
against other state-of the-art algorithms (S-MSKCF, VINS-Mono). In the proposed
algorithm based on point and line feature selection, translation RMSE increased

supervised learning methods to learn an automatic photo enhancer for paired

present an unsupervised image enhancement generative adversarial network
(UEGAN), which learns the corresponding image-to-image mapping from a set of
images with desired characteristics in an unsupervised manner, rather than
learning on a large number of paired images. The proposed model is based on
single deep GAN which embeds the modulation and attention mechanisms to capture
richer global and local features. Based on the proposed model, we introduce two
losses to deal with the unsupervised image enhancement: (1) fidelity loss,
which is defined as a L2 regularization in the feature domain of a pre-trained
VGG network to ensure the content between the enhanced image and the input
image is the same, and (2) quality loss that is formulated as a relativistic
hinge adversarial loss to endow the input image the desired characteristics.
Both quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model
effectively improves the aesthetic quality of images. Our code is available at:

increasing computational resources, it is currently possible to numerically
solve the time-dependent and anisotropic large scales of turbulence in a large
variety of flows. For some applications this large-scale resolution is
satisfactory. However, a wide range of engineering problems involve flows at
very large Reynolds numbers where the subgrid scale dynamics of a practical LES
are critically important to design and yet are out of reach given the
computational demands of solving the Navier Stokes equations; this difficulty
is particularly relevant in wall-bounded turbulence where even the large-scales
are often below the implied filter width of modest cost wall modeled LES
(WMLES). In this paper we briefly introduce a scale enrichment procedure which
leverages spatially and spectrally-localized Gabor modes. The method provides a
physically consistent description of the small scale velocity field without
solving the full non-linear equations. The enrichment procedure is appraised
against its ability to predict small scale contributions to the pressure field.
We find that the method accurately extrapolates the pressure spectrum and
recovers pressure variance of the full field remarkably well when compared to a
computationally expensive, highly resolved LES. The analysis is conducted both
in \textit{a priori} and \textit{a posteriori} settings for the case of
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT).

the common conception of DHT systems, especially about its scalability and load

DHT by considering the impacts of write workloads and data movement. We show
that, the average network bandwidth of each node and the intensity of the

Unlike previous works, we propose to tackle this challenging problem from a new

propose to train a network that can separate signal and noise by learning a set
of reconstruction basis in the feature space. Subsequently, image denosing can
be achieved by selecting corresponding basis of the signal subspace and
projecting the input into such space. Our key insight is that projection can
naturally maintain the local structure of input signal, especially for areas
with low light or weak textures. Towards this end, we propose SSA, a non-local
subspace attention module designed explicitly to learn the basis generation as
well as the subspace projection. We further incorporate SSA with NBNet, a UNet

significant challenge in many natural and industrial systems. Vortical
structure dynamics is believed to be the driving mechanism in the transition
regime in porous media based on the pore Reynolds number, $Re_p$. To examine
this assertion, a refractive-index matched randomly packed porous medium is
designed to measure the scale of vortical flow structures in transition from
unsteady laminar to turbulent using two-dimensional time-resolved Particle
Image Velocimetry (PIV). Planar PIV data for $Re_p$ from 100 to 948 is used to
quantify the scale in terms of the size, strength, and number density using two
different scalings (i) $Re_p$ macroscopic (global), and (ii) $Re_{\langle
p\rangle}$ microscopic (local). Direct measurement of vortex scale is
quantified by employing swirl strength, vortex core, and enhanced swirl
strength vortex identification methods. These scales are compared with
turbulent integral scales. Shear-dominant vortical structures in moderate
unsteady laminar Reynolds numbers ($Re_p <300$) were observed, while the
swirl-dominant flow structures appeared in weak turbulent Reynolds numbers
($Re_p>500$). From the macroscopic point of view, increasing Rep resulted in,
(i) reduction in the sizes of vortical structures to asymptotically to reach
20$\%$ of the global hydraulic diameter, (ii) growth in strength of vortices,
and (iii) increase in the average number densities of vortices. From the
pore-scale (local) point of view, increasing $Re_{\langle p\rangle}$ led to
decrease in the size of vortical structures monotonically, (ii) rise of the
strength of vortices, and (iii) invariance in the number density of vortical
structures. These findings suggest pore versus macro-scale coupling exists for
the scale of vortical flow structures in the transition regime.

insights, in this paper, we propose the Multi-adversarial spatiotemporal
recurrent Graph Neural Networks (MasterGNN) for joint air quality and weather
predictions. Specifically, we first propose a heterogeneous recurrent graph
neural network to model the spatiotemporal autocorrelation among air quality
and weather monitoring stations. Then, we develop a multi-adversarial graph
learning framework to against observation noise propagation introduced by
spatiotemporal modeling. Moreover, we present an adaptive training strategy by
formulating multi-adversarial learning as a multi-task learning problem.
Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that MasterGNN
achieves the best performance compared with seven baselines on both air quality
and weather prediction tasks.

models. Despite the fact that in an end-to-end view, the real goal is to
achieve good optimization performance, the prediction performance is measured
on its own. While it is usually believed that good prediction performance in
estimating the parameters will result in good subsequent optimization
performance, formal theoretical guarantees on this are notably lacking. In this
paper, we explore conditions that allow us to explicitly describe how the
prediction performance governs the optimization performance. Our weaker
condition allows for an asymptotic convergence result, while our stronger
condition allows for exact quantification of the optimization performance in
terms of the prediction performance. In general, verification of these
conditions is a non-trivial task. Nevertheless, we show that our weaker
condition is equivalent to the well-known Fisher consistency concept from the
learning theory literature. This then allows us to easily check our weaker
condition for several loss functions. We also establish that the squared error
loss function satisfies our stronger condition. Consequently, we derive the
exact theoretical relationship between prediction performance measured with the
squared loss, as well as a class of symmetric loss functions, and the
subsequent optimization performance. In a computational study on portfolio
optimization, fractional knapsack and multiclass classification problems, we
compare the optimization performance of using of several prediction loss
functions (some that are Fisher consistent and some that are not) and
demonstrate that lack of consistency of the loss function can indeed have a
detrimental effect on performance.

measuring equality of means among groups of $n$ multinomial distributions with
$d_1,\dots,d_n$ observations. In the context of network models, the number of
multinomials, $n$, grows much faster than the number of observations, $d_i$,
corresponding to the degree of node $i$, hence the setting deviates from
classical asymptotics. We show that a simple adjustment allows the statistic to
converge in distribution, under null, as long as the harmonic mean of $\{d_i\}$
grows to infinity. When applied sequentially, the test can also be used to
determine the number of communities. The test operates on a compressed version
of the adjacency matrix, conditional on the degrees, and as a result is highly
scalable to large sparse networks. We incorporate a novel idea of compressing
the rows based on a $(K+1)$-community assignment when testing for $K$
communities. This approach increases the power in sequential applications
without sacrificing computational efficiency, and we prove its consistency in
recovering the number of communities. Since the test statistic does not rely on
a specific alternative, its utility goes beyond sequential testing and can be
used to simultaneously test against a wide range of alternatives outside the
DCSBM family. In particular, we prove that the test is consistent against a
general family of latent-variable network models with community structure.

in an isothermal halo develops a density spike with a power law of $r^{-7/4}$,
which is shallower than $r^{-7/3}$ as expected for collisionless dark matter

the density spike could be relaxed in SIDM. Taking the most dense satellite
galaxy of the Milky Way Draco as an example, we derive upper limits on the
annihilation cross section and the black hole mass for both SIDM and CDM halos.
For the former case, Draco could host an intermediate mass black hole even if
dark matter is composed of thermal relics. We further explore the constraints
from the Milky Way and M87, which host supermassive black holes, and show the

progression of an infectious disease are the distributions of inherent
susceptibility ($\sigma_{inh}$) and external infectivity ($\iota_{ext}$), in a
given population. While the former is determined by the immunity of an
individual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to
the infection. We model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a
generalized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the
susceptibility and infectivity distributions to understand their combined
effects, which appear to remain inadequately addressed till date. We consider
the coupling between $\sigma_{inh}$ and $\iota_{ext}$ through a new Critical
Infection Parameter (CIP) ($\gamma_c$). We find that the neglect of these
distributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation of the
amount of infection in a population, which leads to incorrect (higher)
estimates of the infections required to achieve the herd immunity threshold.
Additionally, we include the effects of seeding of infection in a population by
long-range migration. We solve the resulting master equations by performing
Kinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our
simulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic.
The latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of
susceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly
different from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these
additional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating
system where the disease cluster survives by migrating from region to region.

Therefore, learning a joint distribution of seen-unseen domains and preserving

learn the underlying distribution of seen data, although unseen class semantics
are available in the GZSL problem setting. Most methods neglect retaining
domain distinction and use the learned distribution to recognize seen and
unseen data. Consequently, they do not perform well. In this work, we utilize
the available unseen class semantics alongside seen class semantics and learn
joint distribution through a strong visual-semantic coupling. We propose a
bidirectional mapping coupled generative adversarial network (BMCoGAN) by
extending the coupled generative adversarial network into a dual-domain
learning bidirectional mapping model. We further integrate a Wasserstein
generative adversarial optimization to supervise the joint distribution
learning. We design a loss optimization for retaining domain distinctive
information in the synthesized features and reducing bias towards seen classes,
which pushes synthesized seen features towards real seen features and pulls
synthesized unseen features away from real seen features. We evaluate BMCoGAN
on benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance against

edge-weighted general multi-graph $G := (V, E)$ with weights $w : E \rightarrow

few colors as possible. An edge coloring is called a proper weighted coloring
if the sum of the weights of the edges incident to a vertex of any color is at
most one. In the online setting, the edges are revealed one by one and have to
be colored irrevocably as soon as they are revealed. We show that $3.39m+o(m)$
colors are enough when the maximum number of neighbors of a vertex over all the
vertices is $o(m)$ and where $m$ is the maximum over all vertices of the
minimum number of unit-sized bins needed to pack the weights of the incident
edges to that vertex. We also prove the tightness of our analysis. This
improves upon the previous best upper bound of $5m$ by Correa and Goemans [STOC
2004]. For the offline case, we show that for a simple graph with edge disjoint
cycles, $m+1$ colors are sufficient and for a multi-graph tree, we show that
$1.693m+12$ colors are sufficient.

incorporating varied clustering techniques such as feature-based clustering,
distance-based clustering and random clustering, and generalise them to use
different underlying GFM model types. We then propose a new methodology of

representations to alleviate the burden of manual feature engineering in
Natural Language Processing (NLP). Such text representations are widely used to
extract features from unlabeled data. The word segmentation is a fundamental
and inevitable prerequisite for many languages. Sindhi is an under-resourced
language, whose segmentation is challenging as it exhibits space omission,
space insertion issues, and lacks the labeled corpus for segmentation. In this
paper, we investigate supervised Sindhi Word Segmentation (SWS) using unlabeled
data with a Subword Guided Neural Word Segmenter (SGNWS) for Sindhi. In order
to learn text representations, we incorporate subword representations to
recurrent neural architecture to capture word information at morphemic-level,
which takes advantage of Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM),
self-attention mechanism, and Conditional Random Field (CRF). Our proposed
SGNWS model achieves an F1 value of 98.51% without relying on feature
engineering. The empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
model over the existing Sindhi word segmenters.

use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness.
Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem
into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed
optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each
MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from
multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the

designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the
proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining
good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.

significance of an excess of muon neutrinos inducing track-like events in
correlation with the location of a list of possible sources. Different sets of
objects are tested in the analysis: a) a sub-sample of the \textit{Fermi} 3LAC
catalog of blazars, b) a jet-obscured AGN population, c) a sample of soft
gamma-ray selected radio galaxies, d) a star-forming galaxy catalog , and e) a
public sample of 56 very-high-energy track events from the IceCube experiment.
  None of the tested sources shows a significant association with the sample of
neutrinos detected by ANTARES. The smallest p-value is obtained for the radio
galaxies catalog with an equal weights hypothesis, with a pre-trial p-value
equivalent to a $2.8 \, \sigma$ excess, equivalent to $1.6 \, \sigma$
post-trial.
  In addition, the results of a dedicated analysis for the blazar MG3
J225517+2409 are also reported: this source is found to be the most significant
within the \textit{Fermi} 3LAC sample, with 5 ANTARES events located at less
than one degree from the source. This blazar showed evidence of flaring
activity in \textit{Fermi} data, in space-time coincidence with a high-energy
track detected by IceCube. An \emph{a posteriori} significance of $2.0\,
\sigma$ for the combination of ANTARES and IceCube data is reported.

policy based on a dataset collected a priori. Due to the lack of further
interactions with the environment, offline RL suffers from the insufficient
coverage of the dataset, which eludes most existing theoretical analysis. In
this paper, we propose a pessimistic variant of the value iteration algorithm
(PEVI), which incorporates an uncertainty quantifier as the penalty function.
Such a penalty function simply flips the sign of the bonus function for
promoting exploration in online RL, which makes it easily implementable and
compatible with general function approximators.
  Without assuming the sufficient coverage of the dataset, we establish a
data-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality of PEVI for general Markov
decision processes (MDPs). When specialized to linear MDPs, it matches the
information-theoretic lower bound up to multiplicative factors of the dimension
and horizon. In other words, pessimism is not only provably efficient but also
minimax optimal. In particular, given the dataset, the learned policy serves as
the ""best effort"" among all policies, as no other policies can do better. Our
theoretical analysis identifies the critical role of pessimism in eliminating a
notion of spurious correlation, which emerges from the ""irrelevant""
trajectories that are less covered by the dataset and not informative for the
optimal policy.

understanding models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PrLMs) offer a new
performant method of contextualized word representations by leveraging the
sequence-level context for modeling. Although the PrLMs generally give more
accurate contextualized word representations than non-contextualized models do,
they are still subject to a sequence of text contexts without diverse hints for
word representation from multimodality. This paper thus proposes a visual
representation method to explicitly enhance conventional word embedding with
multiple-aspect senses from visual guidance. In detail, we build a small-scale
word-image dictionary from a multimodal seed dataset where each word
corresponds to diverse related images. The texts and paired images are encoded
in parallel, followed by an attention layer to integrate the multimodal
representations. We show that the method substantially improves the accuracy of
disambiguation. Experiments on 12 natural language understanding and machine
translation tasks further verify the effectiveness and the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

allows murmuring starlings to outmaneuver preying falcons$^2$, shoaling

Pleistocene peers$^4$. On the micron-scale, bacterial colonies show excellent
resilience thanks to the individuals' ability to cooperate even when densely
packed, mitigating their internal flow pattern to mix nutrients, fence the
immune system, and resist antibiotics$^{5-14}$. Production of an artificial
swarm on the micro-scale faces a serious challenge $\frac{\;\;}{\;\;}$ while an
individual bacterium has an evolutionary-forged internal machinery to produce
propulsion, until now, artificial micro-swimmers relied on the precise chemical
composition of their environment to directly fuel their drive$^{14-23}$. When
crowded, artificial micro-swimmers compete locally for a finite fuel supply,
quenching each other's activity at their greatest propensity for cooperation.
Here we introduce an artificial micro-swimmer that consumes no chemical fuel
and is driven solely by light. We couple a light absorbing particle to a fluid
droplet, forming a colloidal chimera that transforms light energy into
propulsive thermo-capillary action. The swimmers' internal drive allows them to
operate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective
repulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above
a critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that
displays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense
swimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We
derive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying
the role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration
of the micro-swimmers.

  Length","21 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an important coding scheme in modern distributed storage systems, locally
repairable codes (LRCs) have attracted a lot of attentions from perspectives of
both practical applications and theoretical research. As a major topic in the
research of LRCs, bounds and constructions of the corresponding optimal codes
are of particular concerns.
  In this work, codes with $(r,\delta)$-locality which have optimal minimal
distance w.r.t. the bound given by Prakash et al. \cite{Prakash2012Optimal} are
considered. Through parity check matrix approach, constructions of both optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs with all symbol locality ($(r,\delta)_a$-LRCs) and optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs with information locality ($(r,\delta)_i$-LRCs) are provided.
As a generalization of a work of Xing and Yuan \cite{XY19}, these constructions
are built on a connection between sparse hypergraphs and optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs. With the help of constructions of large sparse hypergraphs,
the length of codes constructed can be super-linear in the alphabet size. This
improves upon previous constructions when the minimal distance of the code is
at least $3\delta+1$. As two applications, optimal H-LRCs with super-linear
length and GSD codes with unbounded length are also constructed.

exploited to reconstruct the 3D data from the 2D measurement. Unfortunately,
the accuracy and computational complexity are unsatisfied. One feasible
solution is to utilize additional information such as the RGB measurement in
CASSI. Considering the combined CASSI and RGB measurement, in this paper, we
propose a new fusion model for the HSI reconstruction. We investigate the
spectral low-rank property of HSI composed of a spectral basis and spatial

coefficients, meanwhile the CASSI measurement is adopted to provide the
orthogonal spectral basis. We further propose a patch processing strategy to
enhance the spectral low-rank property of HSI. The proposed model neither
requires non-local processing or iteration, nor the spectral sensing matrix of
the RGB detector. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real HSI dataset
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art not

plasma is largely ionized and magnetized because of electric currents flowing
in the highly conductive environment near black holes; the process of accretion
then carries the magnetic flux onto the event horizon, $r\simeq R_+$. On the
other hand, magnetic pressure acts against accretion. It can not only arrest
the inflow but it can even push the plasma away from the black hole if the
magnetic repulsion prevails. The black hole does not hold the magnetic field by
itself.
  In this contribution we show an example of an equatorial outflow driven by a
large scale magnetic field. We initiate our computations with a spherically
symmetric distribution of gas, which flows onto the domain from a large
distance, $r\gg R_+$. After the flow settles in a steady (Bondi) solution, we
impose an axially symmetric configuration of a uniform (Wald) magnetic field
aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole. Then we evolve the initial
configuration numerically by employing the MHD code that approaches the
force-free limit of a perfectly conducting fluid.
  We observe how the magnetic lines of force start accreting with the plasma
while an equatorial intermittent outflow develops and goes on ejecting some
material away from the black hole.

variety of tasks including image recognition or Go playing. Yet, why they work
is not understood. Ultimately, they manage to classify data lying in high
dimension -- a feat generically impossible due to the geometry of high
dimensional space and the associated curse of dimensionality. Understanding
what kind of structure, symmetry or invariance makes data such as images
learnable is a fundamental challenge. Other puzzles include that (i) learning
corresponds to minimizing a loss in high dimension, which is in general not
convex and could well get stuck bad minima. (ii) Deep learning predicting power
increases with the number of fitting parameters, even in a regime where data
are perfectly fitted. In this manuscript, we review recent results elucidating
(i,ii) and the perspective they offer on the (still unexplained) curse of
dimensionality paradox. We base our theoretical discussion on the $(h,\alpha)$
plane where $h$ is the network width and $\alpha$ the scale of the output of
the network at initialization, and provide new systematic measures of
performance in that plane for MNIST and CIFAR 10. We argue that different
learning regimes can be organized into a phase diagram. A line of critical
points sharply delimits an under-parametrised phase from an over-parametrized
one. In over-parametrized nets, learning can operate in two regimes separated
by a smooth cross-over. At large initialization, it corresponds to a kernel
method, whereas for small initializations features can be learnt, together with
invariants in the data. We review the properties of these different phases, of
the transition separating them and some open questions. Our treatment
emphasizes analogies with physical systems, scaling arguments and the
development of numerical observables to quantitatively test these results

exciton lifetime due to the defect traps and the strong exciton-exciton
interaction in TMDs has significantly limited the efficiency of exciton
emission from this class of materials. Here, we show that exciton-exciton
dipolar field interaction in 1L-WS2 can be effectively screened using an
ultra-flat Au film substrate separated by multilayers of hexagonal boron
nitride. Under this geometry, dipolar exciton-exciton interaction becomes
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction because of effective image dipoles formed
inside the metal. The suppressed exciton-exciton interaction leads to a
significantly improved quantum yield by an order of magnitude, which is also
accompanied by a reduction in the exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) rate, as
confirmed by time-resolved optical measurements. A semiclassical model
accounting for the screening of the dipole-dipole interaction qualitatively
captures the dependence of EEA on exciton densities. Our results suggest that
fundamental EEA processes in the TMD can be engineered through proximal
metallic screening, which represents a practical approach towards
high-efficiency 2D light emitters.

development and deployment of applications. One of the most known and dangerous
vulnerabilities is stack-based buffer overflows, which may allow potential
attackers to execute malicious code. In this paper we consider the use of
modern machine learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks, to
detect stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the assembly code of a
program. Since assembly code is a generic and common representation, focusing
on this language allows us to potentially consider programs written in several
different programming languages. Moreover, we subscribe to the hypothesis that
code may be treated as natural language, and thus we process assembly code
using standard architectures commonly employed in natural language processing.
We perform a set of experiments aimed at confirming the validity of the natural
language hypothesis and the feasibility of using recurrent neural networks for
detecting vulnerabilities. Our results show that our architecture is able to
capture subtle stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that strongly depend
on the context, thus suggesting that this approach may be extended to
real-world setting, as well as to other forms of vulnerability detection.

We find that in the later stages of shock evolution, the initially strong
suprathermal part in the ion spectra fades, thus leaving the spectra composed
of a Maxwellian and a power law. Once the electron and ion spectra flatten and
become parallel, we find that the amounts of cosmic ray ions and electrons

physics by applying this injection rule to Blasi's semi-analytical model of
non-linear diffusive shock acceleration, in order to obtain the particle
spectra and electron-to-proton ratio $K_{\mathrm{ep}}$ at high energies. By
using shock jump conditions that include the electron heating, we find
$K_{\mathrm{ep}}$ as a function of Mach number. For Mach number $\sim$ 100, our

or equivalently, by the maximum quantum distance of Bloch states. This
naturally explains the origin of the $\pi$-Berry phase of a linear BCP. In the

an interesting finding on the property of scatter: when applying the spectral
correction before scatter is removed, the impact of SPR on a CT projection will
be scaled by the first derivative of the mapping function; while the scatter
distribution in the transmission domain will be scaled by the product of the
first derivative of the mapping function and a natural exponential of the
projection difference before and after the mapping. Such a characterization of
scatter's behavior provides an analytic approach of compensating for the SPR as
well as approximating the change of scatter distribution after spectral
correction, even though both of them might be significantly distorted as the
linearization mapping function in spectral correction could vary a lot from one
detector pixel to another. We conduct an evaluation of SPR compensations on a

pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate
characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is
crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the
role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization
is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in
spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the
entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a
general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating
existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process
modeling, and nonparametric regression into a functional ANOVA model.
Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality,
providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a
continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time.
This functional ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature
profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step
procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC
season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a
thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for
heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit
reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we
obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean
on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the
near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the
mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.

multi bands. We also find that symmetry puts strong constraints on the LLS of
flat bands. Our work demonstrates that an isolated flat band is an ideal system
for studying the fundamental role of wave-function geometry in describing
magnetic responses of solids.

numerical scheme for the square phase field crystal (SPFC) equation, a gradient
flow modeling crystal dynamics at the atomic scale in space but on diffusive
scales in time. Its primary difference with the standard phase field crystal
model is an introduction of the 4-Laplacian term in the free energy potential,
which in turn leads to a much higher degree of nonlinearity. To make the
numerical scheme linear while preserving the nonlinear energy stability, we
make use of the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, in which a second
order backward differentiation formula (BDF) is applied in the temporal
stencil. Meanwhile, a direct application of the SAV method faces certain
difficulties, due to the involvement of the 4-Laplacian term, combined with a
derivation of the lower bound of the nonlinear energy functional. In the
proposed numerical method, an appropriate decomposition for the physical energy
functional is formulated, so that the nonlinear energy part has a
well-established global lower bound, and the rest terms lead to
constant-coefficient diffusion terms with positive eigenvalues. In turn, the
numerical scheme could be very efficiently implemented by constant-coefficient
Poisson-like type solvers (via FFT), and energy stability is established by
introducing an auxiliary variable, and an optimal rate convergence analysis is
provided for the proposed SAV method. A few numerical experiments are also
presented, which confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.

region $2.0 < \eta_{l} < 4.5$ of the decay leptons at center-of-mass energies
8, 13, and 14 TeV. Accurate prediction of the $\phi^{*}_{\eta}$ distribution is
achieved by means of the state-of-the-art calculations including fixed-order
perturbative QCD and large logarithmic corrections. The predicted distributions
are obtained by employing the resummation either at next-to-next-to-leading

perturbative QCD calculation at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy,
that is at NNLO+NNLL and NNLO+N$^{3}$LL, respectively. The Z boson
$\phi^{*}_{\eta}$ variable is experimentally preferable as it has been measured
more precisely than the Z boson transverse momentum though both variables probe
the same physics, thereby an accurate description of the $\phi^{*}_{\eta}$
variable is required by using theoretical predictions at both NNLO+NNLL and

available 8 TeV and 13 TeV measurements by the LHCb experiment at the LHC and
found to be in good agreement. The 14 TeV predicted distributions at both

determined by the interfacial load transfer between implants and bone tissue.
Stress-shielding effects arise from shear stresses due to the difference of
material properties between bone and the implant. It remains difficult to
measure the stress field in periprosthetic bone tissue. This study proposes to
investigate the dependence of the stress field in periprosthetic bone tissue on
i) the implant surface roughness, ii) material properties of bone and of the
implant, iii) the bone-implant contact ratio. To do so, a microscale 2-D finite
element model of an osseointegrated boneimplant interface was developed where
the surface roughness was modeled by a sinusoidal surface. The results show
that the isostatic pressure is not affected by the presence of the bone-implant
interface while shear stresses arise due to the combined effects of a
geometrical singularity (for low surface roughness) and of shear stresses at
the bone-implant interface (for high surface roughness). Stress-shielding
effects are likely to be more important when the bone-implant contact ratio
value is low, which corresponds to a case of relatively low implant stability.
Shear stress reach a maximum value at a distance from the interface comprised
between 0 and 0.1 time roughness wavelength $\lambda$ and tend to 0 at a
distance from the implant surface higher than $\lambda$, independently from
bone-implant contact ratio and waviness ratio. A comparison with an analytical
model allows validating the numerical results. Future work should use the
present approach to model osseointegration phenomena.

fundamental for the transmission of human-mosquitoes malaria infections. Here
we formulate an age-structured model accounting for the three structural
variables. Using integrated semigroups theory, we first handle the
well-posedness of the model proposed. We also investigate the existence of
model's steady-states. A disease-free equilibrium always exists while the
existence of endemic equilibria is discussed. We derive the threshold R0 (the
basic reproduction number). The expression of the R0 obtained here particularly
highlight the effect of above structural variables on key important
epidemiological traits of the human-vector association. This includes, humans
and mosquitoes transmission probability and survival rates. Next, we derive a
necessary and sufficient condition that implies the bifurcation of an endemic
equilibrium. In some configuration where the age-structure of the human
population is neglected, we show that, depending on the sign of some constant
Cbif given by the parameters, a bifurcation occurs at R0 = 1 that is either
forward or backward. In the former case, it means that there exists a (unique)
endemic equilibrium if and only if R0 > 1. In the latter case, no endemic

multiple endemic equilibria exist when 0 <<R0 < 1 close enough to 1.

3933.68 A for 122 A-type stars (7000 <Te < 10000 K) in a wide range of
rotational velocity (10 < vsini < 300 km/s), in order to study the behaviors of
Ca abundances ([Ca/H]39) determined from this Ca II 3934 line, especially in
context of (i) how they are related with the Am phenomenon (often seen in slow
rotators) and (ii) whether they are consistent with the Ca abundances
([Ca/H]61) derived from the weaker Ca I 6162 line. It was confirmed that Ca
line strengths in Am stars tend to be weaker and associated abundances are
lower compared to non-Am stars at the same Te, indicating a deficiency of Ca in
the photosphere of Am stars. However, an appreciable fraction of cool Am stars
(Te < 8000 K) were found to show anomalous Ca II 3934 line feature (i.e.,
unusually broad for its weakness) which is hard to explain. Regarding the
comparison between [Ca/H]39 and [Ca/H]61, while both are roughly consistent for
hotter stars (Te > 8000 K), the former tends to be lower (by up to -1 dex or
even more) than the latter for cooler A stars (Te < 8000 K) including those
""weak broad K line"" objects, This fact suggests that some special mechanism
reducing the strength of Ca II 3934 line is involved at Te < 8000 K where
[Ca/H]39 would be no more reliable. Whereas atomic diffusion causing the
deficit of Ca in the photosphere as a result of element segregation in the
deeper radiative envelope may be regarded as a promising explanation because it
seems to fit in the qualitative trend of [Ca/H]61 in A-type stars, the
well-known feature of considerably weak Ca II K line in classical Am stars
should not necessarily be attributed to only this element diffusion scenario,
for which some unknown weakening mechanism specific to this resonance line may
independently be operative.

influenced by the interaction of JT distortions at C$_{60}$ sites with
vibrational modes of the lattice. This leads to modification of JT
stabilization energy and to the warping of the trough at each fullerene site,
as well as to the interaction of JT distortions at different sites. Here we
investigate these effects in three fcc fullerides with A=K,Rb,Cs and in
Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ with bcc (A15) structure. DFT calculations of orbital vibronic
coupling constants at C$_{60}$ sites and of phonon spectra have been done for
fully ordered lattices (1 C$_{60}$/u.c.). Based on them the elastic response
function for local JT distortions has been evaluated and the lowest APES
investigated. To this end an expression for the latter in function of trough
coordinates of all sites has been derived. The results show that the JT
stabilization energy slightly increases compared to an isolated C$_{60}^{3-}$
and a warping of the trough of few meV occurs. The interaction of JT
distortions on nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor fullerene sites is of similar
order of magnitude. These effects arise first of all due to the interaction of
C$_{60}$ sites with the displacements of neighbor alkali atoms and are more
pronounced in fcc fullerides than in the A15 compound. The results of this
study support the picture of weakly hindered independent rotations of JT
deformations at C$_{60}$ sites in cubic A$_3$C$_{60}$.

leveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808
anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. We find a universal spreading
pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a
power-law-like model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we
reveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading
process: long average travelling distance results in a high growth rate of
spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases. With such
insight, we adopt Kendall model to simulate urban spreading of COVID-19 that
can well fit the real spreading process. Our results unveil the underlying
mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban evolution of COVID-19, and can be
used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented

potential to reduce driver workload and to improve driving safety. One
challenge is how to improve driver acceptance on the automated system. From the
viewpoint of human factors, an automated system with different styles would
improve user acceptance as the drivers can adapt the style to different driving
situations. This paper proposes a method to design different lane change styles
in automated driving by analysis and modeling of truck driver behavior. A truck
driving simulator experiment with 12 participants was conducted to identify the
driver model parameters and three lane change styles were classified as the
aggressive, medium, and conservative ones. The proposed automated lane change
system was evaluated by another truck driving simulator experiment with the
same 12 participants. Moreover, the effect of different driving styles on
driver experience and acceptance was evaluated. The evaluation results
demonstrate that the different lane change styles could be distinguished by the
drivers; meanwhile, the three styles were overall evaluated as acceptable on
safety issues and reliable by the human drivers. This study provides insight
into designing the automated driving system with different driving styles and
the findings can be applied to commercial automated trucks.

of keyframes. For flexibility, KSF supports anytime calibration of IMU
systematic errors, as well as extrinsic, intrinsic, and temporal parameters of
each camera. Estimator consistency and observability of sensor parameters were
analyzed by simulation. Sensitivity to design options, e.g., feature matching
method and camera count was studied with the EuRoC benchmark. Sensor parameter
estimation was evaluated on raw TUM VI sequences and smartphone data. Moreover,
pose estimation accuracy was evaluated on EuRoC and TUM VI sequences versus
recent VIO methods. These tests confirm that KSF reliably calibrates sensor
parameters when the data contain adequate motion, and consistently estimate
motion with accuracy rivaling recent VIO methods. Our implementation runs at 42
Hz with stereo camera images on a consumer laptop.

pose estimation methods. The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed via
covering all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The standard deviations
of these kernels are fixed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need to
handle a large variance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the current
practice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose the
scale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjust
the standard deviation for each keypoint. In this way, SAHR is more tolerant of
various human scales and labeling ambiguities. However, SAHR may aggravate the
imbalance between fore-background samples, which potentially hurts the
improvement of SAHR. Thus, we further introduce the weight-adaptive heatmap
regression (WAHR) to help balance the fore-background samples. Extensive
experiments show that SAHR together with WAHR largely improves the accuracy of
bottom-up human pose estimation. As a result, we finally outperform the

assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles with effective uniaxial anisotropy
dispersed in a liquid are performed depending on the particle diameters, the
alternating (ac) magnetic field amplitude and the liquid viscosity. For small
and moderate ac magnetic field amplitudes H0 with respect to particle
anisotropy field Hk the SAR of the assembly as a function of the particle
diameter passes through a characteristic maximum and then reaches a plateau,
whereas for sufficiently large amplitudes, H0 ~ Hk, the SAR increases
monotonically as a function of particle diameter. This difference is a
consequence of realization of viscous and magnetic oscillation modes for
particle unit magnetization vector and director for moderate and sufficiently
large H0 values, respectively. It is found that the SAR of the assembly changes
inversely with the viscosity only in a viscous mode, for nanoparticles of
sufficiently large diameters. In the developed magnetic mode the SAR of the
assembly is practically independent of the viscosity, since in this case the
nanoparticle director only weakly oscillates around the ac magnetic field
direction. At moderate amplitudes of the ac magnetic field the SAR values of
the assembly in the liquid and in the solid matrix are found to be close,
except of the range of large particle diameters and sufficiently low viscosity.
However, at large field amplitudes the SAR of randomly oriented assembly of
nanoparticles in a solid matrix is approximately two times less than that in a
liquid, because a significant fraction of nanoparticles of the assembly in the
solid matrix is not optimally oriented with respect to the ac magnetic field
direction. The conditions for the validity of the linear response theory have
been clarified by comparison with the numerical simulation data.

of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc, resulting in dissipative

dissipates the magnetic energy and powers jet acceleration. The striped jet
model can explain the jet acceleration, large-scale jet emission, and blazar
emission signatures consistently in a unified physical picture. Specifically,
we find that the jet accelerates to the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \gtrsim 10$

$\dot{\Gamma}/\Gamma$ between $0.0005~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $0.005~\rm{yr^{-1}}$ at

core-shift effect and overall flat-to-inverted synchrotron spectrum. The
large-scale spectral luminosity peak $\nu_{\rm peak}$ is anti-proportional to
the location of the peak of the dissipation, which is set by the minimal stripe
width $l_{\rm min}$. The blazar zone is approximately at the same location. At
this distance, the jet is moderately magnetized, with the comoving magnetic
field strength and dissipation power consistent with typical leptonic blazar
model parameters.

conventional internal combustion engine vehicles that do not have the
capability of regenerative braking, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm
(GA)-based eco-driving technique for EVs considering regenerative braking. In
the proposed approach, the optimal or near-optimal combination of variables in
the driving cycle of EVs is searched using GA. The proposed approach starts by
generating an initial population of chromosomes, where all variables under
consideration are encoded in each chromosome. This population of chromosomes is
passed through crossover, mutation, and elitist-based selection over a certain
number of generations, which results in a driving cycle with the least energy
consumption. The proposed method is verified using two case studies. The
results of the case studies show the capability of the proposed method in

deep learning for large datasets as well as complex models. However, the
limited scalability caused by network overheads makes it difficult to
synchronize the parameters of all workers. To resolve this problem,
gossip-based methods that demonstrates stable scalability regardless of the
number of workers have been proposed. However, to use gossip-based methods in
general cases, the validation accuracy for a large mini-batch needs to be
verified. To verify this, we first empirically study the characteristics of
gossip methods in a large mini-batch problem and observe that the gossip
methods preserve higher validation accuracy than AllReduce-SGD(Stochastic
Gradient Descent) when the number of batch sizes is increased and the number of
workers is fixed. However, the delayed parameter propagation of the
gossip-based models decreases validation accuracy in large node scales. To cope
with this problem, we propose Crossover-SGD that alleviates the delay
propagation of weight parameters via segment-wise communication and load
balancing random network topology. We also adapt hierarchical communication to
limit the number of workers in gossip-based communication methods. To validate
the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct empirical experiments and
observe that our Crossover-SGD shows higher node scalability than

cost of a looser control of channel length, and a successful key-transfer using
this technique in a real world remains a significant challenge. Using

moved towards the boundary, multiple quantum phase transitions periodically
occur in which the parity of the superconducting condensate oscillates between
even and odd. We find that the magnetic ground state configuration of two

explicitly on their distance away from the boundary of the nanowire. As a
consequence, the magnetic ground state can switch from ferromagnetic to

Recent work has focused on investigating backdoor attacks on natural images or

understood in complex real-world applications, such as in medical imaging where
misdiagnosis can be very costly. In this paper, we explore the impact of
backdoor attacks on a multi-label disease classification task using chest

architecture demonstrates that by introducing images with few-pixel

successfully without having to be involved with the training procedure. A
simple 3$\times$3 pixel trigger can achieve up to 1.00 Area Under the Receiver

set of clean images, the backdoored neural network could still achieve up to
0.85 AUROC, highlighting the stealthiness of the attack. As the use of deep

between the different values of l. Landau levels associated with the sub-bands,
with the selection rule. An energy splitting between the two polarised
components was observed for each Landau level transition. This was found to be
equal to the sum of the conduction and valence band spin splittings. We used
the know value of electron g factor to determine the valence band spin
splittings. Our experimental values were compared to the numerically calculated
values and were found to be in reasonable agreement.

ownership. Most multimedia content like images and videos are transmitted or
saved in the compressed form. This kind of lossy compression, such as JPEG, can
destroy the hidden data, which raises the need of robust data hiding. It is
still an open challenge to achieve the goal of data hiding that can be against
these compressions. Recently, deep learning has shown large success in data
hiding, while non-differentiability of JPEG makes it challenging to train a
deep pipeline for improving robustness against lossy compression. The existing
SOTA approaches replace the non-differentiable parts with differentiable
modules that perform similar operations. Multiple limitations exist: (a) large
engineering effort; (b) requiring a white-box knowledge of compression attacks;
(c) only works for simple compression like JPEG. In this work, we propose a
simple yet effective approach to address all the above limitations at once.
Beyond JPEG, our approach has been shown to improve robustness against various
image and video lossy compression algorithms.

labeled samples from the source domain and unlabeled samples from the target

three terms: source risk, distribution discrepancy, and combined risk. Based on
the assumption that the combined risk is a small fixed value, methods based on
this bound train a target classifier by only minimizing estimators of the
source risk and the distribution discrepancy. However, the combined risk may
increase when minimizing both estimators, which makes the target risk
uncontrollable. Hence the target classifier cannot achieve ideal performance if
we fail to control the combined risk. To control the combined risk, the key
challenge takes root in the unavailability of the labeled samples in the target
domain. To address this key challenge, we propose a method named E-MixNet.
E-MixNet employs enhanced mixup, a generic vicinal distribution, on the labeled
source samples and pseudo-labeled target samples to calculate a proxy of the
combined risk. Experiments show that the proxy can effectively curb the
increase of the combined risk when minimizing the source risk and distribution
discrepancy. Furthermore, we show that if the proxy of the combined risk is
added into loss functions of four representative UDA methods, their performance
is also improved.

distribution $\pi$ defined on a space $(\Theta,\mathcal{T})$ consist of the
simulation of realisations of Markov chains $\{\theta_{n},n\geq1\}$ of
invariant distribution $\pi$ and such that the distribution of $\theta_{i}$
converges to $\pi$ as $i\rightarrow\infty$. In practice one is typically
interested in the computation of expectations of functions, say $f$, with
respect to $\pi$ and it is also required that averages
$M^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{M}f(\theta_{n})$ converge to the expectation of interest.
The iterative nature of MCMC makes it difficult to develop generic methods to
take advantage of parallel computing environments when interested in reducing
time to convergence. While numerous approaches have been proposed to reduce the
variance of ergodic averages, including averaging over independent realisations
of $\{\theta_{n},n\geq1\}$ simulated on several computers, techniques to reduce
the ""burn-in"" of MCMC are scarce. In this paper we explore a simple and generic
approach to improve convergence to equilibrium of existing algorithms which
rely on the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) update, the main building block of MCMC.
The main idea is to use averages of the acceptance ratio w.r.t. multiple
realisations of random variables involved, while preserving $\pi$ as invariant
distribution. The methodology requires limited change to existing code, is
naturally suited to parallel computing and is shown on our examples to provide
substantial performance improvements both in terms of convergence to
equilibrium and variance of ergodic averages. In some scenarios gains are
observed even on a serial machine.

paper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG
signals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem
of ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of
these detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a
novel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used
integrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This
CNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block
followed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation
map of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been
trained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel
ECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can
be conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable
device. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China
Physiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one
million beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves

best R-peak detection performance ever achieved. Compared to all competing

false-negatives in Holter ECG signals by more than 54% and 82%, respectively.
Results also demonstrate similar or better performance than most competing

the number of support vectors becomes really large. Particularly LiDAR spins

the method is a direct solver with a deterministic operation and communication

dominant computational cost is solving the cyclic tridiagonal linear systems of
compact numerical schemes on a 3D periodic domain. The algorithm is
particularly useful for solving the linear systems arising from the application

the same year as the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United Nations
emphasized the importance of providing COVID-19 vaccines as ""a global public

vaccines is a controversial topic. We use optimization and game theoretic
approaches to model the COVID-19 U.S. vaccine market as a duopoly with two
manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The results suggest that even in the
context of very high production and distribution costs, the government can
negotiate prices with the manufacturers to keep public sector prices as low as
possible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a target
profit. Furthermore, these prices are consistent with those currently predicted
in the media.

concerns, but measurement challenges impede product development and hazard
assessment. To meet these challenges, we advance a lateral nanoflow assay that
integrates complex nanofluidic replicas, optical localization microscopy, and
novel statistical analyses. We apply our sample-in-answer-out system to measure
polystyrene nanoparticles that sorb and carry hydrophobic fluorophores. An
elegant scaling of surface forces automates advection and dominates diffusion
to drive the analytical separation of colloidal nanoparticles by their steric
diameters. Reference nanoparticles, with a mean of 99 nm and a standard
deviation of 8.4 nm, test the unknown limits of silicone replicas to function
as separation matrices. New calibrations correct aberrations from microscope
and device, improving the accuracy of reducing single micrographs to joint
histograms of steric diameter and fluorescence intensity. A dimensional model
approaches the information limit of the system to discriminate size exclusion
from surface adsorption, yielding errors of the mean ranging from 0.2 nm to 2.3
nm and errors of the standard deviation ranging from 2.2 nm to 4.2 nm. A
hierarchical model accounts for metrological, optical, and dimensional
variability to reveal a fundamental structure-property relationship. Intensity
scales with diameter to the power of 3.6 +/- 0.5 at 95 % coverage, confounding
basic concepts of surface adsorption or volume absorption. Distributions of
fluorescivity - the product of the number density, absorption cross section,
and quantum yield of an ensemble of fluorophores - are ultrabroad and
asymmetric, limiting any inference from fluorescence intensity. This surprising
characterization of common nanoplastics resets expectations for optimizing
products, applying standards, and understanding byproducts.

singularity point of back holes. Also, the quintessence scalar field is a
candidate model for describing late-time acceleration expansion. Accordingly,
Kazakov and Solodukhin considered the existence of back-reaction of the
spacetime due to the quantum fluctuations of the background metric to deform
Schwarzschild black hole, which led to change the intrinsic singularity of the
black hole to a 2-sphere with a radius of the order of the Planck length. Also,
Kiselev rewrote the Schwarzschild metric by taking into account the
quintessence field in the background. In this study, we consider the
quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Kazakov-Solodukhin's
work, and Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence deduced by
Kiselev to study the mutual effects of quantum fluctuations and quintessence on
the accretion onto the black hole. Consequently, the radial component of
4-velocity and the proper energy density of the accreting fluid have a finite
value on the surface of its central 2-sphere due to the presence of quantum
corrections. Also, by comparing the accretion parameters in different kinds of
black holes, we infer that the presence of a point-like electric charge in the
spacetime is somewhat similar to some quantum fluctuations in the background
metric.

developed using twelve multilayer patch antennas with unique radiation

stemming from the need for reliable data to validate urban climate models and
obtain a better understanding of urban climate features. Also contributing to
this growth is the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme, firstly developed to
enhance the accuracy in the contextualisation of urban measurements, and lately
used for characterising urban areas. Due to its relative novelty, researchers
are still investigating the potential of LCZs and its indicators for urban
temperature variability detection. In this respect, the present study
introduces the results of an extensive monitoring campaign carried out in the
city of Madrid over a two-year period (2016-2018). The aim of this work is to
further examine the relationships between LCZs and air temperature differences,
with emphasis on their hourly and seasonal evolution. A graphical and
statistical analysis to identify temperature variability trends for each LCZ is
performed. Results support the existing evidence suggesting a high level of
effectiveness in capturing the heat island (UHI) profile of different urban
areas, while underperforming when it comes to capturing diurnal temperature
variability. The incorporation of indicators that explain the daytime
temperature variation phenomenon into the LCZ scheme is therefore recommended,
warranting further research.

Ockham's Razor to interpret quantum observations and to evaluate terminology
associated with wave-particle duality. One finds that the Correspondence
Principle (CP), combined with classical wave DSEs, e.g., Young [1804], is
sufficient to separate and anticipate the observed quantum particle and wave
phenomena. The empirical approach of Ockham infers that individual quanta are
only whole particles during transit from source to detector; an individual
quantum never acts as a wave. The wave nature of quanta emerges only in the
distribution of large numbers of single-quantum observation events. That is,
the ""measurement problem"" is no problem at all; ""particle"" and ""wave"" derive
from separate and different aspects of a set of observations. Such artificial
constructs as wave function collapse are irrelevant to the observation of
individual quanta, each of which acts as a whole ""particle"" from emission to
measurement. The histogram of detected events is a collective property
identical to a classical wave interference pattern in the limit of large
numbers, as the CP decrees. For a specific quantum, Ockham's Razor renders
irrelevant any hypothesis regarding wave- or particle-like behavior of the
quantum in the region between emission and detection. To analyze actual data
sets consisting of a large number of identical observation events and to
predict future DSEs, the CP of standard quantum (wave) mechanics is sufficient:
in the limit, the distribution of observations approaches the continuous
density defined by the standard quantum mechanical wave function. Scientific
progress beyond this picture requires new, relevant experiments. From the DSE,
Ockham's Razor infers that a theoretical quantum system consists of at least
one quantum particle plus a wave function specifying the distribution of a
large number of such particles.
