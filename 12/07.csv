existence results for such problems where the perturbations satisfy a suitable

classical subject of biophysics that has received much attention recently. It
may be involved in potassium accumulation \textcolor{black}{including}
spreading depression, perhaps migraine and some kinds of epilepsy, even
(speculatively) learning. Quantitative analysis is likely to help evaluate the
role of potassium clearance from the extracellular space after a train of
action potentials. Clearance involves three structures that extend down the
length of the nerve: glia, extracellular space, and axon and so need to be
described as systems distributed in space in the tradition used for electrical
potential in the `cable equations' of nerve since the work of Hodgkin in 1937.
A three-compartment model is proposed here for the optic nerve and is used to
study the accumulation of potassium and its clearance. The model allows the
convection, diffusion, and electrical migration of water and ions. We depend on
the data of Orkand et al to ensure the relevance of our model and align its
parameters with the anatomy and properties of membranes, channels, and
transporters: our model fits their experimental data quite well. The aligned
model shows that glia has an important role in buffering potassium, as
expected. The model shows that potassium is cleared mostly by convective flow
through the syncytia of glia driven by osmotic pressure differences. A
simplified model might be possible, but it must involve flow down the length of
the optic nerve. It is easy for compartment models to neglect this flow. Our
model can be used for structures quite different from the optic nerve that
might have different distributions of channels and transporters in its three
compartments. It can be generalized to include a fourth (distributed)
compartment representing blood vessels to deal with the glymphatic flow into
the circulatory system.

about 40 km resolution. However, their coarse scale restricts the range of
applications. While SMAP included an L-band radar to downscale the radiometer
soil moisture to 9 km, the radar failed after 3 months and this initial

of afflictions linked to a modern sedentary lifestyle and improvements on life
expectancy, for example though the application area of physiotherapy.
Motion-based games for health (MGH) are being discussed in research and
industry for their ability to play a supportive role in health, by offering
motivation to engage in treatments, objective insights on status and
development, and guidance regarding treatment activities. Difficulty settings
in games are typically limited to few discrete tiers. For most serious
applications in health, more fine-grained and far-reaching adjustments are
required. The need for applying adjustments on complex sets of parameters can
be overwhelming for patient-players and even trained professionals. Automatic
adaptivity and efficient manual adaptability are thus major concerns for the
design and development of MGH. Despite a growing amount of research on specific
methods for adaptivity, general considerations on human-computer interaction
with adaptable and adaptive MGH are rare. This thesis therefore focuses on
establishing and augmenting theory for adaptability and adaptivity in
human-computer interaction in the context of MGH. Working with older adults and
people with Parkinson's disease as frequent target groups that can benefit from
tailored activities, explorations and comparative studies that investigate the
design, acceptance, and effectiveness of MGH are presented. The outcomes
encourage the application of adaptivity for MGH following iterative
human-centred design that considers the respective interests of stakeholders,
provided that the users receive adequate information and are empowered to exert
control over the automated system when desired or required, and if adaptivity
is embedded in such a way that it does not interfere with the users' sense of
competence or autonomy.

classifier has attracted much recent attention. Most previous works have
focused on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is
completely adversarial or always equally prefers the positive label. In this
paper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework for strategic
classification, and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to
capture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably
generalizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by
Cullina et al. arXiv:1806.01471. We instantiate our framework for the
fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1)
the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2)
its computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical
risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is
always upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension. This characterization also
strictly generalizes the AVC bound for linear classifiers in arXiv:1806.01471.

manner. The proposed method, called Pseudo Labelling, consists of first
applying a randomly sampled set of data augmentation transformations to each
training image. As a result, each initial image can be considered as a
pseudo-label to its corresponding augmented ones. Then, an Auto-Encoder is used
to learn the mapping between each set of the augmented images and its
corresponding pseudo-label. Furthermore, the perceptual loss is employed to
take into consideration the existing dependencies between the pixels in the
same neighbourhood of an image. This combination encourages the encoder to
output richer encodings that are highly informative of the input's class.
Consequently, the Auto-Encoder's performance on unsupervised image
classification is improved in terms of stability, accuracy and consistency
across all tested datasets. Previous state-of-the-art accuracy on the MNIST,

KATRec learns the short and long-term interests of users by modeling their

  Motivation: Owing to the rapid development of deep learning, in recent years
there have been a number of breakthroughs in the domain of Natural Language
Processing. Since these methods are capable of performing different tasks when
trained with a sufficient amount of data, off-the-shelf models are used to
perform various biological applications. In this study, we investigated the
applicability of the popular Skip-gram model for protein sequence analysis and
made an attempt to incorporate some biological insights into it.
  Results: We propose a novel $k$-mer embedding scheme, Align-gram, which is
capable of mapping the similar $k$-mers close to each other in a vector space.
Furthermore, we experiment with other sequence-based protein representations
and observe that the embeddings derived from Align-gram aids modeling and
training deep learning models better. Our experiments with a simple baseline

system subject to additive disturbances and polyhedral constraints on the state

collection of dynamically coupled subsystems, where each subsystem is assumed
to have a dedicated local controller. The decentralization of information is
expressed according to sparsity constraints on the state measurements that each
local controller has access to. We investigate the design of decentralized
controllers that are affinely parameterized in their measurement history. For
problems with partially nested information structures, the optimization over
such restricted policy spaces is known to be convex. Convexity is not, however,
guaranteed under more general (nonclassical) information structures, where the
information available to one local controller can be affected by control
actions that it cannot reconstruct. To address the nonconvexity that arises in
such problems, we propose an approach to decentralized control design where
such information-coupling states are effectively treated as disturbances whose
trajectories are constrained to take values in ellipsoidal ""contract"" sets

experimental units into two groups in order to minimize error in estimating an
additive treatment effect. One concern is minimizing error at the experimental
design stage is large covariate imbalance between the two groups. Another
concern is robustness of design to misspecification in response models. We
address both concerns in our proposed design: we first place subjects into
pairs using optimal nonbipartite matching, making our estimator robust to
complicated non-linear response models. Our innovation is to keep the matched
pairs extant, take differences of the covariate values within each matched pair
and then we use the greedy switching heuristic of Krieger et al. (2019) or
rerandomization on these differences. This latter step greatly reduce covariate
imbalance to the rate $O_p(n^{-4})$ in the case of one covariate that are
uniformly distributed. This rate benefits from the greedy switching heuristic
which is $O_p(n^{-3})$ and the rate of matching which is $O_p(n^{-1})$.
Further, our resultant designs are shown to be as random as matching which is
robust to unobserved covariates. When compared to previous designs, our
approach exhibits significant improvement in the mean squared error of the
treatment effect estimator when the response model is nonlinear and performs at
least as well when it the response model is linear. Our design procedure is
found as a method in the open source R package available on CRAN called
GreedyExperimentalDesign.

Operational space is documented in terms of engineering and physics parameters,

also discriminates no-ELM regimes and is found to rise linearly with IaB and
also benefits from tolerance to power. The highest normalized performance using
the metric <p>$\tau$/IaB is found in QH and RMP regimes. Though comparable QH
and RMP performance is found, the pedestal pressure (p_ped) is very different.
p_ped in RMP plasmas is relatively low, and the best performance is found with
a high core <p> fraction alongside high core rotation, consistent with an ExB
shear confinement enhancement. p_ped of QH plasmas is significantly higher than
RMP, and QH performance does not correlate with core rotation. However, the
highest QH p_ped are found with high carbon fraction. While normalized
performance of Neg-D plasmas is comparable to QH and RMP plasmas, the absolute
confinement of Neg-D is lower, owing to low elongation and low p_ped achieved

distribution measured in a groove for several independent runs is explained by
different mechanisms, like the random position of fluorescent seeding particles
at various height of the groove, the hydrodynamic interactions between
longitudinal and transverse grooves, and the random location of the transverse

the empirical power of the proposed method with the arcsine square-root

widely used to gain insight into the evolution and probability of rare events.
At its core lies the realization that rare events are, under the right
circumstances, dominated by their least unlikely realization. Their computation
through a saddle-point approximation of the path integral for the corresponding
stochastic field theory then reduces an inefficient stochastic sampling problem
into a deterministic optimization problem: finding the path of smallest action,
the instanton. In the presence of heavy tails, though, standard algorithms to
compute the instanton critically fail to converge. The reason for this failure
is the divergence of the scaled cumulant generating function (CGF) due to a
non-convex large deviation rate function. We propose a solution to this problem
by ""convexifying"" the rate function through nonlinear reparametrization of the
observable, which allows us to compute instantons even in the presence of
super-exponential or algebraic tail decay. The approach is generalizable to
other situations where the existence of the CGF is required, such as
exponential tilting in importance sampling for Monte-Carlo algorithms. We
demonstrate the proposed formalism by applying it to rare events in several

success in handling multiple correlated time series, they may be impractical in
some real-world scenarios due to a lack of sufficient high-quality training
data. Furthermore, spatio-temporal graph neural networks lack theoretical
interpretation. To address these issues, we put forth a novel mathematically
designed framework to analyze spatio-temporal data. Our proposed
spatio-temporal graph scattering transform (ST-GST) extends traditional
scattering transforms to the spatio-temporal domain. It performs iterative
applications of spatio-temporal graph wavelets and nonlinear activation
functions, which can be viewed as a forward pass of spatio-temporal graph
convolutional networks without training. Since all the filter coefficients in
ST-GST are mathematically designed, it is promising for the real-world
scenarios with limited training data, and also allows for a theoretical
analysis, which shows that the proposed ST-GST is stable to small perturbations
of input signals and structures. Finally, our experiments show that i) ST-GST
outperforms spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks by an increase of 35%
in accuracy for MSR Action3D dataset; ii) it is better and computationally more
efficient to design the transform based on separable spatio-temporal graphs
than the joint ones; and iii) the nonlinearity in ST-GST is critical to
empirical performance.

mixing state, is a convenient measure for quantifying these errors. Global
estimates of aerosol mixing state indices have recently become available via
supervised learning models, but require regionalization to ease spatiotemporal
analysis. Here we developed a simple but effective unsupervised learning
approach to regionalize predictions of global aerosol mixing state indices. We
used the monthly average of aerosol mixing state indices global distribution as
the input data. Grid cells were then clustered into regions by the k-means
algorithm without explicit spatial information as input. This approach resulted
in eleven regions over the globe with specific spatial aggregation patterns.
Each region exhibited a unique distribution of mixing state indices and aerosol
compositions, showing the effectiveness of the unsupervised regionalization
approach. This study defines ""aerosol mixing state zones"" that could be useful
for atmospheric science research.

dietary assessment. However, due to the different complexity level of food
images and inter-class similarity of food categories, it is challenging for an
image-based food recognition system to achieve high accuracy for a variety of
publicly available datasets. In this work, we propose a new two-step food
recognition system that includes food localization and hierarchical food
classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the backbone
architecture. The food localization step is based on an implementation of the
Faster R-CNN method to identify food regions. In the food classification step,
visually similar food categories can be clustered together automatically to
generate a hierarchical structure that represents the semantic visual relations
among food categories, then a multi-task CNN model is proposed to perform the
classification task based on the visual aware hierarchical structure. Since the
size and quality of dataset is a key component of data driven methods, we
introduce a new food image dataset, VIPER-FoodNet (VFN) dataset, consists of 82
food categories with 15k images based on the most commonly consumed foods in
the United States. A semi-automatic crowdsourcing tool is used to provide the
ground-truth information for this dataset including food object bounding boxes
and food object labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can
significantly improve both classification and recognition performance on 4

  sample sizes","19 pages, 9 figures. In submission at Digital Threats: Research and
  Practice",,,,"cs.CR stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  U.S. elections rely heavily on computers such as voter registration
databases, electronic pollbooks, voting machines, scanners, tabulators, and
results reporting websites. These introduce digital threats to election
outcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems
by manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance
of correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a
trustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are
correct. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot
cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all
cast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of
ballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as
the number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more
contests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases
(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the
contest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of
small contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about
which ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style
data (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to
audit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD
reduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two
contests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every
ballot and the other is on 10% of ballots. In realistic examples, the savings
can be several orders of magnitude.

Traditionally, the two wicks are manufactured separately and subsequently
joined, thereby creating an interface that reduces the liquid transfer
efficiency. In order to overcome this situation, a gradient porous wick is
proposed and successfully manufactured through the freeze-casting method in a
single operation. The influence of two different dispersant agents, KD4 and
stearic acid was studied on the processing parameters, final pore size and
morphology, and capillarity performances. A variate of gradient porosity was
obtained by applying a diverse thermal gradient and solidification front
velocity during directional solidification. The rheological characterisation of

The final pore size and morphology were characterised by Optical Microscopy,

use of stearic acid improves the particle stabilisation and generates pore
enlargement with an equiaxed pore structure, while commercial dispersant KD4

partitioned into several regions, each with distinct types of efficient
kinematics. These include kinematics resembling lateral undulation with very
anisotropic friction, small-amplitude reciprocal kinematics, very large
amplitude kinematics near isotropic friction, and kinematics that are very
asymmetric about the flat state. In the two-parameter shape space, zero net
rotation for elliptical trajectories occurs mainly with bilateral or antipodal
symmetry. These symmetric subspaces have about the same peak efficiency as the
full space but with much smaller dimension. Adding modes with two or three
times the basic frequency greatly increases the numbers of local optimal for
efficiency, but only modestly increases the peak efficiency. Random ensembles
with higher frequencies have efficiency distributions that peak near a certain
nonzero value and decay rapidly up to the maximum efficiency. A stochastic
optimization algorithm is developed to compute optima with higher frequencies.
These are simple closed curves, sharpened versions of the elliptical optima in
most cases, and achieve much higher efficiencies mainly for small normal
friction. With a linear resistance law, the optimal trajectories are similar in
much of friction coefficient space, and relative efficiencies are much lower
except with very large normal friction.

these results performed within the astrometry task. The processing broadly
followed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements
to the modelling of observations. For the first time in the Gaia data
processing, colour-dependent calibrations of the line- and point-spread
functions have been used for sources with well-determined colours from DR2. In
the astrometric processing these sources obtained five-parameter solutions,
whereas other sources were processed using a special calibration that allowed a
pseudocolour to be estimated as the sixth astrometric parameter. Compared with
DR2, the astrometric calibration models have been extended, and the
spin-related distortion model includes a self-consistent determination of
basic-angle variations, improving the global parallax zero point. Gaia EDR3
gives full astrometric data (positions at epoch J2016.0, parallaxes, and proper
motions) for 1.468 billion sources (585 million with five-parameter solutions,
882 million with six parameters), and mean positions at J2016.0 for an
additional 344 million. Solutions with five parameters are generally more
accurate than six-parameter solutions, and are available for 93% of the sources
brighter than G = 17 mag. The median uncertainty in parallax and annual proper
motion is 0.02-0.03 mas at magnitude G = 9 to 14, and around 0.5 mas at G = 20.
Extensive characterisation of the statistical properties of the solutions is

properties is often a key ingredient in the design of divide-and-conquer
algorithms. For questions related to location, the partition problem can be
modeled, in geometric terms, as finding a subdivision of a planar map -- which
represents, say, a geographical area -- into regions subject to certain
conditions while optimizing some objective function. In this paper, we
investigate one of these geometric problems known as the Minimum Convex
Partition Problem (MCPP). A convex partition of a point set $P$ in the plane is
a subdivision of the convex hull of $P$ whose edges are segments with both
endpoints in $P$ and such that all internal faces are empty convex polygons.
The MCPP is an NP-hard problem where one seeks to find a convex partition with
the least number of faces.
  We present a novel polygon-based integer programming formulation for the
MCPP, which leads to better dual bounds than the previously known edge-based
model. Moreover, we introduce a primal heuristic, a branching rule and a
pricing algorithm. The combination of these techniques leads to the ability to
solve instances with twice as many points as previously possible while
constrained to identical computational resources. A comprehensive experimental
study is presented to show the impact of our design choices.

minimally-interventional safety controller operating within an autonomous
vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free interaction with
an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart while respecting
static obstacles such as a road boundary wall. We leverage reachability
analysis to construct a real-time (100Hz) controller that serves the dual role
of (i) tracking an input trajectory from a higher-level planning algorithm
using model predictive control, and (ii) assuring safety by maintaining the
availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a persistent constraint
regardless of whatever future actions the other car takes. A full-scale
steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic weaving experiments wherein
two cars, initially side-by-side, must swap lanes in a limited amount of time
and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off of a highway. We demonstrate
that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid collision
even when the other car defies the planner's expectations and takes dangerous
actions, either carelessly or with the intent to collide, and otherwise
deviates minimally from the planned trajectory to the extent required to
maintain safety.

applied to density estimation, mostly due to the unsupervised nature of the
estimation task, and (especially) due to the need for constrained training
algorithms that ended up realizing proper probabilistic models that satisfy
Kolmogorov's axioms. Moreover, in spite of the well-known improvement in terms
of modeling capabilities yielded by mixture models over plain single-density
statistical estimators, no proper mixtures of multivariate DNN-based component
densities have been investigated so far. The paper fills this gap by extending
our previous work on Neural Mixture Densities (NMMs) to multivariate DNN
mixtures. A maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm for estimating Deep NMMs (DNMMs)
is handed out, which satisfies numerically a combination of hard and soft
constraints aimed at ensuring satisfaction of Kolmogorov's axioms. The class of
probability density functions that can be modeled to any degree of precision

DNMM architecture, as well as of the hyperparameters for its ML training

Experimental results on univariate and multivariate data are reported on,

We apply the Combo-relation to a sample of 174 gamma ray bursts to investigate

gamma ray burst Hubble's diagram and then we estimate the set ($\Omega_m$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$) in the framework of flat and non-flat $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm. We then get bounds over the $w$CDM model, where $w$ is thought to
evolve with redshift, adopting two priors over the Hubble constant in tension
at $4.4$-$\sigma$, i.e. $H_0=(67.4\pm0.5)$ km/s/Mpc and $H_0=(74.03\pm1.42)$
km/s/Mpc. We show our new sample provides tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$
since at $z\leq1.2$ we see that $w(z)$ agrees within 1$\sigma$ with the
standard value $w=-1$. The situation is the opposite at larger $z$, where gamma
ray bursts better fix $w(z)$ that seems to deviate from $w=-1$ at $2$-$\sigma$
and $4$-$\sigma$ level, depending on the redshift bins. In particular, we
investigate the $w(z)$ evolution through a piecewise formulation over seven
redshift intervals. From our fitting procedure we show that at $z\geq 1.2$ the
case $w<-1$ cannot be fully excluded, indicating that dark energy's influence
is not negligible at larger $z$. We confirm the Combo relation as a powerful
tool to investigate cosmological evolution of dark energy. Future space
missions will significantly enrich the gamma ray burst database even at smaller
redshifts, improving de facto the results discussed in this paper.

is a viscosity solution to a set of first-order equations. As a consequence, in
Banach spaces, we provide sufficient conditions for local and global Lipschitz
properties of $v$. We also derive, in finite dimensions, conditions for
optimality through a comparison principle. Finally, we study the relationship
between viscosity and Clarke generalized solutions to get further
differentiability properties of $v$ in Euclidean spaces.

energy efficiency and robustness. In this paper we propose a method for reduced
area and power overhead of self-timed early-propagative asynchronous inference
circuits, designed using the principles of learning automata. Due to natural
resilience to timing as well as logic underpinning, the circuits are tolerant
to variations in environment and supply voltage whilst enabling the lowest
possible latency. Our method is exemplified through an inference datapath for a
low power machine learning application. The circuit builds on the Tsetlin
machine algorithm further enhancing its energy efficiency. Average latency of
the proposed circuit is reduced by 10x compared with the synchronous
implementation whilst maintaining similar area. Robustness of the proposed
circuit is proven through post-synthesis simulation with 0.25 V to 1.2 V
supply. Functional correctness is maintained and latency scales with gate delay
as voltage is decreased.

medical diagnoses, lifestyle predictions, and business decisions highlights the
need to better understand if these ML technologies are introducing leakages of
sensitive and proprietary training data. In this paper, we focus on one kind of
model inversion attacks, where the adversary knows non-sensitive attributes
about instances in the training data and aims to infer the value of a sensitive
attribute unknown to the adversary, using oracle access to the target
classification model. We devise two novel model inversion attribute inference
attacks -- confidence modeling-based attack and confidence score-based attack,
and also extend our attack to the case where some of the other (non-sensitive)
attributes are unknown to the adversary. Furthermore, while previous work uses
accuracy as the metric to evaluate the effectiveness of attribute inference
attacks, we find that accuracy is not informative when the sensitive attribute
distribution is unbalanced. We identify two metrics that are better for
evaluating attribute inference attacks, namely G-mean and Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC). We evaluate our attacks on two types of machine learning
models, decision tree and deep neural network, trained with two real datasets.
Experimental results show that our newly proposed attacks significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art attacks. Moreover, we empirically show that
specific groups in the training dataset (grouped by attributes, e.g., gender,
race) could be more vulnerable to model inversion attacks. We also demonstrate
that our attacks' performances are not impacted significantly when some of the
other (non-sensitive) attributes are also unknown to the adversary.

cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds
will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology
and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative
process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem
by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate
the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a
novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover.
It moves each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where
the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore,
PMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the
constraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a
strict and unique correspondence on point-level, which can capture the detailed
topology and structure relationships between the incomplete shape and the
complete target, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape.
We conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which
demonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion

of Wasserstein distance, is one of the most theoretically sound GAN models.
However, in practice it does not always outperform other variants of GANs. This
is mostly due to the imperfect implementation of the Lipschitz condition
required by the KR duality. Extensive work has been done in the community with
different implementations of the Lipschitz constraint, which, however, is still
hard to satisfy the restriction perfectly in practice. In this paper, we argue
that the strong Lipschitz constraint might be unnecessary for optimization.
Instead, we take a step back and try to relax the Lipschitz constraint.
Theoretically, we first demonstrate a more general dual form of the Wasserstein
distance called the Sobolev duality, which relaxes the Lipschitz constraint but
still maintains the favorable gradient property of the Wasserstein distance.
Moreover, we show that the KR duality is actually a special case of the Sobolev

single-layer ($p=1$) Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) when
being used to solve Ising problems. The landscapes are obtained using an
analytical formula that we derive. The formula allows us to predict the
landscape for any given Ising problem instance and consequently predict the
optimal QAOA parameters for heuristically solving that instance using the
single-layer QAOA. We have validated our analytical formula by showing that it
accurately reproduces the landscapes published in recent experimental reports.
We then applied our methods to address the question: how well is the
single-layer QAOA able to solve large benchmark problem instances? We used our
analytical formula to calculate the optimal energy-expectation values for
benchmark MAX-CUT problems containing up to $7\,000$ vertices and $41\,459$
edges. We also calculated the optimal energy expectations for general Ising
problems with up to $100\,000$ vertices and $150\,000$ edges. Our results
provide an estimate for how well the single-layer QAOA may work when run on a
quantum computer with thousands of qubits. In addition to providing performance
estimates when optimal angles are used, we are able to use our analytical
results to investigate the difficulties one may encounter when running the QAOA
in practice for different classes of Ising instances. We find that depending on
the parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian, the expectation-value landscapes can
be rather complex, with sharp features that necessitate highly accurate
rotation gates in order for the QAOA to be run optimally on quantum hardware.
We also present analytical results that explain some of the qualitative
landscape features that are observed numerically.

well. However, no study appears to have researched whether this is accurate in

are handled in agile SE teams in practice. We also wanted to know whether
responding to changes is the only or a main reason for software teams to use
agile in their projects. To do this we conducted a mixed-methods research study
which comprised of interviews of 10 agile practitioners from New Zealand and
Australia, a literature review, and an in-depth survey with the participation
of 40 agile practitioners world-wide. Through this study we identified
different types of RCs, their origination including reasons for origination,
forms, sources, carriers, and events at which they originate, challenging
nature, and finally whether agile helps to respond to changes or not. We also
found that agile teams seem to be reluctant to accept RCs, and therefore, they
use several mitigation strategies. Additionally, as they accept the RCs, they
use a variety of techniques to handle them. Furthermore, we found that agile
allowing better response to RCs is only a minor reason for practicing agile.
Several more important reasons included being able to deliver the product in a
shorter period and increasing team productivity. Practitioners stated this
improves the agile team environment and thus are the real motivators for teams
to practice agile. Finally, we provide a set of practical recommendations that
can be used to better handle RCs effectively in agile software development

long-term FD services, various power-saving strategies have been implemented.
Among them, a reduced sampling rate is a common approach for an

systems is diminished owing to low-resolution (LR) accelerometer signals. To
improve the detection accuracy with LR accelerometer signals, several technical
challenges must be considered, including misalignment, mismatch of effective

high-resolution (HR) signals from the LR signals by learning the relationship
between the LR and HR signals. The results show that the FD system using

trade-off relations in decomposing DNNs. We define hostile factor as an element
that interferes with finding the attributions of the target and propagate it in
a distinguishable way to overcome the non-suppressed nature of activated
neurons. As a result, it is possible to assign the bi-polar relevance scores of
the target (positive) and hostile (negative) attributions while maintaining
each attribution aligned with the importance. We also present the purging
techniques to prevent the decrement of the gap between the relevance scores of
the target and hostile attributions during backward propagation by eliminating
the conflicting units to channel attribution map. Therefore, our method makes

Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm in LRTC and TRPCA implicitly via the component vectors.
The method scales to big tensors and provides an arbitrarily sharper rank proxy
for low-rank tensor recovery compared to the nuclear norm. On the other hand,
we study the generalization abilities of LRTC with the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm
regularizer and LRTC with the proposed regularizers. The theorems show that a
relatively sharper regularizer leads to a tighter error bound, which is
consistent with our numerical results. Particularly, we prove that for LRTC

communication link with continuous state-space of channel. The aim of
scheduling is to minimize the average power for data transmission when the
average delay is constrained. More specifically, the optimal cross-layer
scheduling problem was formulated as a variational problem. Based on the
variational problem, we show the optimality of the deterministic scheduling
policy through a constructive proof. The optimality of the deterministic policy
allows us to compress the searching space from the probabilistic policies to
the deterministic policies.

display subharmonic magnetization dynamics reminiscent to that of discrete time

between states differing by a single spin excitation, thus preserving the
MPM-induced $\pi/T$ quasienergy spacing of the Floquet eigenstates in the

predicts the probability that the bit is $1$. The forecaster is called
well-calibrated if for each $p \in [0, 1]$, among the $n_p$ bits for which the
forecaster predicts probability $p$, the actual number of ones, $m_p$, is
indeed equal to $p \cdot n_p$. The calibration error, defined as $\sum_p |m_p -
p n_p|$, quantifies the extent to which the forecaster deviates from being
well-calibrated. It has long been known that an $O(T^{2/3})$ calibration error
is achievable even when the bits are chosen adversarially, and possibly based
on the previous predictions. However, little is known on the lower bound side,
except an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ bound that follows from the trivial example of
independent fair coin flips.

obstacles that have previously hindered strong calibration lower bounds. We
also propose an abstraction of the prediction setting, termed the
Sign-Preservation game, which may be of independent interest. This game has a
much smaller state space than the full prediction setting and allows simpler
analyses. The $\Omega(T^{0.528})$ lower bound follows from a general reduction

plays an important role in the information forensics and security field as the
appearance of the face typically varies with age. Although impressive results
have been achieved with conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs),
the existing cGANs-based methods typically use a single network to learn
various aging effects between any two different age groups. However, they
cannot simultaneously meet three essential requirements of face aging --
including image quality, aging accuracy, and identity preservation -- and
usually generate aged faces with strong ghost artifacts when the age gap
becomes large. Inspired by the fact that faces gradually age over time, this
paper proposes a novel progressive face aging framework based on generative
adversarial network (PFA-GAN) to mitigate these issues. Unlike the existing
cGANs-based methods, the proposed framework contains several sub-networks to
mimic the face aging process from young to old, each of which only learns some
specific aging effects between two adjacent age groups. The proposed framework
can be trained in an end-to-end manner to eliminate accumulative artifacts and
blurriness. Moreover, this paper introduces an age estimation loss to take into
account the age distribution for an improved aging accuracy, and proposes to
use the Pearson correlation coefficient as an evaluation metric measuring the
aging smoothness for face aging methods. Extensively experimental results
demonstrate superior performance over existing (c)GANs-based methods, including
the state-of-the-art one, on two benchmarked datasets. The source code is

classic iterative methods, such as simultaneous subspace iterations (SSI), are
unable to preserve data privacy, while algorithms based on variable-splitting
and consensus-seeking, such as alternating direction methods of multipliers
(ADMM), lack in communication-efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel
consensus-seeking formulation by equalizing subspaces spanned by splitting
variables instead of equalizing variables themselves, thus greatly relaxing
feasibility restrictions and allowing much faster convergence. Then we develop
an ADMM-like algorithm with several special features to make it practically
efficient, including a low-rank multiplier formula and techniques for treating
subproblems. We establish that the proposed algorithm can better protect data
privacy than classic methods adapted to the federated PCA setting. We derive
convergence results, including a worst-case complexity estimate, for the
proposed ADMM-like algorithm in the presence of the nonlinear equality
constraints. Extensive empirical results are presented to show that the new
algorithm, while enhancing data privacy, requires far fewer rounds of
communication than existing peer algorithms for federated PCA.

However, when the salient region plays a maximal discriminative role in

learning ability of the deep network to capture the features of salient regions
pointedly. The different grades or classes of ophthalmic images may be share
similar overall performance but have subtle differences that can be
differentiated by mining salient regions. To address this issue, we propose a
novel end-to-end network, named Attention-based Saliency Hashing (ASH), for
learning compact hash-code to represent ophthalmic images. ASH embeds a
spatial-attention module to focus more on the representation of salient regions
and highlights their essential role in differentiating ophthalmic images.
Benefiting from the spatial-attention module, the information of salient
regions can be mapped into the hash-code for similarity calculation. In the
training stage, we input the image pairs to share the weights of the network,
and a pairwise loss is designed to maximize the discriminability of the
hash-code. In the retrieval stage, ASH obtains the hash-code by inputting an
image with an end-to-end manner, then the hash-code is used to similarity
calculation to return the most similar images. Extensive experiments on two
different modalities of ophthalmic image datasets demonstrate that the proposed
ASH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods due to the huge contributions of the

formation of multiple-planet systems in resonant chains around low-mass stars.
A time-evolution model of the multiple-planet formation via pebble accretion in
the early phase of the disk evolution is constructed based on the formation
model for the TRAPPIST-1 system by Ormel et al. (2017). Our simulations show
that knowing the protoplanet appearance timescale is important for determining
the number of planets and their trapped resonances: as the protoplanet
appearance timescale increases, fewer planets are formed, which are trapped in
more widely separated resonances. We find that there is a range of the
protoplanet appearance timescale for forming the stable multiple-planet systems
in resonant chains. This range depends on the stellar mass and disk size. We
suggest that the protoplanet appearance timescale is a key parameter for
studying the formation of multiple-planet systems with planets in resonant
chains around low-mass stars. The composition of the planets in our model is
also discussed.

distribution of the permuted modified maximum contrast statistic depends on a
nuisance parameter $\sigma^2$, which is the population variance. In this paper,
we propose a modified maximum contrast method with a statistic that does not

these methods via simulation studies. The simulation results showed that the
modified maximum contrast method gave the lowest false-positive rate;
therefore, this method is powerful for detecting the true response patterns in

Networks (GNNs). However, most existing methods for message passing simply sum
or average all the neighboring features to update node representations. They
are restricted by two problems, i.e., (i) lack of interpretability to identify
node features significant to the prediction of GNNs, and (ii) feature
over-mixing that leads to the over-smoothing issue in capturing long-range
dependencies and inability to handle graphs under heterophily or low homophily.
In this paper, we propose a Node-level Capsule Graph Neural Network (NCGNN) to
address these problems with an improved message passing scheme. Specifically,
NCGNN represents nodes as groups of node-level capsules, in which each capsule
extracts distinctive features of its corresponding node. For each node-level
capsule, a novel dynamic routing procedure is developed to adaptively select
appropriate capsules for aggregation from a subgraph identified by the designed
graph filter. NCGNN aggregates only the advantageous capsules and restrains
irrelevant messages to avoid over-mixing features of interacting nodes.
Therefore, it can relieve the over-smoothing issue and learn effective node
representations over graphs with homophily or heterophily. Furthermore, our
proposed message passing scheme is inherently interpretable and exempt from
complex post-hoc explanations, as the graph filter and the dynamic routing
procedure identify a subset of node features that are most significant to the
model prediction from the extracted subgraph. Extensive experiments on
synthetic as well as real-world graphs demonstrate that NCGNN can well address
the over-smoothing issue and produce better node representations for
semisupervised node classification. It outperforms the state of the arts under
both homophily and heterophily.

Learning to generate multi-instrumental music from videos without labeling the

learns a discrete latent representation of various instruments music from
log-spectrogram using a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with
multi-band residual blocks. The pipeline is then trained along with an
autoregressive prior conditioned on the musician's body keypoints movements
encoded by a recurrent neural network. Joint training of the prior with the
body movements encoder succeeds in the disentanglement of the music into latent
features indicating the musical components and the instrumental features. The
latent space results in distributions that are clustered into distinct

full use of deep features while DORF needs to fix the composition of decision
trees before training. Second, MORF has a novel grouped feature selection (GFS)
module to re-sample the split nodes of decision trees. Last, combined with GFS,
MORF is equipped with a meta learning-based weighting scheme to map the
features selected by GFS to tree-wise weights while DORF assigns equal weights
for all trees. Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate
superior performance over existing methods, including the state-of-the-art
DORF.

computer vision and other signal processing tasks due to their superior
accuracy. In recent years, large efforts have been made to reduce the
computational costs of CNNs in order to achieve real-time operation on
low-power embedded devices.
  Towards this goal we present BinArray, a custom hardware accelerator for CNNs
with binary approximated weights. The binary approximation used in this paper
is an improved version of a network compression technique initially suggested
in [1]. It drastically reduces the number of multiplications required per
inference with no or very little accuracy degradation. BinArray easily scales
and allows to compromise between hardware resource usage and throughput by
means of three design parameters transparent to the user. Furthermore, it is
possible to select between high accuracy or throughput dynamically during
runtime. BinArray has been optimized at the register transfer level and
operates at 400 MHz as instruction-set processor within a heterogenous
XC7Z045-2 FPGA-SoC platform.
  Experimental results show that BinArray scales to match the performance of
other accelerators like EdgeTPU [2] for different network sizes. Even for the
largest MobileNet only 50% of the target device and only 96 DSP blocks are
utilized.

Random Field and introduce a learnable unary term. Besides, we propose a

improvements, our method can better capture long-range dependencies and
preserve structural details with linear complexity, which is extended to
several vision tasks for more generic feature transform. Extensive experiments

Given an initial state, which final states can be reached by the dynamic system

evolution shall be governed by an inevitable Hamiltonian drift term, finitely
many control Hamiltonians allowing for (at least) piecewise constant control
amplitudes, plus a (possibly bang-bang switchable) noise term in
Kossakowski-Lindblad form.
  Now assuming switchable coupling of finite-dimensional systems to a thermal
bath of arbitrary temperature, the core problem of reachability boils down to
studying points in the standard simplex amenable to two types of controls that
can be used interleaved: Permutations within the simplex, and contractions by a
dissipative one-parameter semigroup. We illustrate how the solutions of the
core problem pertain to the reachable set of the original controlled Markovian
quantum system. This allows us to show that for global as well as local
switchable coupling to a temperature-zero bath one can generate every quantum
state from every initial state up to arbitrary precision. Moreover we present
an inclusion for non-zero temperatures as a consequence of our results on
d-majorization.
  Then we consider infinite-dimensional open quantum-dynamical systems
following a unital Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation extended by controls.
Here the drift Hamiltonian can be arbitrary, the finitely many control
Hamiltonians are bounded, and the switchable noise term is generated by a
single compact normal operator. Via new majorization results of ours, we show
that such bilinear quantum control systems allow to approximately reach any
target state majorized by the initial one, as up to now only has been known in
finite-dimensional analogues.

First, we present a Dialogue Discourse-Dware Meeting Summarizer (DDAMS) to
explicitly model the interaction between utterances in a meeting by modeling
different discourse relations. The core module is a relational graph encoder,
where the utterances and discourse relations are modeled in a graph interaction
manner. Moreover, we devise a Dialogue Discourse-Aware Data Augmentation

simple iterative algorithm for nonconvex optimization that sequentially
minimizes the objective function in each block coordinate while the other
coordinates are held fixed. We propose a version of BCD that, for block
multi-convex and smooth objective functions under constraints, is guaranteed to
converge to the stationary points with worst-case rate of convergence of
$O((\log n)^{2}/n)$ for $n$ iterations, and a bound of $O(\epsilon^{-1}(\log
\epsilon^{-1})^{2})$ for the number of iterations to achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. Furthermore, we show that these
results continue to hold even when the convex sub-problems are inexactly solved
if the optimality gaps are uniformly summable against initialization. A key
idea is to restrict the parameter search within a diminishing radius to promote
stability of iterates. As an application, we provide an alternating least
squares algorithm with diminishing radius for nonnegative CP tensor
decomposition that converges to the stationary points of the reconstruction
error with the same robust worst-case convergence rate and complexity bounds.
We also experimentally validate our results with both synthetic and real-world

improve the rate of convergence.

and study the relation between the effective size of voids and the mass of
corresponding clusters. Galaxy cluster-scale dark matter halos are identified
in the Mirror simulation at $z=0$ by linking dark matter particles. The void
corresponding to each cluster is defined in the Reference simulation as the
region occupied by the member particles of the cluster. We study the voids
corresponding to the halos more massive than $10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. We find
a power-law scaling relation between the void size and the corresponding
cluster mass. Voids with corresponding cluster mass above
$10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ occupy $\sim1\%$ of the total simulated volume,
whereas this fraction increases to $\sim54\%$ for voids with corresponding

profile of the identified voids follows a universal functional form. Based on
these findings, we propose a method to identify cluster-counterpart voids

utilizing three parameters such as the smoothing scale, density threshold, and
minimum core fraction. We recover voids corresponding to clusters more massive

labeled training data, and even worse, their distribution is usually more or
less different from the target workload even when they come from the same

  To alleviate the said limitations, this paper proposes a novel risk-based

proposed approach first trains a deep model on labeled training data, and then
fine-tunes it by minimizing its estimated misprediction risk on unlabeled
target data. Our theoretical analysis shows that risk-based adaptive training
can correct the label status of a mispredicted instance with a fairly good
chance. We have also empirically validated the efficacy of the proposed
approach on real benchmark data by a comparative study. Our extensive
experiments show that it can considerably improve the performance of deep
models. Furthermore, in the scenario of distribution misalignment, it can
similarly outperform the state-of-the-art alternative of transfer learning by
considerable margins. Using ER as a test case, we demonstrate that risk-based

two years so far show that: (1) students get much better at evaluating their
own project on some, but not all, of the evaluation criteria after a peer
assessment session, (2) students report in a follow-up survey that they are
more motivated to work on their project, and (3) the relation between
motivation and time spent on the project increases. These results suggest that
peer grading could have positive long-term effects on the reflective, and
therefore lifelong learning, skills of students. A better understanding of the
evaluation criteria results in more accurate self and peer grades, emphasizing
the importance of properly defining and communicating these criteria throughout
the semester.

similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters
that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this

smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination
algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate
of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of
the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit

learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify
the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower

incompressible viscous flow simulations, but it uses many more variables than
necessary. This defect was overcome by a recent approach that solves the more
actual macroscopic equations obtained through Taylor series expansion analysis
of the lattice Boltzmann equations [Lu et al., J. Comp. Phys., 415, 109546
(2020)]. The key is to keep some small additional terms (SATs) to stabilize the
numerical solution of the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations. However,
there are many SATs that complicate the implementation of their method. Based
on some analyses and numerous tests, we ultimately pinpoint two essential
ingredients for stable simulations: (1) suitable density (pressure) diffusion
added to the continuity equation; (2) proper numerical dissipation related to
the velocity divergence added to the momentum equations. Then, we propose a
simplified method that is not only easier to implement but noticeably faster
than the original method and the LBM. It contains much simpler SATs that only
involve the density (pressure) derivatives and it requires no intermediate
steps or variables. Besides, it is extended for two-phase flows with uniform
density and viscosity. Several test cases, including some two-phase problems
under two dimensional, axisymmetric and three dimensional geometries, are
presented to demonstrate its capability. This work may help pave the way for
the simplest simulation of incompressible viscous flows on collocated grids

is consistent with that originating from the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida

improving the performance of agents with the aim of replacing humans in known

tool for video game production, where the aim is instead to create Non-Player
Character (NPC) behaviors, has received relatively little attention until
recently. Turn-based strategy games like Roguelikes, for example, present
unique challenges to DRL. In particular, the categorical nature of their
complex game state, composed of many entities with different attributes,
requires agents able to learn how to compare and prioritize these entities.
Moreover, this complexity often leads to agents that overfit to states seen
during training and that are unable to generalize in the face of design changes
made during development. In this paper we propose two network architectures
which, when combined with a \emph{procedural loot generation} system, are able
to better handle complex categorical state spaces and to mitigate the need for
retraining forced by design decisions. The first is based on a dense embedding
of the categorical input space that abstracts the discrete observation model
and renders trained agents more able to generalize. The second proposed
architecture is more general and is based on a Transformer network able to
reason relationally about input and input attributes. Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates that new agents have better adaptation capacity with
respect to a baseline architecture, making this framework more robust to
dynamic gameplay changes during development. Based on the results shown in this
paper, we believe that these solutions represent a step forward towards making
DRL more accessible to the gaming industry.

realistic situation, we have focused on creating an EEG classification
framework that can be applied directly in unseen sessions, using only
multi-subject/-session data acquired previously. Therefore, in this paper, we
tested four deep learning models and four DG algorithms through
leave-one-session-out validation. Our experiment showed that deeper and larger
models were effective in cross-session generalization performance. Furthermore,
we found that none of the explicit DG algorithms outperformed empirical risk

denoising focuses more on suppressing FP noise and less on resolving the FN

framework for robust distant supervision relation extraction, as an FN
denoising solution. H-FND uses a hierarchical policy which first determines
whether non-relation (NA) instances should be kept, discarded, or revised
during the training process. For those learning instances which are to be
revised, the policy further reassigns them appropriate relations, making them
better training inputs. Experiments on SemEval-2010 and TACRED were conducted
with controlled FN ratios that randomly turn the relations of training and
validation instances into negatives to generate FN instances. In this setting,
H-FND can revise FN instances correctly and maintains high F1 scores even when
50% of the instances have been turned into negatives. Experiment on NYT10 is
further conducted to shows that H-FND is applicable in a realistic setting.

programming language cannot be described by the ordinary kind of formal
grammars (Chomsky's ``context-free''). This paper uses grammars extended with
conjunction and negation operators, known as conjunctive grammars and Boolean
grammars, to describe the set of well-formed programs in a simple typeless
procedural programming language. A complete Boolean grammar, which defines such
concepts as declaration of variables and functions before their use, is
constructed and explained. Using the Generalized LR parsing algorithm for
Boolean grammars, a program can then be parsed in time $O(n^4)$ in its length,
while another known algorithm allows subcubic-time parsing. Next, it is shown
how to transform this grammar to an unambiguous conjunctive grammar, with
square-time parsing. This becomes apparently the first specification of the
syntax of a programming language entirely by a computationally feasible formal
grammar.

belief state, database result, system act, and system response of every dialog
turn. Additionally, UBAR is evaluated in a more realistic setting, where its
dialog context has access to user utterances and all content it generated such

the MultiWOZ datasets show that UBAR achieves state-of-the-art performances in
multiple settings, improving the combined score of response generation, policy

Thorough analyses demonstrate that the session-level training sequence

as a fully end-to-end task-oriented dialog system in real life. We also examine
the transfer ability of UBAR to new domains with limited data and provide

extensive research. It plays central roles in a wide variety of applications in
Alibaba Group. However, existing structure learning algorithms suffer from
considerable limitations in real world applications due to their low efficiency
and poor scalability. To resolve this, we propose a new structure learning
algorithm LEAST, which comprehensively fulfills our business requirements as it
attains high accuracy, efficiency and scalability at the same time. The core
idea of LEAST is to formulate the structure learning into a continuous
constrained optimization problem, with a novel differentiable constraint
function measuring the acyclicity of the resulting graph. Unlike with existing
work, our constraint function is built on the spectral radius of the graph and
could be evaluated in near linear time w.r.t. the graph node size. Based on it,
LEAST can be efficiently implemented with low storage overhead. According to
our benchmark evaluation, LEAST runs 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than
state of the art method with comparable accuracy, and it is able to scale on
BNs with up to hundreds of thousands of variables. In our production
environment, LEAST is deployed and serves for more than 20 applications with
thousands of executions per day. We describe a concrete scenario in a ticket
booking service in Alibaba, where LEAST is applied to build a near real-time
automatic anomaly detection and root error cause analysis system. We also show
that LEAST unlocks the possibility of applying BN structure learning in new
areas, such as large-scale gene expression data analysis and explainable
recommendation system.

chronic liver disease, the mechanisms behind remain today poorly understood.
The main reason is that the liver stiffness is not specific to portal
hypertension and is also influenced by concomitant pathologies, such as
cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is also source of a vascular incidence, with a
substantial diversion of portal venous blood to the systemic circulation,
bypassing the liver. This study focuses on this vascular effect of portal
hypertension. We propose to generate and control the portal venous flow (to
isolate the modifications in the portal venous flow as single effect of portal
hypertension) in an anesthetized pig and then to quantify its implications on
liver stiffness by an original combination of MRE and 4D-Flow Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). A catheter balloon is progressively inflated in the
portal vein and the peak flow, peak velocity magnitude and liver stiffness are
quantified in a 1.5T MRI scanner (AREA, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).
A strong correlation is observed between the portal peak velocity magnitude,
the portal peak flow or the liver stiffness and the portal vein intraluminal
obstruction. Moreover, the comparison of mechanical and flow parameters
highlights a correlation with the possibility of identifying linear
relationships. These results give preliminary indications about how liver

was introduced by Al-Odhari. Namely, we speak about families of subsets which
contain empty set and the whole universe X, being at the same time closed under
finite intersections (but not necessarily under arbitrary or even finite
unions). This slight modification allows us to distinguish between new classes
of subsets (infra-open, ps-infra-open and i-genuine). Analogous notions are
discussed in the language of closures. The class of minimal infra-open sets is

obtain characterization of infra-spaces in terms of modal logic, using some of

considered. Two examples taken from a public gas library demonstrate the
reliability of the error control of expectations calculated from random

e.g., approximate probability density functions of minimum and maximum pressure
values at the exits of the network.

robot head, which remains a challenge in real-world environments. In particular
we are interested in locating speech sources, as they are of high interest for
human-robot interaction. The microphone-pair response corresponding to the
direct-path sound propagation is a function of the source direction. In
practice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The
direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between
the direct-path acoustic transfer function (ATF) of the two microphones, and it
is an important feature for SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF
from noisy and reverberant signals in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
domain. First, the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted
to accurately represent the impulse response of the microphone array, and the
first coefficient of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. At each
frequency, the frame-wise speech auto- and cross-power spectral density (PSD)
are obtained by spectral subtraction. Then a set of linear equations is
constructed by the speech auto- and cross-PSD of multiple frames, in which the
DP-RTF is an unknown variable, and is estimated by solving the equations.
Finally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as
a feature vector for SSL. Experiments with a robot, placed in various
reverberant environments, show that the proposed method outperforms two
state-of-the-art methods.

used to reduce radiation dose exposure to patients. For organ-specific AEC, a
preliminary CT reconstruction is necessary to estimate organ shapes for dose
optimization, where only a few projections are allowed for real-time
reconstruction. In this work, we investigate the performance of automated
transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP) in such applications. For proof
of concept, we investigate its performance on the MNIST dataset first, where
the dataset containing all the 10 digits are randomly split into a training set
and a test set. We train the AUTOMAP model for image reconstruction from 2
projections or 4 projections directly. The test results demonstrate that
AUTOMAP is able to reconstruct most digits well with a false rate of 1.6% and
6.8% respectively. In our subsequent experiment, the MNIST dataset is split in
a way that the training set contains 9 digits only while the test set contains
the excluded digit only, for instance ""2"". In the test results, the digit ""2""s
are falsely predicted as ""3"" or ""5"" when using 2 projections for
reconstruction, reaching a false rate of 94.4%. For the application in medical
images, AUTOMAP is also trained on patients' CT images. The test images reach
an average root-mean-square error of 290 HU. Although the coarse body outlines
are well reconstructed, some organs are misshaped.

question of what is the sensitivity of current X-ray telescopes to an MSP

of Galactic MSPs, building on an empirical connection between gamma- and X-ray
MSP emission based on observed source properties. We compare our model with
compact sources in the latest Chandra source catalog, applying selections based
on spectral observables and optical astrometry with Gaia. We find a significant
number of Chandra sources in the region of interest to be consistent with being
bulge MSPs that are as yet unidentified. This motivates dedicated
multi-wavelength searches for bulge MSPs: Some promising directions are briefly

it allows to trace back the origin of an image. Its forensics counter-part is
source device anonymization, that is, to mask any trace on the image that can
be useful for identifying the source device. A typical trace exploited for
source device identification is the Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), a
noise pattern left by the device on the acquired images. In this paper, we
devise a methodology for suppressing such a trace from natural images without
significant impact on image quality. Specifically, we turn PRNU anonymization
into an optimization problem in a Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework. In a
nutshell, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) acts as generator and returns an
image that is anonymized with respect to the source PRNU, still maintaining
high visual quality. With respect to widely-adopted deep learning paradigms,
our proposed CNN is not trained on a set of input-target pairs of images.
Instead, it is optimized to reconstruct the PRNU-free image from the original
image under analysis itself. This makes the approach particularly suitable in
scenarios where large heterogeneous databases are analyzed and prevents any
problem due to lack of generalization. Through numerical examples on publicly
available datasets, we prove our methodology to be effective compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

  Histology","Accepted as a poster for the ML4H 2020 NeurIPS workshop",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the biggest challenges for applying machine learning to histopathology
is weak supervision: whole-slide images have billions of pixels yet often only
one global label. The state of the art therefore relies on strongly-supervised
model training using additional local annotations from domain experts. However,
in the absence of detailed annotations, most weakly-supervised approaches
depend on a frozen feature extractor pre-trained on ImageNet. We identify this
as a key weakness and propose to train an in-domain feature extractor on
histology images using MoCo v2, a recent self-supervised learning algorithm.
Experimental results on Camelyon16 and TCGA show that the proposed extractor
greatly outperforms its ImageNet counterpart. In particular, our results
improve the weakly-supervised state of the art on Camelyon16 from 91.4% to
98.7% AUC, thereby closing the gap with strongly-supervised models that reach
99.3% AUC. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that feature extractors
trained via self-supervised learning can act as drop-in replacements to
significantly improve existing machine learning techniques in histology.
Lastly, we show that the learned embedding space exhibits biologically
meaningful separation of tissue structures.

Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) produces numerous
image sequences in time and space. These sequences provide data support for
predicting the evolution of photospheric magnetic field. Based on the
spatiotemporal long short-term memory(LSTM) network, we use the preprocessed
data of photospheric magnetic field in active regions to build a prediction
model for magnetic field evolution. Because of the elaborate learning and
memory mechanism, the trained model can characterize the inherent relationships
contained in spatiotemporal features. The testing results of the prediction
model indicate that (1) the prediction pattern learned by the model can be
applied to predict the evolution of new magnetic field in the next 6 hour that
have not been trained, and predicted results are roughly consistent with real
observed magnetic field evolution in terms of large-scale structure and
movement speed; (2) the performance of the model is related to the prediction
time; the shorter the prediction time, the higher the accuracy of the predicted
results; (3) the performance of the model is stable not only for active regions
in the north and south but also for data in positive and negative regions.
Detailed experimental results and discussions on magnetic flux emergence and
magnetic neutral lines finally show that the proposed model could effectively
predict the large-scale and short-term evolution of the photospheric magnetic
field in active regions. Moreover, our study may provide a reference for the
spatiotemporal prediction of other solar activities.

  Detection for Industrial Control Systems",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, a number of process-based anomaly detection schemes for
Industrial Control Systems were proposed. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of such schemes, and introduce a taxonomy of properties
that are verified by those detection systems. We then present a novel general
framework to generate adversarial spoofing signals that violate physical
properties of the system, and use the framework to analyze four anomaly
detectors published at top security conferences. We find that three of those
detectors are susceptible to a number of adversarial manipulations (e.g.,
spoofing with precomputed patterns), which we call Synthetic Sensor Spoofing
and one is resilient against our attacks. We investigate the root of its
resilience and demonstrate that it comes from the properties that we
introduced. Our attacks reduce the Recall (True Positive Rate) of the attacked
schemes making them not able to correctly detect anomalies. Thus, the
vulnerabilities we discovered in the anomaly detectors show that (despite an
original good detection performance), those detectors are not able to reliably
learn physical properties of the system. Even attacks that prior work was
expected to be resilient against (based on verified properties) were found to
be successful. We argue that our findings demonstrate the need for both more
complete attacks in datasets, and more critical analysis of process-based
anomaly detectors. We plan to release our implementation as open-source,
together with an extension of two public datasets with a set of Synthetic
Sensor Spoofing attacks as generated by our framework.

near-field enhancement effects occurring at resonant excitation of the

find that the major difference in multi-layer metasurfaces when compared to
conventional single-layer structures appears to be in Rayleigh-Wood anomalies:
they are split into multiple different modes which are themselves spectrally
broadened. As a proof of concept we cover a double-layer metasurface with a
lanthanide-doped up-conversion particle layer and study its interaction with a
1550 nm photoexcitation. We observe a 2.7-fold enhancemed up-conversion
photoluminescence by using the stacked metasurface instead of a planar
substrate, although only around 1% of the up-conversion material is exposed to
enhanced near-fields. Two mechanisms are identified explaining this behavior:
First, enhanced near-fields when exciting the metasurface resonantly, and
second, light trapping by total internal reflection in the particle layer when
the metasurface redirects light into high-angle diffraction orders. These
results pave the way for low-threshold and, in particular, broadband photon
up-conversion in future solar energy and biosensing applications.

  flow","29 pages, 17 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper discusses the numerical investigation of the wall roughness effect
on the supercritical water flow susceptible to heat transfer deterioration
(HTD). The simulation was carried in the vertical circular pipe using the SST
k-omega turbulence model for different sets of heat flux (220kW/m2 & 1810kW/m2)
and mass flow rate (0.0106kg/s &0.022kg/s) at a maximum pressure of 25.3MPa.
The presence of roughness was incorporated as a uniform sand-grain roughness on
the heated wall. As a result, HTD recuperated gradually as the roughness height
(Ks) was increased. The mitigation of HTD is a direct consequence of the
increase in turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). In contrast, the delay in the onset
of HTD is due to the decrease in the dominant forces (buoyancy or acceleration
effects) responsible for HTD occurrence. An equivalent thermal resistance model
was proposed to elucidate the same. Additionally, the heat transfer coefficient
reduces (HTDn) near the outlet at higher roughness values where HTD has
completely recovered. This is attributed to the high specific heat value around
the pseudocritical temperature. In the end, the efficacy of the roughness was
analyzed using two methods: entropy generation and thermal performance factor.
Both techniques suggest that the use of rough pipe is beneficial. However, the
first method recommends using a Ks value greater than the critical roughness
height (Ksc): as the total entropy generation was found to peak at Ksc because
of the thermal conductivity variation with temperature. The study revealed high
sensitivity of maximum wall temperature and HTD onset to roughness presence. In
addition, contrary to usual HTD, a new type of heat transfer impairment (HTDn)
can occur without any loss of TKE.

in remote sensing imagery. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel framework for dense object counting in remote sensing images, which
incorporates a pyramidal scale module (PSM) and a global context module (GCM),
dubbed PSGCNet, where PSM is used to adaptively capture multi-scale information
and GCM is to guide the model to select suitable scales generated from PSM.
Moreover, a reliable supervision manner improved from Bayesian and Counting
loss (BCL) is utilized to learn the density probability and then compute the
count expectation at each annotation. It can relieve non-uniform density
distribution to a certain extent. Extensive experiments on four remote sensing
counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the
superiority of it compared with state-of-the-arts. Additionally, experiments
extended on four commonly used crowd counting datasets further validate the
generalization ability of the model. Code is available at

advantage of the redundancy of the human kinematic chain involved in a task to
control an extra degree of actuation (DoA). This concept is summarized in the
definition of the Implicit Kinematic Kernel (IKK). As first investigation, we
developed a procedure for the real time analysis of the body posture and the
consequent computation of the IKK-based control signal in the case of
single-arm tasks. We considered both bio-mechanical and physiological human
features and constraints to allow for an efficient and intuitive control
approach. Towards a complete evaluation of the proposed control system, we
studied the users' capability of exploiting the Implicit Kinematic Kernel both

tasks. Obtained results demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for

advantages: it bypasses manual tuning of the sensitive loss combination, a
decisive factor for panoptic segmentation; it allows to explicitly model the

different datasets without the need of re-tuning hyperparameters or
re-adjusting the training process laboriously. Our Ada-Segment brings 2.7%

This review examines how social capital contributes to the food security of

provide a state-of-the-art review on capacity social capital in this realm. The
output of this method led to finding 39 related articles. Studying these
articles illustrates that social capital improves food security through two
mechanisms of knowledge sharing and product sharing (i.e., sharing food
products). It reveals that social capital through improving the food security
pillars (i.e., food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and
food system stability) affects food security. In other words, the interaction
among the community members results in sharing food products and information
among community members, which facilitates food availability and access to
food. There are many shreds of evidence in the literature that sharing food and
food products among the community member decreases household food security and
provides healthy nutrition to vulnerable families and improves the food
utilization pillar of food security. It is also disclosed that belonging to the
social networks increases the community members' resilience and decreases the
community's vulnerability that subsequently strengthens the stability of a food
system. This study contributes to the common literature on food security and
social capital by providing a conceptual model based on the literature. In

mechanism where vertex features are updated iteratively by aggregation of

features extraction, but obtained features after many iterations might contain
too much information from other vertices, and tend to be similar to each other.
This makes their representations less expressive. Learning graphs using paths,
on the other hand, can be less adversely affected by this problem because it
does not involve all vertex neighbors. However, most of them can only compare
paths with the same length, which might engender information loss. To resolve
this difficulty, we propose a new Graph Kernel based on a Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS) similarity. Moreover, we found that the widely-used
R-convolution framework is unsuitable for path-based Graph Kernel because a
huge number of comparisons between dissimilar paths might deteriorate graph
distances calculation. Therefore, we propose a novel metric space by exploiting
the proposed LCS-based similarity, and compute a new Wasserstein-based graph
distance in this metric space, which emphasizes more the comparison between
similar paths. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, we propose an
adjacent point merging operation to sparsify point clouds in the metric space.

legal information retrieval systems that can effectively satisfy user-specific

simple pre-processing steps, disregarding topical coherence of segments.
Systems generally rely on representations of individual sentences or
paragraphs, which may lack crucial context, or document-level representations,
which are too long for meaningful search results. To address this issue, we
propose a segmentation system that can predict topical coherence of sequential
text segments spanning several paragraphs, effectively segmenting a document
and providing a more balanced representation for downstream applications. We
build our model on top of popular transformer networks and formulate structural
text segmentation as topical change detection, by performing a series of
independent classifications that allow for efficient fine-tuning on
task-specific data. We crawl a novel dataset consisting of roughly $74,000$

analysts as well as engineers to practice network vigilantism, on traffic as
well as other network events in real-time. The reason is to understand the
exact security posture of an organization network environment at any given
time. This is driven by the fact that modern network environments do, not only
present new opportunities to organizations but also a different set of new and
complex cybersecurity challenges that need to be resolved daily. The growing
size, scope, complexity, and volume of networked devices in our modern network
environments also makes it hard even for the most experienced network
administrators to independently provide the breadth and depth of knowledge

growing number of Cyber Security Threats in the world today, many organizations
have been forced to change the way they plan, develop and implement
cybersecurity strategies as a way to reinforce their ability to respond to
cybersecurity incidents. This paper, therefore, examines the relevance of

to suffer brightness shifting problems on images that are greatly corrupted by
extreme noise such as salt-and-pepper noise. Moreover, most blind denoising

of the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a dilated convolutional

training without random masking. We also propose an adaptive self-supervision
loss to circumvent the requirement of zero-mean constraint, which is
specifically effective in removing salt-and-pepper or hybrid noise where a

The quantification is based on Shapley values, a concept which originates from
coalitional game theory, developed to fairly distribute the payout among a set

contribution. Shapley values are often used to quantify feature importance, ie.
how features affect a prediction. This paper extends this to cluster
importance, letting clusters of the training data act as players in a game

turned to be a complex problem requiring large amount of memory and processing
time. In order to cope with these problems, statistical learning has greatly
helped in the last years to develop statistical retrieval and classification
models that can ingest large amounts of Earth observation data. Kernel methods
constitute a family of powerful machine learning algorithms, which have found
wide use in remote sensing and geosciences. However, kernel methods are still
not widely adopted because of the high computational cost when dealing with
large scale problems, such as the inversion of radiative transfer models or the
classification of high spatial-spectral-temporal resolution data. This paper
introduces an efficient kernel method for fast statistical retrieval of
bio-geo-physical parameters and image classification problems. The method
allows to approximate a kernel matrix with a set of projections on random bases
sampled from the Fourier domain. The method is simple, computationally very
efficient in both memory and processing costs, and easily parallelizable. We
show that kernel regression and classification is now possible for datasets
with millions of examples and high dimensionality. Examples on atmospheric
parameter retrieval from hyperspectral infrared sounders like IASI/Metop; large
scale emulation and inversion of the familiar PROSAIL radiative transfer model
on Sentinel-2 data; and the identification of clouds over landmarks in time
series of MSG/Seviri images show the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposed technique.

enhancements ranging from data rate, reliability, and compatibility to sustain
the ever increasing growth of the telecommunication industry. In this regard,
this work investigates how machine learning technology can improve the
performance of 5G cell and beam index search in practice. The cell search is an
essential function for a User Equipment (UE) to be initially associated with a
base station, and is also important to further maintain the wireless
connection. Unlike the former generation cellular systems, the 5G UE faces with
an additional challenge to detect suitable beams as well as the cell identities
in the cell search procedures. Herein, we propose and implement new
channel-learning schemes to enhance the performance of 5G beam index detection.
The salient point lies in the use of machine learning models and softwarization
for practical implementations in a system level. We develop the proposed
channel-learning scheme including algorithmic procedures and corroborative
system structure for efficient beam index detection. We also implement a
real-time operating 5G testbed based on the off-the-shelf Software Defined
Radio (SDR) platform and conduct intensive experiments with commercial 5G base

$\chi$ is intimately related to basic properties of disordered solids, such as
elastic constants and plastic deformability, and can be experimentally

satisfy a generic lower bound on $\chi$. On the other hand, we show that $\chi$
is unbounded from above, and may diverge in systems driven towards the critical
unjamming point. These results highlight basic properties of disordered solids

imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). By considering the
downlink of a multi-cluster scenario, the IRSs assist the base station (BS) to
multiplex subsets of users in the polarization domain. Our novel strategy
alleviates the impact of imperfect SIC and enables users to exploit
polarization diversity with near-zero inter-subset interference. To this end,
the IRSs are optimized to mitigate transmissions originated at the BS from the
interfering polarization. The formulated optimization is transformed into
quadratic constrained quadratic sub-problems, which makes it possible to obtain
the optimal solution via interior-points methods. We also derive analytically a
closed-form expression for the users' ergodic rates by considering large
numbers of reflecting elements. This is followed by representative simulation
examples and comprehensive discussions. The results show that when the IRSs are
large enough, the proposed scheme always outperforms conventional massive
MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA systems even if SIC error propagation is present. It is
also confirmed that dual-polarized IRSs can make cross-polar transmissions
beneficial to the users, allowing them to improve their performance through

detailed understanding of photon emission and jet-medium interaction in a
non-equilibrium plasma. Up to now, such an understanding has been hindered by
plasma instabilities which arise out of equilibrium and lead to spurious
divergences when evaluating the rate of interaction of hard probes with the
plasma. In this paper, we show that taking into account the time evolution of
an unstable plasma cures these divergences. We calculate the time evolution of
gluon two-point correlators in a setup with small initial momentum anisotropy
and show that the gluon occupation density grows exponentially at early times.
Based on this calculation, we argue for a phenomenological prescription where
instability poles are subtracted. Finally, we show that in the Abelian case
instability fields do not affect medium-induced photon emission to our order of
approximation.

We further find that for a certain ratio of the rotational to a vortex shedding

are evidenced by the surface variation of light elements, in particular Li, and
the evolution of their rotation rates. For the Sun, inversions of helioseismic
data indicate that the radial profile of angular velocity in its radiative zone
is nearly uniform, which implies the existence of angular momentum transport
mechanisms. While there are many independent transport models for angular
momentum and chemical species, there is a lack of self-consistent theories that
permit stellar evolution models to simultaneously match the present-day
observations of solar lithium abundances and radial rotation profiles. We
explore how additional transport processes can improve the agreement between
evolutionary models of rotating stars and observations. We constrain the
resulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation
rate and Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters, and the solar
surface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology. We show
the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of Li. The rotational
dependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation
between the initial rotation rate and Li depletion in our models of solar-type
stars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the
addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity leads to efficient transport of
angular momentum between the core and the envelope. We also self-consistently
compute for the first time the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is
compatible with helioseismic estimations. However, the main sequence depletion
of Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric turbulent
mixing below the convective envelope. The need for additional transport
processes in stellar evolution models is confirmed.

contribute to the social construction of scientific facts in the press,
especially in science news related to medicine, and that professional

binary stars systems. Most of these circumbinary planets lie near their
instability boundaries at about 3 to 5 binary separations. Past attempts to
match these final locations through an inward migration process were only
successful for the Kepler-16 system. Here, we study 10 circumbinary systems and
try to match the final parking locations and orbital parameters of the planets
with a disc driven migration scenario.
  We performed 2D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of circumbinary
discs with embedded planets and followed their migration evolution using
different values for the disc viscosity and aspect ratio. We found that for the
six systems with intermediate binary eccentricities ($0.1 \le e_{bin}\le 0.21$)
the final planetary orbits matched the observations closely for a single set of
disc parameters, specifically a disc viscosity of $\alpha = 10^{-4}$, and an
aspect ratio of $H/r \sim 0.04$. For these systems the planet masses were large
enough to open at least a partial gap in their discs as they approach the
binary, forcing the discs to become circularized and allowing for further
migration towards the binary, leading to good agreement with the observed
planetary orbital parameters.
  For systems with very small or large binary eccentricities the match was not
as good because the very eccentric discs and large inner cavities in these
cases prevented close-in planet migration. In test simulations with higher than
observed planet masses better agreement could be found for those systems.
  The good agreement for 6 out of the 10 modelled systems, where the relative
difference between observed and simulated final planet orbit is $\leq 10\%$,
strongly supports the idea that planet migration in the disc brought the
planets to their present locations.

The second is a method for model selection by element-wise multiplication of
parameters with approximate binary gates that may be computed deterministically

inclusion of a surrogate regularization to the $L_0$ loss. Since the method is
differentiable it enables straightforward and efficient learning of model
architectures by an empirical risk minimization procedure with stochastic
gradient descent and theoretically enables conditional computation during

the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

which projects the infeasible power control results onto the constraint set.
The projection block is designed based on a geometrical interpretation of the

online applications. Explicit-form expression of the backpropagated gradient is
derived for the proposed projection block, with which the DNN can be trained to
directly maximize the sum rate via unsupervised learning. We also develop a

Firstly, by tuning the geometric dimension of the metal pillars in the array,
its ability to precisely manipulate the excited SSPs along one direction is
confirmed, achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with the resolution up
to 0.14 times the wavelength. Then, separately controlling the propagation of

SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Using a new
version of the non-LTE code NICOLE specifically developed for this problem we
invert the spicule single- and double-peak line profiles. This new version
considers off-limb geometry and computes atomic populations by solving the 1D
radiative transfer assuming a vertical stratification. The inversion proceeds
by fitting the observed spectral profiles at 14 different heights with
synthetic profiles computed in the model by solving the radiative transfer
problem along its length. Motivated by the appearance of double-peak Ca II 8542
\AA\ spicule profiles, which exhibit two distinct emission features well
separated in wavelength, we adopt a double-component scenario. We start from
the ansatz that the spicule parameters are practically constant along the
spicule axis for each component, except for a density drop. Our results support
this ansatz by attaining very good fits to the entire set of 14$\times$4
profiles (14 heights and 4 times). We show that the double-component model with
uniform temperature of 9560 K, exponential decrease of density with a height
scale of $1000-2000$ km, and the counter-oriented line-of-sight velocities of

indispensable tools for materials characterization. However, during a typical

its atomic structure. Of these, perhaps the least discussed are chemical
modifications due to the non-ideal vacuum around the sample. With single-layer
graphene, we show that even at relatively low pressures typical for many
instruments, these processes can have a significant impact on the sample
structure. For example, pore growth becomes up to two orders of magnitude
faster at a pressure of ca. 10^{-6} mbar as compared to ultra-high vacuum (UHV;
10^{-10} mbar). Even more remarkably,the presence of oxygen at the sample also
changes the observed atomic structure: When imaged in UHV, nearly 90% of the
identifiable graphene edge configurations have the armchair structure, whereas
armchair and zigzag structures are nearly equally likely to occur when the
oxygen partial pressure in the column is higher. Our results both bring
attention to the role of the often neglected vacuum composition of the
microscope column, and show that control over it can allow atomic-scale
tailoring of the specimen structure.

computation. In this paper, we characterize the security investment of miners
in terms of its cost in fiat money. This enables comparison of security
allocations across PoW blockchains that generally use different PoW algorithms
and reward miners in different cryptocurrency units. We prove that there exists
a unique allocation equilibrium, depending on market prices only, that is
achieved by both strategic miners (who contemplate the actions of others) and
by miners seeking only short-term profit. In fact, the latter will unknowingly
compensate for any attempt to deliberately shift security allocation away from
equilibrium.
  Our conclusions are supported analytically through the development of a
Markov decision process, game theoretical analysis, and derivation of no
arbitrage conditions. We corroborate those results with empirical evidence from
more than two years of blockchain and price data. Overall agreement is strong.
We show that between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2020, market prices
predicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash with error less
than 0.6%. And from the beginning of October 2019, until August 1, 2020, market
prices predicted security allocation between Bitcoin and Litecoin with error of
0.45%. These results are further corroborated by our establishment of
Granger-causality between change in market prices and change in security
allocation.
  To demonstrate the practicality of our results, we describe a trustless
oracle that leverages the equilibrium to estimate the price ratios of PoW
cryptocurrencies from on-chain information only.

closed quantum system at random times. For this purpose a time correlation
matrix is introduced which enables us to extract dynamical properties of the
quantum system. After defining a generalized expectation value we obtain a
distribution of time scales, an average transition time and a correlation time.
A classical limit exists which is separated from the quantum fluctuations. The
latter are characterized by resonances associated with poles of the generalized
expectation value. Its analytic behavior is studied and some generic properties
are linked to a quantized Berry phase.

generated from its decoder? This paper shows that the perhaps surprising answer
to this question is `No'; a (nominally trained) VAE does not necessarily
amortize inference for typical samples that it is capable of generating. We
study the implications of this behaviour on the learned representations and
also the consequences of fixing it by introducing a notion of self consistency.
Our approach hinges on an alternative construction of the variational
approximation distribution to the true posterior of an extended VAE model with
a Markov chain alternating between the encoder and the decoder. The method can
be used to train a VAE model from scratch or given an already trained VAE, it
can be run as a post processing step in an entirely self supervised way without
access to the original training data. Our experimental analysis reveals that
encoders trained with our self-consistency approach lead to representations
that are robust (insensitive) to perturbations in the input introduced by
adversarial attacks. We provide experimental results on the ColorMnist and
CelebA benchmark datasets that quantify the properties of the learned
representations and compare the approach with a baseline that is specifically
trained for the desired property.

effective communication paradigm in low-power wireless networks. Numerous ST
protocols provide high reliability and energy efficiency in normal wireless

EWSN dependability competitions, the community pushed ST to harsher and
highly-interfered environments, improving upon classical ST protocols through
the use of custom rules, hand-tailored parameters, and additional
retransmissions. The results are sophisticated protocols, that require prior
expert knowledge and extensive testing, often tuned for a specific deployment
and envisioned scenario. In this paper, we explore how ST protocols can benefit
from self-adaptivity; a self-adaptive ST protocol selects itself its best
parameters to (1) tackle external environment dynamics and (2) adapt to its
topology over time. We introduce Dimmer as a self-adaptive ST protocol. Dimmer
builds on LWB and uses Reinforcement Learning to tune its parameters and match
the current properties of the wireless medium. By learning how to behave from
an unlabeled dataset, Dimmer adapts to different interference types and
patterns, and is able to tackle previously unseen interference. With Dimmer, we
explore how to efficiently design AI-based systems for constrained devices, and
outline the benefits and downfalls of AI-based low-power networking. We
evaluate our protocol on two deployments of resource-constrained nodes
achieving 95.8% reliability against strong, unknown WiFi interference. Our
results outperform baselines such as non-adaptive ST protocols (27%) and PID

released grid codes to provide frequency regulation service. The most critical
challenge is how to formulate the dynamic model of wind farm for dynamic

predictive control (data-driven MPC) method to make wind farms participate
primary frequency regulation. In this method,a specialized dynamic mode
decomposition (SDMD) algorithm is developed, which can linearly approximate the
dynamics of wind farm from measurements based on Koopman operator
theory.Compared with the existing extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD)
method,this tailored SDMD has two advantages: 1) fully capturing the nonlinear
transients of wind turbine dynamics with good accuracy under a wide range of
working conditions; 2) much less computational burden with model dimensionality
reduction. Based on the recursively updated linear dynamic model, a model
predictive control solution is implemented. The simulation results show this
model-free solution can dynamically optimize wind turbine generators' active
power to track the frequency response requirement from system operator and
minimize the rotor speed distortion.

a k-means clustering of the autoencoder's embedding. The diachronic setting,
however, prevents the former to benefit from valuable information acquired by
the latter. In this paper, we present an alternative where the autoencoder and
the clustering are learned simultaneously. This is achieved by providing novel
theoretical insight, where we show that the objective function of a certain
class of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) can naturally be rephrased as the loss
function of a one-hidden layer autoencoder thus inheriting the built-in
clustering capabilities of the GMM. That simple neural network, referred to as
the clustering module, can be integrated into a deep autoencoder resulting in a
deep clustering model able to jointly learn a clustering and an embedding.
Experiments confirm the equivalence between the clustering module and Gaussian

to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.
  Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work
with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the
same advantage.
  Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model
interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of
categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus
translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the
circuit variables to be learned.
  Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a
novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current
standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of
Wittgenstein's meaning-is-context.

contemporary AI, and it is arguably one of the most challenging areas of the
field. At the same time, in the area of Quantum Computing (QC), with the steady
growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of
quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform
tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of
resources. This provides a new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP
specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional
Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying
mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier
work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential
quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus
on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and
perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the
DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum
circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised
quantum-circuits and the sentence's grammatical structure faithfully manifests
as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a
sentence-circuit. The circuits' parameters are trained using a classical
optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification. Our novel QNLP
model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum
hardware improves in the near future and solidifies a novel branch of
experimental research at the intersection of QC and AI.

relatively high occurrence rate and space weather impact. However, typical CME
signatures such as extreme-ultraviolet dimmings and post-eruptive arcades are
hard to identify and require extensive image processing techniques. These weak
observational signatures mean that little is currently understood about the
physics of these events. We present an extensive study of the magnetic field
configuration in which the stealth CME of 3 March 2011 occurred. Three distinct
episodes of flare ribbon formation are observed in the stealth CME source
active region (AR). Two occurred prior to the eruption and suggest the
occurrence of magnetic reconnection that builds the structure which will become
eruptive. The third occurs in a time close to the eruption of a cavity that is
observed in STEREO-B 171A data; this subsequently becomes part of the
propagating CME observed in coronagraph data. We use both local (Cartesian) and
global (spherical) models of the coronal magnetic field, which are complemented
and verified by the observational analysis. We find evidence of a coronal null
point, with field lines computed from its neighbourhood connecting the stealth
CME source region to two ARs in the northern hemisphere. We conclude that
reconnection at the null point aids the eruption of the stealth CME by removing
field that acted to stabilise the pre-eruptive structure. This stealth CME,
despite its weak signatures, has the main characteristics of other CMEs, and
its eruption is driven by similar mechanisms.

occur and have important practical consequences. Implementing correct engines
is challenging because the spec is intentionally incomplete and evolves
frequently. Objective. This paper investigates the use of test transplantation
and differential testing for revealing functional bugs in JavaScript engines.
The former technique runs the regression test suite of a given engine on
another engine. The latter technique fuzzes existing inputs and then compares
the output produced by different engines with a differential oracle. Method. We
conducted experiments with engines from five major players-Apple, Facebook,
Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla-to assess the effectiveness of test
transplantation and differential testing. Results. Our results indicate that
both techniques revealed several bugs, many of which confirmed by developers.
We reported 35 bugs with test transplantation (23 of these bugs confirmed and
19 fixed) and reported 24 bugs with differential testing (17 of these confirmed
and 10 fixed). Results indicate that most of these bugs affected two
engines-Apple's JSC and Microsoft's ChakraCore (24 and 26 bugs, respectively).
To summarize, our results show that test transplantation and differential
testing are easy to apply and very effective in finding bugs in complex

implicitly generated using a sample of observations or ``scenarios,"" and solved
only \emph{imprecisely}, to within a tolerance that is chosen
\emph{adaptively}, by balancing the estimated statistical error against
solution error. The solutions from prior iterations serve as \emph{warm starts}

optimization problems generated on subsequent iterations. The generated
scenarios can be independent and identically distributed (iid), or dependent,
as in Monte Carlo generation using Latin-hypercube sampling, antithetic
variates, or randomized quasi-Monte Carlo. We first characterize the
almost-sure convergence (and convergence in mean) of the optimality gap and the
distance of the generated stochastic iterates to the true solution set. We then
characterize the corresponding iteration complexity and work complexity rates
as a function of the sample size schedule, demonstrating that the best
achievable work complexity rate is Monte Carlo canonical and analogous to the
generic $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ optimal complexity for non-smooth convex
optimization. We report extensive numerical tests that indicate favorable
performance, due primarily to the use of a sequential framework with an optimal
sample size schedule, and the use of warm starts. The proposed algorithm can be
stopped in finite-time to return a solution endowed with a probabilistic

interference in the single sweep LiDAR point cloud, the accurate semantic
segmentation is non-trivial to achieve. In this paper, we propose a novel
sparse LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation framework assisted by learned
contextual shape priors. In practice, an initial semantic segmentation (SS) of
a single sweep point cloud can be achieved by any appealing network and then
flows into the semantic scene completion (SSC) module as the input. By merging
multiple frames in the LiDAR sequence as supervision, the optimized SSC module
has learned the contextual shape priors from sequential LiDAR data, completing
the sparse single sweep point cloud to the dense one. Thus, it inherently
improves SS optimization through fully end-to-end training. Besides, a
Point-Voxel Interaction (PVI) module is proposed to further enhance the
knowledge fusion between SS and SSC tasks, i.e., promoting the interaction of
incomplete local geometry of point cloud and complete voxel-wise global
structure. Furthermore, the auxiliary SSC and PVI modules can be discarded
during inference without extra burden for SS. Extensive experiments confirm
that our JS3C-Net achieves superior performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SemanticPOSS benchmarks, i.e., 4% and 3% improvement correspondingly.

single such measurement, however, contains limited information and multiple
measurements are needed to infer latent object state. We solve this inference
problem using a factor graph. In order to incorporate tactile measurements in
the graph, we need local observation models that can map high-dimensional
tactile images onto a low-dimensional state space. Prior work has used
low-dimensional force measurements or engineered functions to interpret tactile
measurements. These methods, however, can be brittle and difficult to scale
across objects and sensors. Our key insight is to directly learn tactile
observation models that predict the relative pose of the sensor given a pair of
tactile images. These relative poses can then be incorporated as factors within
a factor graph. We propose a two-stage approach: first we learn local tactile
observation models supervised with ground truth data, and then integrate these
models along with physics and geometric factors within a factor graph
optimizer. We demonstrate reliable object tracking using only tactile feedback

the discrete field ${\bold F}$ of average tile orientations is, up to a
multiplicative constant, the electric field produced by a 2D system of charges

a new field ${\bold T}$, which is also equal up to a multiplicative constant to
the electric field of the corresponding system of charges. We also discuss the
differences between the fields ${\bold T}$ and ${\bold F}$ and present
conjectures for their fine mesh limits in the more general case of a dimer
system with boundary. The new field ${\bold T}$ can be viewed as capturing the
instantaneous pull on each gap in the surrounding fluctuating sea of dimers.

which poses a smoothness condition on the sought inference function on the set
of unlabeled data. For $p<\infty$ continuum limits of this approach were
studied using tools from $\Gamma$-convergence. For the case $p=\infty$, which

$\Gamma$-convergence. In particular, we define a sequence of functionals which
approximate the largest local Lipschitz constant of a graph function and prove
$\Gamma$-convergence in the $L^\infty$-topology to the supremum norm of the
gradient as the graph becomes denser. Furthermore, we show compactness of the
functionals which implies convergence of minimizers. In our analysis we allow a
varying set of labeled data which converges to a general closed set in the

et al. (J. Algebra 525 (2019) 42-63) about the Auslander-Reiten type
correspondence for silting subcategories over triangulated categories. More
specifically, for any Frobenius extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$, we
establish a bijective correspondence between silting subcategories of the
stable category $\underline{\mathcal{C}}$ and certain covariantly finite
subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$. As a consequence, a characterization of silting
subcategories in the stable category of a Frobenius exact category is given.
This result is applied to homotopy categories over abelian categories with
enough projectives, derived categories over Grothendieck categories with enough
projectives as well as to the stable category of Gorenstein projective modules
over a ring $R$.

constructing a forecasting model is one of efficient means to improve

complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)

predict PM2.5 concentration, by modelling the data patterns of historical
pollutant concentrations data, meteorological data, and discrete time

experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed
CEEMDAN-DeepTCN model is verified to be the highest when compared with the time

The new model has improved the capability to model the PM2.5-related factor
data patterns, and can be used as a promising tool for forecasting PM2.5

detect whether people have come into direct contact with COVID-19 patients.
However, we find that the existing systems lack functionality and flexibility,
which may hurt the success of the contact tracing. Specifically, they cannot
detect indirect contact (e.g., people may be exposed to coronavirus because of
used the same elevator even without direct contact); they also cannot flexibly
change the rules of ""risky contact"", such as how many hours of exposure or how
close to a COVID-19 patient that is considered as risk exposure, which may be
changed with the environmental situation. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and secure contact tracing system that enables both direct contact
and indirect contact. To address the above problems, we need to utilize users'
trajectory data for private contact tracing, which we call trajectory-based
PCT. We formalize this problem as Spatiotemporal Private Set Intersection. By
analyzing different approaches such as homomorphic encryption that could be
extended to solve this problem, we identify that Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) is a proposing method to achieve our requirements. The major challenge is
how to design algorithms for spatiotemporal private set intersection under
limited secure memory of TEE. To this end, we design a TEE-based system with
flexible trajectory data encoding algorithms. Our experiments on real-world
data show that the proposed system can process thousands of queries on tens of
million records of trajectory data in a few seconds.

algorithms, when applied to the handover prediction, exhibit three main
limitations: the risk of data privacy breach, the fixed shape of clusters, and
the non-adaptive number of clusters. To overcome these limitations, in this
paper, we propose a three-phased data clustering algorithm, namely: generative
adversarial network-based clustering, cluster calibration, and cluster
division. We show that the generative adversarial network-based clustering
preserves privacy. The cluster calibration deals with dynamic environments by
modifying clusters. Moreover, the divisive clustering explores the different
number of clusters by repeatedly selecting and dividing a cluster into multiple

similarity between layers of a DNN. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
Nearest Neighbour Topological Persistence (NNTP) for quantifying the
inter-layer persistence of data neighbourhood relationships throughout a DNN.
The proposed strategies facilitate the efficient inter-layer information

PV materials at present. Their opto-electronic properties are governed by the
B-X bond. A quantum-chemical bond analysis reveals that this bond differs
significantly from ionic, metallic or covalent bonds. Instead, it is better
regarded as metavalent, since it shares approximately one p-electron between
adjacent atoms. The resulting sigma-bond is half-filled, which causes
pronounced optical absorption. Electron transfer and lattice distortions open a
moderate band gap, resulting in charge carriers with small effective masses.
Hence metavalent bonding explains the favorable PV properties of halide
perovskites. This is summarized in a map for different bond types, which

exhausted. Our framework extends the well-known cascade model in two
directions: the consumers have random attention spans instead of fixed ones,

nested structure of the optimal product ranking as a function of the attention
span when the attention span is fixed. \sg{Using this fact, we develop an
approximation algorithm when only the distribution of the attention spans is

no algorithms can achieve more than 0.5 of the revenue of the same benchmark.
The model and the algorithm can be generalized to the ranking problem when

  its Applications to Regularization","Accepted at AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Loss landscape analysis is extremely useful for a deeper understanding of the
generalization ability of deep neural network models. In this work, we propose
a layerwise loss landscape analysis where the loss surface at every layer is
studied independently and also on how each correlates to the overall loss
surface. We study the layerwise loss landscape by studying the eigenspectra of
the Hessian at each layer. In particular, our results show that the layerwise
Hessian geometry is largely similar to the entire Hessian. We also report an
interesting phenomenon where the Hessian eigenspectrum of middle layers of the
deep neural network are observed to most similar to the overall Hessian
eigenspectrum. We also show that the maximum eigenvalue and the trace of the
Hessian (both full network and layerwise) reduce as training of the network
progresses. We leverage on these observations to propose a new regularizer
based on the trace of the layerwise Hessian. Penalizing the trace of the
Hessian at every layer indirectly forces Stochastic Gradient Descent to
converge to flatter minima, which are shown to have better generalization
performance. In particular, we show that such a layerwise regularizer can be
leveraged to penalize the middlemost layers alone, which yields promising
results. Our empirical studies on well-known deep nets across datasets support
the claims of this work

The pure spinor formalism is a successfull super-Poincare covariant approach to

the above claim. We introduce a mostly BRST exact operator in order to achieve
this.

  Devices in Cardiac Arrhythmias Classification",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  A combination of cloud-based deep learning (DL) algorithms with
portable/wearable (P/W) devices has been developed as a smart heath care system
to support automatic cardiac arrhythmias (CAs) classification using
electrocardiography (ECG). However, long-term and continuous ECG monitoring is
challenging because of limitations of batteries and transmission bandwidth of
P/W devices while incorporated with consumer electronics (CE). A feasible
approach to address this challenge is to decrease sampling rates. However, low
sampling rates lead to low-resolution signals that hinder the CAs
classification performance. In this study, we propose a DL-based ECG signal
super-resolution framework (called SRECG) to enhance low-resolution ECG signals
by jointly considering the accuracies when applied to the DL-based
high-resolution multiclass classifier (HMC) of CAs. In our experiments, we
downsampled the ECG signals from the CPSC2018 dataset and evaluated their HMC
accuracies with and without the SRECG. Experimental results show that SRECG can
well improve the HMC accuracies as compared to traditional interpolation
methods. Moreover, approximately half of the CAs classification accuracies of
HMC were maintained within the enhanced ECG signals by SRECG. The promising
results confirm that SRECG can be suitably used to enhance low-resolution ECG
signals from P/W devices with CE to improve their cloud-based HMC performances.

very little evidence for quadrupolar spatial correlations across the pulsars in
the array, which is needed to make a confident claim of detection of a

correlations is consistent with the magnitude of the correlation coefficients
for pairs of Earth-pulsar baselines in the array, and the fact that pulsar

derive analytic expressions that allow one to compare the expected values of

via nuclear fusion in the Sun, a flux of solar $\bar{\nu}_e$ is unexpected. An
appearance of $\bar{\nu}_e$ in solar neutrino flux opens a new window for the
new physics beyond the standard model. In particular, a spin-flavor precession
process is expected to convert an electron neutrino into an electron
anti-neutrino (${\nu_e\to\bar{\nu}_e}$) when neutrino has a finite magnetic
moment. In this work, we have searched for solar $\bar{\nu}_e$ in the
Super-Kamiokande experiment, using neutron tagging to identify their inverse
beta decay signature. We identified 78 $\bar{\nu}_e$ candidates for neutrino
energies of 9.3 to 17.3 MeV in 2970.1 live days with a fiducial volume of 22.5
kiloton water (183.0 kton$\cdot$year exposure). The energy spectrum has been
consistent with background predictions and we thus derived a 90% confidence
level upper limit of ${4.7\times10^{-4}}$ on the $\nu_e\to\bar{\nu}_e$
conversion probability in the Sun. We used this result to evaluate the
sensitivity of future experiments, notably the Super-Kamiokande Gadolinium

massive black holes (MBHs) at galactic centers when they move into the vicinity
of the MBHs. In this study, we investigate the rates of stellar consumption by
central MBHs and their cosmic distributions, including the effects of triaxial
galaxy shapes in enhancing the reservoir of low-angular-momentum stars and
incorporating realistic galaxy distributions. We find that the enhancement in
the stellar consumption rates due to triaxial galaxy shapes can be significant,
by a factor of ~3 for MBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^6$Msun and up to more
than one order of magnitude for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^8$Msun. Only for $M_{\rm
BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun are the stellar consumption rates significantly higher in
galaxies with steeper inner surface brightness profiles. The average (per
galaxy) stellar consumption rates correlate with central MBH masses positively
for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^7$Msun and negatively for $M_{\rm
BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun. The volumetric stellar tidal disruption rates are
~$3\times10^{-5}$/yr/Mpc$^3$ for MBHs in the mass range of $10^5$-$10^8$Msun at
z=0; and the volumetric stellar consumption rates by MBHs with higher masses
are ~$10^{-6}$/yr/Mpc$^3$, which can be the stellar tidal disruption rate if
the high-mass BHs are extremely spinning Kerr BHs or the rate of being
swallowed if those BHs are Schwarzschild ones. The volumetric stellar
consumption rates decrease with increasing redshift, and the decrease is
relatively mild for $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^7$Msun and stronger for higher
$M_{\rm BH}$. Most of the stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) at z=0 occur
in galaxies with mass $M_{\rm gal}\lesssim10^{11}$Msun, and about 1%-2% of the
TDEs can occur in high-mass galaxies with $M_{\rm gal}\gtrsim10^{11}$Msun.

addition to unfairness, privacy concerns also arise when the use of models
reveals sensitive personal information. Among various privacy notions,
differential privacy has become popular in recent years. In this work, we study
the possibility of using a differentially private exponential mechanism as a
post-processing step to improve both fairness and privacy of supervised
learning models. Unlike many existing works, we consider a scenario where a
supervised model is used to select a limited number of applicants as the number
of available positions is limited. This assumption is well-suited for various
scenarios, such as job application and college admission. We use ``equal
opportunity'' as the fairness notion and show that the exponential mechanisms
can make the decision-making process perfectly fair. Moreover, the experiments
on real-world datasets show that the exponential mechanism can improve both
privacy and fairness, with a slight decrease in accuracy compared to the model
without post-processing.

reconstruct fine geometric and material detail from low resolution input views,
allowing high-quality reconstructions in a few hours despite the expense of

properties. We demonstrate the impact of different geometry initializations,
including space carving, multi-view stereo, and 3D neural networks. Finally,
with input captured using smartphone video and a consumer 360? camera for
lighting estimation, we also show how to refine initial reconstructions of
real-world objects in unconstrained environments.

particular structure apart from the standard assumptions of lower
semicontinuity in the case of sufficient conditions and (in some cases)
convexity in the case of necessary conditions. We expose the roles of the

underlying space: general metric, normed, Banach or Asplund. Employing special
collections of slope operators, we introduce a succinct form of sufficient
error bound conditions, which allows one to combine in a single statement
several different assertions: nonlocal and local primal space conditions in
complete metric spaces, and subdifferential conditions in Banach and Asplund
spaces.

imaging that combines the superiorities of high optical contrast and acoustic
penetration. In the PAT system, more photoacoustic (PA) signals are preferred
to be detected from full field of view to reconstruct PA images with higher
fidelity. However, the requirement for more PA signals detection leads to more
time consumption for single-channel scanning based PAT system, or higher cost
of data acquisition (DAQ) module for an array-based PAT system. To address this
issue, we proposed a programmable acoustic delay line module to reduce DAQ cost
and accelerate imaging speed for PAT system. The module is based on
bidirectional conversion between acoustic signals and electrical signals,
including ultrasound transmission in between to provide sufficient time delay.
The acoustic delay line module achieves tens or hundreds of microseconds delay
for each channel, and is controlled by a programmable control unit. In this
work, it achieves to merge four inputs of PA signals into one output signal,
which can be recovered into original four PA signals in the digital domain
after DAQ. The imaging experiments of pencil leads embedded in agar phantom is
conducted by the PAT system equipped with the proposed programmable acoustic

elastodynamics to resolve systems composed of codimensional DOFs in arbitrary
combination. This enables a unified, interpenetration-free, robust, and stable
simulation framework that couples codimension-0,1,2, and 3 geometries
seamlessly with frictional contact. Extending IPC to thin structures poses new
challenges in computing strain, modeling thickness and determining collisions.
To address these challenges we propose three corresponding contributions.
First, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces
strain limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This
provides energetically-consistent strain limiting models (both isotropic and
anisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction of strain-limit
inequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via
minimization of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric
thickness of codimensional domains we extend the IPC model to directly enforce
distance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee that mid-surfaces
(resp. mid-lines) of shells (resp. rods) will not move closer than applied
thickness values. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact
behavior of codimensional structures and so robustly capture challenging
contacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge, have not been
simulated before. Third, codimensional models, especially with modeled
thickness, mandate strict accuracy requirements that pose a severe challenge to
all existing continuous collision detection (CCD) methods. To address these
limitations we develop a new, efficient, simple-to-implement additive CCD
(ACCD) method that applies conservative advancement to iteratively refine a
lower bound for deforming primitives, converging to time of impact.

and transfer models across image acquisitions, one must be able to cope with
datasets that are not co-registered, acquired under different illumination and
atmospheric conditions, by different sensors, and with scarce ground
references. Traditionally, methods based on histogram matching have been used.
However, they fail when densities have very different shapes or when there is
no corresponding band to be matched between the images. An alternative builds
upon \emph{manifold alignment}. Manifold alignment performs a multidimensional
relative normalization of the data prior to product generation that can cope
with data of different dimensionality (e.g. different number of bands) and
possibly unpaired examples. Aligning data distributions is an appealing
strategy, since it allows to provide data spaces that are more similar to each
other, regardless of the subsequent use of the transformed data. In this paper,
we study a methodology that aligns data from different domains in a nonlinear
way through {\em kernelization}. We introduce the Kernel Manifold Alignment

exploits only a few labeled samples (or semantic ties) in each domain, and
reduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We successfully test KEMA

However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-effect relationship based on

accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of
providing confidence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from
other machine learners. GP-based band analysis identified optimal spectral

pressure due to sudden perturbations. When such disturbances are unpredictable,
it becomes more challenging to tackle. Implementation of specific strategies is
therefore essential for different species to overcome adverse situations.
Numerous biotic and abiotic factors can alter the dynamics of a species.
Anthropogenic disturbance is one such factor that has considerable implications
and also the potential to impact species living in the proximity of human
habitats. We investigated the response of an urban adapted species to a sudden
surge in human footfall or overcrowding. Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) living
freely in the streets of developing countries experience tremendous
anthropogenic pressure. It is known that human movement in an area can predict
the behaviour of these dogs by largely influencing their personalities. In the
current study, we observed a strong effect of high and sudden human footfall on
the abundance and behavioural activity of dogs. A decline in both the abundance
of dogs and behavioural activities was seen with the increase in human
movement. Further investigation over a restricted temporal scale revealed
reinstated behavioural activity but non-restoration of population abundance.
This provides important evidence on the extent to which humans influence the
behaviour of free-ranging dogs in urban environments.

variability in the atmosphere. We demonstrate the feasibility of LAI retrieval
from Sentinel-2 (S2) TOA radiance data (L1C product) in a hybrid machine
learning framework. To achieve this, the coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere
radiative transfer models PROSAIL-6S were used to simulate a look-up table
(LUT) of TOA radiance data and associated input variables. This LUT was then
used to train the Bayesian machine learning algorithms Gaussian processes
regression (GPR) and variational heteroscedastic GPR (VHGPR). PROSAIL
simulations were also used to train GPR and VHGPR models for LAI retrieval from
S2 images at bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) level (L2A product) for comparison
purposes. The VHGPR models led to consistent LAI maps at BOA and TOA scale. We
demonstrated that hybrid LAI retrieval algorithms can be developed from TOA
radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need for atmospheric

where machine learning is currently a key player. In recent years, Gaussian
Process (GP) regression has excelled in biophysical parameter estimation tasks
from airborne and satellite observations. GP regression is based on solid
Bayesian statistics and generally yields efficient and accurate parameter
estimates. However, GPs are typically used for inverse modeling based on
concurrent observations and in situ measurements only. Very often a forward
model encoding the well-understood physical relations between the state vector
and the radiance observations is available though and could be useful to
improve predictions and understanding. In this work, we review three GP models
that respect and learn the physics of the underlying processes in the context
of both forward and inverse modeling. After reviewing the traditional
application of GPs for parameter retrieval, we introduce a Joint GP (JGP) model
that combines in situ measurements and simulated data in a single GP model.
Then, we present a latent force model (LFM) for GP modeling that encodes
ordinary differential equations to blend data-driven modeling and physical
constraints of the system governing equations. The LFM performs multi-output
regression, adapts to the signal characteristics, is able to cope with missing
data in the time series, and provides explicit latent functions that allow
system analysis and evaluation. Finally, we present an Automatic Gaussian
Process Emulator (AGAPE) that approximates the forward physical model using
concepts from Bayesian optimization and at the same time builds an optimally

performance of these models through illustrative examples of vegetation

The proposed sparsity-driven DTM extractor (SD-DTM) takes a high-resolution
Digital Surface Model (DSM) as an input and constructs a high-resolution DTM
using the variational framework. To obtain an accurate DTM, an iterative
approach is proposed for the minimization of the target variational cost
function. Accuracy of the SD-DTM is shown in a real-world DSM data set. We show
the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach both visually and
quantitatively via residual plots in illustrative terrain types.

techniques are needed to enable efficient identification of most informative
bands to facilitate optimized processing of spectral data into estimates of
biophysical variables. This paper introduces an automated spectral band
analysis tool (BAT) based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for the
spectral analysis of vegetation properties. The GPR-BAT procedure sequentially
backwards removes the least contributing band in the regression model for a
given variable until only one band is kept. GPR-BAT is implemented within the
framework of the free ARTMO's MLRA (machine learning regression algorithms)
toolbox, which is dedicated to the transforming of optical remote sensing
images into biophysical products. GPR-BAT allows (1) to identify the most
informative bands in relating spectral data to a biophysical variable, and (2)
to find the least number of bands that preserve optimized accurate predictions.
This study concludes that a wise band selection of hyperspectral data is
strictly required for optimal vegetation properties mapping.

  representation in image data","Preprint of paper accepted at BNAIC/BeneLearn 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the behavior of a neural network model is adversely affected by a lack
of diversity in training data, we present a method that identifies and explains
such deficiencies. When a dataset is labeled, we note that annotations alone
are capable of providing a human interpretable summary of sample diversity.
This allows explaining any lack of diversity as the mismatch found when
comparing the \textit{actual} distribution of annotations in the dataset with
an \textit{expected} distribution of annotations, specified manually to capture
essential label diversity. While, in many practical cases, labeling (samples
$\rightarrow$ annotations) is expensive, its inverse, simulation (annotations
$\rightarrow$ samples) can be cheaper. By mapping the expected distribution of
annotations into test samples using parametric simulation, we present a method
that explains sample representation using the mismatch in diversity between
simulated and collected data. We then apply the method to examine a dataset of
geometric shapes to qualitatively and quantitatively explain sample
representation in terms of comprehensible aspects such as size, position, and
pixel brightness.

to realistically reproduce the light interaction with the Earth surface and
atmosphere. Because these models take long processing time, the common practice
is to first generate a sparse look-up table (LUT) and then make use of
interpolation methods to sample the multi-dimensional LUT input variable space.
However, the question arise whether common interpolation methods perform most
accurate. As an alternative to interpolation, this work proposes to use
emulation, i.e., approximating the RTM output by means of statistical learning.
Two experiments were conducted to assess the accuracy in delivering spectral
outputs using interpolation and emulation: (1) at canopy level, using PROSAIL;
and (2) at top-of-atmosphere level, using MODTRAN. Various interpolation
(nearest-neighbour, inverse distance weighting, piece-wice linear) and
emulation (Gaussian process regression (GPR), kernel ridge regression, neural
networks) methods were evaluated against a dense reference LUT. In all
experiments, the emulation methods clearly produced more accurate output
spectra than classical interpolation methods. GPR emulation performed up to ten
times more accurately than the best performing interpolation method, and this
with a speed that is competitive with the faster interpolation methods. It is
concluded that emulation can function as a fast and more accurate alternative
to commonly used interpolation methods for reconstructing RTM spectral data.

such quantum computers, quantum annealers, and CMOS annealers give rise to new
ways for solving real-word complex problems. However, given current and
near-term hardware limitations, the number of variables required to express a
large real-world problem easily exceeds the hardware capabilities, thus hybrid
methods are usually developed in order to utilize the hardware. In this work,
we advocate for the development of hybrid methods that are built on top of the
frameworks of existing state-of-art heuristics, thereby improving these
methods. We demonstrate this by building on the so called Louvain method, which
is one of the most popular algorithms for the Community detection problem and
develop and Ising-based Louvain method. The proposed method outperforms two
state-of-the-art community detection algorithms in clustering several small to
large-scale graphs. The results show promise in adapting the same optimization
approach to other unsupervised learning heuristics to improve their
performance.

underpins the huge volumes of non-numerical data now being generated. In this
study, we show that replacing numbers with alternative mathematical models,
such as strings and graphs, generalises traditional measurement to provide
rigorous, formal systems (`observement') for recording and interpreting
non-numerical data. Moreover, we show that these representations are already
widely used and identify general classes of interpretive methodologies implicit
in representations based on character strings and graphs (networks). This
implies that a generalised concept of measurement has the potential to reveal
new insights as well as deep connections between different fields of research.

is extremely desirable for model development that can respond to the needs of

application of optimal experimental design to measurements of thermodynamic
properties. The technique is exemplified using the fitting of a Schilling-type
equation from published $(p, \rho, T)$-measurements of ethylene gylcol and
propylene gylcol. The analysis shows that a fixed-exponent fit using
$(p,T)$-measurements along the five most informative isotherms produces models
of relative density errors comparable to those obtained using the data along
all investigated isotherms, \ie, eight or nine. It is also argued that a
calculation of optimal isotherms prior to the measurement series can further
increase the precision at no additional experimental effort.
