passes, affects, and otherwise modifies a circuit. These techniques all have
separate usage scenarios, but when dissected into their core functionality,
they relate in a fundamental manner. In this paper, we develop a common
framework for gate level propagation analysis. We use our model to generate

X-propagation and imprecise fault propagation. We also show that the difference

of deep neural networks (DNNs). Attackers intend to inject hidden backdoors
into DNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples,
whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed if hidden backdoors are
activated by the attacker-defined trigger. Existing backdoor attacks usually
adopt the setting that triggers are sample-agnostic, $i.e.,$ different poisoned
samples contain the same trigger, resulting in that the attacks could be easily
mitigated by current backdoor defenses. In this work, we explore a novel attack
paradigm, where backdoor triggers are sample-specific. In our attack, we only
need to modify certain training samples with invisible perturbation, while not
need to manipulate other training components ($e.g.$, training loss, and model
structure) as required in many existing attacks. Specifically, inspired by the
recent advance in DNN-based image steganography, we generate sample-specific
invisible additive noises as backdoor triggers by encoding an
attacker-specified string into benign images through an encoder-decoder
network. The mapping from the string to the target label will be generated when
DNNs are trained on the poisoned dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets verify the effectiveness of our method in attacking models with or
without defenses.

used for large-scale visual search. However, it is still challenging to produce
compact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple
semantics for two main reasons, 1) similarity constraints designed in most of
the existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity
assignment(i.e., 0 for instance pairs sharing no label, 1 for instance pairs
sharing at least 1 label), 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are
insufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems
significantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper,
we propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a
margin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH
implements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic
information in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for
the semantics of the given dataset, which efficiently and precisely guides a
feature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an
asymmetric learning strategy. By further exploiting semantic dictionaries, a
new margin-scalable constraint is employed for both precise similarity
searching and robust hash code generation. Extensive empirical research on four
popular benchmarks validates the proposed method and shows it outperforms
several state-of-the-art approaches.

purpose, we use a Kuiper belt objects (KBO) population model calibrated on
telescopic surveys, that describes also the evolution of the KBO population
during the early Solar System. We further calibrate this model using the crater
record on Pluto, Charon and Nix. Using this model, we compute the impact
probability on Arrokoth, integrated over the age of the Solar System. This
probability is then used together with other observational constraints to
determine the slope of the crater-production function on Arrokoth. In addition,
we use our Kuiper belt model also to compare the impact rates and velocities of
KBOs on Arrokoth with those on Charon, integrated over the crater retention
ages of their respective surfaces. This allows us to establish a relationship
between the spatial density of sub-km craters on Arrokoth and of D~20km craters
on Charon. Together, all these considerations suggest the crater production
function on these worlds has a cumulative power law slope of -1.5<q<-1.2.
Converted into a projectile SFD slope, we find -1.2<q_KBO<-1.0. These values
are close to the cumulative slope of main belt asteroids in the 0.2--2~km
range, a population in collisional equilibrium. For KBOs, however, this slope
appears to extend from ~2km down to objects a few tens of meters in diameter,
as inferred from sub-km craters on Arrokoth. From the measurement of the dust
density in the Kuiper belt made by the New Horizons mission, we predict that
the SFD of the KBOs becomes steep again below ~10-30m. All these considerations
strongly indicate that the size distribution of the KBO population is in
collisional equilibrium.

projected matter density field and more specifically to the angular aperture
masses. The latter holds the advantage of being an observable that can be
directly extracted from the observed shear field and to be, by construction,
independent from the long wave modes. Furthermore we show that, with the help
of a nulling procedure based on the so-called BNT transform, it is possible to
build observables that depend only on a finite range of redshifts making them
also independent from the small-scale modes. This procedure makes predictions
for the shape of the one-point Probability Distribution Function of such an
observable very accurate, comparable to what had been previously obtained for
3D observables. Comparisons with specific simulations reveal however
inconsistent results showing that synthetic lensing maps were not accurate
enough for such refined observables. It points to the need for more precise
dedicated numerical developments whose performances could be benchmarked with
such observables. We furthermore review the possible systematics that could
affect such a formalism in future weak-lensing surveys like Euclid, notably the

disease. I propose a model where testing permits isolation of the infected and
provides agents with information about the prevalence and lethality of the
disease. Additional testing reduces the perceived lethality of the disease, but
might increase the perceived risk of infection. As a result, more testing could
increase the perceived risk of dying from the disease - i.e. ""stoke fear"" - and
cause a fall in economic activity, despite improving health outcomes. Two main
insights emerge. First, increased testing is beneficial to the economy and pays
for itself if performed at a sufficiently large scale, but not necessarily
otherwise. Second, heterogeneous risk perceptions across age-groups can have
important aggregate consequences. For a SARS-CoV-2 calibration of the model,
heterogeneous risk perceptions across young and old individuals mitigate GDP
losses by 50% and reduce the death toll by 30% relative to a scenario in which
all individuals have the same perceptions of risk.

investigate how to continue scaling compute efficiently beyond the point of

which parallelizes training of individual layers in deep networks by replacing
global backpropagation with truncated layer-wise backpropagation. Local
parallelism enables fully asynchronous layer-wise parallelism with a low memory

the entire system in a completely agnostic way against experimental

imaging (MRI) technique which provides spatial distribution of magnetic
susceptibility values of tissues. QSMs can be obtained by deconvolving the
dipole kernel from phase images, but the spectral nulls in the dipole kernel
make the inversion ill-posed. In recent times, deep learning approaches have
shown a comparable QSM reconstruction performance as the classic approaches,
despite the fast reconstruction time. Most of the existing deep learning
methods are, however, based on supervised learning, so matched pairs of input
phase images and the ground-truth maps are needed. Moreover, it was reported
that the supervised learning often leads to underestimated QSM values. To
address this, here we propose a novel unsupervised QSM deep learning method
using physics-informed cycleGAN, which is derived from optimal transport
perspective. In contrast to the conventional cycleGAN, our novel cycleGAN has
only one generator and one discriminator thanks to the known dipole kernel.
Experimental results confirm that the proposed method provides more accurate
QSM maps compared to the existing deep learning approaches, and provide
competitive performance to the best classical approaches despite the ultra-fast

images retain some features that are characteristic of the target objects if

address the question of whether there can be fooling images with no

case, we introduce single-color images with a few pixels altered, called sparse
fooling images (SFIs). We first prove that SFIs always exist under mild
conditions for linear and nonlinear models and reveal that complex models are
more likely to be vulnerable to SFI attacks. With two SFI generation methods,
we demonstrate that in deeper layers, SFIs end up with similar features to
those of natural images, and consequently, fool DNNs successfully. Among other
layers, we discovered that the max pooling layer causes the vulnerability
against SFIs. The defense against SFIs and transferability are also discussed.
This study highlights the new vulnerability of DNNs by introducing a novel

that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network,
increased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a
constant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave
with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear

that this measurement implements a code subspace projection that enables the
reconstruction of interior operators. We use the soft hair dynamics to
introduce an observer dependent notion of the firewall and show that for an

consider fatigue delamination data strongly affected by R-curve behaviour due
to fibres bridging and argue that a better approach is to correlate the crack
advance with the total work per cycle measured in the testing machine. This
seems to work better than estimating the compliance as a linear fit of
experimental curves from Modified Compliance Calibration ASTM standards
equations for the SERR in the classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics
framework. We show however that if we assume indeed linear behaviour (i.e.
LEFM), the approach they introduce is perfectly equivalent to the SERR one,
i.e. Paris type of laws. As well known form Barenblatt and Botvina, fatigue
crack growth is a weak form of scaling, and it gives Paris classical dependence
only when the crack is much longer than any other characteristic sizes. Paris'
law is not a fundamental law of physics, is not an energy balance equation like
Griffith, and strong size effects due to cohesive zones have been found already
in concrete by Bazant. The proposal is very simple, and interesting as it would
seem to suggest that a proper scaling with a cohesive model at crack tip could
be predicted, although this doesn't seem to have been attempted in the
Literature. The main drawback of the present proposal is that it is not
predictive, but purely observational, as it requires the actual measurement of
work input during the fatigue process.

transitions in non-equilibrium systems. When a many-body quantum system
undergoes unitary evolution interspersed with monitored random measurements,
the steady-state can exhibit a phase transition between volume and area-law
entanglement. There is a correspondence between measurement-induced transitions
in non-unitary quantum circuits in $d$ spatial dimensions and classical
statistical mechanical models in $d+1$ dimensions. In certain limits these
models map to percolation, but there is analytical and numerical evidence to
suggest that away from these limits the universality class should generically
be distinct from percolation. Intriguingly, despite these arguments, numerics
on 1D qubit circuits give bulk exponents which are nonetheless close to those
of 2D percolation, with possible differences in surface behavior. In the first
part of this work we study the critical properties of 2D Clifford circuits. In
the bulk, we find many properties suggested by the percolation picture,
including matching bulk exponents, and an inverse power-law for the critical
entanglement growth, $S(t,L) \sim L(1 - a/t)$, which saturates to an area-law.
We then utilize a graph-state based algorithm to analyze in 1D and 2D the
critical properties of entanglement clusters in the steady state. We show that
in a model with a simple geometric map to percolation, the projective
transverse field Ising model, the entanglement clusters are governed by
percolation surface exponents. However, in the Clifford models we find large
deviations in the cluster exponents from those of surface percolation,
highlighting the breakdown of any possible geometric map to percolation. Given
the evidence for deviations from the percolation universality class, our

arrow of time. And yet, our experiments are not: we observe quantum systems

fundamental question is whether it is possible to conceive a broader set of
operations that probe quantum processes in the backward direction, from the
future to the past, or more generally, in a combination of the forward and
backward directions. Here we introduce a mathematical framework for these
operations, showing that some of them cannot be interpreted as random mixtures
of operations that probe processes in a definite direction. As a concrete
example, we construct an operation, called the quantum time flip, that probes
an unknown dynamics in a quantum superposition of the forward and backward
directions. This operation exhibits an information-theoretic advantage over all
operations with definite direction. It can be realised probabilistically using
quantum teleportation, and can be reproduced experimentally with photonic
systems. More generally, we introduce a set of multipartite operations that
include indefinite time direction as well as indefinite causal order, providing
a framework for potential extensions of quantum theory.

control, to make quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter. Compression can
improve listening comfort, but it can also cause distortion in noisy
environments. It has been widely reported that DRC performs poorly in noise,
but there has been little mathematical analysis of these distortion effects.
This work introduces a mathematical model to study the behavior of DRC in
noise. Using statistical assumptions about the signal envelopes, we define an
effective compression function that models the compression applied to one
signal in the presence of another. This framework is used to prove results
about DRC that have been previously observed experimentally: that when DRC is
applied to a mixture of signals, uncorrelated signal envelopes become
negatively correlated; that the effective compression applied to each sound in
a mixture is weaker than it would have been for the signal alone; and that
compression can reduce the long-term signal-to-noise ratio in certain
conditions. These theoretical results are supported by software experiments
using recorded speech signals.

network a hierarchical structure is formulated by grouping faults based on
their similarity into subsets of faults for detection and diagnosis. Further,
an external pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS) is designed and injected into
the system to identify incipient faults. The hierarchical structure based
strategy improves the detection and classification accuracy significantly for

manifests itself by the fact that the extension of the sequence of numbers of

confined to a strip of bounded width, to negative $n$ produces numbers of
alternating sequences of integers that are bounded from below and from above.
We show that this reciprocity extends to families of non-intersecting bounded
up-down paths and certain arrays of alternating sequences which we call
alternating tableaux. We provide as well weighted versions of these results.
Our proofs are based on Viennot's theory of heaps of pieces and on the
combinatorics of non-intersecting lattice paths. An unexpected application
leads to a refinement of a result of Bousquet-M\'elou and Viennot on the
width-height-area generating function of parallelogram polyominoes. Finally, we
exhibit the relation of the arising alternating tableaux to plane partitions of
strip shapes.

function over the edges of a graph, given neighborhood query access and where
access to the entire network is prohibitively expensive. To estimate this sum,
prior work proposes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that use random
walks started at some seed vertex and whose equilibrium distribution is the
uniform distribution over all edges, eliminating the need to iterate over all
edges. Unfortunately, these existing estimators are not scalable to massive
real-world graphs. In this paper, we introduce Ripple, an MCMC-based estimator
that achieves unprecedented scalability by stratifying the Markov chain state
space into ordered strata with a new technique that we denote {\em sequential
stratified regenerations}. We show that the Ripple estimator is consistent,
highly parallelizable, and scales well.
  We empirically evaluate our method by applying Ripple to the task of
estimating connected, induced subgraph counts given some input graph. Therein,
we demonstrate that Ripple is accurate and can estimate counts of up to
$12$-node subgraphs, which is a task at a scale that has been considered
unreachable, not only by prior MCMC-based methods but also by other sampling
approaches. For instance, in this target application, we present results in
which the Markov chain state space is as large as $10^{43}$, for which Ripple
computes estimates in less than $4$ hours, on average.

galaxies with extremely low oxygen abundances. It has been proposed that they
are young, having formed a large fraction of their stellar mass during their
last few hundred Myr. However, little is known about the fraction of young
stellar populations in more massive galaxies. In a previous article, we
analyzed 280 000 SDSS spectra to identify a surprisingly large sample of more
massive Very Young Galaxies (VYGs), defined to have formed at least $50\%$ of
their stellar mass within the last 1 Gyr. Here, we investigate in detail the
properties of a subsample of 207 galaxies that are VYGs according to all three
of our spectral models. We compare their properties with those of control
sample galaxies (CSGs). We find that VYGs tend to have higher surface
brightness and to be more compact, dusty, asymmetric, and clumpy than CSGs.
Analysis of a subsample with HI detections reveals that VYGs are more gas-rich
than CSGs. VYGs tend to reside more in the inner parts of low-mass groups and
are twice as likely to be interacting with a neighbour galaxy than CSGs. On the
other hand, VYGs and CSGs have similar gas metallicities and large scale
environments (relative to filaments and voids). These results suggest that
gas-rich interactions and mergers are the main mechanisms responsible for the
recent triggering of star formation in low-redshift VYGs, except for the lowest
mass VYGs, where the starbursts may arise from a mixture of mergers and gas
infall.

Firstly, for extracting robust iris features, we have designed a network
utilizing the domain knowledge of ordinal filtering and learning their
nonlinear combinations. Later these real-valued features are binarized.
Finally, for indexing the iris dataset, we have proposed a loss that can
transform the binary feature into an improved feature compatible with the

equally distributed among all the contiguous disjoint sub-strings. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work in the iris indexing domain that
presents an end-to-end iris indexing structure. Experimental results on four

separated by an energy gap. The induced three-body interaction appearing in the
single channel description is derived using the Feshbach projection operators
for the open and closed channels. An effective three-body interaction is
revealed in the limit where the trap setup is tuned to vanishing scattering

ultraviolet scale that competes with the van der Waals radius - this sets the
short-range physics of the system in the open channel. The competition
occurring at short distances exemplifies the violation of the ``van der Waals
universality"" for narrow Feshbach resonances in cold atomic setups. In this

understanding the physics that govern various phenomena ranging from
rheological measurements of fluids to separation of particles and cells. Two
commonly used approaches for obtaining a desired channel shape (for a given
application) are (i) fabricating the microchannel in the requisite shape and
(ii) actuating the microchannel walls during flow to obtain the requisite
shape. However, these approaches are not always viable. We propose an
alternative, passive approach to {\it a priori} tune the elastohydrodynamics in
a microsystem, towards achieving a pre-determined (but not pre-fabricated) flow
geometry when the microchannel is subjected to flow. That is to say, we use the
interaction between a soft solid layer, the viscous flow beneath it and the
shaped rigid wall above it, to tune the fluid domain's shape. Specifically, we
study a parallel-wall microchannel whose top wall is a slender soft coating of
arbitrary thickness attached to a rigid platform. We derive a nonlinear
differential equation for the soft coating's fluid--solid interface, which we
use to infer how to achieve specific conduit shapes during flow. Using this
theory, we demonstrate the tuning of four categories of microchannel
geometries, which establishes, via a proof-of-concept, the viability of our
modeling framework. We also explore slip length patterning on the rigid bottom
wall of the microchannel, a common technique in microfluidics, as an addition
`handle' for microchannel shape control. However, we show that this effect is
much weaker in practice.

word to the case of 2-dimensional configurations on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. More
precisely, we consider a particular subshift of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$ on
the alphabet $\mathcal{A}=\{0,\dots,18\}$ for which we give three
characterizations: as the subshift $\mathcal{X}_\phi$ generated by a
2-dimensional morphism $\phi$ defined on $\mathcal{A}$; as the Wang shift
$\Omega_\mathcal{U}$ defined by a set $\mathcal{U}$ of 19 Wang tiles; as the
symbolic dynamical system $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{U},R_\mathcal{U}}$
representing the orbits under some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action $R_\mathcal{U}$
defined by rotations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and coded by some topological partition
$\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{U}$ of $\mathbb{T}^2$ into 19 polygonal atoms. We prove
their equality $\Omega_\mathcal{U}
=\mathcal{X}_\phi=\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{U},R_\mathcal{U}}$ by
showing they are self-similar with respect to the substitution $\phi$.
  This chapter provides a transversal reading of results divided into four
different articles obtained through the study of the Jeandel-Rao Wang shift. It
gathers in one place the methods introduced to desubstitute Wang shifts and to
desubstitute codings of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions by focussing on a simple
2-dimensional self-similar subshift. SageMath code to find marker tiles and
compute the Rauzy induction of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotations is provided allowing to
reproduce the computations.

class of Littlestone dimension $d$ with approximate differential privacy is
$\tilde O(d^6)$, ignoring privacy and accuracy parameters. This result answers
a question of Bun et al. (FOCS 2020) by improving upon their upper bound of
$2^{O(d)}$ on the sample complexity. Prior to our work, finiteness of the
sample complexity for privately learning a class of finite Littlestone
dimension was only known for improper private learners, and the fact that our
learner is proper answers another question of Bun et al., which was also asked
by Bousquet et al. (NeurIPS 2020). Using machinery developed by Bousquet et
al., we then show that the sample complexity of sanitizing a binary hypothesis
class is at most polynomial in its Littlestone dimension and dual Littlestone
dimension. This implies that a class is sanitizable if and only if it has
finite Littlestone dimension. An important ingredient of our proofs is a new
property of binary hypothesis classes that we call irreducibility, which may be
of independent interest.

the masses of the two binary components fall in the neutron-star mass range,
such a system is typically classified as a binary neutron-star system, although
the detected gravitational-wave signal may be too noisy to clearly establish a
neutron-star nature of the high-mass component in the binary and rule out a
black hole--neutron star system for such an event. We here show that high-mass
binary neutron-star mergers with a very massive neutron-star primary close to
the maximum-mass limit, $m_1 \gtrsim 2.2 \, M_\odot$, produce fast dynamical
mass ejecta from the spin-up of the primary star at merger. By simulating the
merger of black hole--neutron star systems of exactly the same masses and
spins, we show that these fast ejecta are entirely absent, if the primary is
instead a black hole. In addition, we find that both systems leave almost
identical amounts of baryon mass behind, which is not immediately accreted by
the black hole. This implies that both systems will likely have comparable
electromagnetic afterglow emission stemming from the remnant disk. Hence, fast
ejecta at merger have the potentialto distinguish neutron stars from black
holes in high-mass mergers, although these ejecta may be challenging to detect
observationally.

laser intensities. For laser pulses of frequencies much greater than the
electron plasma frequency, the shifts can also be much greater than the plasma

design of a planar vortex antenna, tailored for Geo applications, where the

incremental stepped chirp strategy and with single-mode OAM linearly
incremented modulation. We assign the resolutions of each dimension to three

from the HR-RT-GeoPolInt-OAM communication channel backscattered signals are
used to focus, through fast-Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, a range-azimuth
image that belongs to a single epoch at a given constant frequency. Each OAM
fast-time RADAR image is separated in frequency by using MCA. This procedure is
repeated for all the epochs of the entire stepped-frequency chirp. Once each
two-dimensional image is synthesized, they are co-registered, and the

escalating task complexity; ii) a simple semantic map agent performs
surprisingly well relative to more complex neural image feature map agents; and
iii) even oracle map agents achieve relatively low performance, indicating the
potential for future work in training embodied navigation agents using maps.

introduced by Mazi\`eres in 2016 where the participating nodes conceptually
form a network, with links between them being established by each node
individually and thus in a decentralized way. An important question is whether
these decentralized decisions lead to an overall decentralized network. The
level of (de-)centralization in a network can be assessed using centrality
measures. In this paper we consider three different approaches for obtaining
centrality measures for the nodes in an FBAS. Two of them are based on adapting
well-known measures based on graphs and hypergraphs to the FBAS context. Since
the network structure of an FBAS can be more complex than (usual) graphs or
hypergraphs, we also develop a new, problem-adapted centrality measure. This
new measure is based on the intactness of nodes, which is an important
ingredient of the FBAS model. We illustrate advantages and disadvantages of the
three approaches on several computed examples. We have implemented all
centrality measures and performed all computations in the Python package

early universe. However, due to the large neutrino density, a small
perturbation of the isotropy of the neutrino field could potentially be
amplified by the non-linear flavor mixing caused by neutrino self-interactions.
We carry out the first numerical simulations of the neutrino flavor evolution
in a multi-angle anisotropic setting. Due to the computational challenges
involved, we adopt a simplified framework consisting of a homogeneous universe
with two angle bins -- left and right moving modes -- for neutrinos and
antineutrinos, together with an approximate form for the collision term which
goes beyond the commonly adopted damping approximation. By assuming a small
initial left-right asymmetry of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})$, we convincingly
demonstrate that flavor evolution can be affected in both mass orderings, with
implications on the effective number of thermally excited neutrino species
($N_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Notably, the correction to $N_{\rm eff}$ is comparable to
higher order corrections from finite temperature QED effects in normal
ordering. In addition, by assuming an initial lepton asymmetry in the neutrino
sector of the same order as the baryon one [$\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$], we find
that the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry grows by several orders of magnitude
for isotropic as well as anisotropic initial conditions. This work clearly
shows that it is imperative to critically revisit standard assumptions
concerning neutrino flavor mixing in the early universe, especially in the
light of possible implications on the cosmological observables.

simulations that can resolve halo masses of $M_{\rm halo} \simeq 10^{9}\
M_{\odot}$ (in a simulation box of length $L_{\rm box}{\sim}100\,{\rm Mpc}$)
and $10^{7}\ M_{\odot}$ ($L_{\rm box}\sim20\,{\rm Mpc}$), we demonstrate that
clustering in the vicinity of the lens host produces a clear enhancement
relative to an assumption of unclustered halos that persists to $> 20\,R_{\rm

for clustering, particularly within $2-5\,R_{\rm vir}$. We provide an analytic
expression for this excess, clustered contribution. We find that local
clustering boosts the expected count of $10^9 \ M_\odot$ perturbing halos by
${\sim}35\%$ compared to substructure alone, a result that will significantly
enhance expected signals for low-redshift ($z_l \simeq 0.2$) lenses, where
substructure contributes substantially compared to LOS halos. We also find that
the orientation of the lens with respect to the line of sight (e.g., whether
the line of sight passes through the major axis of the lens) can also have a
significant effect on the lensing signal, boosting counts by an additional
$\sim 50\%$ compared to a random orientations. This could be important if

a continuous flow of high column density gas from star-forming regions into a

evidence of AGN activity in the galaxies, the observed Lya signals can be
explained by a combination of resonant scattering and recombination radiation

Ti, Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). These stars are
confirmed to be metal-poor ([Fe/H]$<-2.5$), with higher precision than from
earlier medium-resolution analyses. The chemistry for most targets is similar
to other extremely metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Three stars near
[Fe/H]$=-3.0$ have unusually low Ca and high Mg, suggestive of contributions
from few SN~II where alpha-element formation through hydrostatic
nucleosynthesis was more efficient. Three new carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars
are also identified (two CEMP-s and one potential CEMP-no star) when our
chemical abundances are combined with carbon from previous medium-resolution

Gaia DR2 proper motions. Most of our targets are dynamically associated with
the Galactic halo; however, five stars with [Fe/H]$<-3$ have planar-like
orbits, including one retrograde star. Another five stars are dynamically
consistent with the Gaia-Sequoia accretion event; three have typical halo
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for their metallicities, whereas two are

weakly gauging and spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetries of
the dual 4D CFT. Our main contribution is to provide a unified and
comprehensive discussion of the subject, together with a detailed description
of the dual CFT picture for each case. Employing a gauge-fixed effective action
suitable for a holographic study, we reproduce many known results in the
literature, such as 't Hooft anomaly matching for unbroken symmetry (Neumann
IR-BC) and (gauged) Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) action for broken symmetry (IR-BC
breaks the bulk group $G \to H$). In addition, we show that anomaly matching
occurs for ABJ anomalies as well as 't Hooft anomalies, which suggests
anomalies inflowed from the bulk CS theory are necessarily free of mixed
anomalies with the confining gauge force of the 4D dual CFT. In the case of

the weakly gauged symmetry are completely removed by a proper field
redefinition, provided the anomaly from the bulk is exactly cancelled by the
boundary contribution, hence confirming the standard expectation. Moreover, we
present a holographic formulation of Witten's argument for the quantization
condition for the WZW action, and argue in favor of an alternative way to
obtain the same condition using a ""deformed"" theory (different BCs). We work
out several examples, including a product group with mixed anomaly, and

a problem about quantum evolutions of multi-photons on multimode photonic

propose a new variant of the problem, timestamp membosonsampling, exploiting
the timestamp information of single photons as free resources, and the scaling

the past to properly define the monopole fluctuation, but the resulting values
of the monopole power $C_0$ are infinite due to the infrared divergences. The
infrared divergences arise from the contribution of the uniform gravitational

$C_0=1.66\times10^{-9}$ in a $\Lambda$CDM model. While the gauge-dependence in
the standard calculations originates from the ambiguity in defining the

well defined and one of the fundamental cosmological parameters. We argue that
once the cosmological parameters are chosen, the monopole fluctuation can be
unambiguously inferred from the angle-average of the observed CMB temperature,
making it a model-dependent ''observable''. Adopting simple approximations for

(R=15,000) spectrum obtained with the High Resolution Spectrograph on the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope in 2007 and 2008. To independently determine the
metallicity, a moderate resolution (R~4,000) spectrum of the calcium-II triplet
lines in the near-infrared was also obtained with the Astrophysical Research
Consortium's 3.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. From the
high-resolution spectrum, G1 is found to be a moderately metal-poor cluster,
with [Fe/H]=-0.98+/-0.05. G1 also shows signs of alpha-enhancement (based on
Mg, Ca, and Ti) and lacks the s-process enhancements seen in dwarf galaxies
(based on comparisons of Y, Ba, and Eu), indicating that it originated in a
fairly massive galaxy. Intriguingly, G1 also exhibits signs of Na and Al
enhancement, a unique signature of GCs -- this suggests that G1's formation is
intimately connected with GC formation. G1's high [Na/Fe] also extends previous
trends with cluster velocity dispersion to an even higher mass regime, implying
that higher mass clusters are more able to retain Na-enhanced ejecta. The
effects of intracluster abundance spreads are discussed in a subsequent paper.
Ultimately, G1's chemical properties are found to resemble other M31 GCs,
though it also shares some similarities with extragalactic nuclear star
clusters.

conduction across shocks, preventing spurious radiative losses in feedback

constrain the physical process that generates those structures. There are
various effects, such as the remnant shell thickness, projection of a
three-dimensional structure onto a two-dimensional observational plane, and the
presence of diffuse ""foreground"" emission, which causes the observed power
spectrum to deviate from the intrinsic power spectrum of the fluctuations.
Here, we report results from a systematic study of these effects, using direct
numerical simulations, in the measured power spectrum. For an input power-law
power spectrum, independent of the power-law index, we see a break in the
observed power law at a scale which depends on the shell thickness of a
shell-type SNR, and the three-dimensional turbulence changes to two-dimensional
turbulence beyond that scale. We also report how the estimated power spectrum
is expected to deviate from the intrinsic SNR power spectrum in the presence of
additional diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (DGSE) around the remnant
shell. For a reasonable choice of the parameters, if the intrinsic SNR power
spectrum is shallower than the DGSE power spectrum, the SNR contribution
dominates at small angular scales of the estimated power spectra. On the other
hand, if the SNR power spectrum is relatively steeper, the original power
spectra is recovered only over a small window of angular scales. This study
shows how detailed modeling may be used to infer the true power spectrum from
the observed SNR intensity fluctuations power spectrum, which in turn can be
used to constrain the nature of the turbulence that gives rise to these small
scale structures.

bump strengths owing to small scale fluctuations in the bump strength. Our
models naturally produce slopes for some non-Milky Way analogs as steep as
those of the LMC and SMC in metal poor galaxies, though notably the bump
strengths are, on average, too large when comparing to the Magellanic clouds.
This owes to the fact that we evolve the grain size distributions of graphites
and silicates simultaneously, which is an oversimplification. Our model
provides a novel framework to study the origins and variations of dust
extinction curves in galaxies over cosmic time.

whether there exists one that is also fair; (2) among the fair allocations,
compute one that maximizes the utilitarian welfare. We show that both problems

for a fixed number of agents greater than two. For the special case of two
agents, we find that problem (1) is polynomial-time solvable, while problem (2)

pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for both problems. We extend our results to

planetary systems, since debris disks have been shown to have a tentative
correlation with giant planets. We selected 20 stars identified as debris disk
hosts by the WSIE mission, with particularly high levels of warm dust. We
observed these with the VLT/SPHERE high contrast imaging instrument with the
goal of finding planets and imaging the disks in scattered light. Our survey
reaches a median 5$\sigma$~sensitivity of 10.4Mj at 25au and 5.9Mj at 100au. We
identified three new stellar companions (HD18378B, HD19257B and HD133778B): two
are mid-M type stars and one is late-K or early-M star. Three additional stars
have very widely separated stellar companions (all at $>$2000au) identified in
the Gaia catalog. The stars hosting the three SPHERE-identified companions are
all older ($\gtrsim$700Myr), with one having recently left the main sequence
and one a giant star. We infer that the high volumes of dust observed around
these stars might have been caused by a recent collision between the planets
and planetesimal belts in the system, although for the most evolved star, mass
loss could also be responsible for the infrared excess. Future mid-IR
spectroscopy or polarimetric imaging may allow the positions and spatial extent
of these dust belts to be constrained, thereby providing evidence as to the
true cause of the elevated levels of dust around these old systems. None of the
disks in this survey are resolved in scattered light.

thus provide evidence for the $t$-channel exchange of a colorless, $C$-odd
gluonic compound, also known as the odderon. We combine these results with a
TOTEM analysis of the same $C$-odd exchange based on the total cross section
and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic scattering

taken to be profinite. We resolve a serious deficit in the existing theory by
constructing a good notion of equivariant presheaves, with a suitable
equivariant sheafification functor. Using equivariant sheafification, we
develop the general theory of equivariant sheaves of modules over a ring, give
explicit constructions of infinite products and introduce an equivariant
analogue of skyscraper sheaves.
  These results underlie recent work by the authors which proves that there is
an algebraic model for rational G-spectra in terms of equivariant sheaves over
profinite spaces. That model is constructed in terms of Weyl-G-sheaves over the
space of closed subgroups of G, where the term Weyl indicates that the stalk
over H is H-fixed. In this paper, we prove that Weyl-G-sheaves of R-modules
form an abelian category with enough injectives and is a coreflective
subcategory of equivariant sheaves of R-modules.
  We end the paper with a structural result that provides another way to
conveniently build equivariant sheaves from simpler data. We prove that a
G-equivariant sheaf over a profinite base space X is a colimit of equivariant
sheaves over finite discrete spaces X_i with actions of finite groups G_i,
where X is the limit of the X_i and G is the limit of the G_i.

radiation, therefore one needs indirect measurements of the escape fraction of
ionizing photons from galaxies of this epoch. Low-ionization state absorption
lines are a common feature in the spectrum of galaxies, showing a diversity of
strengths and shapes. Since these lines indicate the presence of neutral gas in
front of the stars, they have been proposed to carry information on the escape
of ionizing radiation from galaxies. We study which processes are responsible
for the shape of the absorption lines, to better understand their origin. We
then explore whether the absorption lines can be used to predict the escape
fractions. Using a radiation-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation and the
radiative transfer code RASCAS, we generate mock CII 1334 and LyB lines of a
virtual galaxy at redshift 3 as seen from many directions of observation. We
also compute the escape fraction of ionizing photons in those directions and
look for correlations between the lines and the escape fractions. We find that
the resulting mock absorption lines are comparable to observations and that the
lines and the escape fractions vary strongly depending on the direction of
observation. Gas velocity and dust always affect the absorption profile
significantly. We find no strong correlations between observable LyB or CII
1334 and the escape fraction. After correcting the continuum for attenuation by
dust to recover the intrinsic continuum, the residual flux of CII 1334
correlates well with the escape fraction for directions with a dust corrected
residual flux larger than 30%. For other directions, the relations have a
strong dispersion, and the residual flux overestimates the escape fraction for
most cases. Concerning LyB, the residual flux after dust correction does not
correlate with the escape fraction but can be used as a lower limit. (abridged)

statistics available. We aim to identify and characterize a set of pre- and
proto-BDs as well as Class II BDs in the Lupus 1 and 3 molecular clouds to test
their formation mechanism. We performed ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum
observations of a selection of 64 cores previously identified from AzTEC/ASTE
data (1.1 mm), along with previously known Class II BDs in the Lupus 1 and 3
molecular clouds. Surveyed archival data in the optical were used to complement
these observations. We expect these ALMA observations prove efficient in
detecting the youngest sources in these regions, since they probe the frequency
domain at which these sources emit most of their radiation. We detected 19
sources from 15 ALMA fields. Considering all the pointings in our observing
setup, the ALMA detection rate was $\sim$23% and the derived masses of the
detected sources were between $\sim$0.18 and 124 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$. We
classified these sources according to their spectral energy distribution as 5
Class II sources, 2 new Class I/0 candidats, and 12 new possible pre-BD or
deeply embedded protostellar candidates. We detected a promising candidate for
a Class 0/I proto-BD source and inferred the disk dust mass of a bona fide
Class II BD. The pre-BD cores might be the byproduct of an ongoing process of
large-scale collapse. The Class II BD disks follow the correlation between disk
mass and the mass of the central object that is observed at the low-mass
stellar regime. We conclude that it is highly probable that the sources in the
sample are formed as a scaled-down version of low-mass star formation, although
disk fragmentation may be responsible for a considerable fraction of BDs.

sustaining a high-temperature radiation bath during inflation. The discrete
interchange symmetry of the model protects the scalar potential against large
thermal corrections and leads to a stable inflaton remnant at late times which

invariant framework which captures the physics of stochastic diffusion in

quasinormal and Hawking modes from the short-lived ones. It furthermore
provides a template for analyzing fluctuating open quantum field theories with
memory. In particular, we use this set-up to analyze the diffusive Hawking
photons and gravitons about a planar Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and derive
the quadratic effective action that governs fluctuating hydrodynamics of the
dual CFT. Along the way we also derive results relevant for probes of

the tilt is however classical in essence and parametrized by the slow roll of
the inflaton potential. Here we present a purely quantum mechanical and model

observations: first, the correlator for gauge invariant variables is related to
the {\it quantum Fisher function} measuring the quantum dependence of the
family of pure de Sitter vacua on the energy scale parameter; second, this
quantum Fisher function has a non vanishing scale dependent red tilt that, at
the energy scales of physical interest, fits the effective quasi de Sitter

resolutions of 300,000 -- 400,000 are optimal to detect O2 in the atmosphere of
earth analogs with the ELTs. Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI) arrays have been
proposed as a relatively low-cost way to reach these resolutions. In this

reaches a resolving power of 600,000. We further discuss the use of
multi-cavity etalons (dualons) to be resolution boosters for existing
spectrographs.

ingredients of the cosmological model. A main summary statistic derived from
those measurements is the one-dimensional power spectrum, P1D, of the
Ly$\alpha$ absorption. However, model predictions for P1D rely on expensive
hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, which was the limiting
factor in previous analyses. Datasets from upcoming surveys such as DESI will
push observational accuracy near the 1%-level and probe even smaller scales.
This observational push mandate seven more accurate simulations as well as more
careful exploration of parameter space. In this work we evaluate the robustness
and accuracy of simulations and the statistical framework used to constrain
cosmological parameters. We present a comparison between the grid-based
simulation code Nyx and SPH-based code Gadget in the context ofP1D. In
addition, we perform resolution and box-size convergence tests using Nyx code.
We use a Gaussian process emulation scheme to reduce the number of simulations
required for exploration of parameter space without sacrificing the model
accuracy. We demonstrate the ability to produce unbiased parameter constraints
in an end-to-end inference test using mock eBOSS- and DESI-like data, and we
advocate for the usage of adaptive sampling schemes as opposed to using a fixed

defined grain types but also highlighting new divisions. Mainstream grains
reside in three clusters probably representing different parent star
metallicities. One of these clusters has a compact core, with a narrow range of
composition, pointing to an enhanced production of SiC grains in asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars with a narrow range of masses and metallicities. The
addition of 26Al/27Al data highlights a cluster of mainstream grains, enriched
in 15N and 26Al, which cannot be explained by current AGB models. We defined
two AB grain clusters, one with 15N and 26Al excesses, and the other with 14N
and smaller 26Al excesses, in agreement with recent studies. Their definition
does not use the solar N isotopic ratio as a divider, and the contour of the
26Al-rich AB cluster identified in this study is in better agreement with
core-collapse supernova models. We also found a cluster with a mixture of
putative nova and AB grains, which may have formed in supernova or nova
environments. X grains make up two clusters, having either strongly correlated
Si isotopic ratios or deviating from the 2/3 slope line in the Si 3-isotope

previous use of 12C/13C= 100 as a divider for Y grains was arbitrary. Our
results show that cluster analysis is a powerful tool to interpret the data in

many physical assets. To enable a good prediction of the end of discharge of
batteries, detailed electrochemical Li-I battery models have been developed.
Their parameters are typically calibrated before they are taken into operation
and are typically not re-calibrated during operation. However, since battery
performance is affected by aging, the reality gap between the computational
battery models and the real physical systems leads to inaccurate predictions. A
supervised machine learning algorithm would require an extensive representative
training dataset mapping the observation to the ground truth calibration
parameters. This may be infeasible for many practical applications. In this
paper, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based framework for reliably and
efficiently inferring calibration parameters of battery models. The framework
enables real-time inference of the computational model parameters in order to
compensate the reality-gap from the observations. Most importantly, the
proposed methodology does not need any labeled data samples, (samples of
observations and the ground truth calibration parameters). Furthermore, the
framework does not require any information on the underlying physical model.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable
of inferring the model parameters with high accuracy and high robustness. While
the achieved results are comparable to those obtained with supervised machine
learning, they do not rely on the ground truth information during training.

In this paper, we show that a customized hardware design on a Field

to achieve real-time formal verification with a 4D car model by re-solving the

trained to predict detail, shape, albedo, expression, pose and illumination

detail-consistency loss that disentangles person-specific details from
expression-dependent wrinkles. This disentanglement allows us to synthesize
realistic person-specific wrinkles by controlling expression parameters while
keeping person-specific details unchanged. DECA is learned from in-the-wild

We computed the weighted mean RV, Galactic velocities and orbital parameters of
1382 OCs. We investigated their distributions as a function of age, and by
comparison to field stars. We provide the largest RV catalogue available for
OCs, half of it based on at least 3 members. Compared to field stars, we note
that OCs are not exactly on the same arches in the radial-azimuthal velocity
plane, while they seem to follow the same diagonal ridges in the Galactic
radial distribution of azimuthal velocities. Velocity ellipsoids in different
age bins all show a clear anisotropy. The heating rate of the OC population is
similar to that of field stars for the radial and azimuthal components but
significantly lower for the vertical component. The rotation curve drawn by our
sample of clusters shows several dips, which match the wiggles derived from
non-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy. From the computation of orbits, we
obtain a clear dependence of the maximum height and eccentricity with age.
Finally, the orbital characteristics of the sample of clusters as shown by the
action variables, follow the distribution of field stars. The additional age
information of the clusters points towards some (weak) age dependence of the
known moving groups.

is the characteristic feature of Mott insulators. We study how the Mott gap is
affected by long-range antiferromagnetic order. Our key finding is that the
Mott gap is increased by the magnetic ordering: a magnetic blue-shift (MBS)
occurs. Thus, the effect is proportional to the exchange coupling in the
leading order in the Hubbard model. In systems with additional localized spins
the double-exchange mechanism induces an additional contribution to the MBS
which is proportional to the hopping in the leading order. The coupling between
spin and charge degrees of freedom bears the potential to enable spin-to-charge
conversion in Mott systems on extreme time scales determined by hopping and
exchange only, since a spin-orbit mediated transfer of angular momentum is not
involved in the process. In view of spintronic and magnonic applications, it is
highly promising to observe that several entire classes of compounds show
exchange and double-exchange effects. Exemplarily, we show that the magnetic
contribution to the band-gap blue-shift observed in the optical conductivity of
$\alpha$-MnTe is correctly interpreted as the MBS of a Mott gap.

equivalent to Eddington fractions of $\sim4\times10^{-7}$. During its decay

completing at $L_{\rm X}\approx10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\approx10^{-5} L_{\rm

of the organization network interacts with the local properties of devices. To
validate the interaction among the timing properties of components and the
network, we formally specify such systems in Timed Rebeca. We use model
checking to verify the derived timing requirements of the communication
substrate in terms of the network and device models. We provide a set of
templates as a guideline to specify medical systems in terms of the formal
model of patterns. A composite medical system using several devices is subject
to state-space explosion. We extend the reduction technique of Timed Rebeca
based on the static properties of patterns. We prove that our reduction is
sound and show the applicability of our approach in reducing the state space by
modeling two clinical scenarios made of several instances of patterns.

Particle (LSP), could be motivated by the stringent upper bounds on the DM
direct detection rates. This is especially so when its mass is around or below
100 GeV for which such a bound tends to get most severe. Requiring not so large
a higgsino mass parameter, that would render the scenario reasonably natural,
prompts such a bino-like state to be relatively light. In the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), in the absence of comparably light
scalars, such an excitation, if it has to be a thermal relic, is unable to meet
the stringent experimental upper bound on its abundance unless its
self-annihilation hits a funnel involving either the $Z$-boson or the Standard
Model (SM)-like Higgs boson. We demonstrate that, in such a realistic
situation, a highly bino-like DM of the popular $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is viable over an extended range of its
mass, from our targeted maximum in the vicinity of the mass of the top quark
down to about 30 GeV. This is facilitated by the presence of comparably light
singlet-like states that could serve as funnel (scalars) and/or coannihilating
(singlino) states even as the bino-like LSP receives a minimal (but optimal)
tempering triggered by suitably light higgsino states that, in the first place,
evade stringent lower bounds on their masses that can be derived from the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments only in the presence of a lighter
singlino-like state. An involved set of blind spot conditions is derived for
the DM direct detection rates by considering for the very first time the
augmented system of neutralinos comprising of the bino, the higgsinos and the
singlino which highlights the important roles played by the NMSSM parameters
$\lambda$ and $\tan\beta$ in delivering a richer phenomenology.

this work, we study the statistical mechanics of learning in Deep Linear Neural
Networks (DLNNs) in which the input-output function of an individual unit is
linear. Despite the linearity of the units, learning in DLNNs is nonlinear,
hence studying its properties reveals some of the features of nonlinear Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). Importantly, we solve exactly the network properties
following supervised learning using an equilibrium Gibbs distribution in the
weight space. To do this, we introduce the Back-Propagating Kernel
Renormalization (BPKR), which allows for the incremental integration of the
network weights starting from the network output layer and progressing backward
until the first layer's weights are integrated out. This procedure allows us to
evaluate important network properties, such as its generalization error, the
role of network width and depth, the impact of the size of the training set,
and the effects of weight regularization and learning stochasticity. BPKR does
not assume specific statistics of the input or the task's output. Furthermore,
by performing partial integration of the layers, the BPKR allows us to compute
the properties of the neural representations across the different hidden
layers. We have proposed an extension of the BPKR to nonlinear DNNs with ReLU.
Surprisingly, our numerical simulations reveal that despite the nonlinearity,
the predictions of our theory are largely shared by ReLU networks in a wide
regime of parameters. Our work is the first exact statistical mechanical study
of learning in a family of DNNs, and the first successful theory of learning
through successive integration of DoFs in the learned weight space.

PSD. We call a matrix in this $k$-\emph{locally PSD}. In order to compare
$S^{n,k}$ to the of PSD matrices, we study eigenvalues of $k$-{locally PSD}

$H(e_k^n)$ so that if $X \in \mathcal{S}^{n,k}$, then the vector of eigenvalues
of $X$ is contained in $H(e_k^n)$. The cone $H(e_k^n)$ is the hyperbolicity

first show that this relaxation is tight for the case of $k = n -1$, that is,
for every vector in $H(e^n_{n -1})$ there exists a matrix in $\mathcal{S}^{n, n

multi-frequency cleaning techniques employed in CMB data analysis. These
methods reduce foregrounds by minimizing the total variance in the coadded map
(subject to a signal-preservation constraint), although often significant
foreground residuals or biases remain. A modification to the ILC method is the
constrained ILC (cILC), which explicitly nulls certain foreground components;
however, this foreground nulling often comes at a high price for ground-based
CMB datasets, with the map noise increasing significantly on small scales. In
this paper we explore a new method, the partially constrained ILC (pcILC),
which allows us to optimize the tradeoff between foreground bias and variance
in ILC methods. In particular, this method allows us to minimize the variance
subject to an inequality constraint requiring that the constrained foregrounds
are reduced by at least a fixed factor, which can be chosen based on the
foreground sensitivity of the intended application. We test our method on
simulated sky maps for a Simons Observatory-like experiment; we find that for
cleaning thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) contamination at $\ell \in
[3000,4800]$, if a small tSZ residual of 20% of the standard ILC residual can
be tolerated, the variance of the CMB temperature map is reduced by at least
50% over the cILC value. We also demonstrate an application of this method to
reduce noise in CMB lensing reconstruction.

mean flow is analyzed using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KPII) equation.
Building upon previous studies that examined the transmission or trapping of a
soliton by a slowly varying rarefaction or oscillatory dispersive shock wave in
one space and one time dimension, this paper allows for the incident soliton to
approach the changing mean flow at a nonzero oblique angle. By deriving
invariant quantities of the soliton-mean flow modulation equations$-$a system
of three (1+1)-dimensional quasilinear, hyperbolic equations for the soliton
and mean flow parameters$-$and positing the initial configuration as a Riemann
problem in the modulation variables, it is possible to derive quantitative
predictions regarding the evolution of the line soliton within the mean flow.
It is found that the interaction between an oblique soliton and a changing mean
flow leads to several novel features not observed in the (1+1)-dimensional
reduced problem. Many of these interesting dynamics arise from the unique
structure of the modulation equations that are nonstrictly hyperbolic,
including a well-defined multivalued solution interpreted as a solution of the
(2+1)-dimensional soliton-mean modulation equations, in which the soliton
interacts with the mean flow and then wraps around to interact with it again.
Finally, it is shown that the oblique interactions between solitons and
dispersive shock wave solutions for the mean flow give rise to all three
possible types of 2-soliton solutions of the KPII equation. The analytical
findings are quantitatively supported by direct numerical simulations.

applications in ultrathin electronics and photonics. The exposure of TMD based
devices to light generates photo-carriers resulting in an enhanced
conductivity, which can be effectively used, e.g., in photodetectors. If the
photo-enhanced conductivity persists after removal of the irradiation, the
effect is known as persistent photoconductivity (PPC). Here we show that
ultraviolet light (wavelength = 365 nm) exposure induces an extremely
long-living giant PPC (GPPC) in monolayer MoS2 (ML-MoS2) field-effect
transistors (FET) with a time constant of ~30 days. Furthermore, this effect
leads to a large enhancement of the conductivity up to a factor of 107. In
contrast to previous studies in which the origin of the PPC was attributed to
extrinsic reasons such as trapped charges in the substrate or adsorbates, we
unambiguously show that the GPPC arises mainly from the intrinsic properties of
ML-MoS2 such as lattice defects that induce a large amount of localized states
in the forbidden gap. This finding is supported by a detailed experimental and
theoretical study of the electric transport in TMD based FETs as well as by
characterization of ML-MoS2 with scanning tunneling spectroscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence
measurements. The obtained results provide a basis towards the defect-based
engineering of the electronic and optical properties of TMDs for device
applications.

properties led to the hypothesis almost four decades ago that it is
gravitationally lensed by a mass concentration associated with an intervening
galaxy. It exhibits symmetric achromatic variability, a rare form of
variability that has been attributed to gravitational milli-lensing. It has
been classified as a BL Lac object, and is one of the rare objects in this
class with a visible counterjet. BL Lac objects have jet axes aligned close to
the line of sight. It has also been classified as a compact symmetric object,
which have jet axes not aligned close to the line of sight. Intensive efforts
to understand this blazar have hitherto failed to resolve even the questions of
the orientation of the relativistic jet, and the host galaxy. Answering these
two questions is important as they challenge our understanding of jets in
active galactic nuclei and the classification schemes we use to describe them.
We show that the jet axis is aligned close to the line of sight and PKS
1413+135 is almost certainly not located in the apparent host galaxy, but is a
background object in the redshift range $0.247 < z < 0.5$. The intervening
spiral galaxy at $z = 0.247$ provides a natural host for the putative lens
responsible for symmetric achromatic variability and is shown to be a Seyfert 2
galaxy. We also show that, as for the radio emission, a ""multizone"" model is
needed to account for the high-energy emission.

direct evidence for the inflationary paradigm of the origin of the Universe.
The BICEP/Keck Array (BK) program targets the degree angular scales, where the
power from primordial $B$-mode polarization is expected to peak, with
ever-increasing sensitivity and has published the most stringent constraints on
inflation to date. BICEP Array (BA) is the Stage-3 instrument of the BK program
and will comprise four BICEP3-class receivers observing at 30/40, 95, 150 and
220/270 GHz with a combined 32,000+ detectors; such wide frequency coverage is
necessary for control of the Galactic foregrounds, which also produce
degree-scale $B$-mode signal. The 30/40 GHz receiver is designed to constrain
the synchrotron foreground and has begun observing at the South Pole in early
2020. By the end of a 3-year observing campaign, the full BICEP Array
instrument is projected to reach $\sigma_r$ between 0.002 and 0.004, depending
on foreground complexity and degree of removal of $B$-modes due to
gravitational lensing (delensing). This paper presents an overview of the
design, measured on-sky performance and calibration of the first BA receiver.
We also give a preview of the added complexity in the time-domain multiplexed

those that have opposite magnetic polarity, which, in their majority, generate
explosive events such as the so-called solar flares. The flares are intense
explosions occurring in the solar atmosphere with adverse effects on the Earth

in the so-called space weather. For this reason, attempts have been made to

the bipolar active regions. The analysis took into account the areas of the
umbrae of opposite polarity, their average magnetic field, and the magnetic
barycenter from each sunspot in the region for a sample of three active regions
to find the temporal variation due to the evolution of the sunspots, thus
confirming previous results reported in the literature. We made a statistical
analysis to determine whether after a flare occurs, another can arise in the

been limited to a few narrow fields of view by the CoRoT and Kepler missions.
In an effort to provide well-characterized stellar parameters across a wide

analyses; first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and red clump (RC) evolutionary
state classifications from machine learning; and ready-to-use radius & mass
coefficients, $\kappa_R$ & $\kappa_M$, which, when appropriately multiplied by
a solar-scaled effective temperature factor, yield physical stellar radii and
masses. In total, we report 4395 radius and mass coefficients, with typical
uncertainties of $3.3\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 1\% \mathrm{\ (syst.)}$ for
$\kappa_R$ and $7.7\% \mathrm{\ (stat.)} \pm 2\% \mathrm{\ (syst.)}$ for

complete -- except for a dearth of stars with $\nu_{\mathrm{max}} \lesssim
10-20\mu$Hz -- by comparing to Galactic models and visual inspection. Our
asteroseismic radii agree with radii derived from Gaia Data Release 2

ACOPF to capture consumer preferences through explicit use of time-varying

natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network
architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual,
geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of
the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a
novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically
related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better
than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in
terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results

an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ to converge to an
$\epsilon$-stationary point (i.e., $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(\bm{x})\|^2] \leq
\epsilon$) for smooth non-convex functions -- under arbitrary client
heterogeneity and compressed communication -- compared to the
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ complexity of most prior works. Our key
algorithmic idea that enables achieving this improved complexity is based on
the observation that the convergence in FL is hampered by two sources of high
variance: (i) the global server aggregation step with multiple local updates,
exacerbated by client heterogeneity, and (ii) the noise of the local
client-level stochastic gradients. By modeling the server aggregation step as a
generalized gradient-type update, we propose a variance-reducing momentum-based
global update at the server, which when applied in conjunction with
variance-reduced local updates at the clients, enables \texttt{FedGLOMO} to
enjoy an improved convergence rate. Moreover, we derive our results under a
novel and more realistic client-heterogeneity assumption which we verify
empirically -- unlike prior assumptions that are hard to verify. Our
experiments illustrate the intrinsic variance reduction effect of
\texttt{FedGLOMO}, which implicitly suppresses client-drift in heterogeneous
data distribution settings and promotes communication efficiency.

Decision-makers and policy analysts employ IAMs to calculate the marginalized
monetary cost of climate damages resulting from an incremental emission of a
greenhouse gas. Used within the context of regulating anthropogenic methane
emissions, this metric is called the social cost of methane (SC-CH$_4$).
Because several key IAMs used for social cost estimation contain a simplified
model structure that prevents the endogenous modeling of non-CO$_2$ greenhouse
gases, very few estimates of the SC-CH$_4$ exist. For this reason, IAMs should
be updated to better represent methane cycle dynamics that are consistent with
comprehensive Earth System Models. We include feedbacks of climate change on
the methane cycle to estimate the SC-CH$_4$. Our expected value for the
SC-CH$_4$ is \$1163/t-CH$_4$ under a constant 3.0% discount rate. This
represents a 44% increase relative to a mean estimate without feedbacks on the

environment can have arbitrary (e.g. structured) spectral density. The
entanglement can be seen constructively as a Lego: its bricks are the modes of
the environment. These bricks are connected to each other via operator
transforms. The central result is that each infinitesimal time interval one new
(incoming) mode of the environment gets coupled (entangled) to the open system,
and one new (outgoing) mode gets irreversibly decoupled (disentangled from
future). Moreover, each moment of time, only a few relevant modes (3 - 4 in the
considered cases) are non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion.
These relevant mode change (flow, or renormalize) with time. As a result, the
temporal entanglement has the structure of a matrix-product operator. This
allows us to pose a number of questions and to answer them in this work: what
is the intrinsic quantum complexity of a real time motion; does this complexity
saturate with time, or grows without bounds; how to do the real-time
renormalization group in a justified way; how the classical Brownian stochastic
trajectories emerge from the quantum evolution; how to construct the few-mode
representations of non-Markovian environments. We provide illustrative
simulations of the spin-boson model for various spectral densities of the

annotated via point(s), we convert the annotations into pixel-wise supervision

random environment, also known as the unoriented first passage percolation on
the hypercube, in the limit of large dimensions. By means of the multiscale
refinement of the second moment method we obtain a fairly precise geometrical
description of optimal paths, i.e. of polymers with minimal energy. The picture
which emerges can be loosely summarized as follows. The energy of the polymer
is, to first approximation, uniformly spread along the strand. The polymer's
bonds carry however a lower energy than in the directed setting, and are
reached through the following geometrical evolution. Close to the origin, the
polymer proceeds in oriented fashion -- it is thus as stretched as possible.
The tension of the strand decreases however gradually, with the polymer
allowing for more and more backsteps as it enters the core of the hypercube.
Backsteps, although increasing the length of the strand, allow the polymer to
connect reservoirs of energetically favorable edges which are otherwise
unattainable in a fully directed regime. These reservoirs lie at mesoscopic
distance apart, but in virtue of the high dimensional nature of the ambient
space, the polymer manages to connect them through approximate geodesics with
respect to the Hamming metric: this is the key strategy which leads to an
optimal energy/entropy balance. Around halfway, the mirror picture sets in: the
polymer tension gradually builds up again, until full orientedness close to the
endpoint. The approach yields, as a corollary, a constructive proof of the
result by Martinsson [Ann. Appl. Prob. 26 (2016), Ann. Prob. 46 (2018)]

amorphous selenium (aSe) layers under drift electric fields of up to 50
V/$\mu$m. The aSe target was exposed to ionizing radiation from a $^{57}$Co
radioactive source and the ionization pulses were recorded with high
resolution. Using the spectral line from the photoabsorption of 122 keV
$\gamma$ rays, we measured the charge yield in aSe and the line width as a
function of drift electric field. From a detailed microphysics simulation of
charge generation and recombination in aSe, we conclude that the strong
dependence of recombination on the ionization track density provides the
dominant contribution to the energy resolution in aSe. These results provide
valuable input to estimate the sensitivity of a proposed next-generation search
for the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay of $^{82}$Se that aims to employ
imaging sensors with an active layer of aSe. We estimate the RMS line width of
the integrated ionization signal from neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay events
(of deposited energy 3 MeV) to be 2.0% for a drift field of 50 V/$\mu$m. The
energy resolution can be improved to 1% by correcting for the charge yield as a
function of ionization density along the imaged electron tracks.

popular in the natural language processing community. One of the challenges is
enabling them to converse in an empathetic manner. Current neural response
generation methods rely solely on end-to-end learning from large scale
conversation data to generate dialogues. This approach can produce socially
unacceptable responses due to the lack of large-scale quality data used to
train the neural models. However, recent work has shown the promise of
combining dialogue act/intent modelling and neural response generation. This
hybrid method improves the response quality of chatbots and makes them more
controllable and interpretable. A key element in dialog intent modelling is the
development of a taxonomy. Inspired by this idea, we have manually labeled 500
response intents using a subset of a sizeable empathetic dialogue dataset (25K
dialogues). Our goal is to produce a large-scale taxonomy for empathetic
response intents. Furthermore, using lexical and machine learning methods, we
automatically analysed both speaker and listener utterances of the entire
dataset with identified response intents and 32 emotion categories. Finally, we
use information visualization methods to summarize emotional dialogue exchange
patterns and their temporal progression. These results reveal novel and
important empathy patterns in human-human open-domain conversations and can
serve as heuristics for hybrid approaches.

possible scenarios of such ring formation in early stage, which is coagulation

growth timescale is roughly proportional to the orbital period. The boundary of
the dust evolution can be regarded as the growth front, where the growth time
is comparable to the disk age. With radiative transfer calculations based on
the dust coagulation model, we find that the growth front can be observed as a
ring structure because dust surface density is sharply changed at this
position. Furthermore, we confirm that the observed ring positions in the YSOs
with an age of $\lesssim1$ Myr are consistent with the growth front. The growth
front could be important to create the ring structure in particular for early

Firstly, we show that every rational number q>=1 arises as the stable

  Sampling Cliques is Harder Than Counting",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we consider the problem of sampling a $k$-clique in a graph
from an almost uniform distribution in sublinear time in the general graph
query model. Specifically the algorithm should output each $k$-clique with
probability $(1\pm \epsilon)/n_k$, where $n_k$ denotes the number of
$k$-cliques in the graph and $\epsilon$ is a given approximation parameter.
  We prove that the query complexity of this problem is \[
\Theta^*\left(\max\left\{ \left(\frac{(n\alpha)^{k/2}}{
n_k}\right)^{\frac{1}{k-1}} ,\; \min\left\{n\alpha,\frac{n\alpha^{k-1}}{n_k}
\right\}\right\}\right). \] where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph,
$\alpha$ is its arboricity, and $\Theta^*$ suppresses the dependence on $(\log
n/\epsilon)^{O(k)}$. Interestingly, this establishes a separation between
approximate counting and approximate uniform sampling in the sublinear regime.
For example, if $k=3$, $\alpha = O(1)$, and $n_3$ (the number of triangles) is
$\Theta(n)$, then we get a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/4})$ (for constant
$\epsilon$), while under these conditions, a $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation of
$n_3$ can be obtained by performing $\textrm{poly}(\log(n/\epsilon))$ queries
(Eden, Ron and Seshadhri, SODA20).
  Our lower bound follows from a construction of a family of graphs with
arboricity $\alpha$ such that in each graph there are $n_k$ cliques (of size
$k$), where one of these cliques is ""hidden"" and hence hard to sample. Our
upper bound is based on defining a special auxiliary graph $H_k$, such that
sampling edges almost uniformly in $H_k$ translates to sampling $k$-cliques
almost uniformly in the original graph $G$. We then build on a known
edge-sampling algorithm (Eden, Ron and Rosenbaum, ICALP19) to sample edges in
$H_k$, where the challenge is simulate queries to $H_k$ while being given
access only to $G$.

$\Delta U^+$ is thought to depend only on the outer-layer length scale (pipe
diameter, channel half height or boundary layer thickness). This is in contrast
to conventional engineering rough surfaces, named $k$-type, for which $\Delta
U^+$ depends on the roughness height, $k$. The minimal-span rough-wall channel
is used to circumvent the high cost of simulating high Reynolds number flows,
enabling a range of bars with varying aspect ratios to be investigated. The
present results show that increasing the trough-to-crest height ($k$) of the
roughness while keeping the width between roughness bars, $\mathcal{W}$, fixed
in viscous units, results in non-$k$-type behaviour although this does not
necessarily indicate $d$-type behaviour. Instead, for deep surfaces with
$k/\mathcal{W}\gtrsim 3$, the roughness function appears to depend only on
$\mathcal{W}$ in viscous units. In these situations, the flow no longer has any
information about how deep the roughness is and instead can only `see' the
width of the fluid gap between the bars.

Earth's magnetic field, upstream the magnetic field is compressed down to ~10
Earth radii. However, the diverted stream of SW around Earth's magnetic field
results in an extended depleted region of SW protons (positively charged
hydrogen) out to 1000's of Earth radii, referred to as the magnetotail. The
Moon orbits at a distance of ~40 Earth radii; therefore, upstream it is within
the SW, but downstream it is partially shielded while in the magnetotail during
full Moon. SW protons penetrate lunar soil particles and some H atoms can
chemical react with oxygen to form water-like molecules such as OH/H2O. Most of
the H atoms bounce around within grains until finding another hydrogen atom,
chemically combine, and then escape the grain as H2 into the thin atmosphere.
We developed a model to calculate the global distribution of OH produced in the
lunar surface and H2 released to the atmosphere as the Moon orbits in/out of

trading venues and diversification of goods traded. These changes have
re-emphasized the importance of understanding the effects of market
competition: does proliferation of trading venues and increased competition
lead to dominance of a single market or coexistence of multiple markets? In
this paper, we address these questions in a stylized model of Zero Intelligence
traders who make repeated decisions at which of three available markets to
trade. We analyse the model numerically and analytically and find that
parameters that govern traders' decisions -- memory length and intensity of
choice, e.g. how strongly decisions are based on past success -- make the key
distinctions between consolidated and fragmented steady states of the
population of traders. All three markets coexist with equal shares of traders
only when either learning is too weak and traders choose randomly, or when
markets are identical. In the latter case, the population of traders is
fragmented across the markets. For the more general case of markets with
different biases, we note that market dominance is the more typical scenario.
These results are interesting because previously either strong differentiation
of markets or heterogeneity in the needs of traders was found to be a necessary
condition for market coexistence. We show that, in contrast, these states can
emerge simply as a consequence of co-adaptation of an initially homogeneous
population of traders.

inductive biases of overparameterized models. We completely characterize how
the removal of spurious features affects accuracy across different groups (more
generally, test distributions) in noiseless overparameterized linear
regression. In addition, we show that removal of spurious feature can decrease
the accuracy even in balanced datasets -- each target co-occurs equally with
each spurious feature; and it can inadvertently make the model more susceptible

remove spurious features without affecting the overall accuracy. Experiments on

simulate quantum error correction when the outer code is either a repetition

fault-tolerant quantum computation is a protocol for fault-tolerant Toffoli
magic state preparation that significantly improves upon the fidelity of
physical Toffoli gates at very low qubit cost. To achieve even lower overheads,
we devise a new magic-state distillation protocol for Toffoli states. Combining
these results together, we obtain realistic full-resource estimates of the
physical error rates and overheads needed to run useful fault-tolerant quantum
algorithms. We find that with around 1,000 superconducting circuit components,

representativeness and robustness to complex objects. The DGConv replaces

adversarial network (GAN) -based model to generate high-quality, identity

extreme poses. Specifically, we propose SuperFront-GAN (SF-GAN) to synthesize a
high-resolution (HR), frontal face from one-to-many LR faces with various poses

module into SF-GAN to preserve identity information and fine details of the
side-views in HR space, which helps model reconstruct high-frequency
information of faces (i.e., periocular, nose, and mouth regions). Moreover,
SF-GAN accepts multiple LR faces as input, and improves each added sample. We
squeeze additional gain in performance with an orthogonal constraint in the
generator to penalize redundant latent representations and, hence, diversify
the learned features space. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate
the superiority of SF-GAN over others.

release under strong privacy guarantees. A variety of mechanisms have been
proposed in the literature for releasing the output of numeric queries (e.g.,
the Laplace mechanism and smooth sensitivity mechanism). Those mechanisms
guarantee differential privacy by adding noise to the true query's output. The
amount of noise added is calibrated by the notions of global sensitivity and
local sensitivity of the query that measure the impact of the addition or
removal of an individual on the query's output. Mechanisms that use local
sensitivity add less noise and, consequently, have a more accurate answer.
However, although there has been some work on generic mechanisms for releasing
the output of non-numeric queries using global sensitivity (e.g., the
Exponential mechanism), the literature lacks generic mechanisms for releasing
the output of non-numeric queries using local sensitivity to reduce the noise
in the query's output. In this work, we remedy this shortcoming and present the
local dampening mechanism. We adapt the notion of local sensitivity for the
non-numeric setting and leverage it to design a generic non-numeric mechanism.
We provide theoretical comparisons to the exponential mechanism and show under
which conditions the local dampening mechanism is more accurate than the
exponential mechanism. We illustrate the effectiveness of the local dampening
mechanism by applying it to three diverse problems: (i) percentile selection
problem. We report the p-th element in the database; (ii) Influential node

this analysis. Constructed to target EFT effects directly, the analysis applies
a novel approach in which the observed yields are parameterized in terms of the
Wilson coefficients (WCs) of the EFT operators. A simultaneous fit of the 16
WCs to the data is performed and two standard deviation confidence intervals
for the WCs are extracted; the standard model expectations for the WC values
are within these intervals for all of the WCs probed.

shear wave elastography (SWE) approach. Currently, commercial methods for SWE
rely on directional filtering based on the prior knowledge of the wave
propagation direction, to remove complicated wave patterns formed due to
reflection and refraction. The result is a set of decomposed directional waves
that are separately analyzed to construct shear modulus fields that are then
combined through compounding. Instead, PWE relies on a rigorous representation
of the wave propagation using the frequency-domain scalar wave equation to
automatically select appropriate propagation directions and simultaneously
reconstruct shear modulus fields. Specifically, assuming a homogeneous,
isotropic, incompressible, linear-elastic medium, we represent the solution of
the wave equation using a linear combination of plane waves propagating in
arbitrary directions. Given this closed-form solution, we formulate the SWE
problem as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem which can be solved
very efficiently. Through numerous phantom studies, we show that PWE can handle
complicated waveforms without prior filtering and is competitive with
state-of-the-art that requires prior filtering based on the knowledge of
propagation directions.

spectral filters to produce different indicator functions that guide effective
knot placement. In particular, we describe how spectral filters can be used to
compute high-order derivatives, smoothed versions of noisy data, and the
locations of jump discontinuities. Our knot placement method can combine one or
more of these indicators to place knots that align with the qualitative
features of the data, leading to accurate B-spline approximations without
needing many knots. The method we introduce is direct and does not require any
intermediate B-spline fitting before choosing the final knot vector. Aside from
a fast Fourier transform to transfer to and from Fourier space, the method runs
in linear time with very little communication. The method is applied to several
test cases in one and two dimensions, including data sets with jump
discontinuities and noise. These tests show that the method can fit
discontinuous data without spurious oscillations and remains accurate in the

adapting it to a multimodal setting, where a new visual model is trained in

modality-shared parts so that the model learns the dynamics of each modality
both individually and together, and propose a novel parameter sharing scheme
based on low-rank approximation. We show that our approach reduces parameters

stratified atmosphere in which the mixing lengths for momentum and heat are not
parameterized in the same manner. The key difference is that, while the mixing
length for heat tends towards the stability independent mixing length for
momentum in neutrally stratified conditions, it tends towards one based on the
Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a time scale and square root of the TKE in the limit of large
stability. This enables a unique steady-state solution for TKE to be obtained,
which we demonstrate would otherwise be impossible if the mixing lengths were
the same. Despite the model's relative simplicity, it is shown to perform
reasonably well with observational data from the 1999 Cooperative
Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99) using commonly employed model
constants. Analyzing the scaling behavior of the non-dimensional velocity and
potential temperature gradients, or of the stability (correction) functions,
reveals that for large stability the present model scales in the same manner as
the first-order operational scheme of Viterbo et al. (Quart. J. Roy. Meteor.

of the TKE closure scheme of Baas et al. (Bound.-Layer Meteor. 127, 17-36,

present model avoids the non-physical behavior identified in one of the cases

constant cooling rate is applied at the ground to mimic longwave radiative
cooling. Depending on the cooling rate, it can lead to either turbulent (weakly
stable) or laminar (very stable) flows. Compared to the completely dry case,
the condensation of liquid water in the moist case enables slightly higher
cooling rates to be achieved before leading to turbulence collapse. In the very
stable cases, runaway cooling leads to the substantial condensation of liquid
water close to the ground and fog (visibility less than 1 km) results over much
of the domain. In the weakly stable cases, turbulent mixing narrowly yields
visibilities of 1 km close to the ground over a similar time period. However,
despite the idealized nature of the system, the present results suggest that
turbulence impedes, although will not necessarily inhibit, fog formation. A
possible mechanism for fog formation within turbulent flows is identified,
wherein regions of increased liquid water content form within the low-speed
streaks of the near-wall cycle. These streaks are energized in the moist cases
due to reduced dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy compared to the dry
case, although in both cases the streaks are less energetic and persistent than

simulations of flow over three-dimensional transitionally rough sinusoidal

in the roughness solidity, $\Lambda$ (frontal area divided by plan area)
ranging from 0.05 to 0.54. The high cost of resolving both the flow around the
dense roughness elements and the bulk flow is circumvented by the use of the
minimal-span channel technique, recently demonstrated by Chung et al. (J. Fluid
Mech., vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418-431) to accurately determine the Hama roughness
function, $\Delta U^+$. Good agreement of the second-order statistics in the
near-wall roughness-affected region between minimal- and full-span rough-wall
channels is observed. In the sparse regime of roughness ($\Lambda \lesssim
0.15$) the roughness function increases with increasing solidity, while in the
dense regime the roughness function decreases with increasing solidity. It was
found that the dense regime begins when $\Lambda\gtrsim0.15-$0.18, in agreement
with the literature. A model is proposed for the limit of
$\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$, which is a smooth wall located at the crest of the
roughness elements. This model assists with interpreting the asymptotic
behaviour of the roughness, and the rough-wall data presented in this paper
show that the near-wall flow is tending towards this modelled limit. The peak
streamwise turbulence intensity, which is associated with the turbulent
near-wall cycle, is seen to move increasingly further away from the wall with
increasing solidity. In the sparse regime, increasing $\Lambda$ reduces
streamwise turbulent energy associated with the near-wall cycle, while
increasing $\Lambda$ in the dense regime increases turbulent energy

agents, governed by identical high-order discrete-time linear dynamics, are
subject to unknown-but-bounded input disturbances. In terms of its own state
information, each agent only has access to measured outputs that are corrupted
with unknown-but-bounded output disturbances. Also, the initial states of the
agents are unknown. To deal with all these unknowns (or uncertainties), a
set-membership filter (or state estimator), having the `correction-prediction'
form of a standard Kalman filter, is formulated. We consider each agent to be
equipped with this filter that estimates the state of the agent and consider
the agents to be able to share the state estimate information with the
neighbors locally. The corrected state estimates of the agents are utilized in
the local control law design for synchronization. Under appropriate conditions,
the global disagreement error between the agents and the leader is shown to be
bounded. An upper bound on the norm of the global disagreement error is
calculated and shown to be monotonically decreasing. Finally, two simulation
examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
set-membership filter and the proposed leader-follower synchronization

torque and orbital angular momentum to the electron beam. Furthermore, we find
that the complex polarization patterns, observed in these heterostructures, are

we show that our algorithm is more stable and efficient than the existing RL

order corrections due to spin, tides, dissipation and gravitational wave
radiation. Our implementation is of particular relevance for probing the
stellar structure of compact objects with gravitational wave observations. A
spinning compact object in the effective field theory framework is described as
a spinning point particle, with its finite size effects encoded in higher order
operators in the effective action, operators which have coefficients that
encapsulates the internal structure of the star. For the inspiral regime
described by non-relativistic general relativity, post-Newtonian corrections to
each term of the action can be obtained in a diagrammatic approach, including
gravitational radiation effects. Taking into account the aforementioned
ingredients of the effective theory, we solve for the dynamics of the inspiral
of binary systems using an algorithm for point particle simulations. We extract
the gravitational wave as a function of the orbital frequency, input that is
generated numerically and then evaluated in the analytic function of the
waveform. By performing illustrative numerical experiments of systems that the
LIGO-Virgo observatories have already detected, we show the role of the stellar
structure and its coefficients in the phase evolution of the waveform, as well
as the order in which they arise and the sensitivity required for the
gravitational wave observatories to measure them. If these coefficients are to
be measured, tight constraints on fundamental physics can be placed.

use plenty of anchors with different orientations to achieve spatial alignment
with ground truth boxes, then Intersection-over-Union (IoU) is applied to
sample the positive and negative candidates for training. However, we observe
that the selected positive anchors cannot always ensure accurate detections
after regression, while some negative samples can achieve accurate
localization. It indicates that the quality assessment of anchors through IoU
is not appropriate, and this further lead to inconsistency between
classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose
a dynamic anchor learning (DAL) method, which utilizes the newly defined
matching degree to comprehensively evaluate the localization potential of the
anchors and carry out a more efficient label assignment process. In this way,
the detector can dynamically select high-quality anchors to achieve accurate
object detection, and the divergence between classification and regression will
be alleviated. With the newly introduced DAL, we achieve superior detection
performance for arbitrary-oriented objects with only a few horizontal preset
anchors. Experimental results on three remote sensing datasets HRSC2016, DOTA,

$\mathtt{FREYA}$ which is well suited for this purpose because it obeys all
conservation laws, including linear and angular momentum conservation at each
step of the process. We first discuss the implementation of angular momentum in
$\mathtt{FREYA}$ and then assess particular observables, including various
correlated observables. We also study potential effects of neutron-induced
fission of the low-lying isomeric state of $^{235}$U relative to the ground
state. Results: The fluctuations inherent in the fission process ensure that
the spin of the initial compound nucleus has only a small influence on the
fragment spins which are therefore nearly uncorrelated. There is a marked
correlation between the spin magnitude of the fission fragments and the photon
multiplicity. We also consider the dynamical anisotropy caused by the rotation
of an evaporating fragment and study especially the distribution of the
projected neutron-neutron opening angles, showing that while it is dominated by
the effect of the evaporation recoils, it is possible to extract the signal of
the dynamical anisotropy by means of a Fourier decomposition. Finally, we note
that the use of an isomeric target, $^{235 {\rm m}}$U($n_{\rm th}$,f), may
enhance the symmetric yields and can thus result in higher neutron
multiplicities for low total fragment kinetic energy.

including both its functional form and parameters, is derived so that when used
in a nonlocal solver, it generates solutions that closely match high-fidelity

randomization are naturally present and have been considered as ways to
increase the speed and reduce the cost of computation while compromising the
accuracy and convergence rate. In this work, we show the additional benefits of
randomization and asynchrony on the stability of linear dynamical systems. We
introduce a natural model for random asynchronous linear time-invariant (LTI)
systems which generalizes the standard (synchronous) LTI systems. In this
model, each state variable is updated randomly and asynchronously with some
probability according to the underlying system dynamics. We examine how the
mean-square stability of random asynchronous LTI systems vary with respect to
randomization and asynchrony. Surprisingly, we show that the stability of
random asynchronous LTI systems does not imply or is not implied by the
stability of the synchronous variant of the system and an unstable synchronous
system can be stabilized via randomization and/or asynchrony. We further study
a special case of the introduced model, namely randomized LTI systems, where
each state element is updated randomly with some fixed but unknown probability.
We consider the problem of system identification of unknown randomized LTI
systems using the precise characterization of mean-square stability via
extended Lyapunov equation. For unknown randomized LTI systems, we propose a
systematic identification method to recover the underlying dynamics. Given a
single input/output trajectory, our method estimates the model parameters that
govern the system dynamics, the update probability of state variables, and the
noise covariance using the correlation matrices of collected data and the
extended Lyapunov equation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently recovers the underlying system dynamics with the
optimal rate.

results reveal that all the four types of defects lead to structural
distortions around the O-dopant or N-vacancy, and thereby change the lattice
parameter and monolayer height h. Specifically, ONout or ONin increases the
lattice parameter, but VNout or VNin is on the contrary. ONout or VNout
increases the monolayer height, whereas the height decreases for ONin or VNin.
Each of the four types of defects has a fundamental effect on the electronic
properties of MoSi2N4 monolayer, which can induce a transition from
semiconductor to metal. ONin or VNin plays a vital role in the occurrence of a
transition from non-magnetism to ferrimagnetism in MoSi2N4 monolayer. The
effect of biaxial strain on the magnetic properties of the two systems with
ONin and VNin was subsequently investigated. It is found that the total
magnetic moments are less sensitive to biaxial strain whereas the local
magnetic moments residing on the Mo atoms are increased for the two systems
with ONin and VNin, as strain increases from -3% to 10% and from -9% to 10%,
respectively. Furthermore, the magnetic phase transitions between ferrimagnetic
and paramagnetic states were found to occur around -4% strain and within the

task in the field of crowd analysis. However, traditional density-based methods
only predict coarse prediction, and segmentation/detection-based methods cannot

end, we propose an end-to-end and straightforward framework for crowd
localization, named Independent Instance Map segmentation (IIM). Different from
density maps and boxes regression, each instance in IIM is non-overlapped. By
segmenting crowds into independent connected components, the positions and the
crowd counts (the centers and the number of components, respectively) are
obtained. Furthermore, to improve the segmentation quality for different
density regions, we present a differentiable Binarization Module (BM) to output
structured instance maps. BM brings two advantages into localization models: 1)
adaptively learn a threshold map for different images to detect each instance
more accurately; 2) directly train the model using loss on binary predictions
and labels. Extensive experiments verify the proposed method is effective and
outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods on the five popular crowd datasets.
Significantly, IIM improves F1-measure by 10.4% on the NWPU-Crowd Localization

interfaces are expected only if major constituents are immiscible. Diffuse
interfaces could arise if accretion favored a central concentration of the
least volatile constituents (also incidentally the most dense); compositional
gradients arising in such a structure would likely inhibit convection.
Currently, two lines of evidence suggest possible hydrogen-water immiscibility
in ice giant interiors. The first arises from crude extrapolation of the
experimental hydrogen-water critical curve to $\sim 3$ GPa (Bali et al. 2013).
The data are obtained for an impure system containing silicates, though Uranus
and Neptune could also be ""dirty."" Current ab initio models disagree (Soubiran
& Militzer 2015), though hydrogen and water are difficult to model from
first-principles quantum mechanics with the necessary precision. The second
argument for hydrogen-water immiscibility in ice giants, outlined herein,
invokes reasoning about the gravitational and magnetic fields. While consensus
remains lacking, here we examine the immiscible case. Applying the resulting
thermodynamic constraints, we find that Neptune models with envelopes
containing a substantial water mole fraction, as much as $\chi \gtrsim 0.1$
relative to hydrogen, can satisfy observations. In contrast, Uranus models
appear to require $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, potentially suggestive of fully demixed
hydrogen and water. Enough gravitational potential energy would be available
from gradual hydrogen-water demixing, to supply Neptune's present-day heatflow
for roughly ten solar system lifetimes. Hydrogen-water demixing could slow
Neptune's cooling rate by an order of magnitude; different hydrogen-water
demixing states could account for the different heatflows of Uranus and
Neptune.

of applications in medical informatics and other fields where model
interpretability is paramount. For such data, hierarchical Poisson matrix
factorization (HPF) and other sparse probabilistic non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) methods are considered to be interpretable generative
models. They consist of sparse transformations for decoding their learned
representations into predictions. However, sparsity in representation decoding
does not necessarily imply sparsity in the encoding of representations from the
original data features. HPF is often incorrectly interpreted in the literature
as if it possesses encoder sparsity. The distinction between decoder sparsity
and encoder sparsity is subtle but important. Due to the lack of encoder
sparsity, HPF does not possess the column-clustering property of classical NMF
-- the factor loading matrix does not sufficiently define how each factor is
formed from the original features. We address this deficiency by
self-consistently enforcing encoder sparsity, using a generalized additive
model (GAM), thereby allowing one to relate each representation coordinate to a
subset of the original data features. In doing so, the method also gains the
ability to perform feature selection. We demonstrate our method on simulated

concrete application of representing inpatient comorbidities in Medicare

dipoles subject to an external magnetic field for studying the origin of their
collective magnetic response. Using bifurcation theory we have found all the
possible solutions being stable or unstable, and explored how those solutions
are naturally connected by points where the symmetries of the system are lost

found to be the culprit that shape hysteresis loops in this system. The

critical for the emergence of fractal structures in the basins of attraction.

mobility. It allows robots to primarily measure relative direction, or
Angle-of-Arrival (AOA), to other robots, while operating in non-line-of-sight
unmapped environments and without requiring external infrastructure. We do so
by capturing all of the paths that a wireless signal traverses as it travels
from a transmitting to a receiving robot in the team, which we term as an AOA
profile. The key intuition behind our approach is to enable a robot to emulate
antenna arrays as it moves freely in 2D and 3D space. The small differences in
the phase of the wireless signals are thus processed with knowledge of robots'
local displacement to obtain the profile, via a method akin to Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR). The main contribution of this work is the development of
i) a framework to accommodate arbitrary 2D and 3D motion, as well as continuous
mobility of both signal transmitting and receiving robots, while computing AOA
profiles between them and ii) a Cramer-Rao Bound analysis, based on antenna
array theory, that provides a lower bound on the variance in AOA estimation as
a function of the geometry of robot motion. We show that allowing robots to use
their full mobility in 3D space while performing SAR, results in more accurate
AOA profiles and thus better AOA estimation. All analytical developments are
substantiated by extensive simulation and hardware experiments on air/ground
robot platforms using 5 GHz WiFi. Our experimental results bolster our
analytical findings, demonstrating that 3D motion provides enhanced and
consistent accuracy, with total AOA error of less than 10 degree for 95% of
trials. We also analytically characterize the impact of displacement estimation
errors on the measured AOA.

here all exogenous excitements are spatially (that is, across agents)

polynomial correlations, the latent nodes in the expanded networks can be
excited by clusters of noise sources, where the clusters are uncorrelated with
each other. The clusters can be replaced with a single noise source if the
latent nodes are allowed to have non-linear interactions. Finally, using the

particle of charge -1/3$e$ coupling to a top quark plus a tau lepton
($\mathrm{t}\tau$) or a bottom quark plus a neutrino ($\mathrm{b}\nu$), or a
vector particle of charge +2/3$e$, coupling to $\mathrm{t}\nu$ or
$\mathrm{b}\tau$. These choices are motivated by models that can explain a
series of anomalies observed in the measurement of B meson decays. In this
analysis the signatures $\mathrm{t}\tau\nu\mathrm{b}$ and $\mathrm{t}\tau\nu$
are probed, using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at
$\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV and that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 137
fb$^{-1}$. These signatures have not been previously explored in a dedicated
search. The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model
prediction. Lower limits at 95% confidence level are set on the LQ mass in the
range 0.98-1.73 TeV, depending on the LQ spin and its coupling $\lambda$ to a
lepton and a quark, and assuming equal branching fractions for the two LQ decay
modes considered. These are the most stringent constraints to date on the
existence of leptoquarks in this scenario.

been extensively investigated. However, the quantitative growth information of
sea ice remains lack due to the uncontrolled crystalline orientation in
previous investigations. For the first time, we in-situ observed the
unidirectional growth of lamellar sea ice with well-manipulated ice crystal
orientation and visualized tip undercooling of sea ice. A semi-empirical model
was proposed to quantitatively address the variation of tip undercooling with
growth velocity and salinity and compared with a very recent analytical model.
With the real-time observation, interesting phenomena of doublon tip in
cellular ice growth and growth direction shift of ice dendritic tip were
discovered for the first time, which are attributed to the complex solutal
diffusion and anisotropic interface kinetics in sea ice growth. The
quantitative experiment provides a clear micro scenario of sea ice growth, and
will promote relevant investigations of sea ice in terms of the theoretical
approach to describing the diffusion field around faceted ice dendritic tip.

fundamental time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral as well as crystalline
symmetries. While one-dimensional (1D) generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
systems show various topological phenomena such as topological solitons and
topological charge pumping, it remains unclear how such symmetry protects and
relates such topological phenomena. Here we show that the generalized
time-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetry operators consistently
explain not only the symmetry transformation properties between the ground
states but also the topological features of the topological solitons in
prototypical quasi-1D systems such as the SSH, Rice-Mele, and double-chain
models. As a consequence, we classify generalized essential operators into
three groups: Class I and class II operators connect ground states in between
after spontaneous symmetry breaking while class III operators give the
generalized particle-hole and chiral symmetries to ground states. Furthermore,
class I operators endow the equivalence relation between topological solitons
while class II and III operators do the particle-hole relations. Finally, we
demonstrate three distinct types of topological charge pumping and soliton
chirality from the viewpoint of class I, II, and III operators. We build a
general framework to explore the topological features of the generalized 1D
electronic system, which can be easily applied in various condensed matter
systems as well as photonic crystal and cold atomic systems.

a totally ordered set from a $BL_\infty$ (Bi-Lie) formalism of the rational

of structures, namely algebraic planar torsion, order of semi-dilation and
planarity, all taking values in $\mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$, where algebraic
planar torsion can be understood as the analogue of Latschev-Wendl's algebraic
torsion in the context of RSFT. The hierarchy functor is well-defined through a
partial construction of RSFT and is within the scope of established virtual
techniques. We develop computation tools for those functors and prove all three
of them are surjective. In particular, the planarity functor is surjective in
all dimension $\ge 3$. Then we use the hierarchy functor to study the existence
of exact cobordisms. We discuss examples including iterated planar open books,

hierarchically porous microstructure. However, the formation of tilted lamellar
microstructure during freezing needs to be reconsidered due to the limited
control of ice orientation with respect to thermal gradient during in-situ
observations, which can greatly enrich our insight into architectural control
of porous biomaterials. This paper provides an in-situ study of solid/liquid
interface morphology evolution of directionally solidified single crystal ice
with its C-axis (optical axis) perpendicular to directions of both thermal
gradient and incident light in poly (vinyl alcohol, PVA) solutions. Misty
morphology and V-shaped lamellar morphology were clearly observed in-situ for
the first time. Quantitative characterizations on lamellar spacing, tilt angle
and tip undercooling of lamellar ice platelets provide a clearer insight into
the inherent ice growth habit in polymeric aqueous systems and are suggested

zero bias anomaly around the Fermi level. This local density of states with a
fractional power law shape is well known to be a consequence of electronic
correlations. For comparison, we have also measured the tunneling conductances
of other half-Heusler compounds with 18 valence electrons. ZrNiPb shows a
metal-like local density of states, whereas ZrCoSb and NbFeSb show a linear and
V^2 anomaly. One interpretation of these anomalies is that a correlation gap is
opening in these compounds. By analyzing the magnetoresistance of HfNiSn, we
demonstrate that at low temperatures, electron-electron scattering dominates.
The T^m(m < 1) temperature dependence of the conductivity confirms that the
electronic correlations are a bulk rather than a surface property.

  Classification on Graphs",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-based semi-supervised node classification (GraphSSC) has wide
applications, ranging from networking and security to data mining and machine
learning, etc. However, existing centralized GraphSSC methods are impractical
to solve many real-world graph-based problems, as collecting the entire graph
and labeling a reasonable number of labels is time-consuming and costly, and
data privacy may be also violated. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging
learning paradigm that enables collaborative learning among multiple clients,
which can mitigate the issue of label scarcity and protect data privacy as
well. Therefore, performing GraphSSC under the FL setting is a promising
solution to solve real-world graph-based problems. However, existing FL methods
1) perform poorly when data across clients are non-IID, 2) cannot handle data
with new label domains, and 3) cannot leverage unlabeled data, while all these
issues naturally happen in real-world graph-based problems. To address the
above issues, we propose the first FL framework, namely GraphFL, for
semi-supervised node classification on graphs. Our framework is motivated by
meta-learning methods. Specifically, we propose two GraphFL methods to
respectively address the non-IID issue in graph data and handle the tasks with
new label domains. Furthermore, we design a self-training method to leverage
unlabeled graph data. We adopt representative graph neural networks as GraphSSC
methods and evaluate GraphFL on multiple graph datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that GraphFL significantly outperforms the compared FL baseline and
GraphFL with self-training can obtain better performance.

represented in structured data forms like trees or graphs. To acquire the
structural information in source code, most existing researches use abstract
syntax trees (AST). A group of works add additional edges to ASTs to convert
source code into graphs and use graph neural networks to learn representations
for program graphs. Although these works provide additional control or data
flow information to ASTs for downstream tasks, they neglect an important aspect
of structure information in AST itself: the different types of nodes and edges.
In ASTs, different nodes contain different kinds of information like variables
or control flow, and the relation between a node and all its children can also
be different.
  To address the information of node and edge types, we bring the idea of
heterogeneous graphs to learning on source code and present a new formula of
building heterogeneous program graphs from ASTs with additional type
information for nodes and edges. We use the ASDL grammar of programming
language to define the node and edge types of program graphs. Then we use
heterogeneous graph neural networks to learn on these graphs. We evaluate our
approach on two tasks: code comment generation and method naming. Both tasks
require reasoning on the semantics of complete code snippets. Experiment
results show that our approach outperforms baseline models, including
homogeneous graph-based models, showing that leveraging the type information of
nodes and edges in program graphs can help in learning program semantics.

dataless classifiers to be highly sensitive to the choice of label descriptions

this paper, we ask the following question: how can we improve dataless text

solution is a clustering based approach. Given a dataless classifier, our
approach refines its set of predictions using k-means clustering. We
demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach by improving the
performance of two widely used classifier architectures, one that encodes
text-category pairs with two independent encoders and one with a single joint

applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced

applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when
the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically
generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a
target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an
inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we
present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that
combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information
Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing
semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition
(PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC
can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant
to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the
latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various
characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. An interpretation
of the attribute vector to systematically generate synthetic images by varying
a chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored. Experiments on a GPS
trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate
various forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic
locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road
network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic
data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer
vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote

phonons. InterPhon makes it possible to apply all of the phonon-based
predictions that have been available for bulk systems, to interfacial systems.
The first example, in which this package was applied to InAs surfaces,
demonstrates a systematic structure search for unexplored surface
reconstructions, navigated by the imaginary mode of surface phonons. It
eventually explains the anisotropic surface vibrations of the polar crystal.
The second example, involving oxygen adsorption on Cu, reveals
adsorption-induced vibrational change and its contribution to energetic
stability. The third example, on a Si/GaAs interface, shows distinct
vibrational patterns depending on interfacial structures. It leads to a
prediction regarding the structural transition of interfaces and unveils the
processing conditions for spontaneous growth of GaAs nanowires on Si.
High-level automation in InterPhon will be of great help in elucidating
interfacial atomic dynamics and in implementing an automated computational
workflow for diverse interfacial systems.

  Estimation",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution of climate
change is based on a multiple regression where each covariate has measurement
error whose covariance matrix is the same as that of the regression error up to
a known scale. Inferences about the regression coefficients are critical not
only for making statements about detection and attribution but also for
quantifying the uncertainty in important outcomes derived from detection and
attribution analyses. When there is no errors-in-variables (EIV), the optimal
weight matrix in estimating the regression coefficients is the precision matrix
of the regression error which, in practice, is never known and has to be
estimated from climate model simulations. We construct a weight matrix by
inverting a nonlinear shrinkage estimate of the error covariance matrix that
minimizes loss functions directly targeting the uncertainty of the resulting
regression coefficient estimator. The resulting estimator of the regression
coefficients is asymptotically optimal as the sample size of the climate model
simulations and the matrix dimension go to infinity together with a limiting
ratio. When EIVs are present, the estimator of the regression coefficients
based on the proposed weight matrix is asymptotically more efficient than that
based on the inverse of the existing linear shrinkage estimator of the error
covariance matrix. The performance of the method is confirmed in finite sample
simulation studies mimicking realistic situations in terms of the length of the
confidence intervals and empirical coverage rates for the regression
coefficients. An application to detection and attribution analyses of the mean
temperature at different spatial scales illustrates the utility of the method.

than the usual energy-momentum, eigenstates and hence are sensitive to both UV
and IR physics. We show that known UV and IR properties of quantum gravity
translate into powerful constraints on the analytic structure of celestial
amplitudes. For example the soft UV behavior of quantum gravity is shown to
imply that the exact four-particle scattering amplitude is meromorphic in the
complex boost weight plane with poles confined to even integers on the negative
real axis. Would-be poles on the positive real axis from UV asymptotics are
shown to be erased by a flat space analog of the AdS resolution of the bulk
point singularity. The residues of the poles on the negative axis are
identified with operator coefficients in the IR effective action. Far along the
real positive axis, the scattering is argued to grow exponentially according to
the black hole area law. Exclusive amplitudes are shown to simply factorize
into conformally hard and conformally soft factors. The soft factor contains
all IR divergences and is given by a celestial current algebra correlator of
Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries. The hard
factor describes the scattering of hard particles together with the
boost-eigenstate clouds of soft photons or gravitons required by asymptotic
symmetries. These provide an IR safe $\mathcal{S}$-matrix for the scattering of
hard particles.

the shock-induced phase transition of a cold neutron star. By employing
hadronic and quark equation of state that satisfies the current mass bound, we
use combustion adiabat conditions to find such a limit. The combustion adiabat
condition results in a local or a global maximum pressure at an intermediate
density range. The maximum pressure corresponds to a local or global maximum
mass for the phase transformed hybrid star. The phase transition is usually
exothermic if we have a local maximum mass. The criteria for exothermic or
endothermic phase transition depend on whether the quark pressure/energy ratios
to nuclear pressure/energy are smaller or greater than 1. We find that
exothermic phase transition in a cold neutron star usually results in hybrid
stars whose mass is smaller than a parent neutron star. The phase transition is
endothermic for a global maximum pressure; thereby, one gets a global maximum
mass. Hybrid stars much massive than phase transformed local maximum mass can
be formed, provided there is some external energy source during the phase
transition process. However, for some cases, even massive hybrid stars can form
with exothermic phase transition for EoSs having global maximum pressure.

observation task. Recently, land cover classification has benefited from the
development of fully connected neural networks for semantic segmentation. The
benchmark datasets available for training deep segmentation models in remote
sensing imagery tend to be small, however, often consisting of only a handful
of images from a single location with a single scale. This limits the models'
ability to generalize to other datasets. Domain adaptation has been proposed to
improve the models' generalization but we find these approaches are not
effective for dealing with the scale variation commonly found between remote
sensing image collections. We therefore propose a scale aware adversarial
learning framework to perform joint cross-location and cross-scale land-cover
classification. The framework has a dual discriminator architecture with a
standard feature discriminator as well as a novel scale discriminator. We also
introduce a scale attention module which produces scale-enhanced features.

turned on in the 1980s, and its central star (V839 Ara) started a fast
evolution with large amplitudes in magnitude, surface temperature, and surface
gravity, perhaps as part of a late thermal pulse causing a loop in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. With these fast changes, we have taken images
with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2016. We do not see the massive
high-velocity mass loss of the 1980s, either close in to the central star, or
as clumps or changes in the nebula far from the star, or as localized or
general increases in the emission-line flux caused by the shocks of the
outflowing ejecta ramming into the slow-moving PN shell. We think that the lack
of seeing the outgoing material is because the relatively modest total mass had
already suffused the PN before the first resolved imaging in 1992, and it was
the shocks from this impact that initially ionized the Stingray starting in the
1980s. We also quantify the complex fast fading of the Stingray, with each
emission line and each structure having different fade rates, with half-lives
ranging from 3 to 29 years. In a century or two, the PN will fade to
invisibility. With this complex fading of different structures, it is
impossible to derive any expansion rate for the PN. The central star had its
brightness roughly constant from 1996 to 2016, but with substantial erratic

Furthermore, cells must also respond to unforeseen environmental changes that
have not previously been experienced, to avoid extinction prior to the
evolutionary rewiring of their networks, which takes numerous generations. We
have investigated gene regulatory networks that mutually activate or inhibit,
and have demonstrated that complex entangled networks can make appropriate
input-output relationships that satisfy the robust and adaptive responses
required for unforeseen challenges. Such entangled networks function for sloppy
and unreliable responses with low Hill coefficient reactions for the expression
of each gene. To compensate for such sloppiness, several detours in the

detours, the network shows a higher robustness to environmental and

simple unidirectional circuits. Furthermore, the appropriate response to
unforeseen challenges, allowing for functional outputs, is achieved as many
genes exhibit similar dynamic expression responses, irrespective of inputs, as
confirmed by applying dynamic time warping and dynamic mode decomposition. As
complex entangled networks are common in gene regulatory networks and global

results from large truncation errors of solving ODEs. To address the problem,
we propose to add a regularization. The regularization penalizes the difference
between the trajectory of the ODE and its fitted polynomial regression. The
trajectory of ODE will approximate a polynomial function, and thus the
truncation error will be smaller. Furthermore, we provide two proofs and claim
that the additional regularization does not harm training quality. Experimental
results show that our proposed method can result in 42.3% to 71.3% reduction of

considered as one of the promising technologies for future 6G wireless

scheme to track mobile users in THz massive MIMO systems. However, the existing
beam tracking schemes designed for narrowband systems with the traditional
hybrid precoding structure suffer from a severe performance loss caused by the
beam split effect, and thus cannot be directly applied to wideband THz massive
MIMO systems. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a beam zooming
based beam tracking scheme by considering the recently proposed delay-phase
precoding structure for THz massive MIMO. Specifically, we firstly prove the
beam zooming mechanism to flexibly control the angular coverage of
frequencydependent beams over the whole bandwidth, which can be realized by the
elaborate design of time delays in the delay-phase precoding structure. Then,
based on this beam zooming mechanism, we propose to track multiple user
physical directions simultaneously in each time slot by generating multiple
beams. The angular coverage of these beams is flexibly zoomed to adapt to the
potential variation range of the user physical direction. After several time
slots, the base station is able to obtain the exact user physical direction by
finding out the beam with the largest user received power. Unlike traditional
schemes where only one frequency-independent beam can be usually generated by
one radio-frequency chain, the proposed beam zooming based beam tracking scheme
can simultaneously track multiple user physical directions by using multiple
frequency-dependent beams generated by one radio-frequency chain. Theoretical
analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the near-optimal achievable

various application domains. To support diverse DNN models, efficient
implementations of DNN inference on edge-computing platforms, e.g., ASICs,
FPGAs, and embedded systems, are extensively investigated. Due to the huge
model size and computation amount, model compression is a critical step to
deploy DNN models on edge devices. This paper focuses on weight quantization, a
hardware-friendly model compression approach that is complementary to weight
pruning. Unlike existing methods that use the same quantization scheme for all
weights, we propose the first solution that applies different quantization
schemes for different rows of the weight matrix. It is motivated by (1) the
distribution of the weights in the different rows are not the same; and (2) the
potential of achieving better utilization of heterogeneous FPGA hardware
resources. To achieve that, we first propose a hardware-friendly quantization
scheme named sum-of-power-of-2 (SP2) suitable for Gaussian-like weight
distribution, in which the multiplication arithmetic can be replaced with logic
shifter and adder, thereby enabling highly efficient implementations with the
FPGA LUT resources. In contrast, the existing fixed-point quantization is
suitable for Uniform-like weight distribution and can be implemented
efficiently by DSP. Then to fully explore the resources, we propose an
FPGA-centric mixed scheme quantization (MSQ) with an ensemble of the proposed
SP2 and the fixed-point schemes. Combining the two schemes can maintain, or
even increase accuracy due to better matching with weight distributions.

assessing how well a hypothesized model fits the data. Likewise, they are
important when weights are assigned to multiple data sets used to refine the
same model. Therefore, it is problematic when experimental errors are over- or

can be used to assess and rescale the errors accordingly. Even if the estimated

overfitting is an inherent challenge, such as reweighting of a simulated

cheap method to detect OOD samples in DNN. However, the features produced by a
DNN at any given layer do not fully occupy the corresponding high-dimensional

and nonlinear manifold-learning techniques on the high-dimensional features in
order to capture the true subspace spanned by the features. We hypothesize that
such lower-dimensional feature embeddings can mitigate the curse of
dimensionality, and enhance any feature-based method for more efficient and
effective performance. In the context of uncertainty estimation and OOD, we
show that the log-likelihood score obtained from the distributions learnt on
this lower-dimensional subspace is more discriminative for OOD detection. We
also show that the feature reconstruction error, which is the $L_2$-norm of the
difference between the original feature and the pre-image of its embedding, is
highly effective for OOD detection and in some cases superior to the
log-likelihood scores. The benefits of our approach are demonstrated on image
features by detecting OOD images, using popular DNN architectures on commonly

an analogue of a result of Harer obtained in the orientable case. As a
corollary, we obtain a $4$-dimensional proof of the fact that every

first proved by Berstein and Edmonds using branched coverings. Moreover, the
monodromy of the open book we obtain for a given $3$-manifold belongs to the
twist subgroup of the mapping class group of the page. In particular, we
construct an explicit minimal open book for the connected sum of arbitrarily
many copies of the product of the circle with the real projective plane.
  We also obtain a relative trisection diagram for $W$, based on the
nonorientable Lefschetz fibration we construct, similar to the orientable case
first studied by Castro. As a corollary, we get trisection diagrams for some
closed $4$-manifolds, e.g. the product of the $2$-sphere with the real
projective plane, by doubling $W$. Moreover, if $X$ is a closed nonorientable

possible without a trusted third party, but they have a scalability issue due
to their consensus mechanisms. Payment networks have emerged to overcome this
limitation by executing transactions outside of the blockchain, which is why
these are referred to as off-chain transactions. In order to establish a
payment channel between two users, the users lock their deposits in the
blockchain, and then they can pay each other through the channel. Furthermore,
payment networks support multi-hop payments that allow users to transfer their
balances to other users who are connected to them via multiple channels.
However, multi-hop payments are hard to be accomplished, as they are heavily
dependent on routing users on a payment path from a sender to a receiver.
Although routing hubs can make multi-hop payments more practical and efficient,
they need a lot of collateral locked for a long period and have privacy issues
in terms of payment history.
  We propose RouTEE, a secure payment routing hub that is fully feasible
without the hub's deposit. Unlike existing payment networks, RouTEE provides
high balance liquidity, and details about payments are concealed from hosts by
leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). RouTEE is designed to make
rational hosts behave honestly, by introducing a new routing fee scheme and a
secure settlement method. Moreover, users do not need to monitor the blockchain
in real-time or run full nodes. They can participate in RouTEE by simply
verifying block headers through light clients; furthermore, having only one
channel with RouTEE is sufficient to interact with other users. Our
implementation demonstrates that RouTEE is highly efficient and outperforms
Lightning Network that is the state-of-the-art payment network.

symmetry, and the magnetic exchange interaction can open a gap in the otherwise

(QAHE) and axion insulator states. Magnetic doping and magnetic proximity are
viewed as being useful means of exploring the interaction between topology and

magnetic ordering and small exchange gaps, and consequently the observed QAHE
appears only at ultralow temperatures. Therefore, intrinsic magnetic
topological insulators are highly desired for increasing the QAHE working
temperature and for investigating topological quantum phenomena further. The
realization and characterization of such systems are essential for both
fundamental physics and potential technical revolutions. This review summarizes

OUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two

feature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental
results show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos,

controls the camera movements actively to achieve an accurate camera pose. The
past solutions are mostly based on Markov Localization, which reduces the
position-wise camera uncertainty for localization. These approaches localize
the camera in the discrete pose space and are agnostic to the
localization-driven scene property, which restricts the camera pose accuracy in
the coarse scale. We propose to overcome these limitations via a novel active
camera localization algorithm, composed of a passive and an active localization
module. The former optimizes the camera pose in the continuous pose space by
establishing point-wise camera-world correspondences. The latter explicitly
models the scene and camera uncertainty components to plan the right path for
accurate camera pose estimation. We validate our algorithm on the challenging
localization scenarios from both synthetic and scanned real-world indoor

the great opportunity for image enhancement (e.g., deblurring) directly from
RAW images and investigate novel neural network structures benefiting RAW-based
learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no available RAW
image deblurring dataset. Therefore, we built a new dataset containing both RAW

characteristics of RAW images. The proposed deblurring model, trained solely
from RAW images, achieves the state-of-art performance and outweighs those
trained on processed sRGB images. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed

Additionally, by a series of experiments, we demonstrate that existing

weaknesses by deriving the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of each as
well as their true positive rate against a larger sample. We selected DBSCAN,
HDBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models for further study, owing to their speed
and appropriateness for use with Gaia data. We developed a preprocessing
pipeline for Gaia data and developed the algorithms further for the specific
application to open clusters. We derived detection rates for all 1385 open
clusters in the fields in our study as well as more detailed performance
statistics for 100 of these open clusters. DBSCAN was sensitive to 50% to 62%
of the true positive open clusters in our sample, with generally very good
specificity and precision. HDBSCAN traded precision for a higher sensitivity of
up to 82%, especially across different distances and scales of open clusters.
Gaussian mixture models were slow and only sensitive to 33% of open clusters in
our sample, which tended to be larger objects. Additionally, we report on 41
new open cluster candidates detected by HDBSCAN, three of which are closer than
500 pc. When used with additional post-processing to mitigate its false

electrostatically by a charged nanopore. We first estimate the time scales
corresponding to Brownian and electrostatic translations and reorientation. We
find that Brownian motion becomes negligible at distances within the pore
capture radius, and numerically determine the trajectories of the nano-rod in
this region to explore the effects of anisotropic mobility. This allows us to
determine the range of directions from the pore in which hydrodynamic
interactions with the boundary shape the approach dynamics and need to be
accounted for in detailed modelling.

have been developed in an unsupervised context like sparse principal component
analysis (s-PCA), sparse canonical correlation analysis (s-CCA) and sparse
singular value decomposition (s-SVD). These sparse methods combine feature
selection and dimension reduction. One advantage of s-PCA is to simplify the
interpretation of the (pseudo) principal components since each one is expressed
as a linear combination of a small number of variables. The disadvantages lie
on the one hand in the difficulty of choosing the number of non-zero
coefficients in the absence of a well established criterion and on the other
hand in the loss of orthogonality for the components and/or the loadings. In
this paper we propose sparse variants of correspondence analysis (CA)for large
contingency tables like documents-terms matrices used in text mining, together
with pPMD, a deation technique derived from projected deflation in s-PCA. We
use the fact that CA is a double weighted PCA (for rows and columns) or a
weighted SVD, as well as a canonical correlation analysis of indicator
variables. Applying s-CCA or s-SVD allows to sparsify both rows and columns
weights. The user may tune the level of sparsity of rows and columns and
optimize it according to some criterium, and even decide that no sparsity is
needed for rows (or columns) by relaxing one sparsity constraint. The latter is
equivalent to apply s-PCA to matrices of row (or column) profiles.

understanding of symmetry-breaking instabilities in 2D dynamic fracture. At the
heart of this progress resides the identification of two intrinsic, near crack
tip length scales -- a nonlinear elastic length scale $\ell$ and a dissipation
length scale $\xi$ -- that do not exist in the classical theory of cracks. In
particular, it has been shown that at a high propagation velocity $v$, cracks
in 2D brittle materials undergo an oscillatory instability whose wavelength
varies linearly with $\ell$, and at yet higher propagation velocities and
larger loading levels, a tip-splitting instability emerges, both in agreements
with experiments. In this paper, using phase-field models of brittle fracture,
we demonstrate the following properties of the oscillatory instability: (i) It
exists also in the absence of near-tip elastic nonlinearity, i.e. in the limit
$\ell\!\to\!0$, with a wavelength determined by the dissipation length scale
$\xi$. This result shows that the instability crucially depends on the
existence of an intrinsic length scale associated with the breakdown of linear
elasticity near crack tips, independently of whether the latter is related to
nonlinear elasticity or to dissipation. (ii) It is a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation, featuring a vanishing oscillations amplitude at onset. (iii) It is
largely independent of the fracture energy $\Gamma(v)$ that is controlled by a
dissipation time scale. These results substantiate the universal nature of the
oscillatory instability of ultra-high speed cracks in 2D. In addition, we
provide evidence indicating that the ultra-high velocity tip-splitting
instability is controlled by the limiting rate of elastic energy transport
inside the crack tip region. Finally, we describe in detail the numerical
implementation scheme of the employed phase-field fracture approach.

The singularity is generated by the band crossing of the flat band with another
dispersive band. In the singular flat band, one can find special kind of

make predictions for unlabeled data on a target domain, given labeled data on a
source domain whose distribution diverges from the target one. Mainstream UDA
methods strive to learn domain-aligned features such that classifiers trained
on the source features can be readily applied to the target ones. Although
impressive results have been achieved, these methods have a potential risk of
damaging the intrinsic data structures of target discrimination, raising an
issue of generalization particularly for UDA tasks in an inductive setting. To
address this issue, we are motivated by a UDA assumption of structural
similarity across domains, and propose to directly uncover the intrinsic target
discrimination via constrained clustering, where we constrain the clustering
solutions using structural source regularization that hinges on the very same
assumption. Technically, we propose a hybrid model of Structurally Regularized
Deep Clustering, which integrates the regularized discriminative clustering of
target data with a generative one, and we thus term our method as H-SRDC. Our
hybrid model is based on a deep clustering framework that minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of network prediction and
an auxiliary one, where we impose structural regularization by learning
domain-shared classifier and cluster centroids. By enriching the structural
similarity assumption, we are able to extend H-SRDC for a pixel-level UDA task
of semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on seven UDA
benchmarks of image classification and semantic segmentation. With no explicit
feature alignment, our proposed H-SRDC outperforms all the existing methods

$^{29}\text{F}$ ($^{27}\text{F}+n+n$) wave functions are built within the

low-energy scattering. Parity inversion in $^{28}$F leads to a $^{29}$F ground

dineutron configuration, and an increase of the matter radius with respect to
the core radius of $\Delta R=0.20$ fm. Glauber-model calculations for a carbon
target at 240 MeV/nucleon provide a total reaction cross section of 1370 mb, in
agreement with recent data. The model produces also a barely bound excited

continuum yield a total strength of 1.59 e$^2$fm$^2$ up to 6 MeV, and the $E1$
distribution exhibits a resonance at $\approx$ 0.85 MeV. Results using a

synchrotron curvature can be explained by statistical or stochastic
acceleration mechanisms. There are significant correlations between synchrotron
peak frequency and synchrotron curvature for whole sample, Fermi blazars and BL

synchrotron peak frequency and synchrotron curvature in gamma-NLS1s is large
than that of FSRQs and BL Lacs. This result may imply that the cooling

alignment that is tangential or planar for extensile systems (pushers) and
perpendicular or homeotropic for contractile ones (pullers). This alignment is
known as active anchoring and has been reported for a number of systems and
described using active nematic hydrodynamic theories. The latter are based on
the one-elastic constant approximation, i.e., they assume elastic isotropy of
the underlying passive nematic. Real nematics, however, have different elastic
constants, which lead to interfacial anchoring. In this paper, we consider
elastic anisotropy in multiphase and multicomponent hydrodynamic models of
active nematics and investigate the competition between the interfacial
alignment driven by the elastic anisotropy of the passive nematic and the
active anchoring. We start by considering systems with translational invariance
to analyze the alignment at flat interfaces and, then, consider two-dimensional
systems and active nematic droplets. We investigate the competition of the two
types of anchoring over a wide range of the other parameters that characterize
the system. The results of the simulations reveal that the active anchoring
dominates except at very low activities, when the interfaces are static. In
addition, we found that the elastic anisotropy does not affect the dynamics but
changes the active length that becomes anisotropic.

arbitrary transceiver pair across a geographic area of interest, CG maps can be
constructed from spatially distributed sensor measurements. Most approaches to
build such spectrum maps are location-based, meaning that the input variable to
the estimating function is a pair of spatial locations. The performance of such
maps depends critically on the ability of the sensors to determine their
positions, which may be drastically impaired if the positioning pilot signals
are affected by multi-path channels. An alternative location-free approach was
recently proposed for spectrum power maps, where the input variable to the maps
consists of features extracted from the positioning signals, instead of
location estimates. The location-based and the location-free approaches have
complementary merits. In this work, apart from adapting the location-free
features for the CG maps, a method that can combine both approaches is proposed
in a mixture-of-experts framework.

insulating materials are complex because of their small size, low conductivity,

modified scanning thermal microscope operating in vacuum and in air. The
sphere-plate geometry is considered. Under controlled heating power, we measure
the temperature on top of a glass microsphere glued to the probe as it
approaches a glass plate at room temperature with nanometer accuracy. In
vacuum, a jump is observed at contact. From this jump in temperature and the
modeling of the thermal resistance of a sphere, the sphere-plate contact
resistance $ R_K=(1.4 \pm 0.18)\times10^7 \ \mathrm{K.W^{-1}}$ and effective
radius $r=(36 \pm 4)$ nm are obtained. In air, the temperature on top of the
sphere shows a decrease starting from a sphere-plate distance of 200
$\mathrm{\mu m}$. A jump is also observed at contact, with a reduced amplitude.
The sphere-plate coupling out of contact can be described by the resistance
shape factor of a sphere in front of a plate in air, placed in a circuit
involving a series and a parallel resistance that are determined by fitting the
approach curve. The contact resistance in air $R^*_K=(1.2 \pm 0.46)\times 10^7
\ \mathrm{K.W^{-1}}$ is then estimated from the temperature jump. The method is
quantitative without requiring any tedious multiple-scale numerical simulation,
and is versatile to describe the coupling between micro-objects from large
distances to contact in various environments.

surrounding LkH$\alpha$ 101, a part of the Auriga-California molecular cloud.
The observations were taken with the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope within the framework of the B-fields In Star-forming Region
Observations (BISTRO) survey. Observed polarization of thermal dust emission at
850 $\mu$m is found to be mostly associated with the red-shifted gas component
of the cloud. The magnetic field displays a relatively complex morphology. Two
variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, unsharp masking and structure
function, are used to calculate the strength of magnetic fields in the plane of
the sky, yielding a similar result of $B_{\rm POS}\sim 115$ $\mathrm{\mu}$G.
The mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio in critical value units, $\lambda\sim0.3$, is
the smallest among the values obtained for other regions surveyed by POL-2.
This implies that the LkH$\alpha$ 101 region is sub-critical and the magnetic
field is strong enough to prevent gravitational collapse. The inferred $\delta
B/B_0\sim 0.3$ implies that the large scale component of the magnetic field
dominates the turbulent one. The variation of the polarization fraction with
total emission intensity can be fitted by a power-law with an index of
$\alpha=0.82\pm0.03$, which lies in the range previously reported for molecular
clouds. We find that the polarization fraction decreases rapidly with proximity
to the only early B star (LkH$\alpha$ 101) in the region. The magnetic field
tangling and the joint effect of grain alignment and rotational disruption by
radiative torques are potential of explaining such a decreasing trend.

forms of the iron atoms, Fe2+ with spin S=2, and Fe3+ with spin {\sigma}=5/2
are the most probable configurations. A mixed Ising model with ferromagnetic
spin coupling between Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and between Fe3+ and Fe3+ ions, and
with antiferromagnetic spin coupling between Fe2+ ions of adjacent layers has
been used to study the magnetic properties of this compound. We demonstrated
that the magnetic phase transition can be either of the first or of the second
order, depending on the value of the exchange interaction and crystal field.
The presence of vacancies in every second iron layer leads to incomplete
cancellation of magnetic moments, hence to the emergence of the ferrimagnetism.
Anomalies in the magnetization behavior have been found and compared with the

assess the models with automatic evaluation measures and conduct a small-scale

minimise the root temperature for a prescribed thermal power, rather than

proposed based on ring-ribbon quadtree and color vector angle. First, original
image is subjected to normalization and Gaussian low-pass filtering to produce
a secondary image, which is divided into a series of ring-ribbons with
different radii and the same number of pixels. Then, both textural and color
features are extracted locally and globally. Quadtree decomposition (QD) is
applied on luminance values of the ring-ribbons to extract local textural
features, and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to extract
global textural features. Local color features of significant corner points on
outer boundaries of ring-ribbons are extracted through color vector angles
(CVA), and color low-order moments (CLMs) is utilized to extract global color
features. Finally, two types of feature vectors are fused via canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) to prodcue the final hash after scrambling. Compared
with direct concatenation, the CCA feature fusion method improves
classification performance, which better reflects overall correlation between
two sets of feature vectors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

neural networks (ANNs) to approximate high-dimensional functions without
suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, we introduce a
concept which we refer to as approximation spaces of artificial neural networks
and we present several tools to handle those spaces. Roughly speaking,
approximation spaces consist of sequences of functions which can, in a suitable
way, be approximated by ANNs without curse of dimensionality in the sense that
the number of required ANN parameters to approximate a function of the sequence
with an accuracy $\varepsilon > 0$ grows at most polynomially both in the
reciprocal $1/\varepsilon$ of the required accuracy and in the dimension $d \in
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$ of the function. We show under suitable
assumptions that these approximation spaces are closed under various operations
including linear combinations, formations of limits, and infinite compositions.
To illustrate the power of the machinery proposed in this paper, we employ the
developed theory to prove that ANNs have the capacity to overcome the curse of
dimensionality in the numerical approximation of certain first order transport
partial differential equations (PDEs). Under suitable conditions we even prove
that approximation spaces are closed under flows of first order transport PDEs.

often suffers from the noisy label problem. Traditional DS methods usually
represent an entity pair as a bag of sentences and denoise labels using
multi-instance learning techniques. The bag-based paradigm, however, fails to
leverage the inter-sentence-level and the entity-level evidence for relation
extraction, and their denoising algorithms are often specialized and
complicated. In this paper, we propose a new DS paradigm--document-based
distant supervision, which models relation extraction as a document-based
machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. By re-organizing all sentences about
an entity as a document and extracting relations via querying the document with
relation-specific questions, the document-based DS paradigm can simultaneously
encode and exploit all sentence-level, inter-sentence-level, and entity-level
evidence. Furthermore, we design a new loss function--DSLoss (distant
supervision loss), which can effectively train MRC models using only
$\langle$document, question, answer$\rangle$ tuples, therefore noisy label
problem can be inherently resolved. Experiments show that our method achieves
new state-of-the-art DS performance.

total breast volume, can be assessed qualitatively by radiologists and

segmentation of breast and FGT volume. In this study, we propose a method to
directly assess breast density on MRI, and provide interpretations of these
assessments.
  We assessed breast density in 506 patients with breast cancer using a
regression convolutional neural network (CNN). The input for the CNN were
slices of breast MRI of 128 x 128 voxels, and the output was a continuous
density value between 0 (fatty breast) and 1 (dense breast). We used 350
patients to train the CNN, 75 for validation, and 81 for independent testing.
We investigated why the CNN came to its predicted density using Deep SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
  The density predicted by the CNN on the testing set was significantly
correlated with the ground truth densities (N = 81 patients, Spearman's rho =
0.86, P < 0.001). When inspecting what the CNN based its predictions on, we
found that voxels in FGT commonly had positive SHAP-values, voxels in fatty
tissue commonly had negative SHAP-values, and voxels in non-breast tissue
commonly had SHAP-values near zero. This means that the prediction of density
is based on the structures we expect it to be based on, namely FGT and fatty
tissue.
  To conclude, we presented an interpretable deep learning regression method
for breast density estimation on MRI with promising results.

low-dimensional subspaces. Usually, SC learns an affinity matrix and then
performs spectral clustering. Both steps suffer from high time and space
complexity, which leads to difficulty in clustering large datasets. This paper
presents a method called k-Factorization Subspace Clustering (k-FSC) for
large-scale subspace clustering. K-FSC directly factorizes the data into k
groups via pursuing structured sparsity in the matrix factorization model.
Thus, k-FSC avoids learning affinity matrix and performing eigenvalue
decomposition, and has low (linear) time and space complexity on large
datasets. This paper proves the effectiveness of the k-FSC model theoretically.
An efficient algorithm with convergence guarantee is proposed to solve the
optimization of k-FSC. In addition, k-FSC is able to handle sparse noise,
outliers, and missing data, which are pervasive in real applications. This
paper also provides online extension and out-of-sample extension for k-FSC to
handle streaming data and cluster arbitrarily large datasets. Extensive
experiments on large-scale real datasets show that k-FSC and its extensions
outperform state-of-the-art methods of subspace clustering.

due to its advantages of global optimization and high maintainability in real

operations to concatenate the detection part and the sequence recognition part
into a two-stage text spotting framework. However, in such framework, the
recognition part is highly sensitive to the detected results (e.g.), the
compactness of text contours). To address this problem, in this paper, we
propose a novel Mask AttentioN Guided One-stage text spotting framework named
MANGO, in which character sequences can be directly recognized without RoI

generate attention weights on each text instance and its characters. It allows
different text instances in an image to be allocated on different feature map
channels which are further grouped as a batch of instance features. Finally, a
lightweight sequence decoder is applied to generate the character sequences. It
is worth noting that MANGO inherently adapts to arbitrary-shaped text spotting
and can be trained end-to-end with only coarse position information (e.g.),
rectangular bounding box) and text annotations. Experimental results show that
the proposed method achieves competitive and even new state-of-the-art

the variance of the Gaussian distribution can be optimized at each input so as
to maximize the certification radius for the construction of the smooth

certification with existing approaches, we propose a memory-enhanced data

approach is generic, parameter-free, and easy to implement. In fact, we show
that our data dependent framework can be seamlessly incorporated into 3
randomized smoothing approaches, leading to consistent improved certified

of nucleons into nuclei. In the case of small interacting systems, such as dark
matter and $e^+e^-$ annihilations or $pp$ collisions, the coalescence condition
is often imposed only in momentum space and hence the size of the interaction
region is neglected. On the other hand, in most coalescence models used for
heavy ion collisions, the coalescence probability is controlled mainly by the
size of the interaction region, while two-nucleon momentum correlations are
either neglected or treated as collective flow. Recent experimental data from
$pp$ collisions at LHC have been interpreted as evidence for such collective
behaviour, even in small interacting systems. We argue that these data are
naturally explained in the framework of conventional QCD inspired event
generators when both two-nucleon momentum correlations and the size of the
hadronic emission volume are taken into account. To include both effects, we
employ a per-event coalescence model based on the Wigner function
representation of the produced nuclei states. This model reproduces well the
source size for baryon emission and the coalescence factor $B_2$ measured
recently by the ALICE collaboration in $pp$ collisions.

recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very

it into a wrong class). Humans are very robust against such perturbations; one
possible reason could be that humans do not learn to classify based on an error
between ""target label"" and ""predicted label"" but possibly due to reinforcements
that they receive on their predictions. In this work, we proposed a novel
method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a
reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient
method used in reinforcement learning, to train our model instead of
conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on the cifar10 dataset

The morphology of HNCO 4$_{04}$-3$_{03}$ and HC$_{3}$N 10-9 agrees well with
the dust emission. HC$_{3}$N 10-9 tends to originate from more compact regions
than HNCO 4$_{04}$-3$_{03}$ and SiO 2-1. We divided our sources into three
groups: those in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), those associated with
bubbles (Bubble), and the remaining sources, which are termed 'normal star
forming regions' (NMSFR). These three groups, subdivided into three different
categories with respect to line widths, integrated intensities, and column
densities, hint at the presence of different physical and chemical processes.
We find that the dust temperature $T_{\rm d}$, and the abundance ratios of
$N_{\rm HNCO}/N_{\rm SiO}$ and $N_{\rm HNCO}/N_{\rm HC3N}$ show a decreasing
trend towards the central dense regions of CMZ sources, while $N_{\rm

in eight of the sixteen bubble and NMSFR sources. The low outflow detection
rate indicates that in these sources the SiO 2-1 line wing emission is either
below our sensitivity limit or that the bulk of the SiO emission may be
produced by the expansion of an H{\sc\,ii} region or supernova remnant, which
has pushed molecular gas away forming a shock and yielding SiO.

difficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of
supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D
object detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a
teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the
labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due
to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from
significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a
confidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence
thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter
low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures
do not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use
the estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware
self-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet
as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the
autonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant
margins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting). For example,
when training using only 10\% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7%
absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5% absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon
the prior art. On KITTI, we are the first to demonstrate semi-supervised 3D
object detection and our method surpasses a fully supervised baseline from 1.8%
to 7.6% under different label ratios and categories.

here is the inplanes and out of plane phonon modes contribution in the thermal
rectification. We see that the Y mode has high and positive thermal
rectification while that the X and Z modes have small and negative thermal
rectifications. Thermal rectification for Y mode increases sharply beyond T 30

approach, combining quadratic hedging with application of a risk measure on the
residual liability, to obtain a cost-of-capital margin. In such approaches, the
preferences represented by the regulatory risk measure are not reflected in the
hedging process. We address this issue by an alternative two-step hedging
procedure, based on generalised regression arguments, which leads to portfolios
that are neutral with respect to a risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk or the
expectile. First, a portfolio of traded assets aimed at replicating the
liability is determined by local quadratic hedging. Second, the residual
liability is hedged using an alternative objective function. The risk margin is
then defined as the cost of the capital required to hedge the residual
liability. In the case quantile regression is used in the second step, yearly
solvency constraints are naturally satisfied; furthermore, the portfolio is a
risk minimiser among all hedging portfolios that satisfy such constraints. We
present a neural network algorithm for the valuation and hedging of insurance
liabilities based on a backward iterations scheme. The algorithm is fairly
general and easily applicable, as it only requires simulated paths of risk
drivers.

development, the investigation and the calibration of medical imaging
techniques and protocols. Because it requires taking both mechanical and
imaging properties into account, the development of robust, calibrated phantoms
is a major challenge in elastography. Soft polyvinyl chloride gels in a liquid
plasticizer (plastisol or PVCP) have been proposed as soft tissue-mimicking
phantoms (TMP) for elasticity imaging. PVCP phantoms are relatively low-cost
and can be easily stored over long time periods without any specific
requirements. In this work, the preparation of a PVCP gel phantom for both MR
and ultrasoundelastography is proposed and its acoustic, NMR and mechanical
properties are studied.Material and methods: The acoustic and magnetic
resonance imaging properties of PVCP are measured for different mass ratios
between ultrasound speckle particles and PVCP solution, and between resin and
plasticizer. The linear mechanical properties of plastisol samples are then
investigated over time using not only indentation tests, but also MR and
ultrasound-elastography clinical protocols. These properties are compared to
typical values reported for biological soft tissues and to the values found in
the literature for PVCP gels.Results and conclusions: After a period of two
weeks, the mechanical properties of the plastisol samples measured with
indentation testing are stable for at least the following 4 weeks (end of
follow-up period 43 days after gelation-fusion). Neither the mechanical nor the
NMR properties of plastisol gels were found to be affected by the addition of
cellulose as acoustic speckle. Mechanical properties of the proposed gels were
successfully characterized by clinical, commercially-available MR Elastography
and sonoelastography protocols. PVCP with a mass ratio of ultrasound speckle
particles of 0.6% to 0.8% and a mass ratio between resin and plasticizer
between 50 and 70% appears as a good TMP candidate that can be used with both
MR and ultrasound-based elastography methods.

case of a cantilevered EAP strip subjected to a continuous voltage between its
two faces (static case). Since the amplitude of the bending is large, the
applied forces and the deflection are calculated using a beam model in large

The existing Bayesian optimization (BO) based solutions turn the CASH problem
into a Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) problem by combining the
hyperparameters of all machine learning (ML) algorithms, and use BO methods to
solve it. As a result, these methods suffer from the low-efficiency problem due
to the huge hyperparameter space in CASH. To alleviate this issue, we propose
the alternating optimization framework, where the HPO problem for each ML

this framework, the BO methods are used to solve the HPO problem for each ML
algorithm separately, incorporating a much smaller hyperparameter space for BO
methods. Furthermore, we introduce Rising Bandits, a CASH-oriented Multi-Armed
Bandits (MAB) variant, to model the algorithm selection in CASH. This framework
can take the advantages of both BO in solving the HPO problem with a relatively
small hyperparameter space and the MABs in accelerating the algorithm
selection. Moreover, we further develop an efficient online algorithm to solve
the Rising Bandits with provably theoretical guarantees. The extensive

these obstacles, we introduce a cross-domain NER dataset (CrossNER), a
fully-labeled collection of NER data spanning over five diverse domains with
specialized entity categories for different domains. Additionally, we also
provide a domain-related corpus since using it to continue pre-training

adaptation. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the
effectiveness of leveraging different levels of the domain corpus and

the body and control is a difficult challenge due to the intricate relationship
between fine-tuning control and morphological changes that can invalidate such
optimizations. To solve this challenge we compare three different Evolutionary
Algorithms on their capacity to optimize morphologies in modular robotics. We
compare two objective-based search algorithms, with MAP-Elites. To understand
the benefit of diversity we transition the evolved populations into two
difficult environments to see if diversity can have an impact on solving
complex environments. In addition, we analyse the genealogical ancestry to shed
light on the notion of stepping stones as key to enable high performance. The
results show that MAP-Elites is capable of evolving the highest performing
solutions in addition to generating the largest morphological diversity. For
the transition between environments the results show that MAP-Elites is better
at regaining performance by promoting morphological diversity. With the
analysis of genealogical ancestry we show that MAP-Elites produces more diverse
and higher performing stepping stones than the other objective-based search
algorithms. Transitioning the populations to more difficult environments show
the utility of morphological diversity, while the analysis of stepping stones
show a strong correlation between diversity of ancestry and maximum performance
on the locomotion task. The paper shows the advantage of promoting diversity
for solving a locomotion task in different environments for modular robotics.

efficiently balancing the performance and complexity of multiple-input and

efficient online training by leveraging the following simple observation:
although NN parameters should adapt to channels, not all of them are
channel-sensitive. In particular, we use a deep unfolded NN structure that
represents iterative algorithms in signal detection and channel decoding
modules as multi layer deep feed forward networks. An expectation propagation
(EP) module, called EPNet, is established for signal detection by unfolding the
EP algorithm and rendering the damping factors trainable. An unfolded turbo
decoding module, called TurboNet, is used for channel decoding. This component
decodes the turbo code, where trainable NN units are integrated into the
traditional max-log-maximum a posteriori decoding procedure. We demonstrate
that TurboNet is robust for channels and requires only one off-line training.
Therefore, only a few damping factors in EPNet must be re-optimized online. An
online training mechanism based on meta learning is then developed. Here, the
optimizer, which is implemented by long short-term memory NNs, is trained to
update damping factors efficiently by using a small training set such that they
can quickly adapt to new environments. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed receiver significantly outperforms traditional receivers and that the
online learning mechanism can quickly adapt to new environments. Furthermore,
an over-the-air platform is presented to demonstrate the significant robustness
of the proposed receiver in practical deployment.

order to accurately describe the flow characteristics, high-resolution
nonlinear numerical schemes are needed to capture discontinuities and resolve
wide convective, acoustic and interfacial scale ranges. The simulation of
realistic 3D problems with state-of-the-art FVM based on approximate Riemann
solvers with weighted nonlinear reconstruction schemes requires the usage of
HPC architectures. Efficient compression algorithms reduce computational and
memory load. Fully adaptive MR algorithms with LTS have proven their potential
for such applications. While modern CPU require multiple levels of parallelism
to achieve peak performance, the fine grained MR mesh adaptivity results in
challenging compute/communication patterns. Moreover, LTS incur for strong data

  We address these challenges with a block-based MR algorithm, where arbitrary

a modular setup of the source code framework in which the building blocks of

subgroups of rings as well as on model-theoretic connected components of rings,
which concern generating in finitely many steps inside additive groups of

  Let $R$ be any ring equipped with an arbitrary additional first order
structure, and $A$ a set of parameters. We show that whenever $H$ is an
$A$-definable, finite index subgroup of $(R,+)$, then $H+RH$ contains an
$A$-definable, two-sided ideal of finite index. As a corollary, we positively
answer Question 3.9 of [Bohr compactifications of groups and rings, J.
Gismatullin, G. Jagiella and K. Krupi\'nski]: if $R$ is unital, then $(\bar
R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A =
\bar R^{00}_A$, where $\bar R \succ R$ is a sufficiently saturated elementary
extension of $R$, and $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ [resp. $\bar R^{00}_A$] is the
smallest $A$-type-definable, bounded index additive subgroup [resp. ideal] of
$\bar R$. This implies that $\bar R^{00}_A=\bar R^{000}_A$, where $\bar
R^{000}_A$ is the smallest invariant over $A$, bounded index ideal of $\bar R$.
If $R$ is of finite characteristic (not necessarily unital), we get a sharper
result: $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A = \bar R^{00}_A$.
We obtain similar results for finitely generated (not necessarily unital) rings
and for topological rings. The above results imply that the simplified
descriptions of the definable (so also classical) Bohr compactifications of
triangular groups over unital rings obtained in Corollary 3.5 of the
aforementioned paper are valid for all unital rings.
  We analyze many examples, where we compute the number of steps needed to
generate a group by $(\bar R \cup \{1\}) \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ and study
related aspects, showing ""optimality"" of some of our main results and answering

conventional voltammetry measurements is complicated because only the total

contributions to the current. Chopped light measurement and hole scavenger
measurement techniques are widely employed to determine xt, but they often lead
to errors. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is better
suited for accurate determination of xt because it provides direct information

analysis of IMPS measurements at different light intensities is required to
account for nonlinear effects. We compare the xt values obtained by these

tracing to find individuals before they become infectious and in order to limit
their interactions with others until after their infectious period has passed.
Manual contact tracing is a public health intervention where individuals
testing positive are interviewed to identify other members of the community who
they may have come into contact with. These interviews can take a significant
amount of time that has to be tallied in the overall accounting of the outbreak
cost. The concept of contact tracing has been expanded recently into Automated
Exposure Notification whereby cellphones can be used as sensor platforms to log
close contacts and notify the owner in the event that one of their close
contacts tests positive. The intention is that this notification will prompt
the person to be tested and then restrict their interactions with others until
their status is determined. In this paper we describe our efforts to
investigate the effectiveness of contact tracing interventions on controlling
an outbreak. This is accomplished by creating a model of disease spread and
then observing the impact that simulated tracing and testing have on the number
of infected individuals. Model parameters are explored to identify critical
transition points where interventions become effective. We estimate the
benefits as well as costs in order to offer insight to public health officials

suitable for quantum information processing (QIP), within the lifetime of the
system. This family of pulses enables to overcome inevitable fabrication errors
in silicon photonics, and relax the need for a precise initial state of light
coupled into the system to achieve accurate light transfer. Furthermore, we
extend universal DMCPs to n-level systems with irreducible SU(2) symmetry to
create state transfer that is highly robust to errors in the pulse area from
any initial state.

agents must cooperatively minimize a cumulative objective function, with each
local function expressible as an empirical average of data-dependent losses.
State-of-the-art approaches for decentralized optimization rely on gradient
tracking, where consensus is enforced via a doubly stochastic mixing matrix.
Construction of such mixing matrices is not straightforward and requires
coordination even prior to the start of the optimization algorithm. This paper
puts forth a primal-dual framework for decentralized stochastic optimization
that obviates the need for such doubly stochastic matrices. Instead, dual
variables are maintained to track the disagreement between neighbors. The
proposed framework is flexible and is used to develop decentralized variants of
SAGA, L-SVRG, SVRG++, and SEGA algorithms. Using a unified proof, we establish
that the oracle complexity of these decentralized variants is $O(1/\epsilon)$,
matching the complexity bounds obtained for the centralized variants.
Additionally, we also present a decentralized primal-dual accelerated SVRG
algorithm achieving $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ oracle complexity, again matching
the bound for the centralized accelerated SVRG. Numerical tests on the
algorithms establish their superior performance as compared to the
variance-reduced gradient tracking algorithms.

the performance gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised salient
object detection methods is huge, and most previous weakly supervised works
adopt complex training methods with many bells and whistles. In this work, we
propose a one-round end-to-end training approach for weakly supervised salient
object detection via scribble annotations without pre/post-processing
operations or extra supervision data. Since scribble labels fail to offer
detailed salient regions, we propose a local coherence loss to propagate the
labels to unlabeled regions based on image features and pixel distance, so as
to predict integral salient regions with complete object structures. We design
a saliency structure consistency loss as self-consistent mechanism to ensure
consistent saliency maps are predicted with different scales of the same image
as input, which could be viewed as a regularization technique to enhance the
model generalization ability. Additionally, we design an aggregation module
(AGGM) to better integrate high-level features, low-level features and global
context information for the decoder to aggregate various information. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
six benchmarks (e.g. for the ECSSD dataset: F_\beta = 0.8995, E_\xi = 0.9079

cosmological simulations with three sine waves and Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
initial conditions. The simulations are performed with the tessellation based
Vlasov solver ColDICE and a Particle-Mesh (PM) $N$-body code. The analyses
include projected density, phase-space diagrams, radial density and
pseudo-phase space density. Particular attention is paid to force and mass
resolution. Because the phase-space sheet complexity, estimated in terms of
total volume and simplices count, increases very quickly, ColDICE can follow
only the early violent relaxation phase of halo formation. During the latter,
agreement between ColDICE and PM simulations having one particle per cell or
more is excellent and halos have a power-law density profile, $\rho(r) \propto
r^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha \in [1.5,1.8]$. This slope, measured prior to any merger,
is slightly larger than in the literature. The phase-space diagrams evidence
complex but coherent patterns with clear signatures of self-similarity in the
sine wave simulations, while the CDM halos are somewhat scribbly. After
additional mass resolution tests, the PM simulations are used to follow the
next stages of evolution. The power-law progressively breaks down with a
convergence of the density profile to the well known ""NFW""-like universal
attractor, irrespectively of initial conditions, that is even in the three-sine
wave simulations. This demonstrates again that mergers do not represent a
necessary condition for convergence to the dynamical attractor. Not
surprisingly, the measured pseudo phase-space density is a power-law $Q(r)
\propto r^{-\alpha_Q}$, with $\alpha_{\rm Q}$ close to the prediction of
secondary spherical infall model, $\alpha_{\rm Q} \simeq 1.875$. However this
property is also verified during the early relaxation phase, which is non
trivial.

  Technique",,,,,"cs.DS math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Packing problems constitute an important class of optimization problems, both
because of their high practical relevance and theoretical appeal. However,
despite the large number of variants that have been studied in the literature,
most packing problems encompass a single tier of capacity restrictions only.
For example, in the Multiple Knapsack Problem, we assign items to multiple
knapsacks such that their capacities are not exceeded. But what if these
knapsacks are partitioned into clusters, each imposing an additional capacity
restriction on the knapsacks contained in that cluster? In this paper, we study
the Maximum Coverage Problem with Cluster Constraints (MCPC), which generalizes
the Maximum Coverage Problem with Knapsack Constraints (MCPK) by incorporating
cluster constraints. Our main contribution is a general LP-based technique to
derive approximation algorithms for cluster capacitated problems. Our technique
allows us to reduce the cluster capacitated problem to the respective original
packing problem. By using an LP-based approximation algorithm for the original
problem, we can then obtain an effective rounding scheme for the problem, which
only loses a small fraction in the approximation guarantee. We apply our
technique to derive approximation algorithms for MCPC. To this aim, we develop
an LP-based $\frac12(1-\frac1e)$-approximation algorithm for MCPK by adapting
the pipage rounding technique. Combined with our reduction technique, we obtain
a $\frac13(1-\frac1e)$-approximation algorithm for MCPC. We also derive
improved results for a special case of MCPC, the Multiple Knapsack Problem with
Cluster Constraints (MKPC). Based on a simple greedy algorithm, our approach
yields a $\frac13$-approximation algorithm. By combining our technique with a
more sophisticated iterative rounding approach, we obtain a

forecasting systems is that reliability, in general, is a hypothesis not about
a finite dimensional parameter but about an entire functional relationship. A
calibrated probability forecast for binary events for instance should equal the
conditional probability of the event given the forecast for {\em any} value of
the forecast. Attempts to estimate deviations from calibration at a specific
forecast value meet with the difficulty that the probability of the forecast
assuming that value is typically zero. Considering the estimated {\em
cumulative} deviations from reliability instead however, tests are presented
for which the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic can be established
rigorously. The distribution turns out to be universal, provided the forecasts
""look one step ahead"" only, or in other words, verify at the next time step in
the future. Furthermore, the tests develop power against a wide class of
alternatives. Numerical experiments for both artificial data as well as
operational weather forecasting systems are also presented, as are possible
extensions to forecasts with longer lead times.

H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies (ELGs) were detected, most of them having
[NII}]. We reduced and analysed a set of [OIII] and H$\beta$ tunable filter
(TF) observations within GLACE survey. Using H$\alpha$ priors, we identified
[OIII] and H$\beta$ in 35 ($\sim$20%) and 59 ($\sim$34%) sources, respectively,
with 21 of them having both emission lines, and 20 having in addition [NII].
Applying BPT-NII diagnostic diagram, we classified these ELGs into 40%
star-forming (SF), 55% composites, and 5% LINERs. Star formation rate (SFR)
measured through extinction corrected H$\alpha$ fluxes increases with stellar
mass ($\mathrm{M}_{*}$), attaining its peak at
$\mathrm{M}_{*}\sim10^{9.8}\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We observed that the cluster
centre to $\sim$1.3Mpc is devoid of SF galaxies and AGN. Our results suggest
that the star formation efficiency declines as the local density increases in
the cluster medium. Moreover, the SF and AGN fractions drop sharply towards
high-density environments. We observed a strong decline in SF fraction in high
$\mathrm{M}_*$, confirming that star formation is highly suppressed in
high-mass cluster galaxies. Finally, we determined that SFR correlates with
$\mathrm{M}_*$ while specific SFR (sSFR) anti-correlates with $\mathrm{M}_*$,
both for cluster and field. This work shows the importance and strength of TF
observations when studying ELGs in clusters at higher redshifts. We provide

global localization and data association to reduce the instance ambiguity

creation of complete globally consistent representations of the environment and
typically do not scale well. We utilize multiple hypothesis trees to derive a
probabilistic data association for semantic measurements by means of position,

motivation to use quantum computation to accelerate the calculation. Here, we
propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that solves SDEs based on

trinomial tree structure with discretization and then formulate it as the
time-evolution of a quantum state embedding the probability distributions of
the SDE variables. We embed the probability distribution directly in the
amplitudes of the quantum state while the previous studies did the square-root
of the probability distribution in the amplitudes. Our embedding enables us to
construct simple quantum circuits that simulate the time-evolution of the state
for general SDEs. We also develop a scheme to compute the expectation values of
the SDE variables and discuss whether our scheme can achieve quantum speed-up
for the expectation-value evaluations of the SDE variables. Finally, we
numerically validate our algorithm by simulating several types of stochastic
processes. Our proposal provides a new direction for simulating SDEs on quantum

due to its practical consideration, i.e., the clients may only have unlabeled
data. In practice, these SSFL systems implement semi-supervised training by
assigning a ""guessed"" label to the unlabeled data near the labeled data to
convert the unsupervised problem into a fully supervised problem. However, the
inherent properties of such semi-supervised training techniques create a new
attack surface. In this paper, we discover and reveal a simple yet powerful
poisoning attack against SSFL. Our attack utilizes the natural characteristic
of semi-supervised learning to cause the model to be poisoned by poisoning
unlabeled data. Specifically, the adversary just needs to insert a small number
of maliciously crafted unlabeled samples (e.g., only 0.1\% of the dataset) to
infect model performance and misclassification. Extensive case studies have
shown that our attacks are effective on different datasets and common
semi-supervised learning methods. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a
defense, i.e., a minimax optimization-based client selection strategy, to
enable the server to select the clients who hold the correct label information
and high-quality updates. Our defense further employs a quality-based
aggregation rule to strengthen the contributions of the selected updates.
Evaluations under different attack conditions show that the proposed defense
can well alleviate such unlabeled poisoning attacks. Our study unveils the
vulnerability of SSFL to unlabeled poisoning attacks and provides the community
with potential defense methods.

However, FEL faces two critical challenges: communication overhead and data
privacy. FEL suffers from expensive communication overhead when training
large-scale multi-node models. Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to
gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global
model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we
propose a communication-efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL
framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model
update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global
model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential
privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates
gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge
nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to
detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can
avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping
attacks. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate
that the proposed framework can not only improve communication efficiency but
also mitigate malicious attacks while its accuracy is comparable to traditional
FEL frameworks.

been made with deep learning models, state-of-the-art methods require
ground-truth dense point sets as the supervision, which makes them limited to
be trained under synthetic paired training data and not suitable to be under
real-scanned sparse data. However, it is expensive and tedious to obtain large
numbers of paired sparse-dense point sets as supervision from real-scanned
sparse data. To address this problem, we propose a self-supervised point cloud
upsampling network, named SPU-Net, to capture the inherent upsampling patterns
of points lying on the underlying object surface. Specifically, we propose a
coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework, which contains two main components:
point feature extraction and point feature expansion, respectively. In the
point feature extraction, we integrate the self-attention module with the graph
convolution network (GCN) to capture context information inside and among local
regions simultaneously. In the point feature expansion, we introduce a
hierarchically learnable folding strategy to generate upsampled point sets with
learnable 2D grids. Moreover, to further optimize the noisy points in the

the hydrogen and oxygen cells. The ion exchange in our cells is mediated by
auxiliary electrodes, and the cells are connected to each other only by metal
wires, enabling centralized hydrogen production. We demonstrate hydrogen
generation in separate cells with solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of
7.5%, which can readily surpass 10% using standard commercial components. A
basic cost comparison shows that our approach is competitive with conventional

paper takes a direct approach whereby an event of interest is identified based
on information on the composite event and aggregate data on composite events
(e.g. total number of search ads shown). This work contributes to the
literature by proving identification of the unobserved events' probabilities up
to a scalar factor under mild condition. We propose an approach to identify the
scalar factor by using aggregate data that is usually available from earned and

recently been remarkable. Grover's search algorithm in a binary quantum system
provides considerable speed-up over classical paradigm. Further, Grover's

advantage of larger state space, which helps to reduce the run-time of the
algorithm as compared to the traditional binary quantum systems. In a qudit
quantum system, an $n$-qudit Toffoli gate plays a significant role in the
accurate implementation of Grover's algorithm. In this article, a generalized

attain a logarithmic depth decomposition without ancilla qudit. The circuit for
Grover's algorithm has then been designed for any $d$-ary quantum system, where
$d \ge 2$, with the proposed $n$-qudit Toffoli gate to obtain optimized depth
compared to earlier approaches. The technique for decomposing an $n$-qudit
Toffoli gate requires access to two immediately higher energy levels, making
the design susceptible to errors. Nevertheless, we show that the percentage
decrease in the probability of error is significant as we have reduced both

new local well-posedness theory for nonlinear stochastic PDEs with Gaussian
noise. In the current Part II we consider blow-up criteria and regularization
phenomena. As in Part I we can allow nonlinearities with polynomial growth, and
rough initial values from critical spaces.
  In the first main result we obtain several new blow-up criteria for quasi-
and semilinear stochastic evolution equations. In particular, for semilinear
equations we obtain a Serrin type blow-up criterium, which extends a recent
result of Pr\""uss-Simonett-Wilke (2018) to the stochastic setting. Blow-up
criteria can be used to prove global well-posedness for SPDEs. As in Part I,
maximal regularity techniques and weights in time play a central role in the
proofs.
  Our second contribution is a new method to bootstrap Sobolev and H\""older
regularity in time and space, which does not require smoothness of the initial
data. The blow-up criteria are at the basis of these new methods. Moreover, in
applications the bootstrap results can be combined with our blow-up criteria,
to obtain efficient ways to prove global existence. This gives new results even
in classical $L^2$-settings, which we illustrate for a concrete SPDE.
  In future works in preparation we apply the results of the current paper to
obtain global well-posedness results, and regularity for several concrete
SPDEs. These include stochastic Navier-Stokes, reaction diffusion equations,
and Allen-Cahn equations. Our setting allows to put these SPDEs into a more
flexible framework, where less restrictions on the nonlinearities are needed,
and we are able to treat rough initial values from critical spaces. Moreover,
we will obtain higher order regularity results.

heatwave projections with power outage and recovery process analysis to
investigate how the emerging hurricane-blackout-heatwave compound hazard may
vary in a changing climate, for Harris County in Texas (including major part of
Houston City) as an example. We find that, under the high-emissions scenario
RCP8.5, the expected percent of customers experiencing at least one
longer-than-5-day hurricane-induced power outage in a 20-year period would
increase significantly from 14% at the end of the 20th century to 44% at the
end of the 21st century in Harris County. The expected percent of customers who
may experience at least one longer-than-5-day heatwave without power (to
provide air conditioning) would increase alarmingly, from 0.8% to 15.5%. These
increases of risk may be largely avoided if the climate is well controlled
under the stringent mitigation scenario RCP2.6. We also reveal that a moderate
enhancement of critical sectors of the distribution network can significantly
improve the resilience of the entire power grid and mitigate the risk of the
future compound hazard. Together these findings suggest that, in addition to
climate mitigation, climate adaptation actions are urgently needed to improve
the resilience of coastal power systems.

propose a Multi-Objective Interpolation Training (MOIT) approach that jointly
exploits contrastive learning and classification to mutually help each other

contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an
interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a
novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature
representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample
soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify
noisy samples. This detection allows treating noisy samples as unlabeled and
training a classifier in a semi-supervised manner to prevent noise memorization
and improve representation learning. We further propose MOIT+, a refinement of
MOIT by fine-tuning on detected clean samples. Hyperparameter and ablation

microelectronics as it eliminates alignment errors inherent to conventional
approaches by enabling material deposition only in specific areas. Typically,
the selectivity originates from surface modifications of the substrate that
allow or block precursor adsorption. The control of the deposition process
currently remains a major challenge as the selectivity of the no-growth areas
is lost quickly. Here, we show that surface modifications of the substrate
strongly manipulate the surface diffusion. The selective deposition of TiO$_2$
on poly (methyl methacrylate) and SiO$_2$ yields localized nanostructures with
tailored aspect ratios. Controlling the surface diffusion allows to tune such
nanostructures as it boosts the growth rate at the interface of the growth and
no-growth areas. Kinetic Monte-Carlo calculations reveal that species move from
high to low diffusion areas. Further, we identify the catalytic activity of
TiCl$_4$ during the formation of carboxylic acid on poly (methyl methacrylate)
as the reaction mechanism responsible for the loss of selectivity, and show
that process optimization leads to higher selectivity. Our work enables the
precise control of area-selective atomic layer deposition on the nanoscale, and
offers new strategies in area-selective deposition processes by exploiting
surface diffusion effects.

of 144 galaxies with dynamically determined $M_{\rm BH}$ encompasses 24
core-S\'ersic galaxies, thought to be products of gas-poor mergers, and
reliably identified based on high-resolution HST imaging. For core-S\'ersic

$\Delta_{\rm rms} \sim 0.47$ dex, however, at the high-mass end large-core
galaxies (four with measured $M_{\rm BH}$) are offset upward from this relation
by ($2.5-4) \times \sigma_{\rm s}$, explaining the previously reported

methods better suited for classifying spherical images. These newly proposed
convolutional layers naturally extend the notion of convolution to functions on
the unit sphere $S^2$ and the group of rotations $SO(3)$ and these layers are
equivariant to 3D rotations. In this paper, we consider the problem of
unsupervised learning of rotation-invariant representations for spherical
images. In particular, we carefully design an autoencoder architecture
consisting of $S^2$ and $SO(3)$ convolutional layers. As 3D rotations are often
a nuisance factor, the latent space is constrained to be exactly invariant to
these input transformations. As the rotation information is discarded in the
latent space, we craft a novel rotation-invariant loss function for training
the network. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the
usefulness of the learned representations on clustering, retrieval and
classification applications.

gradients explode as they propagate through the network's layers: the kernel is
random at initialization and changes significantly during training in this

active particle's transition rate between metastable states as a function of
friction and correlation time of the active force. Our experiments reveal the
existence of an optimal correlation time where the transition rate is
maximized. This novel \emph{active turnover} is reminiscent of the much

transmitted to the bottom silicon PV cell. We employ optical simulations to
determine the optimal thicknesses of the DBR layers and the V-shape angle to
maximize light absorption in the ultrathin (10 nm thick) hematite film. The DBR
spectral response can be tailored to allow for a more than threefold
enhancement in absorbed photons compared to a layer of the same thickness on
transparent current collectors. Using a DBR to couple a bottom silicon PV cell

Hachem et al., including a central server containing $N$ files connected to $K$
cache-less users through an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache-nodes, each
equipped with a cache memory size of $M$ files. Each user has access to $L$
neighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching
scheme proposed by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that $L$ does not divide
$K$, where the needed number of transmissions (a.k.a. load) is at most four
times the load expression for the case where $L$ divides $K$.
  Our main contribution is to propose a novel {\it transformation} approach to
smartly extend the schemes satisfying some conditions for the well known
shared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching systems. Then we can get
many coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess
coded caching system. These resulting schemes have the maximum local caching
gain (i.e., the cached contents stored at any $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes are
different such that the number of retrieval packets by each user from the
connected cache-nodes is maximal) and the same coded caching gain as the
original schemes. Applying the transformation approach to the well-known
shared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we obtain a
new multiaccess coded caching scheme that achieves the same load as the scheme
of Hachem et al. but for any system parameters. Under the constraint of the
cache placement used in this new multiaccess coded caching scheme, our delivery
strategy is approximately optimal when $K$ is sufficiently large. Finally, we
also show that the transmission load of the proposed scheme can be further
reduced by compressing the multicast message.

These are automatically generated during FP molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

MD simulations successfully reproduce the first-order displacive nature of the
phase transition, which is manifested by an abrupt jump of the volume and a
cooperative displacement of atoms at the phase transition temperature. The
phase transition is further identified by the simulated x-ray powder
diffraction, and the predicted phase transition temperature is in reasonable
agreement with experiment. Furthermore, we show that using a singular value
decomposition and pseudo inversion of the design matrix generally improves the
machine-learned force field compared to the usual inversion of the squared

that allows respondents to post their opinions in a free-format style, which
can subsequently serve as one of the choice items for other respondents, just
as in a multiple-choice survey. As a result, this framework generates an
opinion graph that relates opinions and respondents. We can also construct
annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution. By clustering the

response patterns as well as the interconnectedness and multi-faceted nature of
opinions. Substantively, our notable finding is that ""social pressure,"" not
""infection risk,"" was one of the major concerns of our respondents. Social
pressure refers to criticism and discrimination that they anticipate receiving
from others should they contract COVID-19. It is possible that the collectivist
nature of Japanese culture coupled with the government's policy of relying on
personal responsibility to combat COVID-19 explains some of the above findings,
as the latter has led to the emergence of vigilantes. The presence of mutual

situation is that the system can be measured but its structure and the detailed
rules of dynamical evolution are unknown. The inverse problem is to determine
the system equations and structure based solely on measured time series.
Recently, methods based on sparse optimization have been developed. For
example, the principle of exploiting sparse optimization such as compressive
sensing to find the equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data was
articulated in 2011 by the Nonlinear Dynamics Group at Arizona State
University. This article presents a brief review of the recent progress in this
area. The basic idea is to expand the equations governing the dynamical
evolution of the system into a power series or a Fourier series of a finite
number of terms and then to determine the vector of the expansion coefficients
based solely on data through sparse optimization. Examples discussed here
include discovering the equations of stationary or nonstationary chaotic
systems to enable prediction of dynamical events such as critical transition
and system collapse, inferring the full topology of complex networks of
dynamical oscillators and social networks hosting evolutionary game dynamics,
and identifying partial differential equations for spatiotemporal dynamical
systems. Situations where sparse optimization is effective and those in which
the method fails are discussed. Comparisons with the traditional method of
delay coordinate embedding in nonlinear time series analysis are given and the
recent development of model-free, data driven prediction framework based on
machine learning is briefly introduced.

significant scope for improvements in micro-expression recognition techniques.
The presence of micro-expressions in small-local regions of the face, as well
as the limited size of available databases, continue to limit the accuracy in
recognizing micro-expressions. In this work, we propose a facial
micro-expression recognition model using 3D residual attention network named
MERANet to tackle such challenges. The proposed model takes advantage of
spatial-temporal attention and channel attention together, to learn deeper
fine-grained subtle features for classification of emotions. Further, the
proposed model encompasses both spatial and temporal information simultaneously
using the 3D kernels and residual connections. Moreover, the channel features
and spatio-temporal features are re-calibrated using the channel and
spatio-temporal attentions, respectively in each residual module. Our attention
mechanism enables the model to learn to focus on different facial areas of
interest. The experiments are conducted on benchmark facial micro-expression
datasets. A superior performance is observed as compared to the
state-of-the-art for facial micro-expression recognition on benchmark data.

impossible. In fact, the methods are shown to estimate the optimal convex
aggregation, which minimizes the mis-clustering error under some specialized

Gaussian mixture models is generally superior to the commonly used $k$-means in

mountains and remoteness from oceans this area has the lowest relative humidity
in the former USSR and extremely high atmospheric stability. In particular,
direct measurements of precipitated water vapor in the winter months showed
typical pwv=0.8 - 0.9 mm with sometimes of 0.27 mm. To validate previous
studies and to compare them with results for other similar regions we performed
opacity calculations at mm - sub-mm wavelengths for different sites in the

To do this we integrate radiative transfer equations using the output of NASA

We confirm previous conclusions about exceptionally good astroclimate in the

to identify promising regions within the design space to explore, while the
strong learner is used to determine the exact location of the optimum within
promising regions. For each design iteration, exploration is done by randomly
selecting evaluation points within regions where the weak learner-predicted
fitness is high. The global optimum obtained by using the strong learner as a
surrogate is also evaluated to enable rapid convergence once the most promising

against five other optimizers on a cosine mixture function with 25 local optima

ActivO reduces the number of function evaluations needed to reach the global

is. All the logical entities and activities will be presented as
formatting/structuring on a given model of computation which should be as

By using an idea of ""interactive typing"" reminiscent of realisability theory,
it is possible to design formulas/types generalising the connectives of linear

systematically incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to
capture the diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related

discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other types
of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these

underlying mechanisms that shape the photocurrent. In a subsequent step, we fit
the data to a process-oriented equivalent circuit model (ECM) whose makeup is
derived from the DRT analysis in the first step. This yields consistent
quantitative trends of the dominant polarization processes observed. Our
observations reveal a common step for the photo-oxidation reactions of water

data is perhaps the most important challenge in today's \blue{science}. In
remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better
understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the
governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference,
thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set
of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario
that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be
used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive
noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause
and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such
principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward
directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the
obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more
independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a
criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence
estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting
the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious
detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal
inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and
machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182
problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a
carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates
in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.

Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) was applied to study the

different roles depending on the underlying hematite photoanode. The effect of
the co-catalyst is not always limited to changes in the surface properties, but
also to an increase in hole current from the bulk to the surface that indicates

observed by APT to segregate to the hematite/FTO interface and into some
hematite grains. Since no other pronounced changes in microstructure and
chemical composition were observed by electron microscopy and RBS after
annealing, the non-uniform Ti redistribution seems to be the reason for a
reduced interfacial recombination in the annealed films, as observed by IMPS.
This results in a lower onset potential, higher photocurrent and larger fill

previous problems without making any assumption on the statistics of the

reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and performs standard least squares
regression with the empirical means therein. A flexible version to deal with
multisource data of different dimensionality and sample sizes is also presented

analogy between electrostatics of conductors and open cosmological models which

are solutions of the Einstein equations with the energy-momentum tensor of a
Pascal perfect fluid. As a result, it is shown that the capacity of the
multidimensional ""ball"" electric capacitor in multidimensional Euclidean
auxiliary space is connected with harmonic functions by which the potentials of
multidimensional capacitors are described. In turn, the conformal factor of the
metric describing an open universe model in the Fock representation is a power
function of this potential for each dimensionality of the Euclidean space. In
particular, for 3D auxiliary Euclidean space in 4D space-time, there is the
Friedman solution for an open universe filled with incoherent dust (with flat
metric at spatial infinity). Further for 4D Euclidean space, we have an
analogue of the open cosmological model with the equation of state of an

and in real space within Floquet formalism, and develop a method based on
subcycle-resolved x-ray-optical wave mixing to reconstruct those dynamics. We
analyze how time-reversal and inversion symmetries influence properties of
optically-induced charge distributions and microscopic electron currents.
Several examples for the $\mu$th-order microscopic optical response of band-gap
crystals are shown and compared for cases when there is either a considerable
or a vanishing $\mu$th-order macroscopic response. We then analyze the
consequence of crystal symmetries on subcycle-resolved x-ray-optical wave
mixing, a process in which an x-ray pulse of a duration shorter than the
optical cycle of the driving pulse interacts with a laser-dressed crystal.
Based on this analysis, we develop a method to reconstruct amplitudes and
phases of Fourier components of optically-induced charge distributions from
momentum and delay dependence of x-ray-optical wave-mixing spectra.
Subcycle-resolved x-ray-optical wave mixing also reveals phases of temporal
oscillations of microscopic optical response and some properties of microscopic
laser-driven electron currents.

agricultural applications, {both for assessing vegetation condition and for
subsequent yield prediction.} Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate
gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate
crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or
semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic
mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in
mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for
advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine
process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer
model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 {and Landsat 8} optical remote sensing data and
machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. Our model successfully
estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions
even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites.
This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite
sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud
computing platforms.

  Images: Case Studies on Lung and Brain Cancers",,,,,"cs.CV stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Tumor shape is a key factor that affects tumor growth and metastasis. This
paper proposes a topological feature computed by persistent homology to
characterize tumor progression from digital pathology and radiology images and
examines its effect on the time-to-event data. The proposed topological
features are invariant to scale-preserving transformation and can summarize
various tumor shape patterns. The topological features are represented in
functional space and used as functional predictors in a functional Cox
proportional hazards model. The proposed model enables interpretable inference
about the association between topological shape features and survival risks.
Two case studies are conducted using consecutive 133 lung cancer and 77 brain
tumor patients. The results of both studies show that the topological features
predict survival prognosis after adjusting clinical variables, and the
predicted high-risk groups have worse survival outcomes than the low-risk
groups. Also, the topological shape features found to be positively associated
with survival hazards are irregular and heterogeneous shape patterns, which are
known to be related to tumor progression.

and Registration (INR) models for geostationary satellite services, as well as
to maintain the geometric quality assessment (GQA) in the instrument data
processing chain of Earth observation satellites. Matching the landmark
accurately is of paramount relevance, and the process can be strongly impacted
by the cloud contamination of a given landmark. This paper introduces a
complete pattern recognition methodology able to detect the presence of clouds
over landmarks using Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data. The methodology is
based on the ensemble combination of dedicated support vector machines (SVMs)
dependent on the particular landmark and illumination conditions. This
divide-and-conquer strategy is motivated by the data complexity and follows a
physically-based strategy that considers variability both in seasonality and
illumination conditions along the day to split observations. In addition, it
allows training the classification scheme with millions of samples at an
affordable computational costs. The image archive was composed of 200 landmark
test sites with near 7 million multispectral images that correspond to MSG
acquisitions during 2010. Results are analyzed in terms of cloud detection
accuracy and computational cost. We provide illustrative source code and a
portion of the huge training data to the community.

quantify, seriously complicates the normalization of comparative transcriptomic

currently neglected ingredient is essential for controlling gene network
multistability and therefore cellular differentiation. Basal expression is
correlated to the degree of chromatin loosening measured by DNA accessibility,
and systematically leads to cellular dedifferentiation as assessed by
transcriptomic signatures, irrespective of the molecular and cellular tools
used. Modeling gene network motifs formally involved in developmental
bifurcations, reveals that the epigenetic landscapes of Waddington are
restructured by the level of non specific expression, such that the attractors
of progenitor and differentiated cells can be mutually exclusive. This
mechanism is universal and holds beyond the particular nature of the genes
involved, provided the multistable circuits are correctly described with
autonomous basal expression. These results explain the relationships long
established between gene expression noise, chromatin decondensation and
cellular dedifferentiation, and highlight how heterochromatin maintenance is
essential for preventing pathological cellular reprogramming, age-related
diseases and cancer.

traditional computer vision techniques developed for electro-optical imagery
does not directly translate to the thermal domain due to two major reasons:
these algorithms require photometric assumptions to hold, and methods for
photometric calibration of RGB cameras cannot be applied to thermal-infrared
cameras due to difference in data acquisition and sensor phenomenology. In this
paper, we take a step in this direction, and introduce a novel algorithm for
online photometric calibration of thermal-infrared cameras. Our proposed method
does not require any specific driver/hardware support and hence can be applied
to any commercial off-the-shelf thermal IR camera. We present this in the
context of visual odometry and SLAM algorithms, and demonstrate the efficacy of
our proposed system through extensive experiments for both standard benchmark
datasets, and real-world field tests with a thermal-infrared camera in natural

  Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)",,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many species in nature demonstrate symbiotic relationships leading to
emergent behaviors through cooperation, which are sometimes beyond the scope of
the partnerships within the same species. These symbiotic relationships are
classified as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism based on the benefit
levels involved. While these partnerships are ubiquitous in nature, it is
imperative to understand the benefits of collective behaviors in designing
heterogeneous multi-robot systems (HMRS). In this paper, we investigate the
impact of heterogeneity on the performance of HMRS applied to a search and
rescue problem. The groups consisting of searchers and rescuers, varied in the
individual robot behaviors with multiple degrees of functionality overlap and
group compositions, demonstrating various levels of heterogeneity. We propose a
new technique to measure heterogeneity in the agents through the use of
Behavior Trees and use it to obtain heterogeneity informatics from our Monte
Carlo simulations. The results show a positive correlation between the group's
heterogeneity measure and the rescue efficiency demonstrating benefits in most
of the scenarios. However, we also see cases where heterogeneity may hamper the
group's abilities pointing to the need for determining the optimal
heterogeneity in group required to maximally benefit from HMRS in real-world
applications.

people in affected areas to migrate, to change their lifeways, and continuing
to affect demographic change throughout the world. Changes to the geographic
distribution of population will have dramatic impacts on land use and land
cover and thus constitute one of the major challenges of planning for climate
change scenarios. In this paper, we explore a generative model framework for
generating satellite imagery conditional on gridded population distributions.
We make additions to the existing ALAE architecture, creating a spatially
conditional version: SCALAE. This method allows us to explicitly disentangle
population from the model's latent space and thus input custom population
forecasts into the generated imagery. We postulate that such imagery could then
be directly used for land cover and land use change estimation using existing
frameworks, as well as for realistic visualisation of expected local change. We
evaluate the model by comparing pixel and semantic reconstructions, as well as
calculate the standard FID metric. The results suggest the model captures
population distributions accurately and delivers a controllable method to
generate realistic satellite imagery.
