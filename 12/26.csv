academic research community and other stakeholders such as technology companies

growth of ever-changing interdisciplinary areas, researchers need an efficient
way to identify important scholarly work. The number of citations a given
research publication has accrued has been used for this purpose, but these take
time to occur and longer to accumulate. In this article, we use altmetrics to
predict the short-term and long-term citations that a scholarly publication
could receive. We build various classification and regression models and
evaluate their performance, finding neural networks and ensemble models to
perform best for these tasks. We also find that Mendeley readership is the most
important factor in predicting the early citations, followed by other factors
such as the academic status of the readers (e.g., student, postdoc, professor),
followers on Twitter, online post length, author count, and the number of
mentions on Twitter, Wikipedia, and across different countries.

for low-latency edge RNN inference with batch size of 1. EdgeDRNN adopts the
spiking neural network inspired delta network algorithm to exploit temporal
sparsity in RNNs. Weights are stored in inexpensive DRAM which enables EdgeDRNN
to compute large multi-layer RNNs on the most inexpensive FPGA. The sparse
updates reduce DRAM weight memory access by a factor of up to 10x and the delta
can be varied dynamically to trade-off between latency and accuracy. EdgeDRNN
updates a 5 million parameter 2-layer GRU-RNN in about 0.5ms. It achieves
latency comparable with a 92W Nvidia 1080 GPU. It outperforms NVIDIA Jetson

performed by two independent methods, via analysis of the angular distribution

$\Xi\rightarrow\Lambda+\pi$, as well as by measuring the polarization of the

slightly larger than the inclusive $\Lambda$ polarization and in reasonable
agreement with a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). The $\langle P_\Xi

predicted in the model, increasing toward more peripheral collisions. The
global polarization of $\Omega$, $\langle P_\Omega \rangle = 1.11\pm0.87~({\rm

risks and benefits, feelings, and knowledge of AVs. This study aims to use
these factors to predict people's dispositional and initial learned trust in
AVs using a survey study conducted with 1175 participants. For each
participant, 23 features were extracted from the survey questions to capture
his or her knowledge, perception, experience, behavioral assessment, and
feelings about AVs. These features were then used as input to train an eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to predict trust in AVs. With the help of
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we were able to interpret the trust
predictions of XGBoost to further improve the explainability of the XGBoost
model. Compared to traditional regression models and black-box machine learning
models, our findings show that this approach was powerful in providing a high
level of explainability and predictability of trust in AVs, simultaneously.

a variety of attacks. One such attack is Typosquatting. Detecting this attack
is particularly important as it can be a threat to corporate secrets and can be
used to steal information or commit fraud. In this paper, a machine
learning-based approach is proposed to tackle the typosquatting vulnerability.
To that end, exploratory data analytics is first used to better understand the
trends observed in eight domain name-based extracted features. Furthermore, a
majority voting-based ensemble learning classifier built using five
classification algorithms is proposed that can detect suspicious domains with
high accuracy. Moreover, the observed trends are validated by studying the same
features in an unlabeled dataset using K-means clustering algorithm and through
applying the developed ensemble learning classifier. Results show that
legitimate domains have a smaller domain name length and fewer unique
characters. Moreover, the developed ensemble learning classifier performs
better in terms of accuracy, precision, and F-score. Furthermore, it is shown
that similar trends are observed when clustering is used. However, the number
of domains identified as potentially suspicious is high. Hence, the ensemble
learning classifier is applied with results showing that the number of domains
identified as potentially suspicious is reduced by almost a factor of five
while still maintaining the same trends in terms of features' statistics.

equivalent to designing the sequence of sensing beamformers to learn the angle

(DNN) that designs the adaptive sensing vectors sequentially based on the
available information so far at the base station (BS). By recognizing that the
AoA posterior distribution is a sufficient statistic for solving the initial
access problem, we use the posterior distribution as the input to the proposed
DNN for designing the adaptive sensing strategy. However, computing the
posterior distribution can be computationally challenging when the channel
fading coefficient is unknown. To address this issue, this paper proposes to
use an estimate of the fading coefficient to compute an approximation of the
posterior distribution. Further, this paper shows that the proposed DNN can
deal with practical beamforming constraints such as the constant modulus

adaptive and non-adaptive beamforming schemes, the proposed DNN-based adaptive

multi-server system is typically the sum of the service rates of individual

canceling them as soon as one copy finishes can boost the throughput,
especially when the service time distribution has high variability. This means
that redundancy can, in fact, create synergy among servers such that their
overall throughput is greater than the sum of individual servers. This work
seeks to find the fundamental limit of the throughput boost achieved by job
replication and the optimal replication policy to achieve it. While most
previous works consider upfront replication policies, we expand the set of
possible policies to delayed launch of replicas. The search for the optimal
adaptive replication policy can be formulated as a Markov Decision Process,
using which we propose two myopic replication policies, MaxRate and AdaRep, to

other policies, we derive upper bounds on the service capacity, which provide
fundamental limits on the throughput of queueing systems with redundancy.

that users at the cell boundaries achieve sufficient signal strength. The shape
and size of cells vary from BS to BS, since the large-scale signal propagation
conditions differ in different geographical regions. This work proposes and
studies a joint spatial-propagation (JSP) model, which considers the
correlation between cell radii and the large-scale signal propagation (captured
by shadowing). We first introduce the notion of the directional radius of
Voronoi cells, which has applications in cellular networks and beyond. The
directional radius of a cell is defined as the distance from the nucleus to the
cell boundary at an angle relative to the direction of a uniformly random
location in the cell. We study the distribution of the radii in two types of
cells in the Poisson Voronoi tessellations: the zero-cell, which contains the
origin, and the typical cell. The results are applied to analyze the JSP model.
We show that, even though the Poisson point process (PPP) is often considered
as a pessimistic spatial model for BS locations, the JSP model with the PPP
achieves coverage performance close to the most optimistic one -- the standard
triangular lattice model. Further, we show that the network performance depends
critically on the variance of the large-scale path loss along the cell
boundary.

comprehensive picture of topological phases and topological phase transitions
in cold magnetized plasmas is still missing. Here we systematically map out all
the topological phases and establish the bulk-edge correspondence in cold
magnetized plasmas. We find that for the linear eigenmodes, there are 10
topological phases in the parameter space of density $n$, magnetic field $B$,
and parallel wavenumber $k_{z}$, separated by the surfaces of Langmuir wave-L
wave resonance, Langmuir wave-cyclotron wave resonance, and zero magnetic
field. For fixed $B$ and $k_{z}$, only the phase transition at the Langmuir
wave-cyclotron wave resonance corresponds to edge modes. A sufficient and
necessary condition for the existence of this type of edge modes is given and
verified by numerical solutions. We demonstrate that edge modes exist not only
on a plasma-vacuum interface but also on more general plasma-plasma interfaces.

terms of topological theories. Using the analogy between knot diagrams and
quantum amplitudes we calculate the transmission coefficients of the concept
topological quantum devices that realize the knot topology. We observe that the
problem is in different ways similar to that of transmission on quantum graphs.
The desired transmission or filtering properties can be attained by the
variation of the topology of the device, or an external parameter, which in our
model controls the topological phase. One interesting property of the
transmission coefficients is the existence of ""self-averaging"" phases, in which
the value of the transmission coefficient is independent from all the
representatives in a chosen family of knots. We briefly discuss physical
realizations of the concept devices.

Similarly, research studies often collect multimodal imaging data, each of
which can provide shared and unique information. This observation motivated the
design of powerful multimodal self-supervised representation-learning
algorithms. In this paper, we unify recent work on multimodal self-supervised
learning under a single framework. Observing that most self-supervised methods
optimize similarity metrics between a set of model components, we propose a
taxonomy of all reasonable ways to organize this process. We first evaluate
models on toy multimodal MNIST datasets and then apply them to a multimodal
neuroimaging dataset with Alzheimer's disease patients. We find that (1)
multimodal contrastive learning has significant benefits over its unimodal
counterpart, (2) the specific composition of multiple contrastive objectives is
critical to performance on a downstream task, (3) maximization of the
similarity between representations has a regularizing effect on a neural
network, which can sometimes lead to reduced downstream performance but still
reveal multimodal relations. Results show that the proposed approach
outperforms previous self-supervised encoder-decoder methods based on canonical
correlation analysis (CCA) or the mixture-of-experts multimodal variational
autoEncoder (MMVAE) on various datasets with a linear evaluation protocol.
Importantly, we find a promising solution to uncover connections between
modalities through a jointly shared subspace that can help advance work in our

effective approach for improving the robustness of the deep neural networks.
However, PGD AT has been shown to suffer from two main limitations: i) high
computational cost, and ii) extreme overfitting during training that leads to
reduction in model generalization. While the effect of factors such as model
capacity and scale of training data on adversarial robustness have been
extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the effect of a very
important parameter in every network optimization on adversarial robustness:
the learning rate. In particular, we hypothesize that effective learning rate
scheduling during adversarial training can significantly reduce the overfitting
issue, to a degree where one does not even need to adversarially train a model
from scratch but can instead simply adversarially fine-tune a pre-trained
model. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet very effective
adversarial fine-tuning approach based on a $\textit{slow start, fast decay}$
learning rate scheduling strategy which not only significantly decreases
computational cost required, but also greatly improves the accuracy and
robustness of a deep neural network. Experimental results show that the
proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets in both test accuracy and
the robustness, while reducing the computational cost by 8-10$\times$.
Furthermore, a very important benefit of the proposed adversarial fine-tuning
approach is that it enables the ability to improve the robustness of any
pre-trained deep neural network without needing to train the model from

demonstrated in research literature.

essential to obtain key information on many aspects of the explosion processes

has been largely improved thanks to multi-dimensional models describing the
long-term evolution from the SN to the SNR as well as to observational data of
growing quality and quantity across the electromagnetic spectrum which allow to
constrain the models. Here we used the numerical resources obtained in the

core-collapse to the full-fledged SNR at the age of 2000 years. Our simulations
were compared with observations of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) at the age of $\sim

from the polarization degree of freedom can be synthesized by means of applying
crossed electric and magnetic fields. The appearance of the gauge potential can
be ascribed to the motional (magneto-electric) Stark effect which is
responsible for the presence of a linear-in-momentum contribution to the
exciton kinetic energy. We study the interplay of this phenomenon with the
competing effect which arises from the Rabi-splitting renormalization due the
reduction of the electron-hole overlap for a moving exciton. Accounting for
this mechanism is crucial in the structures with the high ratio of Rabi
splitting and the exciton binding energy. Besides, we propose an approach which
boosts the gauge field in the considered system. It takes advantage of the
crossover from the hydrogen-like exciton to the strongly dipole-polarized
exciton state at a specific choice of electric and magnetic fields. The strong
sensitivity of the exciton energy to the momentum in this regime leads to the
large values of the gauge field. We consider the specific example of a GaAs
ring-shape polariton Berry phase interferometer and show that the flux of the
effective magnetic field may approach the flux quantum value in the considered
crossover regime.

increases. Making the best use of the convexity region, our method starts
training with an extensive RSI, gradually reduces it, and switches to the RAE
as soon as the RAE is numerically feasible. After training converges, the
resultant deep learning machine is expected to be inside the attraction basin
of a global minimum of the cross-entropy loss. Numerical results are provided

this paper, we try to solve this problem in terms of throughput maximization

extereme flow decomposition technique, which facilitates the design and
analysis of approximation and online algorithms. For the offline scenario, we
develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) which can find a
$(1+\omega )$-approximation solution for any specified $\omega>0$. For the
online scenario, we develop an online primal-dual algorithm which proves
$O(1)$-competitive and violates link capacities by a factor of $O(\log m)$,
where $m$ is the link number. The proposed algorithms share an elegant
primal-dual form and thereby have inherent advantages of simplicity,
efficiency, and scalability. To better understand the advantages of the
extereme flow decomposition approach, we devise delicate numerical examples on
an extended butterfly network. We validate the effects of algorithmic
parameters and make an interesting comparison between the proposed FPTAS and

formation and evolution of the Solar System, planetary systems in general, and
Neptune's early orbital history in particular. The problem is best addressed by
forward modeling where different initial conditions and Neptune's orbital
evolutions are tested, and the model predictions are compared to orbits of
known Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). It has previously been established that
Neptune radially migrated, by gravitationally interacting with an outer disk of
planetesimals, from the original radial distance r < 25 au to its current orbit
at 30 au. Here we show that the migration models with a very low orbital
eccentricity of Neptune e_N < 0.05 do not explain KBOs with semimajor axes 50 <
a < 60 au, perihelion distances q > 35 au and inclinations i < 10 deg. If e_N <
0.05 at all times, the Kozai cycles control the implantation process and the
orbits with q > 35 au end up having, due to the angular momentum's z-component
conservation, i > 10 deg. Better results are obtained when Neptune's
eccentricity is excited to e_N ~ 0.1 and subsequently damped by dynamical
friction. The low-e & low-i orbits at 50-60 au are produced in this model when
KBOs are lifted from the scattered disk by secular cycles -- mainly the apsidal
resonance nu_8 -- near various mean motion resonances. These results give
support to a (mild) dynamical instability that presumably excited the orbits of
giant planets during Neptune's early migration.

particle physics. At low recoil energies, this capability may be used to
confirm the cosmological origin of a dark matter signal, to penetrate the
so-called neutrino floor, or to distinguish between different neutrino sources.
Gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) can enable directional recoil detection if
the readout granularity is sufficiently high, as is the case when micro-pattern
gaseous detectors (MPGDs) are utilized. A key challenge in such detectors is
identifying and rejecting background electron recoil events caused by gamma
rays from radioactive contaminants in the detector materials and the
environment. We define new observables that can distinguish electron and
nuclear recoils, even at keV-scale energies, based on the simulated
ionization's topology. We perform a simulation study that shows these
observables outperform the traditionally used discriminant, dE/dx, by up to
three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, these new observables work well even at
ionization energies well below 10 keV and remain robust even in the regime
where directionality fails.

a compact localized state governed by local integrals of motion (LIOMs), which
are to be obtained explicitly. In this work, we clarify the dynamical aspects
of FMBL. We first study dynamics of two-particles, and find that the states are
not substantially modified by weak interactions, but the periodic time
evolution of entanglement entropy emerges as a result of a specific mechanism
inherent in the system. On the other hand, as the strength of the interactions
is increased, the modification of the states takes place with inducing
instability of the LIOMs. Furthermore, many-body dynamics of the system at
finite fillings is numerically investigated by time-evolving block decimation
(TEBD) method. For a suitable choice of the filling, non-thermal and low
entangled dynamics appears. This behavior is a typical example of the

attention method first concentrates on the whole image, and then focuses on
local specific objects in the image. We also propose a joint max-margin

should be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and
vertically. This function can further improve our multi-label image

represented by a Partial Derivative Equation (PDE), is proved within an
approximation error inversely proportional to the number of users. Global
convergence to the equilibrium of the PDE, i.e., stationary AoI distribution,
is also proved. Based on this framework, it is shown that an existing AoI lower
bound in the literature is in fact asymptotically tight, and a simple threshold
policy, with the thresholds explicitly derived, achieves the optimum
asymptotically. The proposed threshold-based policy is also much easier to
decentralize than the widely-known index-based policies which require comparing
user indices. To showcase the usability of the framework, we also use it to
analyze the average non-linear AoI functions (with power and logarithm forms)

derived, and average age functions proven. Simulation results show that even
when the number of users is limited, e.g., $10$, the proposed policy and

be misinterpreted as shadows due to different reasons such as low image

been a topic of interest in recent years. Here, we propose an automatic
diagnosis system to detect dental caries in Panoramic images for the first
time, to the best of authors' knowledge. The proposed model benefits from
various pretrained deep learning models through transfer learning to extract
relevant features from x-rays and uses a capsule network to draw prediction
results. On a dataset of 470 Panoramic images used for features extraction,
including 240 labeled images for classification, our model achieved an accuracy
score of 86.05\% on the test set. The obtained score demonstrates acceptable
detection performance and an increase in caries detection speed, as long as the
challenges of using Panoramic x-rays of real patients are taken into account.
Among images with caries lesions in the test set, our model acquired recall
scores of 69.44\% and 90.52\% for mild and severe ones, confirming the fact
that severe caries spots are more straightforward to detect and efficient mild
caries detection needs a more robust and larger dataset. Considering the

One of the most widely cited economic indicator is consumer confidence index

disappeared when those models were tested with newer data according to a recent
comprehensive survey. In this work, we revisit this problem of assessing the
true potential of using social media data to measure CCI, by proposing a robust
non-parametric Bayesian modeling framework grounded in Gaussian Process
Regression (which provides both an estimate and an uncertainty associated with
it). Integral to our framework is a principled experimentation methodology that
demonstrates how digital data can be employed to reduce the frequency of
surveys, and thus periodic polling would be needed only to calibrate our model.
Via extensive experimentation we show how the choice of different
micro-decisions, such as the smoothing interval, various types of lags etc.
have an important bearing on the results. By using decadal data (2008-2019)
from Reddit, we show that both monthly and daily estimates of CCI can, indeed,
be reliably estimated at least several months in advance, and that our model
estimates are far superior to those generated by the existing methods.

contexts (e.g., misclassification of objects in roads leads to serious
accidents). Unlike Bayesian NN that indirectly infer uncertainty through weight
uncertainties, evidential NNs (ENNs) have been recently proposed to explicitly
model the uncertainty of class probabilities and use them for classification
tasks. An ENN offers the formulation of the predictions of NNs as subjective
opinions and learns the function by collecting an amount of evidence that can
form the subjective opinions by a deterministic NN from data. However, the ENN
is trained as a black box without explicitly considering inherent uncertainty
in data with their different root causes, such as vacuity (i.e., uncertainty

combines Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with ENNs to jointly
train a model with prior knowledge of a certain class, which has high vacuity

  Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification","14 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1109/TIP.2021.3104169",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (re-ID) is a
challenging task due to the missing of labels for the target domain data. To
handle this problem, some recent works adopt clustering algorithms to off-line
generate pseudo labels, which can then be used as the supervision signal for
on-line feature learning in the target domain. However, the off-line generated
labels often contain lots of noise that significantly hinders the
discriminability of the on-line learned features, and thus limits the final UDA
re-ID performance. To this end, we propose a novel approach, called
Dual-Refinement, that jointly refines pseudo labels at the off-line clustering
phase and features at the on-line training phase, to alternatively boost the
label purity and feature discriminability in the target domain for more
reliable re-ID. Specifically, at the off-line phase, a new hierarchical
clustering scheme is proposed, which selects representative prototypes for
every coarse cluster. Thus, labels can be effectively refined by using the
inherent hierarchical information of person images. Besides, at the on-line
phase, we propose an instant memory spread-out (IM-spread-out) regularization,
that takes advantage of the proposed instant memory bank to store sample
features of the entire dataset and enable spread-out feature learning over the
entire training data instantly. Our Dual-Refinement method reduces the
influence of noisy labels and refines the learned features within the
alternative training process. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

  Fourier-transformation Approach","29 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel, rigorous and simple Fourier-transformation
approach to study resonances in a perfectly conducting slab with finite number
of subwavelength slits of width $h\ll 1$. Since regions outside the slits are
variable separated, by Fourier transforming the governing equation, we could
express field in the outer regions in terms of field derivatives on the
aperture. Next, in each slit where variable separation is still available, wave
field could be expressed as a Fourier series in terms of a countable basis
functions with unknown Fourier coefficients. Finally, by matching field on the
aperture, we establish a linear system of infinite number of equations
governing the countable Fourier coefficients. By carefully asymptotic analysis
of each entry of the coefficient matrix, we rigorously show that, by removing
only a finite number of rows and columns, the resulting principle sub-matrix is
diagonally dominant so that the infinite dimensional linear system can be
reduced to a finite dimensional linear system. Resonance frequencies are
exactly those frequencies making the linear system rank-deficient. This in turn
provides a simple, asymptotic formula describing resonance frequencies with
accuracy ${\cal O}(h^3\log h)$. We emphasize that such a formula is more
accurate than all existing results and is the first accurate result especially
for slits of number more than two to our best knowledge. Moreover, this
asymptotic formula rigorously confirms a fact that the imaginary part of
resonance frequencies is always ${\cal O}(h)$ no matter how we place the slits
as long as they are spaced by distances independent of width $h$.

properties of these outstretched planetary systems is important to understand
and discern various planet formation and evolution scenarios. We present the
stellar parameters and metallicity ([Fe/H]) for a subsample of 18 stars known
to host planets discovered by the direct imaging technique. We retrieved the
high-resolution spectra for these stars from public archives and used the
synthetic spectral fitting technique and Bayesian analysis to determine the

metallicities of stars hosting directly imaged planets are close to solar with
a mean [Fe/H] = $-0.04\pm0.27$~dex. The large scatter in metallicity suggests
that a metal-rich environment may not be necessary to form massive planets at

essential task in computer-aided orthodontic surgical planning. To date, deep
learning based methods have been popularly used to handle this task.
State-of-the-art methods directly concatenate the raw attributes of 3D inputs,
namely coordinates and normal vectors of mesh cells, to train a single-stream
network for fully-automated tooth segmentation. This, however, has the drawback
of ignoring the different geometric meanings provided by those raw attributes.
This issue might possibly confuse the network in learning discriminative
geometric features and result in many isolated false predictions on the dental
model. Against this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network
(TSGCNet) to learn multi-view geometric information from different geometric
attributes. Our TSGCNet adopts two graph-learning streams, designed in an
input-aware fashion, to extract more discriminative high-level geometric
representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These
feature representations learned from the designed two different streams are
further fused to integrate the multi-view complementary information for the
cell-wise dense prediction task. We evaluate our proposed TSGCNet on a

bracket on a Hamiltonian function. The Hamiltonian function is a constant of
motion (the energy) of the system. The properties of the Poisson bracket are
encapsulated in the symplectic 2-form, a closed second order differential form.
Due to closure, the symplectic 2-form is preserved by the Hamiltonian flow, and
it assigns an invariant (Liouville) measure on the phase space through the
Lie-Darboux theorem. In this paper we propose a generalization of classical
Hamiltonian mechanics to a three-dimensional phase space: the classical Poisson
bracket is replaced with a generalized Poisson bracket acting on a pair of
Hamiltonian functions, while the symplectic 2-form is replaced by a symplectic
3-form. We show that, using the closure of the symplectic 3-form, a result
analogous to the classical Lie-Darboux theorem holds: locally, there exist
smooth coordinates such that the components of the symplectic 3-form are
constants, and the phase space is endowed with a preserved volume element.
Furthermore, as in the classical theory, the Jacobi identity for the
generalized Poisson bracket mathematically expresses the closure of the
associated symplectic form. As a consequence, constant skew-symmetric third
order contravariant tensors always define generalized Poisson brackets. This is
in contrast with generalizations of Hamiltonian mechanics postulating the
fundamental identity as replacement for the Jacobi identity. In particular, we
find that the fundamental identity represents a stronger requirement than the
closure of the symplectic 3-form.

randomized experiments, the traditional approach has been based on the Stable
Unit Treatment Value (SUTVA: \cite{rubin}) assumption which dictates that there
is no interference between individuals. However, the SUTVA assumption fails to
hold in many applications due to social interaction, general equilibrium,
and/or externality effects. While much progress has been made in relaxing the
SUTVA assumption, most of this literature has only considered a setting with
perfect compliance to treatment assignment. In practice, however, noncompliance
occurs frequently where the actual treatment receipt is different from the
assignment to the treatment. In this paper, we study causal effects in
randomized experiments with network interference and noncompliance. Spillovers
are allowed to occur at both treatment choice stage and outcome realization
stage. In particular, we explicitly model treatment choices of agents as a
binary game of incomplete information where resulting equilibrium treatment
choice probabilities affect outcomes of interest. Outcomes are further
characterized by a random coefficient model to allow for general unobserved
heterogeneity in the causal effects. After defining our causal parameters of
interest, we propose a simple control function estimator and derive its
asymptotic properties under large-network asymptotics. We apply our methods to

stars present in the cluster. We have identified a new extreme horizontal

BaSTI isochrones with cluster parameters, $[Fe/H] = -1.8$ dex and age $= 12.0$
Gyr on the V $-$ I vs V CMD. Interestingly, only the EHB star and blue
horizontal branch stars (BHBs) among the UV-bright hot sources are detected in
FUV filters of UVIT. We have derived the effective temperature of BHBs using
color-temperature relation and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
multi-band filters, which are in the range from 8,000 K to 10,500 K. We find a
variation of He abundance of BHBs by fitting the BaSTI ZAHB. The range in the
He abundance of the BHBs corresponding to the best fit isochrones is 0.247 to
0.350. We have estimated various physical parameters of the newly identified
EHB star in the cluster using SED fit and post-HB evolutionary tracks. We have
studied the radial distribution of all the sources of the cluster detected in

beyond the tidal radius (9.2$'$) of the cluster.

significant scientific interest. In this paper, we review how these prolonged
solar activity minima have been identified. In particular, we focus on the
Dalton Minimum, which is named after John Dalton. We review Dalton's scientific
achievements, particularly in geophysics. Special emphasis is placed on his
lifelong observations of auroral displays over approximately five decades in
Great Britain. Dalton's observations for the auroral frequency allowed him to
notice the scarcity of auroral displays in the early 19th century. We analyze
temporal variations in the annual frequency of such displays from a modern
perspective. The contemporary geomagnetic positions of Dalton's observational
site make his dataset extremely valuable because his site is located in the
sub-auroral zone and is relatively sensitive to minor enhancements in solar
eruptions and solar wind streams. His data indicate clear solar cycles in the
early 19th century and their significant depression from 1798 to 1824.
Additionally, his data reveal a significant spike in auroral frequency in 1797,
which chronologically coincides with the ""lost cycle"" that is believed to have
occurred at the end of Solar Cycle 4. Therefore, John Dalton's achievements can
still benefit modern science and help us improve our understanding of the
Dalton Minimum.

then the automated ranking algorithm is explained. In this algorithm, the SI is
computed for the target dataset which passes from the feature extracting parts

pre-trained DNNs are ranked, easily. In this ranking method, the best DNN makes
maximum SI on the target dataset and a few pre-trained DNNs may be rejected in

of swarm robotics, sociobiology, and social dynamics, several types of local
pairwise interactions were proposed and analysed leading to spatial gathering

interaction at encounters that leads to agreement or geometric alignment in
swarms of simple agents, and analyse the process of converging to consensus.
Consider a group of agents whose ""states"" evolve in time by pairwise
interactions: the state of an agent is either a real value (a randomly
initialised position within an interval) or a vector that is either
unconstrained (e.g. the location of the agent in the plane) or constrained to
have unit length (e.g. the direction of the agent's motion). The interactions
are doubly stochastic, in the sense that, at discrete time steps, pairs of
agents are randomly selected and their new states are independently and
uniformly set at random in (local) domains or intervals defined by the states
of the interacting pair. We show that such processes lead, in finite expected
time (measured by the number of interactions that occurred) to agreement in
case of unconstrained states and alignment when the states are unit vectors.

owing to their exotic properties. In realistic two-dimensional materials,
Kitaev interaction is often accompanied by the Dzyloshinskii-Moriya
interaction, which poses a challenge of distinguishing their magnitude
separately. In this work, we demonstrate that it can be done by accessing
magnonic transport properties. By studying honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions simultaneously, we reveal
non-trivial magnonic topological properties accompanied by intricate magnonic
transport characteristics as given by thermal Hall and magnon Nernst effects.
We also investigate the effect of a magnetic field, showing that it does not
only break the symmetry of the system but also brings drastic modifications to
magnonic topological transport properties, which serve as hallmarks of the
relative strength of anisotropic exchange interactions. Based on our findings,
we suggest strategies to estimate the importance of Kitaev interactions in real
materials.

data while ensuring good generalization to novel classes. Existing literature
makes use of vast amounts of annotated data by simply shifting the label
requirement from novel classes to base classes. Since data annotation is
time-consuming and costly, reducing the label requirement even further is an
important goal. To that end, our paper presents a more challenging few-shot
setting where no label access is allowed during training or testing. By
leveraging self-supervision for learning image representations and image
similarity for classification at test time, we achieve competitive baselines
while using \textbf{zero} labels, which is at least fewer labels than
state-of-the-art. We hope that this work is a step towards developing few-shot
learning methods which do not depend on annotated data at all. Our code will be

for every atomic von Neumann algebra (not necessarily $\sigma$-finite) the
restriction of the order topology to bounded parts of $M$ coincides with the
restriction of the $\sigma$-strong topology $s(M,M_\ast)$. We recall that the

special-relativistic form in any local inertial frame, lies at the core of
General Relativity. Because of its fundamental status, this principle could be
a very powerful guide in formulating physical laws at regimes where both
gravitational and quantum effects are relevant. However, its formulation
implicitly presupposes that reference frames are abstracted from classical
systems (rods and clocks) and that the spacetime background is well defined. It
is unclear if it continues to hold when quantum systems, which can be in a
quantum relationship with other physical systems, are taken as reference
frames, and in a superposition of classical spacetime structures. Here, we
tackle both questions by introducing a relational formalism to describe quantum
systems in a superposition of curved spacetimes. We build a unitary
transformation to the quantum reference frame (QRF) of a quantum system in
curved spacetime, and in a superposition thereof. In both cases, a QRF can be
found such that the metric looks locally minkowskian. Hence, one cannot
distinguish, with a local measurement, if the spacetime is flat or curved, or
in a superposition of such spacetimes. This transformation identifies a Quantum
Local Inertial Frame. We also find a spacetime path-integral encoding the
dynamics of a quantum particle in spacetime and show that the state of a freely
falling particle can be expressed as an infinite sum of all possible classical
geodesics. We then build the QRF transformation to the Fermi normal coordinates
of such freely falling quantum particle and show that the metric is locally
minkowskian. These results extend the Principle of Equivalence to QRFs in a
superposition of gravitational fields. Verifying this principle may pave a
fruitful path to establishing solid conceptual grounds for a future theory of
quantum gravity.

computing system residing in a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN). Specifically,
job dispatchers are implemented on access points (APs) which collect jobs from
mobile users and distribute each job to a server at the edge or the cloud. A
signaling mechanism with periodic broadcast is introduced to facilitate
cooperation among APs. The transmission latency is non-negligible in MAN, which
leads to outdated information sharing among APs. Moreover, the fully-observed
system state is discouraged as reception of all broadcast is time consuming.
Therefore, we formulate the distributed optimization of job dispatching
strategies among the APs as a Markov decision process with partial and outdated
system state, i.e., partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The
conventional solution for POMDP is impractical due to huge time complexity. We
propose a novel low-complexity solution framework for distributed job
dispatching, based on which the optimization of job dispatching policy can be
decoupled via an alternative policy iteration algorithm, so that the
distributed policy iteration of each AP can be made according to partial and
outdated observation. A theoretical performance lower bound is proved for our
approximate MDP solution. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations based
on the Google Cluster trace. The evaluation results show that our policy can
achieve as high as $20.67\%$ reduction in average job response time compared
with heuristic baselines, and our algorithm consistently performs well under

characterizing topological orders. In this paper, we provide a
field-theoretical approach towards a complete list of mutually compatible
braiding phases of topological orders in (3+1)D spacetime. More concretely,
considering a discrete gauge group as input data, topological excitations in
this paper are bosonic \particles carrying gauge charges and loops carrying
gauge fluxes. Among these excitations, there are three classes of root braiding
processes: particle-loop braidings (i.e., the familiar Aharonov-Bohm phase of
winding an electric charge around a thin magnetic solenoid), multi-loop
braidings [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 080403 (2014)], and particle-loop-loop
braidings [i.e., Borromean Rings braiding in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 061601
(2018)]. A naive way to exhaust all topological orders is to arbitrarily
combine these root braiding processes. Surprisingly, we find that there exist
illegitimate combinations in which certain braiding phases cannot coexist,
i.e., are mutually incompatible. Thus, the resulting topological orders are
illegitimate and must be excluded. It is not obvious to identify these
illegitimate combinations. But with the help of the powerful (3+1)D topological
quantum field theories (TQFTs), we find that illegitimate combinations violate
gauge invariance. In this way, we are able to obtain all sets of mutually
compatible braiding phases and all legitimate topological orders. To
illustrate, we work out all details when gauge groups are
$\mathbb{Z}_{N_1},\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2},\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_3}$,

networks with low bit-width weights and activations. First, to obtain low
bit-width weights, most existing methods obtain the quantized weights by
performing quantization on the full-precision network weights. However, this
approach would result in some mismatch: the gradient descent updates
full-precision weights, but it does not update the quantized weights. To
address this issue, we propose a novel method that enables {direct} updating of
quantized weights {with learnable quantization levels} to minimize the cost
function using gradient descent. Second, to obtain low bit-width activations,
existing works consider all channels equally. However, the activation
quantizers could be biased toward a few channels with high-variance. To address
this issue, we propose a method to take into account the quantization errors of
individual channels. With this approach, we can learn activation quantizers
that minimize the quantization errors in the majority of channels. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art

learning by considering both background and foreground balance comprehensively.
This work aims to address imbalance problem in the situation of using a general
unbalanced data of non-extreme distribution not including few shot and the
focal loss for anchor free object detector. We use a batch-wise alpha-balanced
variant of the focal loss to deal with this imbalance problem elaborately. It
is a simple and practical solution using only re-weighting for general
unbalanced data. It does require neither additional learning cost nor
structural change during inference and grouping classes is also unnecessary.
Through extensive experiments, we show the performance improvement for each

The oriented chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $G$
permits an oriented $r$-coloring.
  In this paper we consider the Oriented Chromatic Number problem on classes of
recursively defined oriented graphs. Oriented co-graphs (short for oriented
complement reducible graphs) can be recursively defined defined from the single
vertex graph by applying the disjoint union and order composition. This
recursive structure allows to compute an optimal oriented coloring and the
oriented chromatic number in linear time. We generalize this result using the
concept of perfect orderable graphs. Therefore, we show that for acyclic
transitive digraphs every greedy coloring along a topological ordering leads to
an optimal oriented coloring. Msp-digraphs (short for minimal series-parallel
digraphs) can be defined from the single vertex graph by applying the parallel
composition and series composition. We prove an upper bound of $7$ for the

this is bound best possible. We apply this bound and the recursive structure of
msp-digraphs to obtain a linear time solution for computing the oriented
chromatic number of msp-digraphs.

nodes/links typically represent critical elements/communication links that play
a key role in a system's performance. However, a majority of the methods
available in the literature on the identification of critical nodes/links are
based on an iterative approach that explores each node/link of a graph at a
time, repeating for all nodes/links in the graph. Such methods suffer from high
computational complexity and the resulting analysis is also network-specific.
To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a scalable and generic
graph neural network (GNN) based framework for identifying critical nodes/links
in large complex networks. The proposed framework defines a GNN based model
that learns the node/link criticality score on a small representative subset of
nodes/links. An appropriately trained model can be employed to predict the
scores of unseen nodes/links in large graphs and consequently identify the most
critical ones. The scalability of the framework is demonstrated through
prediction of nodes/links scores in large scale synthetic and real-world
networks. The proposed approach is fairly accurate in approximating the
criticality scores and offers a significant computational advantage over
conventional approaches.

byte-addressable persistent storage with a load/store interface. However,
programming applications to directly manipulate NVM data is complex and
error-prone. Applications generally employ libraries that hide the low-level
details of the hardware and provide a transactional programming model to
achieve crash-consistency. Furthermore, applications continue to expect
correctness during concurrent executions, achieved through the use of
synchronization. To achieve this, applications seek well-known ACID guarantees.
However, realizing this presents designers of transactional systems with a
range of choices in how to combine several low-level techniques, given target
hardware features and workload characteristics.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of
combining existing crash-consistency and synchronization methods for achieving
performant and correct NVM transactional systems. We consider different
hardware characteristics, in terms of support for hardware transactional memory
(HTM) and the boundaries of the persistence domain (transient or persistent
caches). By characterizing persistent transactional systems in terms of their
properties, we make it possible to better understand the tradeoffs of different
implementations and to arrive at better design choices for providing ACID
guarantees. We use both real hardware with Intel Optane DC persistent memory
and simulation to evaluate a persistent version of hardware transactional
memory, a persistent version of software transactional memory, and undo/redo
logging. Through our empirical study, we show two major factors that impact the
cost of supporting persistence in transactional systems: the persistence domain
(transient or persistent caches) and application characteristics, such as
transaction size and parallelism.

the enhancement of graph (system) robustness and characterize crucial factors

are based on an iterative approach that explores each node/link of a graph.
These methods suffer from high computational complexity and the resulting
analysis is network specific. Additionally, uncertainty associated with the
underlying graphical model further limits the potential value of these

computationally efficient and systematically incorporates uncertainties.
Instead of utilizing the observed graph for training the model, a MAP estimate

Further, a Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout algorithm is incorporated to account for
the epistemic uncertainty. The fidelity and the gain in computational

first to combine a network form representing the players who are playing with
the use of a hidden Markov model to mine the network and generate the desired

improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN
to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More
specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the

thrust augmentation in starting jets over steady jets and a few pulsed jet

study has been conducted to confirm the nozzle exit over-pressure effect. In
this paper, thrust and nozzle exit pressure are numerically investigated under
different jet velocity programs (negative slope (NS), positive slope (PS) and
impulsive). Starting jets are generated for fluid slug length to diameter (L/D)
ratios of 2-5 at each jet velocity program. In contradiction to the findings
presented in [P. Krueger and M. Gharib, J. Phys. Fluids, 15, 1271 (2003)] the
results in this paper reveal that the time-averaged thrust due to nozzle exit
pressure in starting jets from a tube nozzle is negligible or negative
resulting in no thrust augmentation when compared to steady jets with
hypothetical identical velocity programs. Also, nozzle exit experiences both
over-pressure and under-pressure in accelerating and decelerating portions of
jet velocity programs respectively in both NS and PS velocity programs.
Furthermore, it is found that secondary counter-rotating vortex is generated
during decelerating portion of jet velocity programs which may be linked to the
nozzle exit underpressure explaining the reduced thrust during starting jets
generated by different velocity programs.

constructed. With the application of such limiter to the over-intersection
based remapping framework, a low dissipation remapping method has been proposed
that can be applied to the existing ALE method.

  Optical Properties of ITO Thin Film Layer","32 pages, 18 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Here we report on studying the electronic and optical material properties of
the technologically-relevant material indium tin oxide (ITO) as a function of
thermal annealing. In this work, ITO powder has been prepared utilizing
solid-state reaction methods. An electron beam gun technology has been used to
prepare a ITO film (325 nm). The ITO window layer has been investigated at
various temperatures. The effects of absolute temperature on the structural,
optical, and electrical properties of the prepared ITO thin film layer are
investigated. The energy band type corresponding to the orbital transitions has
been determined, and the energies of the orbital transitions have been
calculated in the Tauc region, HOMO/LUMO gap, and charge transfer gap. In
additions, the exciton and Urbach energies have been computed. It has been
found that these energies increase with increasing the annealing temperature,
except for Urbach's energies which behave differently. Thin-film quality
coefficient, surface resistance, and thermal emission in addition to the angle
of refraction as a function of wavelength, have been determined.
