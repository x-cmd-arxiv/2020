multidimensional integrals for Bayesian inference. Population Monte Carlo (PMC)
is an important class of Monte Carlo methods, which utilizes a population of
proposals to generate weighted samples that approximate the target
distribution. The generic PMC framework iterates over three steps: samples are
simulated from a set of proposals, weights are assigned to such samples to
correct for mismatch between the proposal and target distributions, and the
proposals are then adapted via resampling from the weighted samples. When the
target distribution is expensive to evaluate, the PMC has its computational
limitation since the convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. To address
this, we propose in this paper a new Population Quasi-Monte Carlo (PQMC)
framework, which integrates Quasi-Monte Carlo ideas within the sampling and
adaptation steps of PMC. A key novelty in PQMC is the idea of importance
support points resampling, a deterministic method for finding an ""optimal""
subsample from the weighted proposal samples. Moreover, within the PQMC
framework, we develop an efficient covariance adaptation strategy for
multivariate normal proposals. Lastly, a new set of correction weights is
introduced for the weighted PMC estimator to improve the efficiency from the
standard PMC estimator. We demonstrate the improved empirical convergence of
PQMC over PMC in extensive numerical simulations and a friction drilling
application.

retrieval via lifting approach to connect affine phase retrieval with
multi-block convex optimization, and then based on the proposed inertial

various fascinating features, pointing to a strong potential for the
advancement of concepts in this field. In particular, the rare-earth ions play
a direct decisive role unlike in many other well known multiferroic materials
and there appears to be a critical canting angle, developing below TN2,
subtended by Tb 4f and Ni 3d moments to trigger this cross coupling phenomenon.
However, for a small replacement of Sr for Ba, viz. in Tb2Ba0.9Sr0.1NiO5,
ferroelectricity was reported to get destroyed, but retaining magnetic features
at (TN1) 55 K and (TN2) 14 K. In this article, we address the origin of
suppression of multiferrocity in this Sr doped system through neutron
diffraction studies and density functional theory calculations. We find that,
unlike in Tb2BaNiO5, there is no pronounced change in the relative canting
angle of the magnetic moments around TN2 and that the absolute value of this
parameter down to 2 K fails to exceed the critical value noted for the parent,
thereby explaining the origin of destruction of magnetoelectric coupling in the
Sr doped material. This finding renders strong support to the proposal of
possible existence of critical canting angle, at least in some cases, to induce
multiferroicity, apart from serving as a route to engineer multiferroic
materials for applications.

flux using three FTS atlases and the HARPS atlas and also in spectra of 13
stars using observation data on the HARPS spectrograph. To reduce observation
noise individual line bisectors of each star have been averaged. The obtained
average bisectors in the stellar spectra are more or less similar to the shape
C well known to the Sun. In stars with rotation speeds greater than 5 km/s the
shape of the bisectors is more like /. The curvature and span of the bisectors
increase with the temperature of the star. Our results confirm the known facts
about strong influence of rotation velocity on the span and shape of bisectors.
The average convective speed was determined based on the span of the average
bisector, which shows the largest difference between the velocity of cold
falling and hot rising convective flows of the matter. It's equal to -420 m/s
for the Sun as a star. In solar-type stars, it grows from -150 to -700 m/s with
an effective temperature of 4800 to 6200 K, respectively. For stars with
greater surface gravity and greater metallicity, the average convective
velocity decreases. It also decreases with star age and correlates with the
speed of micro and macroturbulent movements. The results of solar flux analysis
showed that absolute wavelength scales in the FTS atlases used coincide with an
accuracy of about -10 m/s, except for the atlas of Hinkle, etc., whose scale is
shifted and depends on the wavelength. In the range from 450 to 650 nm, the
scale shift of this atlas varies from -100 to -330 m/s, respectively, and it
equals on average of -240 m/s. The resulting average star bisectors contain
information about the fields of convective velocities and may be useful for
hydrodynamic modeling of stellar atmospheres in order to study the
characteristic features of surface convection.

the poset of permutations under the pattern containment order.
  First, we consider cases where the lower bound of the poset is
indecomposable. We show that $\mu[\sigma,\pi]$ can be computed by considering
just the indecomposable permutations contained in the upper bound. We apply
this to the case where the upper bound is an increasing oscillation, and give a
method for computing the value of the M\""{o}bius function that only involves
evaluating simple inequalities.
  We then consider conditions on an interval which guarantee that the value of
the M\""{o}bius function is zero. In particular, we show that if a permutation
$\pi$ contains two intervals of length 2, which are not order-isomorphic to one
another, then $\mu[1,\pi] = 0$. This allows us to prove that the proportion of
permutations of length $n$ with principal M\""{o}bius function equal to zero is
asymptotically bounded below by $(1-1/e)^2 \ge 0.3995$. This is the first
result determining the value of $\mu[1,\pi]$ for an asymptotically positive
proportion of permutations $\pi$.
  Following this, we use ''2413-balloon'' permutations to show that the growth
of the principal M\""{o}bius function on the permutation poset is exponential.
This improves on previous work, which has shown that the growth is at least
polynomial.
  We then generalise 2413-balloon permutations, and find a recursion for the
value of the principal M\""{o}bius function of these generalisations.

toroidal shell structure are extensively studied within covariant density
functional theory. The general trends in the evolution of toroidal shapes in
the $Z\approx 130-180$ region of nuclear chart are established for the first
time. These nuclei are stable with respect of breathing deformations. The most
compact fat toroidal nuclei are located in the $Z\approx 136, N\approx 206$
region of nuclear chart, but thin toroidal nuclei become dominant with
increasing proton number and on moving towards proton and neutron drip lines.
The role of toroidal shell structure, its regularity, supershell structure,
shell gaps as well as the role of different groups of the pairs of the orbitals
in its formation are investigated in detail. The lowest in energy solutions at
axial symmetry are characterized either by large shell gaps or low density of
the single-particle states in the vicinity of the Fermi level in at least one
of the subsystems (proton or neutron). Related quantum shell effects are
expected to act against the instabilities in breathing and sausage deformations
for these subsystems. The investigation with large set of covariant energy
density functionals reveals that substantial proton $Z=154$ and 186 and neutron
$N=228$, 308 and 406 spherical shell gaps exist in all functionals. The nuclei
in the vicinity of the combination of these particle numbers form the islands
of stability of spherical hyperheavy nuclei. The study suggests that the
$N=210$ toroidal shell gap plays a substantial role in the stabilization of fat
toroidal nuclei.

Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The method is parametrization free, requires no
knowledge regarding the manifold's intrinsic dimension, can handle noise and
outliers in both the function values and in the location of the data, and is
applied directly in the high dimensions. We show that the complexity of the
method is linear in the dimension of the manifold and squared-logarithmic in
the dimension of the codomain of the function. Subsequently, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by considering different manifold topologies and
show the robustness of the method to various noise levels.

upon the idea of propensity scores or covariate balance. They usually impose
strong assumptions on treatment assignment or outcome model to obtain unbiased
estimation, such as linearity or specific functional forms, which easily leads
to the major drawback of model mis-specification. In this paper, we aim to
alleviate these issues by developing a distribution learning-based weighting
method. We first learn the true underlying distribution of covariates
conditioned on treatment assignment, then leverage the ratio of covariates'
density in the treatment group to that of the control group as the weight for
estimating treatment effects. Specifically, we propose to approximate the
distribution of covariates in both treatment and control groups through
invertible transformations via change of variables. To demonstrate the
superiority, robustness, and generalizability of our method, we conduct
extensive experiments using synthetic and real data. From the experiment
results, we find that our method for estimating average treatment effect on

weighting-only benchmarking methods, and it maintains its advantage under a
doubly-robust estimation framework that combines weighting with some advanced

Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing, call for coordination approaches
addressing openness, self-adaptation, heterogeneity, and deployment
agnosticism. Field-based coordination is one such approach, promoting the idea
of programming system coordination declaratively from a global perspective, in
terms of functional manipulation and evolution in ""space and time"" of
distributed data structures called fields. More specifically regarding time, in
field-based coordination (as in many other distributed approaches to
coordination) it is assumed that local activities in each device are regulated
by a fair and unsynchronised fixed clock working at the platform level. In this
work, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where
scheduling is programmed in a natural way (along with usual field-based
coordination) in terms of causality fields, each enacting a programmable
distributed notion of a computation ""cause"" (why and when a field computation
has to be locally computed) and how it should change across time and space.
Starting from low-level platform triggers, such causality fields can be
organised into multiple layers, up to high-level, collectively-computed time
abstractions, to be used at the application level. This reinterpretation of
time in terms of articulated causality relations allows us to express what we
call ""time-fluid"" coordination, where scheduling can be finely tuned so as to
select the triggers to react to, generally allowing to adaptively balance
performance (system reactivity) and cost (resource usage) of computations. We
formalise the proposed scheduling framework for field-based coordination in the
context of the field calculus, discuss an implementation in the aggregate
computing framework, and finally evaluate the approach via simulation on

data collection, where a group of workers is equipped with Internet-connected
geolocated devices to collect sensor data for marketing or research purpose. In
this paper, we consider crowdsourcing these worker's hot travel path. Each
worker is required to report his real-time location information, which is
sensitive and has to be protected. Encryption-based methods are the most direct
way to protect the location, but not suitable for resource-limited devices.
Besides, local differential privacy is a strong privacy concept and has been
deployed in many software systems. However, the local differential privacy
technology needs a large number of participants to ensure the accuracy of the
estimation, which is not always the case for crowdsourcing. To solve this
problem, we proposed a trie-based iterative statistic method, which combines
additive secret sharing and local differential privacy technologies. The
proposed method has excellent performance even with a limited number of
participants without the need of complex computation. Specifically, the
proposed method contains three main components: iterative statistics, adaptive
sampling, and secure reporting. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of
the proposed method and perform extensive experiments to show that the proposed
method not only provides a strict privacy guarantee, but also significantly
improves the performance from the previous existing solutions.

significant similarities in their metallicity ([Fe/H]), carbonicity ([C/Fe]),

results demonstrate that the RPE stars in these CDTGs have likely experienced
common chemical-evolution histories, presumably in their parent satellite

preferentially exhibit pericentric distances that are substantially lower than
the present distances of surviving ultra-faint dwarf and canonical dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, consistent with the disruption hypothesis. The derived
dynamical parameters for several of our CDTGs indicate their association with
previously known substructures, Dynamically Tagged Groups, and RPE Groups.

stringent service requirements of CAV applications on reliability, latency and

channel access algorithms and intelligent control schemes for connected

supported cooperative driving, which is an advanced driving mode through
information sharing and driving coordination. Firstly we quantify the delay
upper bounds of 6G vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications with hybrid
communication and channel access technologies. A deep learning neural network
is developed and trained for fast computation of the delay bounds in real time
operations. Then, an intelligent strategy is designed to control the
inter-vehicle distance for cooperative autonomous driving. Furthermore, we
propose a Markov Chain based algorithm to predict the parameters of the system
states, and also a safe distance mapping method to enable smooth vehicular
speed changes. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the AirSim autonomous
driving platform. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are
effective and robust with safe and stable cooperative autonomous driving, which

with the Bjorken energy density formula after choosing a proper formation time
$\tau{_{\rm F}}$. However, the Bjorken formula breaks down at low energies
because it neglects the finite nuclear thickness. Here we include both the
finite time duration and finite longitudinal extension of the initial energy
production. When $\tau{_{\rm F}}$ is not too much smaller than the crossing
time of the two nuclei, our results are similar to those from a previous study
that only considers the finite time duration. In particular, we find that at
low energies the initial energy density has a much lower maximum value but
evolves much longer than the Bjorken formula, while at large-enough $\tau{_{\rm
F}}$ and/or high-enough energies our result approaches the Bjorken formula. We
also find a qualitative difference in that our maximum energy density
$\epsilon^{\rm max}$ at $\tau{_{\rm F}}=0$ is finite, while the Bjorken formula
diverges as $1/\tau{_{\rm F}}$ and the previous result diverges as $\ln
(1/\tau{_{\rm F}})$ at low energies but as $1/\tau{_{\rm F}}$ at high energies.
Furthermore, our solution of the energy density approximately satisfies a
scaling relation. As a result, the $\tau{_{\rm F}}$-dependence of
$\epsilon^{\rm max}$ determines the $A$-dependence, and the weaker $\tau{_{\rm

slower increase of $\epsilon^{\rm max}$ with $A$.

addition, we derive a canonical momentum transport equation for this class of

study the hydrodynamic equations in a particular nonlinear fluid, where the
effective gauge potential results from the introduction of weak contact
interactions in an ultracold dilute Bose gas of optically-addressed two-level
atoms. In the Cauchy equation of mechanical momentum transport of the
superfluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due to the density-dependent vector
potential. A body-force of dilation appears as a product of the gauge potential

canonical flow pressure term given by the inner-product of the gauge potential
and the canonical current density. By numerical simulation, we illustrate an
interesting effect of the nonlinear gauge potential on the groundstate
wavefunction of a superfluid in the presence of a foreign impurity. We find
that the groundstate adopts a non-trivial local phase, which is antisymmetric
under reversal of the gauge potential. The phase profile leads to a
canonical-flow or phase-flow dipole about the impurity, resulting in a skirting

Golatkar et al. have recently shown that WD only matters at the start of the
training in computer vision, upending traditional wisdom. Loshchilov et al.
show that for adaptive optimizers, manually decaying weights can outperform
adding an $l_2$ penalty to the loss. This technique has become increasingly
popular and is referred to as decoupled WD. The goal of this paper is to
investigate these two recent empirical observations. We demonstrate that by
applying WD only at the start, the network norm stays small throughout
training. This has a regularizing effect as the effective gradient updates
become larger. However, traditional generalizations metrics fail to capture
this effect of WD, and we show how a simple scale-invariant metric can. We also
show how the growth of network weights is heavily influenced by the dataset and
its generalization properties. For decoupled WD, we perform experiments in NLP
and RL where adaptive optimizers are the norm. We demonstrate that the primary
issue that decoupled WD alleviates is the mixing of gradients from the
objective function and the $l_2$ penalty in the buffers of Adam (which stores
the estimates of the first-order moment). Adaptivity itself is not problematic
and decoupled WD ensures that the gradients from the $l_2$ term cannot ""drown

generalized convolutions with sparse tensor representation to build expressive

the new models can efficiently process irregular point clouds without densely
sliding over the entire space, significantly reducing the memory requirements
and allowing higher resolutions of the underlying 3D volumes for better
performance.
  SparsePipe exploits intra-batch parallelism that partitions input data into
multiple processors and further improves the training throughput with
inter-batch pipelining to overlap communication and computing. Besides, it
suitably partitions the model when the GPUs are heterogeneous such that the
computing is load-balanced with reduced communication overhead.

unraveling the physics of tectonic faulting and the interplay between slow and
fast earthquakes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), by enabling
measurement of ground deformation at a global scale every few days, may hold
the key to those interactions. However, atmospheric propagation delays often
exceed ground deformation of interest despite state-of-the art processing, and
thus InSAR analysis requires expert interpretation and a priori knowledge of
fault systems, precluding global investigations of deformation dynamics. Here
we show that a deep auto-encoder architecture tailored to untangle ground
deformation from noise in InSAR time series autonomously extracts deformation
signals, without prior knowledge of a fault's location or slip behaviour.
Applied to InSAR data over the North Anatolian Fault, our method reaches 2 mm
detection, revealing a slow earthquake twice as extensive as previously
recognized. We further explore the generalization of our approach to
inflation/deflation-induced deformation, applying the same methodology to the
geothermal field of Coso, California.

shortcomings of cross-border coordination of electricity markets become more
apparent as the industry transitions towards higher penetration of renewable

study person re-identification in the cross-domain setting. An admirable method
is to optimize the target model by assigning pseudo-labels for unlabeled
samples through clustering. Usually, attributed to the domain gaps, the
pre-trained source domain model cannot extract appropriate target domain
features, which will dramatically affect the clustering performance and the
accuracy of pseudo-labels. Extensive label noise will lead to sub-optimal
solutions doubtlessly. To solve these problems, we propose an Anti-Noise
Learning (ANL) approach, which contains two modules. The Feature Distribution
Alignment (FDA) module is designed to gather the id-related samples and
disperse id-unrelated samples, through the camera-wise contrastive learning and
adversarial adaptation. Creating a friendly cross-feature foundation for
clustering that is to reduce clustering noise. Besides, the Reliable Sample
Selection (RSS) module utilizes an Auxiliary Model to correct noisy labels and
select reliable samples for the Main Model. In order to effectively utilize the
outlier information generated by the clustering algorithm and RSS module, we
train these samples at the instance-level. The experiments demonstrate that our
proposed ANL framework can effectively reduce the domain conflicts and
alleviate the influence of noisy samples, as well as superior performance

industrial, geotechnical, and aerospace engineering problems, from waste
management and transportation (liquid--sediment mixtures) to dust kick-up below
helicopter rotors (gas--sediment mixtures). These mixed flows often involve
bulk motion of hundreds of billions of individual sediment particles and can
contain both highly turbulent regions and static, non-flowing regions. This
breadth of phenomena necessitates the use of continuum simulation methods, such
as the material point method (MPM), which can accurately capture these large
deformations while also tracking the Lagrangian features of the flow (e.g.\ the
granular surface, elastic stress, etc.).
  Recent works using two-phase MPM frameworks to simulate these mixtures have
shown substantial promise; however, these approaches are hindered by the
numerical limitations of MPM when simulating pure fluids. In addition to the
well-known particle ringing instability and difficulty defining inflow/outflow
boundary conditions, MPM has a tendency to accumulate quadrature errors as
materials deform, increasing the rate of overall error growth as simulations
progress. In this work, we present an improved, two-phase continuum simulation
framework that uses the finite volume method (FVM) to solve the fluid phase
equations of motion and MPM to solve the solid phase equations of motion,
substantially reducing the effect of these errors and providing better accuracy
and stability for long-duration simulations of these mixtures.

potential to significantly reduce the simulation cost, compared to its fully

specially designed difference operators, which are variants of the standard

Because
of computational costs, models are truncated, coarsened, or aggregated. As the
neglected and unresolved terms become important, the utility of model
predictions diminishes. We develop a novel, versatile, and rigorous methodology
to learn non-Markovian closure parameterizations for known-physics/low-fidelity
models using data from high-fidelity simulations. The new ""neural closure
models"" augment low-fidelity models with neural delay differential equations
(nDDEs), motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig formulation and the inherent delays in
complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate that neural closures efficiently
account for truncated modes in reduced-order-models, capture the effects of
subgrid-scale processes in coarse models, and augment the simplification of
complex biological and physical-biogeochemical models. We find that using
non-Markovian over Markovian closures improves long-term prediction accuracy
and requires smaller networks. We derive adjoint equations and network
architectures needed to efficiently implement the new discrete and distributed
nDDEs, for any time-integration schemes and allowing nonuniformly-spaced
temporal training data. The performance of discrete over distributed delays in
closure models is explained using information theory, and we find an optimal
amount of past information for a specified architecture. Finally, we analyze
computational complexity and explain the limited additional cost due to neural
closure models.

solving Helmholtz equation, the basic partial differential equation to
represent wave propagation, e.g. acoustic wave, electromagnetic wave, and

differential equations, we instead introduce a complex activation function
$e^{\mathbf{i}{x}}$, the plane wave which is the basic component of the
solution of Helmholtz equation. By a simple derivation, we further find that
PWNN is actually a generalization of the plane wave partition of unity method
(PWPUM) by additionally imposing a learned basis with both amplitude and
direction to better characterize the potential solution. We firstly investigate
our performance on a problem with the solution is an integral of the plane
waves with all known directions. The experiments demonstrate that: PWNN works
much better than TANN and SIREN on varying architectures or the number of
training samples, that means the plane wave activation indeed helps to enhance
the representation ability of neural network toward the solution of Helmholtz
equation; PWNN has competitive performance than PWPUM, e.g. the same
convergence order but less relative error. Furthermore, we focus a more
practical problem, the solution of which only integrate the plane waves with
some unknown directions. We find that PWNN works much better than PWPUM at this
case. Unlike using the plane wave basis with fixed directions in PWPUM, PWNN
can learn a group of optimized plane wave basis which can better predict the
unknown directions of the solution. The proposed approach may provide some new
insights in the aspect of applying deep learning in Helmholtz equation.

macro-objects exist independently and irrespective of observation. One
practical approach to test this view in quantum theory is to observe the
quantum coherence for macro-object in an interference experiment. An elegant
and conceptually appealing approach for testing the notion of macrorealism in
quantum theory is through the violation of Leggett-Garg inequality. However, a
conclusive Leggett-Garg test hinges on how the non-invasive measurability
criteria is guaranteed in an experiment and remains a debated issue till date.
In this work, we connect the practical and the conceptual approaches for
testing the macrorealism through the weak value. We argue that whenever quantum
effect is observed in an interference experiment there is an existence of
anomalous weak value. Further, we demonstrate that whenever such weak value
exists, one obtains the violation of a Leggett-Garg inequality in any
interference experiment. Since the system itself serves as apparatus in a
path-only interference experiment, one cannot salvage the macrorealism by
abandoning the non-invasive measurability assumption. We provide a rigorous
discussion about the assumptions involved in Leggett-Garg scenario and how our
scheme fits into it. Further, using the quasiprobability approach we explain
how non-invasive measurability condition is satisfied in our scheme.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) can produce neutrino spectrum peaks near PeV

we provide a simple and direct argument of an existing proof to demonstrate
that the mixed state preparation non-contextuality implies the first definition

existence and behaviour of the critical-mass blow-up solution when the

corresponding blow-up solution converges to a certain blow-up profile in virial

machine learning (ML) paradigm. Practical needs of the ""right to be forgotten""
and countering data poisoning attacks call for efficient techniques that can
remove, or unlearn, specific training data from the trained FL model. Existing
unlearning techniques in the context of ML, however, are no longer in effect
for FL, mainly due to the inherent distinction in the way how FL and ML learn
from data. Therefore, how to enable efficient data removal from FL models
remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we take the first step to fill
this gap by presenting FedEraser, the first federated unlearning methodology
that can eliminate the influence of a federated client's data on the global FL
model while significantly reducing the time used for constructing the unlearned
FL model.The basic idea of FedEraser is to trade the central server's storage
for unlearned model's construction time, where FedEraser reconstructs the
unlearned model by leveraging the historical parameter updates of federated
clients that have been retained at the central server during the training
process of FL. A novel calibration method is further developed to calibrate the
retained updates, which are further used to promptly construct the unlearned
model, yielding a significant speed-up to the reconstruction of the unlearned
model while maintaining the model efficacy. Experiments on four realistic
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEraser, with an expected speed-up
of $4\times$ compared with retraining from the scratch. We envision our work as
an early step in FL towards compliance with legal and ethical criteria in a

  Feature Selection",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised feature selection is an important method to reduce dimensions of
high dimensional data without labels, which is benefit to avoid ``curse of
dimensionality'' and improve the performance of subsequent machine learning
tasks, like clustering and retrieval. How to select the uncorrelated and
discriminative features is the key problem of unsupervised feature selection.
Many proposed methods select features with strong discriminant and high
redundancy, or vice versa. However, they only satisfy one of these two
criteria. Other existing methods choose the discriminative features with low
redundancy by constructing the graph matrix on the original feature space.
Since the original feature space usually contains redundancy and noise, it will
degrade the performance of feature selection. In order to address these issues,
we first present a novel generalized regression model imposed by an
uncorrelated constraint and the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularization. It can
simultaneously select the uncorrelated and discriminative features as well as
reduce the variance of these data points belonging to the same neighborhood,
which is help for the clustering task. Furthermore, the local intrinsic
structure of data is constructed on the reduced dimensional space by learning
the similarity-induced graph adaptively. Then the learnings of the graph
structure and the indicator matrix based on the spectral analysis are
integrated into the generalized regression model. Finally, we develop an
alternative iterative optimization algorithm to solve the objective function. A
series of experiments are carried out on nine real-world data sets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with other
competing approaches.

the radial mass distribution is expressed as the sum of the distribution
functions for the end-to-end vectors, $\{\vec{r}_{Gh}\}$, from the center of

has been steadily used for image restoration. Existing residual networks based
on an additive model require residual layers with a small output range for fast
convergence and visual quality improvement. However, in inverse halftoning,
homogenous dot patterns hinder a small output range from the residual layers.
Therefore, a new layer decomposition network based on the Gaussian convolution
model (GCM) and structure-aware deblurring strategy is presented to achieve
residual learning for both the base and detail layers. For the base layer, a
new GCM-based residual subnetwork is presented. The GCM utilizes a statistical
distribution, in which the image difference between a blurred continuous-tone
image and a blurred halftoned image with a Gaussian filter can result in a
narrow output range. Subsequently, the GCM-based residual subnetwork uses a
Gaussian-filtered halftoned image as input and outputs the image difference as
residual, thereby generating the base layer, i.e., the Gaussian-blurred
continuous-tone image. For the detail layer, a new structure-aware residual
deblurring subnetwork (SARDS) is presented. To remove the Gaussian blurring of
the base layer, the SARDS uses the predicted base layer as input and outputs
the deblurred version. To more effectively restore image structures such as
lines and texts, a new image structure map predictor is incorporated into the
deblurring network to induce structure-adaptive learning. This paper provides a
method to realize the residual learning of both the base and detail layers
based on the GCM and SARDS. In addition, it is verified that the proposed
method surpasses state-of-the-art methods based on U-Net, direct deblurring
networks, and progressively residual networks.

their appearance through compactification of the extra dimension. Apart from
resolving the issues of compactification scale and size, the particles of their
fields can also turn out to be excellent candidate to solve the dark energy
(DE) and dark matter (DM) problem of the universe. In this work we study their
mixing dynamics with photons in a magnetized media, by incorporating the effect
of parity violating part of the photon polarization tensor, evaluated in a
finite density magnetized media. This piece, though in general is odd in the
external magnetic field strength $eB$; in this work we however have retained
terms to $O$($eB$). We are able to demonstrate in this work that, in magnetized
medium a dilatonic scalar field $(\phi)$ can excite the two transverse degrees
of freedom (DOF) of the photons. One due to direct coupling and the other
indirectly through the parity violating term originating due to magnetized
medium effects. This results in the mixing dynamics being governed by, $3\times
3$ mixing matrices. This mixing results in making the underlying media
optically active. In this work we focus on the spectro-polarimetric imprints of
these particles, on the spectra of the electromagnetic (EM) fields of Gamma Ray

detecting opinion spam in online reviews, especially based on supervised
classifiers. In this contribution, we start from a set of effective features
used for classifying opinion spam and we re-engineered them, by considering the
Cumulative Relative Frequency Distribution of each feature. By an experimental
evaluation carried out on real data from Yelp.com, we show that the use of the
distributional features is able to improve the performances of classifiers.

mechanism reduces the CuPt ordering in GaInP. We demonstrate that using barrier
layers the diffusion of point defects can be mitigated, so that they do not
reach Zn-doped layers, preventing its diffusion. Finally, the impact of Zn
diffusion on solar cells with different Zn-profiles is evaluated by comparing

essential service in 5G systems and beyond to accommodate a wide range of
emerging applications with stringent latency and reliability requirements.
Coexistence of URLLC alongside other service categories calls for developing
spectrally efficient multiplexing techniques. Specifically, coupling URLLC and
conventional enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) through superposition/puncturing
naturally arises as a promising option due to the tolerance of the latter in
terms of latency and reliability. The idea here is to transmit URLLC packets
over resources occupied by ongoing eMBB transmissions while minimizing the
impact on the eMBB transmissions. In this paper, we propose a novel downlink
URLLC-eMBB multiplexing technique that exploits possible similarities among
URLLC and eMBB symbols, with the objective of reducing the size of the
punctured eMBB symbols. We propose that the base station scans the eMBB
traffic' symbol sequences and punctures those that have the highest symbol
similarity with that of the URLLC users to be served. As the eMBB and URLLC may
use different constellation sizes, we introduce the concept of symbol region
similarity to accommodate the different constellations. We assess the
performance of the proposed scheme analytically, where we derive closed-form
expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) of the eMBB and URLLC services. {We
also derive an expression for the eMBB loss function due to puncturing in terms
of the eMBB SER}. We demonstrate through numerical and simulation results the
efficacy of the proposed scheme where we show that 1) the eMBB spectral
efficiency is improved by puncturing fewer symbols, 2) the SER and reliability
performance of eMBB are improved, and 3) the URLLC data is accommodated within
the specified delay constraint while maintaining its reliability.

  multiple time scales",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As cancer patient survival improves, late effects from treatment are becoming
the next clinical challenge. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, for example,
potentially increase the risk of both morbidity and mortality from second
malignancies and cardiovascular disease. To provide clinically relevant
population-level measures of late effects, it is of importance to (1)
simultaneously estimate the risks of both morbidity and mortality, (2)
partition these risks into the component expected in the absence of cancer and
the component due to the cancer and its treatment, and (3) incorporate the
multiple time scales of attained age, calendar time, and time since diagnosis.
Multi-state models provide a framework for simultaneously studying morbidity
and mortality, but do not solve the problem of partitioning the risks. However,
this partitioning can be achieved by applying a relative survival framework, by
allowing is to directly quantify the excess risk. This paper proposes a
combination of these two frameworks, providing one approach to address (1)-(3).
Using recently developed methods in multi-state modeling, we incorporate
estimation of excess hazards into a multi-state model. Both intermediate and
absorbing state risks can be partitioned and different transitions are allowed
to have different and/or multiple time scales. We illustrate our approach using
data on Hodgkin lymphoma patients and excess risk of diseases of the
circulatory system, and provide user-friendly Stata software with accompanying
example code.

technology for beyond 5G with its promising features such as higher spectral

cell-free mMIMO is that many distributed access points (APs) cooperate
simultaneously to serve all the users within the network without creating cell
boundaries. This paper considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system
utilizing the radio stripe network architecture with a sequential fronthaul
between the APs. A novel uplink sequential processing algorithm is developed
which is proved to be optimal in both the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) and
the minimum mean square error (MSE) sense. A detailed quantitative analysis of
the fronthaul requirement or signaling of the proposed algorithm and its
comparison with competing sub-optimal algorithms is provided. Key conclusions
and implications are summarized in the form of corollaries. Based on the

a general format of so-called modified two-derivative diagonally implicit

six are derived by introducing a set of bi-coloured rooted trees and deriving
new elementary weights. Next, we build exponential fitting conditions in order

EFTDDIRK methods. In particular, a family of 2-stage fourth-order, a
fifth-order, and a 3-stage sixth-order EFTDDIRK schemes are derived. These can
be considered as superconvergent methods. The stability and phase-lag analysis
of the new methods are also investigated, leading to optimized fourth-order

at a transition redshift $z_t<0.1$ of the form $w(z)=-1+\Delta w\;\Theta
(z_t-z)$ with $\Delta w<0$ can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant
while closely mimicking a Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM form of the comoving distance
$r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$ for $z>z_t$. Such a transition however would
imply a significantly lower value of the SnIa absolute magnitude $M$ than the
value $M_C$ imposed by local Cepheid calibrators at $z<0.01$. Thus, in order to
resolve the $H_0$ tension it would need to be accompanied by a similar
transition in the value of the SnIa absolute magnitude $M$ as $M(z)=M_C+\Delta
M \;\Theta (z-z_t)$ with $\Delta M<0$. This is a Late $w-M$ phantom transition
($LwMPT$). It may be achieved by a sudden reduction of the value of the
normalized effective Newton constant $\mu=G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}$ by about
$6\%$ assuming that the absolute luminosity of SnIa is proportional to the
Chandrasekhar mass which varies as $\mu^{-3/2}$. We demonstrate that such an
ultra low $z$ abrupt feature of $w-M$ provides a better fit to cosmological
data compared to smooth late time deformations of $H(z)$ that also address the
Hubble tension. For $z_t=0.02$ we find $\Delta w\simeq -4$, $\Delta M \simeq
-0.1$. This model also addresses the growth tension due to the predicted lower
value of $\mu$ at $z>z_t$. A prior of $\Delta w=0$ (no $w$ transition) can
still resolve the $H_0$ tension with a larger amplitude $M$ transition with
$\Delta M\simeq -0.2$ at $z_t\simeq 0.01$. This implies a larger reduction of
$\mu$ for $z>0.01$ (about $12\%$). The $LwMPT$ can be generically induced by a
scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity with no need of a screening
mechanism since in this model $\mu=1$ at $z<0.01$.

of heavy flavors in jets are sensitive to the heavy quark mass. In $0-10\%$
Pb+Pb collisions at $\rm \sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, we observe an inverse
modification pattern of the B mesons radial profiles in jets at $\rm
4<p_T^Q<20$ GeV compared to that of D mesons: the jet quenching effects narrow
the jet radial profile of B mesons in jets while broaden that of D mesons in
jets. We find that in A+A collisions, the contribution dissipated from the
higher $\rm p_T^Q> 20$ GeV region naturally has a narrower initial distribution
and consequently leads to a narrower modification pattern of radial profile;
however the diffusion nature of the heavy flavor in-medium interactions will
give rise to a broader modification pattern of radial profile. These two
effects consequently compete and offset with each other, and the b quarks in
jets benefit more from the former and suffers less diffusion effect compared to
that of c quarks in jets. These findings can be tested in the future
experimental measurements at the LHC to gain better understanding of the mass
effect of jet quenching.

The existing CNNs may help in encoding a complicated structure like syntax for

adaptively generated filters conditioned on syntactically informed inputs. We
achieve this with the integration of a filter generation network which

important syntactic features present inside the input, thus enlarging the gap

Using a static electric field can greatly reduce the magnetic field background

hard to annihilate. A cylindrical setup shields the electric field to the
laboratory as well as encompasses the axion induced magnetic field within the

the axion dark matter inherent bandwidth. This proposed setup is capable of a
wide mass range search.

is devoted to modeling spatial diffusion patterns of COVID-19 stemming from
Wuhan city to Hubei province. The methods include gravity and spatial
auto-regression analyses. The local gravity model is derived from allometric
scaling and global gravity model, and then the parameters of the local gravity
model are estimated by observational data and linear regression. The main
results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can
effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei
Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative
exponential decay to the observation data is not satisfactory. Further, the
goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over
time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and
the distance attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover,
the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and
the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as
follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range
effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the
total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main
process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and
the horizontal transmission between regions is not significant. (3) The effect
of spatial isolation measures taken by Chinese government against the
transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests that the role of

Lagrangian particles in the framework of a general-relativistic (GR) Smooth
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation, while the spacetime is evolved on a
mesh according to the BSSN formulation that is also frequently used in Eulerian
GR-hydrodynamics. To the best of our knowledge this is the first Lagrangian
fully general relativistic hydrodynamics code (all previous SPH approaches used
approximations to GR-gravity). A core ingredient of our particle-mesh approach
is the coupling between the gas (represented by particles) and the spacetime
(represented by a mesh) for which we have developed a set of sophisticated
interpolation tools that are inspired by other particle-mesh approaches, in
particular by vortex-particle methods. One advantage of splitting the
methodology between matter and spacetime is that it gives us more freedom in
choosing the resolution, so that -- if the spacetime is smooth enough -- we
obtain good results already with a moderate number of grid cells and can focus
the computational effort on the simulation of the matter. Further advantages of
our approach are the ease with which ejecta can be tracked and the fact that
the neutron star surface remains well-behaved and does not need any particular
treatment. In the hydrodynamics part of the code we use a number of techniques
that are new to SPH, such as reconstruction, slope limiting and steering
dissipation by monitoring entropy conservation. We describe here in detail the
employed numerical methods and demonstrate the code performance in a number of
benchmark problems ranging from shock tube tests, over Cowling approximations
to the fully dynamical evolution of neutron stars in self-consistently evolved

the effective potential can be expressed in terms of Airy functions. For an
attractive impurity placed far outside the support of the fermion density, we
show that an interesting transition occurs where a single fermion is pulled out

the available energy becomes insufficient to populate the entire configuration

offer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For
example, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP
model enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP
scales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all
examples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been
proposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples.
Importantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables
control over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse
GPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate
inference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is
variational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as
an optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log
marginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework,
where pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the
approximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters
of the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can
naturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from
regression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification
problems with discrete labels, but also problems with multidimensional labels.
The purpose of this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for
readers without prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the
subject enables also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted
VI as well as interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an
inspiration for new research ideas.

($0<a<1$) with real kernel, we show an integration-by-parts formula for
solutions of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem, in the model case where the
operator is $x$-independent with homogeneous symbol, considered on the
halfspace $R^n_+$. The new aspect compared to $(-\Delta )^a$ is that $L$ is
nonsymmetric, having both an even and an odd part. Hence it satisfies a $\mu
$-transmission condition where generally $\mu \ne a$.
  We present a complex method, relying on a factorization in factors
holomorphic in $\xi_n$ in the lower or upper complex halfplane, using
order-reducing operators combined with a decomposition principle originating
from Wiener and Hopf. This is in contrast to a real, computational method
presented very recently by Dipierro, Ros-Oton, Serra and Valdinoci. Our method
allows $\mu $ in a larger range than they consider.
  Another new contribution is the (model) study of ""large"" solutions of
nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problems when $\mu >0$. Here we deduce a ""halfways
Green's formula"" for $L$: $$ \int_{R^n_+} Lu\,\bar
v\,dx-\int_{R^n_+}u\,\overline{ L^*v}\,dx=c\int_{R^{n-1}}\gamma_0(u/x_n^{\mu -1

Dirichlet problem for $L$, and $v$ solves a homogeneous Dirichlet problem for
$L^*$; $\mu ^*=2a-\mu $. Finally, we show a full Green's formula, when both $u$
and $v$ solve nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problems; here both Dirichlet and
Neumann traces of $u$ and $v$ enter, as well as a first-order
pseudodifferential operator over the boundary.

  Soft Robots by Learning",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents an efficient learning-based method to solve the inverse
kinematic (IK) problem on soft robots with highly non-linear deformation. The
major challenge of efficiently computing IK for such robots is due to the lack
of analytical formulation for either forward or inverse kinematics. To address
this challenge, we employ neural networks to learn both the mapping function of
forward kinematics and also the Jacobian of this function. As a result,
Jacobian-based iteration can be applied to solve the IK problem. A sim-to-real
training transfer strategy is conducted to make this approach more practical.
We first generate a large number of samples in a simulation environment for
learning both the kinematic and the Jacobian networks of a soft robot design.
Thereafter, a sim-to-real layer of differentiable neurons is employed to map
the results of simulation to the physical hardware, where this sim-to-real
layer can be learned from a very limited number of training samples generated
on the hardware. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on
pneumatic-driven soft robots for path following and interactive positioning.

provide advanced cyber-defense for high-value assets. The underlying assumption
for using LSTM networks for malware-detection is that the op-code sequence of
malware could be treated as a (spoken) language representation. There are
differences between any spoken-language (sequence of words/sentences) and the
machine-language (sequence of op-codes). In this paper, we demonstrate that due
to these inherent differences, an LSTM model with its default configuration as
tuned for a spoken-language, may not work well to detect malware (using its
op-code sequence) unless the network's essential hyper-parameters are tuned
appropriately. In the process, we also determine the relative importance of all
the different hyper-parameters of an LSTM network as applied to malware
detection using their op-code sequence representations. We experimented with
different configurations of LSTM networks, and altered hyper-parameters like
the embedding-size, number of hidden layers, number of LSTM-units in a hidden
layer, pruning/padding-length of the input-vector, activation-function, and
batch-size. We discovered that owing to the enhanced complexity of the
malware/machine-language, the performance of an LSTM network configured for an
Intrusion Detection System, is very sensitive towards the
number-of-hidden-layers, input sequence-length, and the choice of the
activation-function. Also, for (spoken) language-modeling, the recurrent
architectures by-far outperform their non-recurrent counterparts. Therefore, we
also assess how sequential DL architectures like the LSTM compare against their
non-sequential counterparts like the MLP-DNN for the purpose of

placing ads within the organic content of their pages. We refer to this setting
as ``queryless'' to differentiate from search advertisement where a user
submits a search query and gets back related ads. Understanding user intent is
critical because relevant ads improve user experience and increase the
likelihood of delivering clicks that have value to our advertisers.
  This paper presents Multi-Channel Sequential Behavior Network (MC-SBN), a
deep learning approach for embedding users and ads in a semantic space in which
relevance can be evaluated. Our proposed user encoder architecture summarizes
user activities from multiple input channels--such as previous search queries,
visited pages, or clicked ads--into a user vector. It uses multiple RNNs to
encode sequences of event sessions from the different channels and then applies
an attention mechanism to create the user representation. A key property of our
approach is that user vectors can be maintained and updated incrementally,
which makes it feasible to be deployed for large-scale serving. We conduct
extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that
MC-SBN can improve the ranking of relevant ads and boost the performance of
both click prediction and conversion prediction in the queryless native
advertising setting.

  Artificial Intelligence for Good",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  While we have witnessed a rapid growth of ethics documents meant to guide AI
development, the promotion of AI ethics has nonetheless proceeded with little
input from AI practitioners themselves. Given the proliferation of AI for
Social Good initiatives, this is an emerging gap that needs to be addressed in
order to develop more meaningful ethical approaches to AI use and development.
This paper offers a methodology, a shared fairness approach, aimed at
identifying the needs of AI practitioners when it comes to confronting and
resolving ethical challenges and to find a third space where their operational
language can be married with that of the more abstract principles that
presently remain at the periphery of their work experiences. We offer a
grassroots approach to operational ethics based on dialog and mutualised
responsibility. This methodology is centred around conversations intended to
elicit practitioners perceived ethical attribution and distribution over key
value laden operational decisions, to identify when these decisions arise and
what ethical challenges they confront, and to engage in a language of ethics
and responsibility which enables practitioners to internalise ethical
responsibility. The methodology bridges responsibility imbalances that rest in
structural decision making power and elite technical knowledge, by commencing
with personal, facilitated conversations, returning the ethical discourse to
those meant to give it meaning at the sharp end of the ecosystem. Our primary
contribution is to add to the recent literature seeking to bring AI
practitioners' experiences to the fore by offering a methodology for
understanding how ethics manifests as a relational and interdependent
sociotechnical practice in their work.

  Tracer",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Multi-user capabilities in Cisco Packet Tracer provide an incentive for
immersive realistic learning to increase the efficiency of teaching and
learning in the networking class. It is difficult to evaluate the configuration
skills of the students in the classroom, particularly during laboratory class,
while teaching networking course, the most problems for lecturers. The
multi-user functionality that uses the one-to-many remote relay server concept
allows lecturers to remotely control and test many students at one time. The
key purpose of this paper is to incorporate creativity in teaching by using
realistic multi-user practises in the networking class. In this study, the
multiuser operation was developed and used via an existing LAN link in the
classroom. The focus of the operation is the simple configuration of network
equipment such as routers and switches. This practise was used during the
laboratory session, encouraging lecturers to establish relationships based on a
large audience. The professor is able to evaluate the success of the students
during the execution of the activity and to ensure that each student engages in
the activity. As a result of introducing this approach, the curiosity of
students in technical subjects can be improved and student success can be
conveniently tracked on the part of the lecturer. Lecturers are able to monitor
the configuration capabilities of students closely to ensure that each student
engages in the laboratory class. The lecturer will train students not only to
develop their configuration and troubleshooting abilities by using this
teaching form, but also to accelerate the pace at which students need to fix
network problems.

one physical quantity when given oversampled measurements of two physical
quantities with correlated noise. The algorithm assumes that the aleatoric
measurement uncertainty in both physical quantities follows a Gaussian
distribution and relies on sampling faster than it is possible for the
measurand (the true value of the physical quantity that we are trying to
measure) to change (due to the system thermal time constant) to calculate the
parameters of the noise distribution. In contrast to the Kalman and particle
filters, which respectively require state update equations and a map of one
physical quality, our algorithm requires only the oversampled sensor
measurements. When applied to temperature-compensated humidity sensors, it
provides reduced uncertainty in humidity estimates from correlated temperature
and humidity measurements. In an experimental evaluation, the algorithm
achieves average uncertainty reduction of 10.3 %. The algorithm incurs an
execution time overhead of 5.3 % when compared to the minimum algorithm
required to measure and calculate the uncertainty. Detailed instruction-level
emulation of a C-language implementation compiled to the RISC-V architecture
shows that the uncertainty reduction program required 0.05 % more instructions
per iteration than the minimum operations required to calculate the
uncertainty.

  Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering 2020 (CSDE 2020)",,,,"q-fin.PM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Portfolio optimization is one of the most attentive fields that have been
researched with machine learning approaches. Many researchers attempted to
solve this problem using deep reinforcement learning due to its efficient
inherence that can handle the property of financial markets. However, most of
them can hardly be applicable to real-world trading since they ignore or
extremely simplify the realistic constraints of transaction costs. These
constraints have a significantly negative impact on portfolio profitability. In
our research, a conservative level of transaction fees and slippage are
considered for the realistic experiment. To enhance the performance under those
constraints, we propose a novel Deterministic Policy Gradient with 2D
Relative-attentional Gated Transformer (DPGRGT) model. Applying learnable
relative positional embeddings for the time and assets axes, the model better
understands the peculiar structure of the financial data in the portfolio
optimization domain. Also, gating layers and layer reordering are employed for
stable convergence of Transformers in reinforcement learning. In our experiment
using U.S. stock market data of 20 years, our model outperformed baseline
models and demonstrated its effectiveness.

developed in cognitive sciences, game theory and econophysics. In this work a
generalization of credit loans is introduced by using the vector space
formalism of QM. Operators for the debt, amortization, interest and periodic
installments are defined and its mean values in an arbitrary orthonormal basis
of the vectorial space give the corresponding values at each period of the
loan. Endowing the vector space of dimension M, where M is the loan duration,
with a SO(M) symmetry, it is possible to rotate the eigenbasis to obtain better
schedule periodic payments for the borrower, by using the rotation angles of
the SO(M) transformation. Given that a rotation preserves the length of the
vectors, the total amortization, debt and periodic installments are not
changed. For a general description of the formalism introduced, the loan
operator relations are given in terms of a generalized Heisenberg algebra,
where finite dimensional representations are considered and commutative
operators are defined for the specific loan types. The results obtained are an
improvement of the usual financial instrument of credit because introduce
several degrees of freedom through the rotation angles, which allows to select
superposition states of the corresponding commutative operators that enables
the borrower to tune the periodic installments in order to obtain better
benefits without changing what the lender earns.

electrophysiological correlates of the subjective experience (the felt quality
of redness or the redness of red, the experience of dark and light, the quality
of depth in a visual field, the sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothball,
bodily sensations from pains to orgasms, mental images that are conjured up
internally, the felt quality of emotion, the experience of a stream of
conscious thought or the phenomenology of thought). However, there are brain
occipital and left temporal electrophysiological correlates of the subjective
experience (Pereira, 2015). Notwithstanding, as evoked signal, the change in
event-related brain potentials phase (frequency is the change in phase over
time) is instantaneous, that is, the frequency will transiently be infinite: a
transient peak in frequency (positive or negative), if any, is instantaneous in
electroencephalogram averaging or filtering that the event-related brain
potentials required and the underlying structure of the event-related brain
potentials in the frequency domain cannot be accounted, for example, by the
Wavelet Transform (WT) or the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, because
they require that frequency is derived by convolution rather than by
differentiation. However, as I show in the current original research report,
one suitable method for analyse the instantaneous change in event-related brain
potentials phase and accounted for a transient peak in frequency (positive or
negative), if any, in the underlying structure of the event-related brain
potentials is the Empirical Mode Decomposition with post processing (Xie et
al., 2014) Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (postEEMD) and Hilbert-Huang
Transform (HHT).
