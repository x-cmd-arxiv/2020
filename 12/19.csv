treatment and outcome in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The treatment
effect can nonetheless be identified if two auxiliary variables are available:
a negative control treatment (which has no effect on the actual outcome), and a
negative control outcome (which is not affected by the actual treatment). These
auxiliary variables can also be viewed as proxies for a traditional set of
control variables, and they bear resemblance to instrumental variables. I
propose a family of algorithms based on kernel ridge regression for learning
nonparametric treatment effects with negative controls. Examples include dose

heterogeneous treatment effects. Data may be discrete or continuous, and low,
high, or infinite dimensional. I prove uniform consistency and provide finite

\emph{local} supremum over a sub-interval, rather than on the full domain. That
is, denoting $U$ the CDF of the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$ and $U_n$ its
empirical version built from $n$ samples, we study
$P(\sup_{u\in[\underline{u},\overline{u}]}U_n(u)-U(u)>\epsilon)$ for different
values of $\underline{u},\overline{u}\in[0,1]$. Such local controls naturally
appear for instance when studying estimation error of spectral risk-measures
(such as the conditional value at risk), where $[\underline{u},\overline{u}]$
is typically $[0,\alpha]$ or $[1-\alpha,1]$ for a risk level $\alpha$, after
reshaping the CDF $F$ of the considered distribution into $U$ by the general
inverse transform $F^{-1}$. Extending a proof technique from Smirnov, we
provide exact expressions of the local quantities
$P(\sup_{u\in[\underline{u},\overline{u}]}U_n(u)-U(u)>\epsilon)$ and
$P(\sup_{u\in [\underline{u},\overline{u}]}U(u)-U_n(u)>\epsilon)$ for each
$n,\epsilon,\underline{u},\overline{u}$. Interestingly these quantities, seen
as a function of $\epsilon$, can be easily inverted numerically into functions
of the probability level $\delta$. Although not explicit, they can be computed
and tabulated. We plot such expressions and compare them to the classical bound
$\sqrt{\frac{\ln(1/\delta)}{2n}}$ provided by Massart inequality. Last, we
extend the local concentration results holding individually for each $n$ to
time-uniform concentration inequalities holding simultaneously for all $n$,
revisiting a reflection inequality by James, which is of independent interest
for the study of sequential decision making strategies.

excluding the $l<30$ temperature and polarization likelihoods; $iii)$ imposing
early universe priors, that disentangle early and late time physics. Through a
joint analysis with low-redshift supernovae type-Ia and gravitationally lensed
time delay datasets, {and neglecting galaxy clustering Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) data}, we find that the inclusion of early universe CMB
priors is consistent with the local estimate of $H_0$ while excluding the
low-$l$+lowE likelihoods mildly relaxes the tension. This is in contrast to
joint analyses with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of
contrasting the effect of different CMB priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that
the early universe information from the CMB data when decoupled from late-times
physics could be in agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no
evidence for the early dark energy model using only the early universe physics
within the CMB data. Finally using the BAO data in different redshift ranges to
perform inverse distance ladder analysis, we find that the early universe
modifications, while being perfectly capable of alleviating the $H_0$-tension
when including the BAO galaxy clustering data, would be at odds with the
Ly-$\alpha$ BAO data due to the difference in $r_{\rm d}\, vs.\, H_0$
correlation between the two BAO datasets.} We therefore infer and speculate
that source for the $H_0$-tension between CMB and local estimates could
possibly originate in the modeling of late-time physics within the CMB
analysis. This in turn recasts the $H_0$-tension as an effect of late-time
physics in CMB, instead of the current early-time CMB vs. local late-time
physics perspective.

convex optimization problem can be obtained by solving an SDP followed from a
new development of the $\mathcal{S}$-procedure. The optimal solution can be
approximated by conducting a bisection method on $[0,2\pi].$ On the other hand,
if the joint numerical range of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is non-convex, the respective

images using a generic, high-dimensional feature extractor. We then classified
the images using machine learning for the sake of understanding the
contribution of each feature in decision and execution time. We found that the
non-linear-classifier random forests outperformed Fisher's linear discriminant.
More importantly, the most discriminant and time-consuming features could be
excluded without any significant loss in accuracy, offering a substantial gain
in execution time. It suggests a feature-group redundancy likely related to the
biology of the observed cells. We offer a method to select fast and
discriminant features. In our assay, a 79.6 $\pm$ 2.4 % accurate classification
of a cell took 68.7 $\pm$ 3.5 ms (mean $\pm$ SD, 5-fold cross-validation nested
in 10 bootstrap repeats), corresponding to 14 cells per second, dispatched into
8 phases of the cell cycle using 12 feature-groups and operating a consumer
market ARM-based embedded system. Interestingly, a simple neural network
offered similar performances paving the way to faster training and
classification, using parallel execution on a general-purpose graphic
processing unit. Finally, this strategy is also usable for deep neural networks
paving the way to optimising these algorithms for smart microscopy.

${R{+}RF(\Box)R}$ are derived under the assumption that the conditions can be
imposed by avoiding the `ill-defined expressions' in the theory of
distributions term by term in infinite summations. We find that the junction
conditions of such non-local theories are much more restrictive than in local
theories, since the conditions comprise an infinite number of equations for the
Ricci scalar. These conditions can constrain the geometry far beyond the
matching hypersurface. Furthermore, we derive the junction field equations
which are satisfied by the energy-momentum on the hypersurface. It turns out
that the theory still allows some matter content on the hypersurface (without
external flux and external tension), but with a traceless energy-momentum
tensor. We also discuss the proper matching condition where no matter is
concentrated on the hypersurface. Finally, we explore the possible applications
and consequences of our results to the braneworld scenarios and star models.
Particularly, we find that the internal tension is given purely by the trace of
the energy-momentum tensor of the matter confined to the brane. Consequences of
the junction conditions are illustrated on two simple examples of static and
collapsing stars. It is demonstrated that even without solving the field
equations the geometry on one side of the hypersurface can be determined to a
great extent by the geometry on the other side if the Ricci scalar is analytic.
We further show that some usual star models in the general relativity are no

studies the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted reliably per
unit-energy as a function of $\ell_n$ and $k_n$. When all users are active with
probability one, i.e., $\ell_n = k_n$, it is demonstrated that if $k_n$ is of
an order strictly below $n/\log n$, then each user can achieve the single-user
capacity per unit-energy $(\log e)/N_0$ (where $N_0/ 2$ is the noise power) by
using an orthogonal-access scheme. In contrast, if $k_n$ is of an order
strictly above $n/\log n$, then the capacity per unit-energy is zero.
Consequently, there is a sharp transition between orders of growth where
interference-free communication is feasible and orders of growth where reliable
communication at a positive rate per unit-energy is infeasible. It is further
demonstrated that orthogonal-access schemes in combination with orthogonal
codebooks, which achieve the capacity per unit-energy when the number of users

  When the user activity is random, i.e., when $\ell_n$ and $k_n$ are
different, it is demonstrated that if $k_n\log \ell_n$ is sublinear in $n$,
then each user can achieve the single-user capacity per unit-energy $(\log

capacity per unit-energy is zero. Consequently, there is again a sharp
transition between orders of growth where interference-free communication is
feasible and orders of growth where reliable communication at a positive rate
is infeasible that depends on the asymptotic behaviours of both $\ell_n$ and

$\varepsilon$-close in probability and in $L^q$. The first theorem applies to
dropout networks in the random mode. It assumes little on the activation
function, applies to a wide class of networks, and can even be applied to
approximation schemes other than neural networks. The core is an algebraic
property that shows that deterministic networks can be exactly matched in
expectation by random networks. The second theorem makes stronger assumptions
and gives a stronger result. Given a function to approximate, it provides
existence of a network that approximates in both modes simultaneously. Proof
components are a recursive replacement of edges by independent copies, and a
special first-layer replacement that couples the resulting larger network to
the input.
  The functions to be approximated are assumed to be elements of general normed
spaces, and the approximations are measured in the corresponding norms. The
networks are constructed explicitly. Because of the different methods of proof,
the two results give independent insight into the approximation properties of
random dropout networks. With this, we establish that dropout neural networks
broadly satisfy a universal-approximation property.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO), predominantly observed in black-hole

from the relativistic jet. In this state, the X-ray spectrum is characterised
by a soft-thermal blackbody-like emission due to the accretion disc, an iron
emission line (in the 6-7 keV range), and a power-law like hard component due
to Inverse-Compton scattering of the soft-photon source by hot electrons in a
corona or the relativistic jet itself. The spectral-timing properties of MAXI

assumes a sinusoidal coherent oscillation of the Comptonised X-ray flux and the
physical parameters of the corona at the QPO frequency, to fit simultaneously
the energy-dependent fractional rms amplitude and phase lags of this QPO. We
show that two physically-connected Comptonisation regions can successfully
explain the radiative properties of the QPO in the full 0.8-10 keV energy

detected outburst of the ~60 min orbital period AM CVn SDSS J113732+405458.
Using X-ray and UV observations we determined an upper limit duration of the
event of about one year. The amplitude of the outburst was remarkably small, of
around one magnitude in r and 0.5 magnitudes in g. We have also investigated
the color variations of SDSS J113732+405458 and other long period AM CVns in
outbursts and identified a track on the color-magnitude diagram that is not
compatible with the predictions of the disk instability model, suggesting that
some outbursts in long period AM CVns are caused by enhanced mass-transfer. To
our knowledge, these are the first studies of the color evolution in AM CVns.
During quiescence we measured an X-ray luminosity for SDSS J113732+405458 of
~3E29 erg/s in the 0.5-10 keV band. This indicates a very low accretion rate,
in agreement with the disk instability model for long period systems. However,
such a model predicts stable disks at somewhat long periods. The discovery of
this system outburst, along with similarities to the long period system SDSS
J080710+485259 with a comparably long, weak outburst, indicates that these
enhanced mass-transfer events may be more common in long period AM CVns. A
larger sample would be needed to determine empirically at what period, if any,
the disk instability stops functioning entirely. Finally, we identified an
infrared excess in the quiescence spectrum attributable to the donor. This
makes SDSS J113732+405458 the second AM CVn to have a directly detected donor.

the diffusion of germanium atoms in the opposite direction, into the

networks on classical computing platforms, such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, has
been widely studied; however, when the scale of the application consistently
grows up, the memory bottleneck becomes obvious, widely known as memory-wall.
In response to such a challenge, advanced quantum computing, which can

solution. It is imminent to know how to design the quantum circuit for
accelerating neural networks. Most recently, there are initial works studying
how to map neural networks to actual quantum processors. To better understand
the state-of-the-art design and inspire new design methodology, this paper
carries out a case study to demonstrate an end-to-end implementation. On the

towards quantization, we derive a complete classification of the positive-area
coadjoint orbits of this group for boundaries that are topologically a

representations of the Poincar\'e group since both groups have the structure of
a semidirect product. We find that the total area is a Casimir of the algebra,
analogous to mass in the Poincar\'e group. A further infinite family of
Casimirs can be constructed from the curvature of the normal bundle of the

approximating two ordered probability measures by two finitely supported ones.
Indeed, when the convex order dominating original probability measure is
compactly supported, it is smaller than any of its dual quantizations while the
dominated original measure is greater than any of its stationary (and therefore
any of its optimal) quadratic primal quantization. Moreover, the quantization
errors then correspond to martingale couplings between each original
probability measure and its quantization. This permits to prove that any
martingale coupling between the original probability measures can be
approximated by a martingale coupling between their quantizations in Wassertein

finer adapted Wassertein distance. As a consequence, while the stability of
(Weak) Martingale Optimal Transport problems with respect to the marginal

of an order-preserving map from the higher Bruhat orders to the first higher

of a cubillage of a cyclic zonotope. We provide a new proof that this map is

Array Low-Energy Extension (TALE) air fluorescence detector (FD). By making use
of the Cherenkov light signal in addition to air fluorescence light from cosmic
ray (CR) induced extensive air showers, the TALE FD can measure the properties
of the cosmic rays with energies as low as $\sim 2$ PeV and exceeding 1 EeV. In
this paper, we present results on the measurement of $X_{\rm max}$
distributions of showers observed over this energy range. Data collected over a
period of $\sim 4$ years was analyzed for this study. The resulting $X_{\rm
max}$ distributions are compared to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulated data
distributions for primary cosmic rays with varying composition and a
4-component fit is performed. The comparison and fit are performed for energy
bins, of width 0.1 or 0.2 in $\log_{10} (E/{\rm eV})$, spanning the full range
of the measured energies. We also examine the mean $X_{\rm max}$ value as a
function of energy for cosmic rays with energies greater than $10^{15.8}$ eV.
Below $10^{17.3}$ eV, the slope of the mean $X_{\rm max}$ as a function of
energy (the elongation rate) for the data is significantly smaller than that of
all elements in the models, indicating that the composition is becoming heavier
with energy in this energy range. This is consistent with a rigidity-dependent
cutoff of events from galactic sources. Finally, an increase in the $X_{\rm
max}$ elongation rate is observed at energies just above $10^{17}$ eV
indicating another change in the cosmic rays composition.

separated particles constitute an essential prerequisite both for testing the
foundations of quantum mechanics and for realizing future quantum technologies.
Splitting of Cooper pairs from a superconductor provides entangled electrons at
separate locations. However, experimentally accessing the individual split
Cooper pairs constitutes a major unresolved issue as they mix together with
electrons from competing processes. Here, we overcome this challenge with the
first real-time observation of the splitting of individual Cooper pairs,
enabling direct access to the time-resolved statistics of Cooper pair
splitting. We determine the correlation statistics arising from two-electron
processes and find a pronounced peak that is two orders of magnitude larger
than the background. Our experiment thereby allows to unambiguously pinpoint
and select split Cooper pairs with 99 % fidelity. These results open up an
avenue for performing experiments that tap into the spin-entanglement of split
Cooper pairs.

detectors were also used to benchmark the performance of i-TED. The i-TED
prototype built for this study shows a factor of $\sim$3 higher detection
sensitivity than state-of-the-art \cds detectors in the $\sim$10~keV neutron

improved metal detection, has the potential to reduce the number of attacks and
improve public safety and security. To achieve this, there is considerable
potential to use the fields applied and measured by a metal detector to
discriminate between different shapes and different metals since, hidden within
the field perturbation, is object characterisation information. The magnetic
polarizability tensor (MPT) offers an economical characterisation of metallic
objects that can be computed for different threat and non-threat objects and
has an established theoretical background, which shows that the induced voltage
is a function of the hidden object's MPT coefficients. In this paper, we
describe the additional characterisation information that measurements of the
induced voltage over a range of frequencies offer compared to measurements at a
single frequency. We call such object characterisations its MPT spectral
signature. Then, we present a series of alternative rotational invariants for
the purpose of classifying hidden objects using MPT spectral signatures.
Finally, we include examples of computed MPT spectral signature
characterisations of realistic threat and non-threat objects that can be used
to train machine learning algorithms for classification purposes.

curiosity to a diverse extragalactic population with established host galaxies
and energy scales. While a wide range of models remain viable, the central
engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed
by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts.
Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on
the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our
understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the
intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms
and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there
could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio
bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also
emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo,
which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight. The future
of science with fast radio bursts appears bright.

The quantum mechanical exchange interaction between spins is responsible for
the phenomenon of magnetic order, and is generally considered to be uniform
across bulk magnetic systems. Partly inspired by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction--also known as antisymmetric exchange--we use a linearly varying
exchange interaction along a magnetic strip as a route to spatial inversion
symmetry-breaking. We find that, in addition to asymmetric modes and
localization, spatially-varying exchange can be used to design nonreciprocal
magnetic signal excitation at frequencies that are tunable. Moreover, our work
predicts nonreciprocity to occur across a vast range of frequencies up to
hundreds of GHz. Such spin wave engineering is a key area of ongoing research
in the fields of magnonics and spintronics, which are expected to enable the
next generation of communication technology. Analogous nonreciprocity is
expected to occur in other wave systems with gradient properties.

the phase difference between longitudinal laser modes is fixed but not zero.
This results in a linearly chirped output in the time domain with nearly

such a comb regime can also exist in vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting

valuable resources such as fisheries, forests and wildlife. While real-world
deployment involves both resource allocation and subsequent coordinated
patrolling with communication and real-time, uncertain information, previous
game models do not fully address both of these stages simultaneously.
Furthermore, adopting existing solution strategies is difficult since they do
not scale well for larger, more complex variants of the game models.
  We therefore first propose a novel GSG model that combines defender
allocation, patrolling, real-time drone notification to human patrollers, and
drones sending warning signals to attackers. The model further incorporates
uncertainty for real-time decision-making within a team of drones and human
patrollers. Second, we present CombSGPO, a novel and scalable algorithm based
on reinforcement learning, to compute a defender strategy for this game model.
CombSGPO performs policy search over a multi-dimensional, discrete action space
to compute an allocation strategy that is best suited to a best-response
patrolling strategy for the defender, learnt by training a multi-agent Deep
Q-Network. We show via experiments that CombSGPO converges to better strategies
and is more scalable than comparable approaches. Third, we provide a detailed
analysis of the coordination and signaling behavior learnt by CombSGPO, showing
group formation between defender resources and patrolling formations based on
signaling and notifications between resources. Importantly, we find that
strategic signaling emerges in the final learnt strategy. Finally, we perform
experiments to evaluate these strategies under different levels of uncertainty.

inconsistent with the Golden Rule, and non-power law scaling, depending on the

show that it describes the thermostatic properties of the state all along the

affine linearly on the state. However, because the infinite-dimensional cone of
positive self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt operators has empty interior, we do not
consider a diffusion term. This empty interior also demands a new approach to
proving existence: instead of using standard localisation techniques, we employ
the theory on generalized Feller semigroups introduced in D\""orsek and
Teichmann [arXiv 2010] and further developed in Cuchiero and Teichmann [Journal

warmer than its apex by typically 10$^{\circ}$C, which is likely to trigger

effective thermocapillary surface stress, using only one adjustable parameter.

and current approaches suffer from sparse and partial point clouds of distant

namely PC-RGNN, dealing with such challenges by two specific solutions. On the
one hand, we introduce a point cloud completion module to recover high-quality
proposals of dense points and entire views with original structures preserved.
On the other hand, a graph neural network module is designed, which
comprehensively captures relations among points through a local-global
attention mechanism as well as multi-scale graph based context aggregation,
substantially strengthening encoded features. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI benchmark show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art baselines by remarkable margins, highlighting its
effectiveness.

readout noise can be reduced to sub-electron levels by averaging independent

determined by counting the exact number of electrons. The total readout time is
proportional to the number of measurements of the charge in each pixel. For
some applications this time may be too long; however, researchers usually are
interested only on certain region within the matrix of pixels. In this paper we
present the development of a smart skipper readout technique that allows the
user to specify regions of interest of the CCD matrix where an arbitrary (high)
number of measurements of the same charge can taken to obtain the desired noise
level, and far less measurements are performed in those regions that are less
interesting to the researcher, therefore reducing the total readout time.

class means and increase Fisher ratios. On the opposite, a soft-thresholding on
tight frames can reduce within-class variabilities while preserving class
means. Variance reduction bounds are proved for Gaussian mixture models. For

with rectified wavelet tight frames that are not learned. It defines a

characterize non planar graphs $G_I(\Lambda)$ corresponding to irreducible

produce the first time-domain simulations that include both HWP non-idealities

cause significant B-mode residuals that will have to be extensively modelled in

When a decision tree is used to differentiate between a user's benign and

the model by perturbing the inputs the model receives. We can use algorithms
that take adversarial attacks into account to fit trees that are more robust.
In this work we propose an algorithm, GROOT, that is two orders of magnitude
faster than the state-of-the-art-work while scoring competitively on accuracy
against adversaries. GROOT accepts an intuitive and permissible threat model.
Where previous threat models were limited to distance norms, we allow each
feature to be perturbed with a user-specified parameter: either a maximum
distance or constraints on the direction of perturbation. Previous works
assumed that both benign and malicious users attempt model evasion but we allow
the user to select which classes perform adversarial attacks. Additionally, we
introduce a hyperparameter rho that allows GROOT to trade off performance in
the regular and adversarial settings.

forces, can adopt unique behaviors and configurations. An important challenge
in the design of novel materials which utilize such properties is to precisely
connect the static structure of active systems to the dissipation of energy
induced by the local driving. Here, we use tools from liquid-state theories and
machine learning to take on this challenge. We first demonstrate analytically
for an isotropic active matter system that dissipation and pair correlations
are closely related when driving forces behave like an active temperature. We
then extend a nonequilibrium mean-field framework for predicting these pair
correlations, which unlike most existing approaches is applicable even for
strongly interacting particles and far from equilibrium, to predicting
dissipation in these systems. Based on this theory, we reveal a robust analytic
relation between dissipation and structure which holds even as the system
approaches a nonequilibrium phase transition. Finally, we construct a neural
network which maps static configurations of particles to their dissipation rate
without any prior knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Our results open novel
perspectives on the interplay between dissipation and organization

primarily from KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ ($0.6\lesssim{z}\lesssim{2.6}$) and 471 galaxies
from SAMI ($z<0.113$). We select galaxies that do not show evidence of AGN
activity or outflows, to constrain the average conditions within H II regions.
Measurements of the [SII]$\lambda$6716/[SII]$\lambda$6731 ratio in four
redshift bins indicate that the local $n_e$ in the line-emitting material
decreases from 187$^{+140}_{-132}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim$ 2.2 to 32$^{+4}_{-9}$
cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim$ 0; consistent with previous results. We use the H$\alpha$
luminosity to estimate the root-mean-square (rms) $n_e$ averaged over the
volumes of star-forming disks at each redshift. The local and volume-averaged
$n_e$ evolve at similar rates, hinting that the volume filling factor of the
line-emitting gas may be approximately constant across
$0\lesssim{z}\lesssim{2.6}$. The KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ and SAMI galaxies follow a
roughly monotonic trend between $n_e$ and star formation rate, but the
KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ galaxies have systematically higher $n_e$ than the SAMI
galaxies at fixed offset from the star-forming main sequence, suggesting a link
between the $n_e$ evolution and the evolving main sequence normalization. We
quantitatively test potential drivers of the density evolution and find that
$n_e$(rms) $\simeq{n_{H_2}}$, suggesting that the elevated $n_e$ in high-$z$ H
II regions could plausibly be the direct result of higher densities in the
parent molecular clouds. There is also tentative evidence that $n_e$ could be
influenced by the balance between stellar feedback, which drives the expansion
of H II regions, and the ambient pressure, which resists their expansion.

Nambu-Goldstone bosons of broken conformal and global symmetries. We derive the
low-energy effective action that describes this class of RG flows from basic
symmetry principles. We view the theory of Nambu-Goldstone bosons as a theory
in anti-de Sitter space with the flat space limit. This enables an equivalent
CFT$_3$ formulation of these 4d RG flows in terms of spectral deformations of a
generalized free CFT$_3$. We utilize this dual description to impose further
constraints on the low energy effective action associated with unitary RG flows
in 4d by invoking the chaos bound in 3d. This approach naturally provides a set
of independent monotonically decreasing $C$-functions for 4d RG flows with
global symmetry breaking by explicitly relating 4d $C$-functions with certain
out-of-time-order correlators that diagnose chaos in 3d. We also comment on a

question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for

Developments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of

this work, we report the experimental realisation of such a zero-knowledge
protocol involving two separated verifier-prover pairs. Security is enforced
via the physical principle of special relativity, and no computational

For the integrated correlator, we find color-kinematics does not yield

representation of the bulk-to-bulk propagator so that AdS diagrams are similar

conclude that they originate from a common disk radius in the innermost region

the compact accretor is a neutron star (NS) and the position of the inner disk
is the Alfv\'{e}n radius, we placed an upper limit on the magnetic field
strength to be $B\leq0.7(D/7\ \mathrm {kpc})\times10^{8}$ G at the poles. Given
the lack of pulsations detected and position of $R_{\rm in}$, it was likely
that a boundary layer region had formed between the NS surface and inner edge
of the accretion disk with an extent of 1.2 km. This implies a maximum radius
of the neutron star accretor of $R_{\mathrm{NS}}\leq 12.1$ km when assuming a

interesting to explore in this quantum gravitational setting. In this work, we
explore this unified phenomenological model for a spatially flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe in LQC filled with dust
and a scalar field in an Ekpyrotic scenario like negative potential. Background
dynamics and the power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbations are
numerically analyzed with various initial conditions and a suitable choice of
the initial states. By varying the initial conditions we consider different
cases of dust and Ekpyrotic field domination in the contracting phase. We use
the dressed metric approach to numerically compute the primordial power
spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbations which turns out to be almost
scale invariant for the modes which exit the horizon in the matter-dominated
phase. But, in contrast with a constant magnitude power spectrum obtained under
approximation of a constant Ekpyrotic equation of state using deformed algebra
approach in an earlier work, we find that the magnitude of power spectrum
changes during evolution. Our analysis shows that the bouncing regime only
leaves imprints on the modes outside the scale-invariant regime. However, an
analysis of the spectral index shows inconsistency with the observational data,
thus making further improvements in such a model necessary.

revealed an abundance and ubiquity of rings and gaps over a large sample of
young planet-forming disks, which are hypothesised to be induced by the
presence of forming planets. In this context, we present the first attempt to
directly image these young companions for 10 of the DSHARP disks, by using
NaCo/VLT high contrast observations in L'-band instrument and angular
differential imaging techniques. We report the detection of a point-like source
candidate at 1.1"" (174.9 au) for RU Lup, and at 0.42"" (55 AU) for Elias 24. In
the case of RU Lup, the proper motion of the candidate is consistent with a
stationary background contaminant, based on the astrometry derived from our
observations and available archival data. For Elias 24 the point-like source
candidate is located in one of the disk gaps at 55 AU. Assuming it is a
planetary companion, our analysis suggest a mass ranging from $0.5 M_J$ up to
$5 M_J$, depending on the presence of a circumplanetary disk and its
contribution to the luminosity of the system. However, no clear confirmation is
obtained at this stage, and follow-up observations are mandatory to verify if
the proposed source is physical, comoving with the stellar host, and associated
with a young massive planet sculpting the gap observed at 55\,AU. For all the
remaining systems, the lack of detections suggests the presence of planetary
companions with masses lower than $5M_J$, based on our derived mass detection
limits. This is consistent with predictions of both hydrodynamical simulations
and kinematical signatures on the disk, and allows us to set upper limits on
the presence of massive planets in these young disks.

12CO, CN, and CS trace layers of increasing density and decreasing temperature.
We find that at radii > 100 au from the central star, CN emission arises
predominantly from intermediate layers, while in the inner region of the disk,
CN appears to arise from layers closer to the midplane. We investigate disk
physical conditions within the CN emitting regions, as well as the ranges of CN
excitation temperature and column density, via RADEX non-LTE modeling of the
three brightest CN hyperfine lines. Near the disk midplane, where we derive
densities nH2 ~10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$ at relatively low T$_{kin}$ (~12 K), we find
that CN is thermalized, while sub-thermal, non-LTE conditions appear to obtain
for CN emission from higher (intermediate) disk layers. We consider whether and
how the particular spatial location and excitation conditions of CN emission
from the Flying Saucer can be related to CN production that is governed,
radially and vertically, by the degree of irradiation of the flared disk by
X-rays and UV photons from the central star.

resources of which mobile edge server (MES) should be allocated to which user
equipment (UE). The existing resource allocation schemes only consider CPU as
the requested resource and assume utility for MESs as either a random variable
or dependent on the requested CPU only. This paper presents a novel
comprehensive utility function for resource allocation in MEC. The utility
function considers the heterogeneous nature of applications that a UE offloads
to MES. The proposed utility function considers all important parameters,
including CPU, RAM, hard disk space, required time, and distance, to calculate
a more realistic utility value for MESs. Moreover, we improve upon some general
algorithms, used for resource allocation in MEC and cloud computing, by
considering our proposed utility function. We name the improved versions of
these resource allocation schemes as comprehensive resource allocation schemes.
The UE requests are modeled to represent the amount of resources requested by
the UE as well as the time for which the UE has requested these resources. The
utility function depends upon the UE requests and the distance between UEs and
MES, and serves as a realistic means of comparison between different types of
UE requests. Choosing (or selecting) an optimal MES with the optimal amount of
resources to be allocated to each UE request is a challenging task. We show
that MES resource allocation is sub-optimal if CPU is the only resource
considered. By taking into account the other resources, i.e., RAM, disk space,
request time, and distance in the utility function, we demonstrate improvement
in the resource allocation algorithms in terms of service rate, utility, and
MES energy consumption.

$n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace, has important
applications in machine learning, signal processing and statistics, mainly as a
convex relaxation for optimization problems with low-rank matrices. It is also
one of the most prominent examples in the theory of first-order methods for
convex optimization in which non-Euclidean methods can be significantly
preferable to their Euclidean counterparts. In particular, the desirable choice
is the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) method which is based on the Bregman
distance induced by the (negative) von Neumann entropy. Unfortunately,
implementing MEG requires a full SVD computation on each iteration, which is
not scalable to high-dimensional problems. In this work we propose an efficient
implementations of MEG, both with deterministic and stochastic gradients, which
are tailored for optimization with low-rank matrices, and only use a single
low-rank SVD computation on each iteration. We also provide
efficiently-computable certificates for the correct convergence of our methods.
Mainly, we prove that under a strict complementarity condition, the suggested
methods converge from a ``warm-start"" initialization with similar rates to
their full-SVD-based counterparts. Finally, we bring empirical experiments
which both support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical
appeal of our methods.

these ground states, and their response to the attacks, by calculating
distributions of network measures of an emergent network whose link weights are
the pairwise mutual information between spins. We focus on attacks which
projectively measure spins. We find that the emergent networks in the ground
state do not satisfy the usual criteria for complexity, and their average
properties are captured well by a single dimensionless parameter in the
Hamiltonian. While the response of classical networks to attacks is
well-studied, where classical complex networks are known to be more robust to
random attacks than random networks, we find counterintuitive results for our
quantum networks. We find that the ground states for Hamiltonians defined on
different classes of imprinted networks respond similarly to all our attacks,
and the attacks rescale the average properties of the emergent network by a
constant factor. Mean field theory explains these results for relatively dense
networks, but we also find the simple rescaling behavior away from the regime
of validity of mean field theory. Our calculations indicate that complex spin
networks are not more robust to projective measurement attacks, and presumably
also other quantum attacks, than non-complex spin networks, in contrast to the

confirms a previous pressure study based on electrical resistivity and Hall

the interpretation that this effect is driven by the pressure-induced shift of
the van Hove point. It implies that the pseudogap only exists when the Fermi

equations, we derive a set of the first-order differential equations describing
the translational and rotational motions of such particles characterized by
small Reynolds numbers. Since the gradient magnetic field generates both the
translations and rotations of particles, these motions are coupled. Based on
the derived set of equations, we demonstrate this fact explicitly by expressing
the particle position through the particle orientation angle, and vice versa.
The obtained expressions are used to show that the solution of the basic set of
equations is periodic in time and to determine the intervals, where the
particle coordinate and orientation angle oscillate. In addition, this set of
equations is solved approximately for the case of small characteristic
frequency of the particle oscillations. With this condition, we find that all
particles perform small translational oscillations near their initial
positions. In contrast, the orientation angle oscillates near the initial angle
only if particles are located in the vicinity of zero point of the gradient
magnetic field. The possible applications of the obtained results in
biomedicine and separation processes are also discussed.

thin films fabricated by sputter deposition, to date rare-earth-free sub-20 nm
Mn4N films with PMA have only been reported to be achieved by molecular beam
epitaxy, which is not suitable for massive production. Here we report the
successful thermal growth of sub-20 nm Mn4N films with PMA at 400-450 {\deg}C
substrate temperatures on MgO substrates by reactive sputtering. The Mn4N films
were achieved by reducing the surface roughness of MgO substrate through a
high-temperature vacuum annealing process. The optimal films showed low
saturation magnetization (Ms = 43 emu/cc), low magnetic anisotropy energy (0.7
Merg/cc), and a remanent magnetization to saturation magnetization ratio
(Mr/Ms) near 1 at room temperature. Preliminary ab-initio density functional

the most energetic laboratory neutrinos ever studied. While charged current
neutrino scattering events can be cleanly identified by an energetic lepton
exiting the interaction vertex, neutral current interactions are more difficult
to detect. We explore the potential of FASER$\nu$ to observe neutrino neutral
current scattering $\nu N \to \nu N$, demonstrating techniques to discriminate
neutrino scattering events from neutral hadron backgrounds as well as to
estimate the incoming neutrino energy given the deep inelastic scattering final
state. We find that deep neural networks trained on kinematic observables allow
for the measurement of the neutral current scattering cross section over
neutrino energies from 100 GeV to several TeV. Such a measurement can be
interpreted as a probe of neutrino non-standard interactions that is
complementary to limits from other tests such as oscillations and coherent
neutrino-nucleus scattering.

Bang model has been limited by the long-standing lithium problem. Recent work
presented a self-consistent perturbative analysis of the effects of variations
in nature's fundamental constants on primordial nucleosynthesis for a broad
class of grand unified theory models, showing that such models provide a
possible solution to the lithium problem, provided the value of the
fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at the nucleosynthesis epoch is larger than
the current laboratory one by a few parts per million of relative variation.
Here we extend the earlier analysis, focusing on how this preferred value of
$\alpha$ is affected if relevant cosmological parameters are also allowed to
vary--specifically focusing on the baryon-to-photon ratio, the number of
neutrinos, and the neutron lifetime. We rephrase the lithium problem in terms
of the values of these parameters that would be needed to solve it within this
class of grand unified theories, thus obtaining values that would disagree with
the results of other experiments by several standard deviations. Using these
experimental results as priors in the analysis, we find that a larger value of
$\alpha$ is still preferred, confirming our previous results. By excluding
lithium from the analysis, we also obtain upper limits on possible variations
of $\alpha$ at the primordial nucleosynthesis epoch. At the two-sigma level,
these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|<50$ ppm without nuclear physics, cosmology, or
atomic clocks priors, or alternatively $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|<5$ ppm if these
priors are used. While the simplest solution to the lithium problem is likely
to be found within observational astrophysics, our work shows that varying
fundamental constants remain a viable alternative.

large-scale structure. We measure this bias for the dark matter, and interpret
it as the bias of regions of the Lagrangian density field that are selected

is a critical step in achieving fault tolerant two-qubit gates mediated by the
exchange interaction. This work explores how the physical device geometry
affects the sensitivity of exchange to fluctuations in applied gate voltage and
interdot bias due to charge noise. We present a modified linear combination of
harmonic orbitals configuration interaction (LCHO-CI) method for calculating
exchange energies that is applicable to general quantum dot networks. In the
modified LCHO-CI approach, an orthogonal set of harmonic orbitals formed at the
center of the dot network is used to approximate the many-electron states. This
choice of basis significantly reduces the computation time of the full CI
calculation by enabling a pre-calculated library of matrix elements to be used
in evaluating the Coulomb integrals. The resultant many-electron spectra are
mapped onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian to determine the individual pairwise
electronic exchange interaction strengths, $J_{ij}$. The accuracy of the
modified LCHO-CI method is further improved by optimizing the choice of
harmonic orbitals without significantly lengthening the calculation time. The
modified LCHO-CI method is used to calculate $J$ for a silicon MOSFET double
quantum dot occupied by two electrons. Two-dimensional potential landscapes are
calculated from a 3D device structure, including both the Si/SiO$_2$
heterostructure and metal gate electrodes. The computational efficiency of the
modified LCHO-CI method enables systematic tuning of the device parameters to
determine their impact on the sensitivity of $J$ to charge noise, including
plunger gate size, tunnel gate width, SiO$_2$ thickness and dot eccentricity.
Generally, we find that geometries with larger dot charging energies, smaller
plunger gate lever arms, and symmetric dots are less sensitive to noise.

second. On the other hand the scale invariant model effectively has a
time-dependent cosmological constant. In this case we show that a matter

visualization of changing conformations that are important for processes
ranging from enzyme catalysis to signaling. A protein exhibiting conformational
dynamics is the soluble blood protein beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI), which
exists in two conformations: the closed (circular) form and the open (linear)
form. It is hypothesized that an increased proportion of the open conformation
leads to the autoimmune disease antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A
characteristic feature of beta2GPI is the high content of lysine residues.
However, the potential role of lysine in the conformational dynamics of
beta2GPI has been poorly investigated. Here, we report on a strategy to
permanently open up the closed protein conformation by chemical acetylation of
lysine residues using acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS-Ac). Specific
and complete acetylation was demonstrated by the quantification of primary
amino groups with fluoraldehyde o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent, as well as
western blot analysis with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Our results
demonstrate that acetylated beta2GPI preserves its secondary and tertiary
structures, as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that after
lysine acetylation, the majority of proteins are in the open conformation as
revealed by atomic force microscopy high-resolution images. Using this
strategy, we proved that the electrostatic interaction of lysine residues plays
a major role in stabilizing the beta2GPI closed conformation, as confirmed by
lysine charge distribution calculations. We foresee that our approach will be
applied to other lysine-rich proteins (e.g. histones) undergoing conformational
transitions.

immunity and cancer. In response to intracellular signals and ligand binding,
integrins adopt different conformations: the bent (resting) form; the
intermediate extended form; and the ligand-occupied active form. An integrin
undergoing such conformational dynamics is the heterodimeric platelet receptor
alphaIIbbeta3. Although the dramatic rearrangement of the overall structure of
alphaIIbbeta3 during the activation process is potentially related to changes
in the protein secondary structure, this has not been investigated so far in a
membrane environment. Here we examine the Mn2+- and drug-induced activation of
alphaIIbbeta3 and the impact on the structure of this protein reconstituted
into liposomes. By quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and
activation assays we show that Mn2+ induces binding of the
conformation-specific antibody PAC-1, which only recognizes the extended,
active integrin. Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals, however, that
Mn2+-treatment does not induce major secondary structural changes of
alphaIIbbeta3. Similarly, we found that treatment with clinically relevant
drugs (e.g. quinine) led to the activation of alphaIIbbeta3 without significant
changes in protein secondary structure. Molecular dynamics simulation studies
revealed minor local changes in the beta-sheet probability of several
extracellular domains of the integrin. Our experimental setup represents a new
approach to study transmembrane proteins, especially integrins, in a membrane
environment and opens a new way for testing drug binding to integrins under
clinically relevant conditions.

segmentation, but typically require large amounts of training data, and have
not widely been benchmarked against pixel-wise segmentation models. We propose
Atlas-ISTN, a framework that jointly learns segmentation and registration on 2D

Atlas-ISTN learns to segment multiple structures of interest and to register
the constructed, topologically consistent atlas labelmap to an intermediate
pixel-wise segmentation. Additionally, Atlas-ISTN allows for test time
refinement of the model's parameters to optimize the alignment of the atlas
labelmap to an intermediate pixel-wise segmentation. This process both
mitigates for noise in the target image that can result in spurious pixel-wise
predictions, as well as improves upon the one-pass prediction of the model.
Benefits of the Atlas-ISTN framework are demonstrated qualitatively and
quantitatively on 2D synthetic data and 3D cardiac computed tomography and
brain magnetic resonance image data, out-performing both segmentation and

  The model clouds start from both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and are

mass categories and two metallicities each and different velocities. We allow
for self-gravity and thermal conduction or not. All models experience mass
diffusion, radiative cooling, and external heating leading to dissociation and
ionization.
  Our main findings are: 1) self-gravity stabilizes clouds against
Rayleigh-Taylor instability which are disrupted within 10 sound-crossing times
without; 2) clouds can develop Jeans-instable regions internally even though
they are initially below Jeans mass; 3) all clouds lose mass by ram pressure
and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; 4) thermal conduction substantially lowers
mass-loss rates, by this, extending the clouds' lifetimes, particularly, more
than doubling the lifetime of low-mass clouds; 5) thermal conduction leads to
continuous, filamentary stripping, while the removed gas is heated up quickly
and mixes efficiently with the ambient CGM; 6) without thermal conduction the
removed gas consists of dense, cool, clumpy fragments; 7) thermal conduction
might prevent CHVCs from forming stars; 8) clouds decelerated by means of drag
from the ambient CGM form head-tail shapes and collapse after they reach
velocities characteristic for intermediate-velocity clouds.
  Conclusively, only sophisticated modelling of CHVCs as non-homogeneous and
non-isothermal clouds with thermal conduction and self-gravity explains
observed morphologies and naturally leads to the suppression of star formation.

heterogeneous data sources. Integrating heterogeneous data sources is crucial,
especially in the biomedical domain, where central data-driven tasks such as
drug discovery rely on incorporating information from different biomedical
databases. These databases contain various biological entities and relations
such as proteins (PDB), genes (Gene Ontology), drugs (DrugBank), diseases
(DDB), and protein-protein interactions (BioGRID). The process of semantically
integrating heterogeneous biomedical databases is often riddled with
imperfections. The quality of data-driven drug discovery relies on the accuracy
of the mining methods used and the data's quality as well. Thus, having
complete and refined biomedical knowledge graphs is central to achieving more
accurate drug discovery outcomes. Here we propose using the latest graph
representation learning and embedding models to refine and complete biomedical
knowledge graphs. This preliminary work demonstrates learning discrete
representations of the integrated biomedical knowledge graph Chem2Bio2RD [3].
We perform a knowledge graph completion and refinement task using a simple
top-K cosine similarity measure between the learned embedding vectors to
predict missing links between drugs and targets present in the data. We show
that this simple procedure can be used alternatively to binary classifiers in

the latent group structure among the spatial locations while efficiently
utilizing the spatial dependence information. We derive a closed-form
conditional distribution for the proposed prior and introduce a new way to
compute the marginal likelihood that renders efficient Bayesian inference. We
further study the theoretical properties of the proposed MRF-PPM prior and show
a clustering consistency result for the posterior distribution. We demonstrate

interact with plots based on that data. The interaction can include
pan/zoom/rotate navigation, identifying individual points, and potentially

the client, this enables flexible remote visual exploration of large tables at
relatively low bandwidth. The web client can request any of the plot options

pathological alterations can be visualized by revealing the mechanical
properties of the tissue. Estimating tissue displacement in all directions is
required to accurately estimate the mechanical properties. Despite capabilities
of elastography techniques in estimating displacement in both axial and lateral
directions, estimation of axial displacement is more accurate than lateral
direction due to higher sampling frequency, higher resolution and having a
carrier signal propagating in the axial direction. Among different ultrasound
imaging techniques, Synthetic Aperture (SA) has better lateral resolution than
others, but it is not commonly used for ultrasound elastography due to its
limitation in imaging depth of field. Virtual source synthetic aperture (VSSA)
imaging is a technique to implement synthetic aperture beamforming on the
focused transmitted data to overcome limitation of SA in depth of field while
maintaining the same lateral resolution as SA. Besides lateral resolution, VSSA
has the capability of increasing sampling frequency in the lateral direction
without interpolation. In this paper, we utilize VSSA to perform beamforming to
enable higher resolution and sampling frequency in the lateral direction. The
beamformed data is then processed using our recently published elastography
technique, OVERWIND [1]. Simulation and experimental results show substantial

results, by accessing published large-scale dataset. However, due to the
non-smooth synthesis method, the fake samples in this dataset may expose
obvious artifacts (e.g., stark visual contrast, non-smooth boundary), which
were heavily relied on by most of the frame-level detection methods above. As
these artifacts do not come up in real media forgeries, the above methods can
suffer from a large degradation when applied to fake images that close to
reality. To improve the robustness for high-realism fake data, we propose the
Invariant Texture Learning (InTeLe) framework, which only accesses the
published dataset with low visual quality. Our method is based on the prior
that the microscopic facial texture of the source face is inevitably violated
by the texture transferred from the target person, which can hence be regarded
as the invariant characterization shared among all fake images. To learn such
an invariance for deepfake detection, our InTeLe introduces an auto-encoder
framework with different decoders for pristine and fake images, which are
further appended with a shallow classifier in order to separate out the obvious
artifact-effect. Equipped with such a separation, the extracted embedding by
encoder can capture the texture violation in fake images, followed by the
classifier for the final pristine/fake prediction. As a theoretical guarantee,
we prove the identifiability of such an invariance texture violation, i.e., to
be precisely inferred from observational data. The effectiveness and utility of
our method are demonstrated by promising generalization ability from
low-quality images with obvious artifacts to fake images with high realism.

supervision and fail to generate diverse solutions. In this paper, we address
this issue by introducing a \textit{weakly-supervised} paradigm for learning
MWPs. Our method only requires the annotations of the final answers and can
generate various solutions for a single problem. To boost weakly-supervised
learning, we propose a novel \textit{learning-by-fixing} (LBF) framework, which
corrects the misperceptions of the neural network via symbolic reasoning.
Specifically, for an incorrect solution tree generated by the neural network,
the \textit{fixing} mechanism propagates the error from the root node to the
leaf nodes and infers the most probable fix that can be executed to get the
desired answer. To generate more diverse solutions, \textit{tree
regularization} is applied to guide the efficient shrinkage and exploration of
the solution space, and a \textit{memory buffer} is designed to track and save
the discovered various fixes for each problem. Experimental results on the
Math23K dataset show the proposed LBF framework significantly outperforms
reinforcement learning baselines in weakly-supervised learning. Furthermore, it
achieves comparable top-1 and much better top-3/5 answer accuracies than
fully-supervised methods, demonstrating its strength in producing diverse
solutions.

However, this choice of communication format can miss important details and
lead to biased risk assessments. Here we develop, test, and demonstrate the

one of the active realms in AI. This paper considers extension-based concrete
and abstract semantics of argumentation. For concrete ones, based on Grossi and
Modgil's recent work, this paper considers some issues on graded
extension-based semantics of abstract argumentation framework (AAF, for short).
First, an alternative fundamental lemma is given, which generalizes the
corresponding result due to Grossi and Modgil by relaxing the constraint on
parameters. This lemma provides a new sufficient condition for preserving
conflict-freeness and brings a Galois adjunction between admissible sets and
complete extensions, which is of vital importance in constructing some special
extensions in terms of iterations of the defense function. Applying such a
lemma, some flaws in Grossi and Modgil's work are corrected, and the structural
property and universal definability of various extension-based semantics are
given. Second, an operator so-called reduced meet modulo an ultrafilter is
presented, which is a simple but powerful tool in exploring infinite AAFs. The
neutrality function and the defense function, which play central roles in
Dung's abstract argumentation theory, are shown to be distributive over reduced
meets modulo any ultrafilter. A variety of fundamental semantics of AAFs,
including conflict-free, admissible, complete and stable semantics, etc, are
shown to be closed under this operator. Based on this fact, a number of
applications of such operators are considered. In particular, we provide a
simple and uniform method to prove the universal definability of a family of
range related semantics. Since all graded concrete semantics considered in this
paper are generalizations of corresponding non-graded ones, all results about
them obtained in this paper also hold in the traditional situation.

IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take
advantages of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a
distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem
(corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The
relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to
further limit the error drift and improve the system robustness. Particularly,
we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle
body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples
for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU
DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and
heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed
distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holds
significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU
configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum

graphs without hedge overlaps, where edges are partitioned into subsets called
hedges that fail together. The hedge connectivity of a graph is the minimum
number of hedges whose removal disconnects the graph. This model is more
general than the hypergraph, which brings new computational challenges. It has
been a long open problem whether this problem is solvable in polynomial time.
In this paper, we study the combinatorial properties of hedge graph
connectivity without hedge overlaps, based on its extremal conditions as well
as hedge contraction operations, which provide new insights into its
algorithmic progress.

of two ac methods for measuring in-plane thermal conductivity of thin film
deposited on the back of a suspended SiNx membrane setup. Two parallel metal
strips are present on the top of the dielectric membrane. One strip (S1) serves
as both heater and thermometer, while another one (S2) acts as thermometer
only. For a modified phase shift (MPS) method, it is crucial to extract the
in-plane thermal diffusivity from the phase shift of the temperature
oscillation on S2. It was found that the frequency window for carrying out the
data fitting became narrower as the in-plane thermal diffusivity of the
composite membrane (${\alpha_{\parallel ,C}}$) increased, primarily due to the
failure of the semi-infinite width assumption in the low frequency region. To
ensure the validity of the method, the upper limit of ${\alpha_{\parallel ,C}}$
should not exceed ~1.8$ \times $10-5 m2 s-1 for the specific membrane dimension
under consideration (1$\times $1 mm2). On the other hand, inspired by a
modified Angstrom method proposed by Zhu recently, we suggest a new data
reduction methodology which takes advantage of the phase shift on both S1 and
S2 as well as the amplitude on S1. Based on the simulation results, it is
expected that the non-ideality associated with the three observables may be at
least partially cancelled out.Therefore, the frequency window selection for
carrying out the data fitting is not sensitive to the magnitude of
${\alpha_{\parallel ,C}}$. For typical specimen films whose in-plane thermal
conductivity ranges from 0.84 W m-1 K-1 to 50 W m-1 K-1, the method proposed
here yields a theoretical measurement uncertainty of less than 5%.

cooling (i.e., the effects of the optical thickness and non-LTE). The focus of
this paper is on describing our methodology but presents some new findings. Our
hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate that almost all of the incident X-ray and
UV energy from the host-star is converted into and lost by the radiative
emission of the coolant gas species such as Na, Mg, Mg$^+$, Si$^{2+}$,
Na$^{3+}$ and Si$^{3+}$. For an Earth-size planet orbiting 0.02~AU around a
young solar-type star, we find that the X-ray and UV heating efficiency is as
small as $1 \times 10^{-3}$, which corresponds to 0.3~$\Mearth$/Gyr of the mass
loss rate simply integrated over all the directions. Because of such efficient
cooling, the photo-evaporation of the mineral atmosphere on hot rocky
exoplanets with masses of $1\Mearth$ is not massive enough to exert a great
influence on the planetary mass and bulk composition. This suggests that
close-in high-density exoplanets with sizes larger than the Earth radius
survive in the high-UV environments.

to warm the planetary surface because of its strong absorption at far-infrared

a CO$_2$ atmosphere with a pressure of 3~bar. A wet and oxidized atmosphere is
expected to maintain sufficient quantities of H$_2$O$_2$ gas in its upper

all datasets, enabling a standard experimental pipeline for GNNs to help ensure
fair model architecture comparisons. We use node2vec and Laplacian eigenvectors
to perform data augmentation to investigate how input features affect the

node classification tasks. Increasing the number of model layers does not
improve the performance except on the PATTERN and CLUSTER datasets, in which
the graphs are not connected. Data augmentation is highly useful, especially

However, the significant magnitude of uphill energies in the multi-step NRR
pathways is a bottleneck of its serial reactions. Herein, the concept of a
parallelized reaction is proposed to actively promote NH3 production via the
NRR using a multi-phase vanadium oxide-nitride (V2O3/VN) hybrid system. Density
functional theory calculations revealed that the V2O3/VN junction parallelizes
NRR pathways by exchanging intermediate N2H4* and NH2* products to avoid
massive uphill energies towards final NH3 generation. Such an exchange is
driven by the difference in coverage of the two species. The impact of the
reaction parallelization strategy for multi-step nitrogen reduction is
demonstrated with the V2O3/VN junction by an increased ammonia yield rate of
18.36 micro mol h^-1 cm^-2 and a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 26.62% at -0.3 V
versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a 0.1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte, of
which FE value exhibits 16.95 times and 6.22 times higher than that of

problem. Some have ruled this theory out on grounds that entropic forces are by
nature noisy and entropic gravity would therefore display far more decoherence
than is observed in ultra-cold neutron experiments. We address this criticism
by modeling linear gravity acting on small objects as an open quantum system.
In the strong coupling limit, when the model's unitless free parameter $\sigma$
goes to infinity, the entropic master equation recovers conservative gravity.
We show that the proposed master equation is fully compatible with the
\textit{q}\textsc{Bounce} experiment for ultra-cold neutrons as long as
$\sigma\gtrsim 250$ at $90\%$ confidence. Furthermore, the entropic master
equation predicts energy increase and decoherence on long time scales and for
large masses, phenomena which tabletop experiments could test. In addition,
comparing entropic gravity's energy increase to that of the Di\'{o}si-Penrose
model for gravity induced decoherence indicates that the two theories are
incompatible. These findings support the theory of entropic gravity, motivating
future experimental and theoretical research.

Several methods have been developed to cluster such functional data. However,
these methods are not translation-invariant and thus cannot handle different
times of arrivals of the disease, nor can they consider external covariates and
so are unable to adjust for the population risk factors of each region. We
propose a novel three-step clustering method to circumvent these issues. As a
first step, feature extraction is performed by translation-invariant wavelet

step, single-index regression is used to neutralize disparities caused by
population risk factors. As a third step, a nonparametric mixture is fitted on
the regression residuals to achieve the region clustering. Supplementary

the log-likelihood on a held-out validation set. Next, we propose an iterative

along with the parameter updates and can be applied to any loss-based learning
algorithm. We then show that for a rich class of loss functions including
cross-entropy, hinge-loss, squared-loss, and logistic-loss, the inner discrete
data selection is an instance of (weakly) submodular optimization, and we
analyze conditions for which Glister-Online reduces the validation loss and
converges. Finally, we propose Glister-Active, an extension to batch active
learning, and we empirically demonstrate the performance of Glister on a wide

robust learning under label noise and imbalance settings, and (c) batch-active

Universe, we compare optically-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with
control star-forming and quiescent galaxies on galactic, inter-halo and larger
scales. We find that AGNs are preferentially found in two specific stages of
galaxy evolution: star-burst and `green valley' phases, and that the stellar
population of their host galaxies is quite independent of stellar mass,
different from normal galaxies. Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy
clustering on large scales, we measure the mass of AGN host halos. The typical
halo mass is about $10^{12}h^{-1}\rm M_{\odot}$, similar to the characteristic
mass in the stellar mass-halo mass relation (SHMR). For given stellar mass, AGN
host galaxies and star-forming galaxies share the same SHMR, while quiescent
galaxies have more massive halos. Clustering analysis on halo scales reveals
that AGNs are surrounded by a larger number of satellites (with stellar mass
down to 1/1000 of the mass of the central galaxy) than star-forming galaxies,
and that galaxies with larger stellar velocity dispersion have more satellites.
The number of satellites also increase with halo mass, reaching unity around
$10^{12}h^{-1}\rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest a scenario, in which the
interaction of the central galaxy with the satellites triggers an early episode
of star burst and AGN activities, followed by multiple AGN cycles driven by the
non-axisymmetric structure produced by the interaction. The feedback from the
starburst and AGN reduces the amount of cold gas for fueling the central black
hole, producing a characteristic halo mass scale, $\sim 10^{12}h^{-1}\rm
M_{\odot}$, where the AGN fraction peaks.

  the associated algorithms using enriched categories","Manuscrit d'habilitation \`a diriger des recherches, in French",,,,"cs.FL math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this document, we propose a description, via a Haskell implementation, of
a generalization of the notion of regular expression allowing us to group the
definitions and the methods of (tree or word) automata constructions over one
generic structure, based on enriched category theory tools. We first recall
several methods of conversion from expressions to automata, enlightening the
similarities between the words and trees cases. We then produce an original
study of the power of enriched category theory applied 1) to automata and
expressions implementation, and 2) to the study of associated algorithms, using
advanced concepts of functional programming, while simultaneously constructing
a Haskell implementation of notions of enriched category theory and associated
automata. More precisely, the Haskell implementation and the algebraic
definition of the generic automaton structure are based on the following ideas:
  - enriched categories, enriched functors, enriched monads, etc. can be
implemented in Haskell;
  - Type level programming can be used to properly encode function arity;
  - monoids (word structure) and operads (tree structure) can be encoded as
monoid objects;
  - tree and word automata can be represented by the same algebraic structure,
via enriched categories.
  This generalization leads to surprising remarks. As an example, some
classical algorithms (determinization, completion, conversion from alternating
to deterministic automaton) can be regrouped in only one function. We will then
define a notion of generalized expressions based on the notion of monoidal
tensor product.

quantum computation. Much of the existing work, in topological and
non-topological pure materials, has been focused on the orthogonal locking in
the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point where the directions of spin and momentum
vectors are locked perpendicularly. With the orthogonal case, enforced by the
symmetry in pure systems, mechanisms responsible for non-orthogonal
spin-momentum locking (NOSML) have drawn little attention, although it has been
reported on the topological surface of $\alpha$-$Sn$. Here, we demonstrate
that, the presence of the spin-orbit scattering from dilute spinless impurities
can produce the NOSML state in the presence of a strong intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling in the pristine material. We also observe an interesting coupling
threshold for the NOSML state to occur.
  The relevant parameter in our analysis is the deflection angle from
orthogonality which can be extracted experimentally from the
spin-and-angle-resolved photoemission (S-ARPES) spectra. Our formalism is
applicable to all strongly spin-orbit coupled systems with impurities and not
limited to topological ones. The understanding of NOSML bears on spin-orbit
dependent phenomena, including issues of spin-to-charge conversion and the
interpretation of quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns as well as
scanning-tunneling spectra (STS) in general spin-orbit coupled materials.

the Internet as a whole. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 causes traditional
network scanning to become less useful. An increasing number of hosts is either
IPv6-only or not publicly addressable via IPv4 due to the use of NAT, prompting
a need for network scanning techniques for the IPv6-based Internet. All current
approaches to IPv6 network scanning make use of hitlists (lists of IPv6
addresses to be scanned). A variety of methods for compiling hitlists have been
presented, but they have a strong bias towards server hosts, and do not find
addresses of client hosts -- smartphones, tablets, PCs, 'smart home' devices,
etc. -- in a significant amount. Client hosts are the majority of devices
connected to the Internet. Furthermore, when connected to a residential
broadband connection, they can exchange data at substantial speeds, making them
attractive targets for botnets. Scanning residential broadband networks is
challenging because the active addresses are changing much more frequently than
addresses of server hosts.

method based on the notion of cooperative artificial potential fields is used
to generate safe and complete trajectories for astrobots. Optimal target

reconstruction by analyzing the multiple images and perform pre-processing

transmission peak by exciting a high-quality leaky mode which is formed by
partially breaking a bound state in the continuum generated by the collective
longitudinal magnetic dipole resonances in the metasurface. Our proposed
metasurface-based filter shows a stable performance for oblique light incidence

the problem of frame selection to improve the accuracy of action recognition.
In particular, we show that selecting good frames helps in action recognition
performance even in the trimmed videos domain. Recent work has successfully
leveraged frame selection for long, untrimmed videos, where much of the content
is not relevant, and easy to discard. In this work, however, we focus on the
more standard short, trimmed action recognition problem. We argue that good
frame selection can not only reduce the computational cost of action
recognition but also increase the accuracy by getting rid of frames that are
hard to classify. In contrast to previous work, we propose a method that
instead of selecting frames by considering one at a time, considers them
jointly. This results in a more efficient selection, where good frames are more
effectively distributed over the video, like snapshots that tell a story. We
call the proposed frame selection SMART and we test it in combination with
different backbone architectures and on multiple benchmarks (Kinetics,
Something-something, UCF101). We show that the SMART frame selection
consistently improves the accuracy compared to other frame selection strategies
while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 4 to 10 times.
Additionally, we show that when the primary goal is recognition performance,
our selection strategy can improve over recent state-of-the-art models and
frame selection strategies on various benchmarks (UCF101, HMDB51, FCVID, and

Currently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for perception and
control in autonomous driving. However, several fatal accidents caused by
autonomous vehicles have raised serious safety concerns about autonomous
driving models. Some recent studies have successfully used the metamorphic
testing technique to detect thousands of potential issues in some popularly
used autonomous driving models. However, prior study is limited to a small set
of metamorphic relations, which do not reflect rich, real-world traffic
scenarios and are also not customizable. This paper presents a novel
declarative rule-based metamorphic testing framework called RMT. RMT provides a
rule template with natural language syntax, allowing users to flexibly specify
an enriched set of testing scenarios based on real-world traffic rules and
domain knowledge. RMT automatically parses human-written rules to metamorphic
relations using an NLP-based rule parser referring to an ontology list and
generates test cases with a variety of image transformation engines. We
evaluated RMT on three autonomous driving models. With an enriched set of
metamorphic relations, RMT detected a significant number of abnormal model
predictions that were not detected by prior work. Through a large-scale human
study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we further confirmed the authenticity of test
cases generated by RMT and the validity of detected abnormal model predictions.

problem that requires no annotations. Some previous methods adopt clustering
techniques to generate pseudo labels and use the produced labels to train Re-ID

However, most clustering-based methods take each cluster as a pseudo identity
class, neglecting the large intra-ID variance caused mainly by the change of
camera views. To address this issue, we propose to split each single cluster
into multiple proxies and each proxy represents the instances coming from the
same camera. These camera-aware proxies enable us to deal with large intra-ID
variance and generate more reliable pseudo labels for learning. Based on the
camera-aware proxies, we design both intra- and inter-camera contrastive
learning components for our Re-ID model to effectively learn the ID
discrimination ability within and across cameras. Meanwhile, a proxy-balanced
sampling strategy is also designed, which facilitates our learning further.
Extensive experiments on three large-scale Re-ID datasets show that our

Mass Spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated
by Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS resonator
for capture and detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical
solution is hindered by their miniscule surface area, which results in poor
limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another hindrance is the
necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in
part to focus analytes towards the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS.
Here, we overcome both limitations by integrating an ion lens onto the NEMS
chip. The ion lens is composed of a polymer layer, which charges up by
receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to
focus the analytes towards an open window aligned with the active area of the
NEMS electrostatically. With this integrated system, we have detected the mass
of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under ambient conditions and with two
orders-of-magnitude improvement in capture efficiency compared to the

of SARS-CoV-2 and BoHV-1 virions. With the increase in analytical throughput,
the simplicity of the overall setup and the operation capability under ambient
conditions, the technique demonstrates that NEMS Mass Spectrometry can be
deployed for mass detection of engineered nanoparticles and biological samples

system aided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) that are
deployed to increase the coverage and, possibly, the rank of the channel. We
propose an optimization algorithm to configure the IRSs, which is aimed at
maximizing the network sum-rate by exploiting only the statistical
characterization of the environment, such as the distribution of the locations
of the users and the distribution of the multipath channels. As a consequence,
the proposed approach does not require the estimation of the instantaneous
channel state information (CSI) for system optimization, thus significantly
relaxing (or even avoiding) the need of frequently reconfiguring the IRSs,
which constitutes one of the most critical issues in IRS-assisted systems.
Numerical results confirm the validity of the proposed approach. It is shown,
in particular, that IRS-assisted wireless systems that are optimized based on
statistical CSI still provide large performance gains as compared to the
baseline scenarios in which no IRSs are deployed.

in multi-beam satellite systems. Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that
requires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network
users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol
participants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of
dishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum
sharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading
process so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized
access by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use
of blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and
traceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading
reputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of
heterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support
users with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam
satellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous
spectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By
leveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum
sharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole
trading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate
the system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.

into a number of subbands. In a cellular network those subbands are then reused
in many cells. To mitigate co-channel interference, a joint spectrum and power
allocation problem is often formulated to maximize a sum-rate objective. The
best known algorithms for solving such problems generally require instantaneous
global channel state information and a centralized optimizer. In fact those
algorithms have not been implemented in practice in large networks with
time-varying subbands. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are promising
tools for solving complex resource management problems. A major challenge here
is that spectrum allocation involves discrete subband selection, whereas power
allocation involves continuous variables. In this paper, a learning framework
is proposed to optimize both discrete and continuous decision variables.
Specifically, two separate deep reinforcement learning algorithms are designed
to be executed and trained simultaneously to maximize a joint objective.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms both the
state-of-the-art fractional programming algorithm and a previous solution based

quantization scheme for Dirac field in de Sitter spacetime. Our scheme is
covariant under both general transformations and Lorentz transformations. We
first present a Hamiltonian structure, then quantize the field following the
standard approach of constrained systems. For the free field, the
time-dependent quantized Hamiltonian is diagonalized by Bogliubov
transformation and the eigen-states at each instant are interpreted as the
observed particle states at that instant. The measurable energy-momentum of
observed particle/antiparticles are the same as obtained for Klein-Gordon
field. Moreover, the energy-momentum also satisfies geodesic equation, a
feature justifying its measurability. As in \cite{Feng2020}, though the
mathematics is carried out in terms of conformal coordinates for the sake of
convenience, the whole theory can be transformed into any other coordinates
based on general covariance. It is concluded that particle/antiparticle states,
such as vacuum states in particular are time-dependent and vacuum states at one
time evolves into non-vacuum states at later times. Formalism of perturbational

are routinely used for 3D reconstruction from UAV images where multiple images

learning techniques have made Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) a field of
intense research. Using SIDE techniques on UAV images can overcome the need for
multiple images for 3D reconstruction. This paper aims to estimate depth from a
single UAV aerial image using deep learning. We follow a self-supervised
learning approach, Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (SMDE), which
does not need ground truth depth or any extra information other than images for
learning to estimate depth. Monocular video frames are used for training the
deep learning model which learns depth and pose information jointly through two
different networks, one each for depth and pose. The predicted depth and pose
are used to reconstruct one image from the viewpoint of another image utilising
the temporal information from videos. We propose a novel architecture with two
2D CNN encoders and a 3D CNN decoder for extracting information from
consecutive temporal frames. A contrastive loss term is introduced for
improving the quality of image generation. Our experiments are carried out on
the public UAVid video dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in estimating the depths.

technique based on the frame difference concept is applied to the
identification of static objects. Firstly, we estimate a frame differencing

a static reference frame. The Mixture of Gaussian MOG method is applied to
detect the moving particles and then outcome foreground mask is subtracted from
frame differencing foreground mask. Pre-processing techniques, illumination

reduce the noise from scattered materials in the air e.g. water droplets and

The MLC methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown strong
performance gains in RS. However, they usually require a high number of
reliable training images annotated with multiple land-cover class labels.
Collecting such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this problem, the
publicly available thematic products, which can include noisy labels, can be
used to annotate RS images with zero-labeling cost. However, multi-label noise
(which can be associated with wrong and missing label annotations) can distort
the learning process of the MLC methods. To address this problem, we propose a
novel multi-label noise robust collaborative learning (RCML) method to
alleviate the negative effects of multi-label noise during the training phase
of a CNN model. RCML identifies, ranks and excludes noisy multi-labels in RS
images based on three main modules: 1) the discrepancy module; 2) the group
lasso module; and 3) the swap module. The discrepancy module ensures that the
two networks learn diverse features, while producing the same predictions. The
task of the group lasso module is to detect the potentially noisy labels
assigned to multi-labeled training images, while the swap module is devoted to
exchange the ranking information between two networks. Unlike the existing
methods that make assumptions about noise distribution, our proposed RCML does
not make any prior assumption about the type of noise in the training set. The
experiments conducted on two multi-label RS image archives confirm the
robustness of the proposed RCML under extreme multi-label noise rates. Our code

is demonstrated by a stochastic car-following task. Experiments indicate that

still very basic questions that have not been addressed so far. Taking some of
these as a motivation, we describe a general perspective on distinct classes of
non-local variational principles setting a program for the analysis of this
kind of problems. We start such program with the simplest problem possible:
that of scalar, uni-dimensional cases, under a particular class of
non-locality. Even in this simple initial scenario, one finds quite unexpected
facts to the point that our intuition about local, classic problems can no
longer guide us for these new problems. There are three main issues worth
highlighting, in the particular situation treated:
  $\bullet$ natural underlying spaces involve different non-local types of
derivatives as, for instance, fractional Sobolev spaces;
  $\bullet$ no convexity of integrands is required for existence of minimizers;
  $\bullet$ optimality is formulated in terms of quite special integral
equations rather than differential equations.
  We are thus able to provide some specific answers to the initial questions
that motivated our investigation. In subsequent papers, we will move on to
consider the higher dimensional situation driven by the possibility that no
convexity or quasiconvexity might be involved in weak lower semicontinuity in a
full vector, higher dimensional situation.

  model","accepted for publication by ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abc8ec",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The successful operation of dedicated detectors has brought us valuable
information for understanding the central engine and the progenitor of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For instance, the giant X-ray and optical bumps found
in some long-duration GRBs (e.g. GRBs 121027A and 111209A) imply that some
extended central engine activities, such as the late X-ray flares, are likely
due to the fall-back of progenitor envelope materials. Here we systemically
search for long GRBs that consist of a giant X-ray or optical bump from the
Swift GRB sample, and eventually we find 19 new possible candidates. The
fall-back accretion model could well interpret the X-ray and optical bump for
all candidates within a reasonable parameter space. Six candidates showing
simultaneous bump signatures in both X-ray and optical observations, which
could be well fitted at the same time when scaling down the X-ray flux into
optical by one order of magnitude, are consistent with the standard
$F_{\nu}\propto\nu^{1/3}$ synchrotron spectrum. The typical fall-back radius is
distributed around $10^{10}\rm-10^{12}$ cm, which is consistent with the
typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. The peak fall-back accretion rate is in
the range of $\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-4}M_{\odot} \ \text{s} ^{-1}$ at time
$\sim10^{2}- 10^{5}~\rm s$, which is relatively easy to fulfill as long as the
progenitor's metallicity is not too high. Combined with the sample we found,
future studies of the mass supply rate for the progenitors with different mass,
metallicity, and angular momentum distribution would help us to better
constrain the progenitor properties of long GRBs.

and Ghosh (1918) to depend on the cube root of concentration, because of a good
fit with data for low and moderate salt concentration. However, the
Debye-H\""uckel (DH) theory that was developed later prevailed, and this theory
has a square root dependence. The derivation of the DH equation is not easy or
intuitive, and has various uncertain elements, and the fit to data is not very
good for salts with non-unity valencies. We develop a model for the activity
coefficient based on the Coulomb force between an ion and its nearest-neighbour
ions of opposite charge, including the distribution of separations between the
ions. For a symmetric salt, we only have to analyze the interactions between
one cation and one anion, and we can derive an expression in the dilute limit
that depends on the Bjerrum length and the cube root of salt concentration,
similar to a result already put forward by Bjerrum. For higher salt
concentrations or a non-zero size, numerical evaluation is required. For a 1:1
salt, this cube root dependence describes data of the activity coefficient very
well, both at low and intermediate salt concentrations, with also the prefactor
correctly predicted. We also analyze an asymmetric 2:1 salt and 3:1 salt which
requires numerical solution of all possible orbits of two or three monovalent
ions around a central multivalent ion of opposite charge, and this calculation
also leads to a very good prediction of the activity coefficient that linearly
depends on the cube root of salt concentration up to moderate concentrations.
For 2:2 and 3:3 salts, numerical theory again fits data very well, but the cube
root limiting law does not apply. The theory can be extended to include ion
volume effects, for instance via the Carnahan-Starling equation of state.

  Model",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a widely observable social effect, influence diffusion refers to a process
where innovations, trends, awareness, etc. spread across the network via the
social impact among individuals. Motivated by such social effect, the concept
of influence maximization is coined, where the goal is to select a bounded
number of the most influential nodes (seed nodes) from a social network so that
they can jointly trigger the maximal influence diffusion. A rich body of
research in this area is performed under statistical diffusion models with
provable submodularity, which essentially simplifies the problem as the optimal
result can be approximated by the simple greedy search. When the diffusion
models are non-submodular, however, the research community mostly focuses on
how to bound/approximate them by tractable submodular functions so as to
estimate the optimal result. In other words, there is still a lack of efficient
methods that can directly resolve non-submodular influence maximization
problems. In this regard, we fill the gap by proposing seed selection
strategies using network graphical properties in a generalized threshold-based
model, called influence barricade model, which is non-submodular. Specifically,
under this model, we first establish theories to reveal graphical conditions
that ensure the network generated by node removals has the same optimal seed
set as that in the original network. We then exploit these theoretical
conditions to develop efficient algorithms by strategically removing
less-important nodes and selecting seeds only in the remaining network. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first graph-based approach that directly
tackles non-submodular influence maximization.

differential equations (PDEs). These multi-fidelity BNNs consist of three
neural networks: The first is a fully connected neural network, which is
trained following the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) method to fit the
low-fidelity data; the second is a Bayesian neural network employed to capture
the cross-correlation with uncertainty quantification between the low- and
high-fidelity data; and the last one is the physics-informed neural network,
which encodes the physical laws described by PDEs. For the training of the last
two neural networks, we use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to estimate
accurately the posterior distributions for the corresponding hyperparameters.
We demonstrate the accuracy of the present method using synthetic data as well
as real measurements. Specifically, we first approximate a one- and
four-dimensional function, and then infer the reaction rates in one- and
two-dimensional diffusion-reaction systems. Moreover, we infer the sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays using satellite images
and in-situ measurements. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the
present method can capture both linear and nonlinear correlation between the
low- and high-fideilty data adaptively, identify unknown parameters in PDEs,
and quantify uncertainties in predictions, given a few scattered noisy
high-fidelity data. Finally, we demonstrate that we can effectively and
efficiently reduce the uncertainties and hence enhance the prediction accuracy
with an active learning approach, using as examples a specific one-dimensional
function approximation and an inverse PDE problem.

serious legal risks of violating equal protection, particularly under the
higher education jurisprudence. Such cases have increasingly turned toward
anticlassification, demanding ""individualized consideration"" and barring
formal, quantitative weights for race regardless of purpose. This case law is
hence fundamentally incompatible with fairness in machine learning. Second, we
argue that the government-contracting cases offer an alternative grounding for
algorithmic fairness, as these cases permit explicit and quantitative
race-based remedies based on historical discrimination by the actor. Third,
while limited, this doctrinal approach also guides the future of algorithmic
fairness, mandating that adjustments be calibrated to the entity's
responsibility for historical discrimination causing present-day disparities.
The contractor cases provide a legally viable path for algorithmic fairness
under current constitutional doctrine but call for more research at the
intersection of algorithmic fairness and causal inference to ensure that bias
mitigation is tailored to specific causes and mechanisms of bias.

greater functionality offers the greatest threat to Bitcoin's dominance in the
market. A coin that incorporates several of these features can be technically
better than Bitcoin, but the first-to-marketadvantage of Bitcoin should keep
its dominant position in the market.

  Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mainstream deep models for three-dimensional MRI synthesis are either
cross-sectional or volumetric depending on the input. Cross-sectional models
can decrease the model complexity, but they may lead to discontinuity
artifacts. On the other hand, volumetric models can alleviate the discontinuity
artifacts, but they might suffer from loss of spatial resolution due to
increased model complexity coupled with scarce training data. To mitigate the
limitations of both approaches, we propose a novel model that progressively
recovers the target volume via simpler synthesis tasks across individual
orientations.

  image classifiers",,"In JSM Proceedings, Statistical Computing Section. Alexandria, VA:
  American Statistical Association. 1121-1131 (2020)",,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we investigate the phenomenon that robust image classifiers
have human-recognizable features -- often referred to as interpretability -- as
revealed through the input gradients of their score functions and their
subsequent adversarial perturbations. In particular, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art methods for adversarial training incorporate two terms -- one
that orients the decision boundary via minimizing the expected loss, and
another that induces smoothness of the classifier's decision surface by
penalizing the local Lipschitz constant. Through this demonstration, we provide
a unified discussion of gradient and Jacobian-based regularizers that have been
used to encourage adversarial robustness in prior works. Following this
discussion, we give qualitative evidence that the coupling of smoothness and
orientation of the decision boundary is sufficient to induce the aforementioned
human-recognizability phenomenon.

due to its unique advantages, has lately risen in popularity. They are based on
graphs that represent the causal relationships among the parameters of the
system to be modeled, and they stand out for their interpretability and
flexibility. With the late popularity of FCMs, a plethora of research efforts
have taken place to develop and optimize the model. One of the most important
elements of FCMs is the learning algorithm they use, and their effectiveness is
largely determined by it. The learning algorithms learn the node weights of an
FCM, with the goal of converging towards the desired behavior. The present
study reviews the genetic algorithms used for training FCMs, as well as gives a
general overview of the FCM learning algorithms, putting evolutionary computing
into the wider context.
