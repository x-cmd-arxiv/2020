(SMF-DSN), a novel architecture exploiting the interpretability of the Deep
Scattering Network (DSN) and improving its expressive power. The DSN extracts
salient and interpretable features in signals by cascading wavelet transforms,
complex modulus and extract the representation of the data via a
translation-invariant operator. First, leveraging the development of highly
specialized wavelet filters over the last decades, we propose a multi-family
approach to DSN. In particular, we propose to cross multiple wavelet transforms
at each layer of the network, thus increasing the feature diversity and
removing the need for an expert to select the appropriate filter. Secondly, we
develop an optimal thresholding strategy adequate for the DSN that regularizes
the network and controls possible instabilities induced by the signals, such as
non-stationary noise. Our systematic and principled solution sparsifies the
network's latent representation by acting as a local mask distinguishing
between activity and noise. The SMF-DSN enhances the DSN by (i) increasing the
diversity of the scattering coefficients and (ii) improves its robustness with
respect to non-stationary noise.

STDP algorithms, where the normalised weight values reflect a difference

the nebular [O\thinspace{\sc iii}] and H$\alpha$ emission lines to the
broad-band images. While these galaxies are typically very blue in color, our
analysis reveals that it is only the dominant stellar clusters that are blue.
Each GPG does clearly show the presence of at least one bright and compact
star-forming region, but these are invariably superimposed on a more extended
and lower surface brightness emission. Moreover, the colors of the star forming
regions are on average bluer than those of the diffuse emission, reaching up to
0.6 magnitudes bluer. Assuming that the diffuse and compact components have
constant and single burst Star Formation Histories, respectively, the observed
colors imply that the diffuse components (possibly the host galaxy of the
star-formation episode) have, on average, old stellar ages ($>1$Gyr), while the
star-clusters are younger than 500Myrs. We also discuss the possibility that
the diffuse red emission is due to a varying relative contribution of nebular
continuum, rather than a different stellar population. With the available data,
however, it is not possible to distinguish between these two interpretations. A
substantial presence of old stars would indicate that the mechanisms that allow

human behavioral ecology, cultural evolution, and related fields. What predicts
cooperation in anonymous contexts is inconsistent across populations, levels of
analysis, and games. For instance, market integration is a key predictor across
ethnolinguistic groups but has inconsistent predictive power at the individual
level. We adapt an idea from 19th-century sociology: people in societies with
greater overlap in ties across domains among community members (Durkheim's
""mechanical"" solidarity) will cooperate more with their network partners and
less in anonymous contexts than people in societies with less overlap
(""organic"" solidarity). This hypothesis, which can be tested at the individual
and community level, assumes that these two types of societies differ in the
importance of keeping existing relationships as opposed to recruiting new
partners. Using multiplex networks, we test this idea by comparing cooperative
tendencies in both anonymous experimental games and real-life communal labor
tasks across 9 Makushi villages in Guyana that vary in the degree of
within-village overlap. Average overlap in a village predicts both real-world
cooperative and anonymous interactions in the predicted direction; individual
overlap also has effects in the expected direction. These results reveal a
consistent patterning of cooperative tendencies at both individual and local
levels and contribute to the debate over the emergence of norms for cooperation
among humans. Multiplex overlap can help us understand inconsistencies in
previous studies of cooperation in anonymous contexts and is an unexplored

embryos in the final assembly stage of planet formation. The efficiency of the
planet formation can be defined by the mass ratio between formed protoplanets
and the initial mass of embryos and planetesimals. In final assembly planet
formation models, the gravitational interactions between planetesimals are
usually neglected due to computational difficulties, namely, computations
require fewer resources in this way. We investigated the effect of this
simplification via modeling the planet formation efficiency in a circumstellar
belt of embryos and self-interacting or non-self-interacting planetesimals. We
used our own developed GPU-based direct N-body integrator, HIPERION, for the
simulations. We found that planet formation efficiency is higher if the
planetesimal self-interaction is taken into account in models that contain the
commonly used 100 embryos. The observed effect can be explained by the damping
of planetesimal eccentricities by their self-gravity. The non-self-interacting
and self-interacting models show qualitatively the same results if the initial
number of embryos is above 200.

exponentially weighted $L^2$ norm so that the essential spectrum is strictly
shifted into the left-half plane, and this is closely related to the fact that
solitary waves exist in the super-ion-sonic regime. Furthermore, in a certain
long-wavelength scaling, we show that the Evans function for the Euler-Poisson
system converges to that for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation as an
amplitude parameter tends to zero, from which we deduce that the origin is the

Many methods have been proposed to improve adversarial robustness (e.g.,
adversarial training and new loss functions to learn adversarially robust

behavior of CNNs that they tend to misclassify adversarial samples into the
most probable false classes. This inspires us to propose a new
Probabilistically Compact (PC) loss with logit constraints which can be used as
a drop-in replacement for cross-entropy (CE) loss to improve CNN's adversarial
robustness. Specifically, PC loss enlarges the probability gaps between true

being melted by a small perturbation. We extensively compare our method with
the state-of-the-art using large scale datasets under both white-box and

performed by minimizing the simulation error to reduce the effect of model

sub-optimal parameter estimates. This paper introduces a method that
approximates the simulation loss by splitting the data set into multiple

operation allows for the use of stochastic gradient optimization methods which
scale well with data set size and has a smoothing effect on the non-convex cost

function to estimate the initial state at the start of each section. The
encoder function estimates the initial states using a feed-forward neural
network starting from historical input and output samples. The efficiency and

specific formulation to keep track of the visited target points. In this paper,
we introduce a hybrid approach by adding a discontinuous part of the trajectory
switching between a group of discrete states related to the targets. Then, we
show the well-posedness of the related Hamilton-Jacobi problem, by
reformulating the optimal visiting as a collection of time-dependent optimal
stopping problems.

spectrographs with high throughput. These instruments find use in ground-based
efforts to characterize stellar and exoplanet atmospheres, and in space-based
observatories. Our grating fabrication technique uses x-ray crystallography to
orient silicon parts prior to cutting, followed by lithography and wet chemical
etching to produce the blaze. This process takes advantage of the crystal
structure and relative difference in etching rates between the (100) and (111)
planes such that we can produce parts that have surface errors < {\lambda}/4.
Previous measurements indicate that chemical etching can yield a final etched
blaze that slightly differs from the orientation of the (111) plane. This
difference can be corrected by the mechanical mount in the case of the
immersion gratings, but doing so may compromise grating throughput due to
shadowing. In the case of the grisms, failure to take the actual blaze into
account will reduce the brightness of the undeviated ray. We report on multiple
techniques to precisely measure the blaze of our in-house fabricated immersion
gratings. The first method uses a scanning electron microscope to image the
blaze profile, which yields a measurement precision of 0.5 degrees. The second
method is an optical method of measuring the angle between blaze faces using a
rotation stage, which yields a measurement precision of 0.2 degrees. Finally,
we describe a theoretical blaze function modeling method, which we expect to
yield a measurement precision of 0.1 degrees. With these methods, we can
quantify the accuracy with which the wet etching produces the required blaze
and further optimize grating and grism efficiencies.

each AR by manual inspection. The results show that it is possible to reproduce
the evolution of the main coronal features such as small- and large-scale
coronal loops, filaments and sheared structures for 80% of the ARs. Varying the
boundary and initial conditions, along with the addition of physical effects
such as Ohmic diffusion, hyperdiffusion and a horizontal magnetic field
injection at the photosphere, improves the match between the observations and
simulated coronal evolution by 20%. The simulations were able to reproduce the
build-up to eruption for 50% of the observed eruptions associated with the ARs.
The mean unsigned time difference between the eruptions occurring in the
observations compared to the time of eruption onset in the simulations was
found to be ~5 hrs. The simulations were particularly successful in capturing
the build-up to eruption for all four eruptions that originated from the
internal polarity inversion line of the ARs. The technique was less successful
in reproducing the onset of eruptions that originated from the periphery of ARs
and large-scale coronal structures. For these cases global, rather than local,
nonlinear force-free field models must be used. While the technique has shown
some success, eruptions that occur in quick succession are difficult to
reproduce by this method and future iterations of the model need to address
this.

from the energy density retarded Green's function using the phenomenon of `pole
skipping'. Moreover, special locations in the complex frequency and momentum
plane are found, known as the pole skipping points such that the retarded
Green's function can not be defined uniquely there. In this paper, we compute
the correction/shift to the pole skipping points due to a spatial anisotropy in
a holographic system by performing near horizon analysis of EOMs involving
different bulk field perturbations, namely the scalar, the axion and the metric

gauge invariant variable in order to obtain the master equation. Two separate
cases for every bulk field EOMs is considered with the fluctuation propagating
parallel and perpendicular to the direction of anisotropy. We compute the

relaxed peephole optimization (RPO) for quantum computers. RPO leverages the
single-qubit state information that can be determined statically by the
compiler. We define that a qubit is in a basis state when, at a given point in
time, its state is either in the X-, Y-, or Z-basis. When basis qubits are used
as inputs to quantum gates, there exist opportunities for strength reduction,
which replaces quantum operations with equivalent but less expensive ones.
Compared to the existing peephole optimization for quantum programs, the
difference is that our proposed optimization does not require an identical
unitary matrix, thereby named `relaxed' peephole optimization. We also extend
our approach to optimize the quantum gates when some input qubits are in known
pure states. Both optimizations, namely the Quantum Basis-state Optimization
(QBO) and the Quantum Pure-state Optimization (QPO), are implemented in the
IBM's Qiskit transpiler. Our experimental results show that our proposed
optimization pass is fast and effective. The circuits optimized with our
compiler optimizations obtain up to 18.0% (11.7% on average) fewer CNOT gates
and up to 8.2% (7.1% on average) lower transpilation time than that of the most
aggressive optimization level in the Qiskit compiler. When running on real

different astronomical environments such as in the interstellar medium or in

nitrogen fraction in cold molecular clouds as exchange reactions for 15N are
mostly inefficient. Here, we developed a new gas-grain model for nitrogen
fractionation including a thorough search for new nitrogen fractionation
reactions and a realistic description of atom depletion onto interstellar dust
particles. We show that, while dense molecular cloud gas-phase chemistry alone
leads to very low fractionation, 14N atoms are preferentially depleted from the
gas-phase due to a mass dependent grain surface sticking rate for atomic
nitrogen. However, assuming an elementary 14N/15N ratio of 441 (equal to the
solar wind value), our model leads to only low 15N enrichment for all
N-containing species synthesized in the gas-phase with predicted 14N/15N ratios
in the range 360-400. Higher enrichment levels can neither be explained by this
mechanism, nor through chemistry, with two possible explanations. (I) The
elementary 14N/15N ratio in the local ISM is smaller, as suggested by the
recent work of Romano et al, with an hypothetic 15NNH+ and 15NNH+ depletion due
to variation of the electronic recombination rate constant variation with the
isotopes. (II) N2 photodissociation leads to variable nitrogen fractionation in
diffuse molecular clouds where photons play an important role, which is
conserved during dense molecular cloud formation as suggested by the work of
Furuya & Aikawa.

demonstrated novel devices including efficient photodetectors at
telecommunication frequencies, enhanced-mobility transistors, and on-chip

underlying mechanism required to enhance the performance of the next-generation
devices with strain(op)tronics, it is imperative to understand the nano- and
microscopic properties as a function of a strong non-homogeneous strain. Here,
we study the strain-induced variation of local conductivity of a few-layer
transition-metal-dichalcogenide using a conductive atomic force microscopy. We
report a novel strain characterization technique by capturing the electrical
conductivity variations induced by local strain originating from surface
topography at the nanoscale, which allows overcoming limitations of existing
optical spectroscopy techniques. We show that the conductivity variations
parallel the strain deviations across the geometry predicted by molecular
dynamics simulation. These results substantiate a variation of the effective
mass and surface charge density by .026 me/% and .03e/% of uniaxial strain,
respectively. Furthermore, we show and quantify how a gradual reduction of the
conduction band minima as a function of tensile strain explains the observed
reduced effective Schottky barrier height. Such spatially-textured electronic
behavior via surface topography induced strain variations in atomistic-layered
materials at the nanoscale opens up new opportunities to control fundamental
material properties and offers a myriad of design and functional device

collective action organized by TikTok users. Motivated by TikTok's surge in
popularity and its growing sociopolitical implications, this work explores the
role of TikTok's recommender algorithm in amplifying call-to-action videos that
promoted collective action against the Tulsa rally. We analyze call-to-action
videos from more than 600 TikTok users and compare the visibility (i.e. play
count) of these videos with other videos published by the same users. Evidence
suggests that Tulsa-related videos generally received more plays, and in some
cases the amplification was dramatic. For example, one user's call-to-action
video was played over 2 million times, but no other video by the user exceeded
100,000 plays, and the user had fewer than 20,000 followers. Statistical
modeling suggests that the increased play count is explained by increased
engagement rather than any systematic amplification of call-to-action videos.
We conclude by discussing the implications of recommender algorithms amplifying
sociopolitical messages, and motivate several promising areas for future work.

assess the safety of the produced systems, we also need it to extract knowledge

reinforcement learning do exist, they usually employ greedy algorithms or they
do not exploit the rewards given by the environment. This means that these
techniques may easily get stuck in local optima. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to interpretable reinforcement learning that uses decision
trees. We present a two-level optimization scheme that combines the advantages
of evolutionary algorithms with the advantages of Q-learning. This way we
decompose the problem into two sub-problems: the problem of finding a
meaningful and useful decomposition of the state space, and the problem of
associating an action to each state. We test the proposed method on three
well-known reinforcement learning benchmarks, on which it results competitive
with respect to the state-of-the-art in both performance and interpretability.
Finally, we perform an ablation study that confirms that using the two-level

(or strongly isomorphic) to a given polytope $P$. We show that the associated
space of polytopes, called the inscribed cone of $P$, is closed under Minkowski
addition. Inscribed cones are interpreted as type cones of ideal hyperbolic
polytopes and as deformation spaces of Delaunay subdivisions. In particular,
testing if there is an inscribed polytope normally equivalent to $P$ is
polynomial time solvable.
  Normal equivalence is decided on the level of normal fans and we study the
structure of inscribed cones for various classes of polytopes and fans,
including simple, simplicial, and even. We classify (virtually) inscribable
fans in dimension $2$ as well as inscribable permutahedra and nestohedra.
  A second goal of the paper is to introduce inscribed virtual polytopes.
Polytopes with a fixed normal fan $\mathcal{N}$ form a monoid with respect to
Minkowski addition and the associated Grothendieck group is called the type
space of $\mathcal{N}$. Elements of the type space correspond to formal
Minkowski differences and are naturally equipped with vertices and hence with a
notion of inscribability. We show that inscribed virtual polytopes form a
subgroup, which can be non-trivial even if $\mathcal{N}$ does not have actual
inscribed polytopes.
  We relate inscribed virtual polytopes to routed particle trajectories, that
is, piecewise-linear trajectories of particles in a ball with restricted
directions. The state spaces gives rise to connected groupoids generated by
reflections, called reflection groupoids. The endomorphism groups of reflection
groupoids can be thought of as discrete holonomy groups of the trajectories and
we determine when they are reflection groups.

applications, although useful QML applications would require many qubits.
Therefore our paper is aimed at exploring the successful application of the
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm while balancing several
practical and technical considerations under the Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) assumption. For the quantum SVM under NISQ, we use quantum
feature maps to translate data into quantum states and build the SVM kernel out
of these quantum states, and further compare with classical SVM with radial
basis function (RBF) kernels. As data sets are more complex or abstracted in
some sense, classical SVM with classical kernels leads to less accuracy
compared to QSVM, as classical SVM with typical classical kernels cannot easily
separate different class data. Similarly, QSVM should be able to provide
competitive performance over a broader range of data sets including ``simpler''
data cases in which smoother decision boundaries are required to avoid any
model variance issues (i.e., overfitting). To bridge the gap between
``classical-looking'' decision boundaries and complex quantum decision
boundaries, we propose to utilize general shallow unitary transformations to
create feature maps with rotation factors to define a tunable quantum kernel,
and added regularization to smooth the separating hyperplane model. We show in
experiments that this allows QSVM to perform equally to SVM regardless of the
complexity of the data sets and outperform in some commonly used reference data
sets.

station the index of the precoder (from a codebook) to be used for downlink

to the user position within the cell. We propose a method by which an external
attacker determines the user position by passively overhearing this unencrypted
layer-2 feedback signal. The attacker first builds a map of fed back precoder
indices in the cell. Then, by overhearing the precoder index fed back by the
victim user, the attacker finds its position on the map. We focus on the type-I
single-panel codebook, which today is the only mandatory solution in the 3GPP
standard. We analyze the attack and assess the obtained localization accuracy
against various parameters. We analyze the localization error of a simplified
precoder feedback model and describe its asymptotic localization precision. We
also propose a mitigation against our attack, wherein the user randomly selects
the precoder among those providing the highest rate. Simulations confirm that
the attack can achieve a high localization accuracy, which is significantly
reduced when the mitigation solution is adopted, at the cost of a negligible
rate degradation.

homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection,
which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation.
Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging,
and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the
evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts.
Results: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the
proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier
metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores
between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy
theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets
demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets
and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated
conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. Conclusions: Although we
focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is
not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation
in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to
counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized
misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to
target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become
incorporated.

that this ISP has by far the largest number of M-BGP deployments among
autonomous systems with LG servers. Specifically, Hurricane Electric has
deployed M-BGP with 512 of its peering ASes at 58 PoPs around the world,

The question of whether the presence of HII regions modifies the core-scale
fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. We aim to
investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate
HMSCs that are strongly impacted by HII regions and less disturbed ones. We
also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the
impacted HMSCs. Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of ~1.3"", we
imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by HII regions and
another four situated in the quiet environment. The less-impacted HMSCs are
selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance compared to the
impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. A total of
51 cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each
clump. Within our limited sample, we did not find a clear difference in the
~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted HMSCs, even
though HII regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented
cores. Both types of HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level
hierarchical features at the clump thermal Jeans length ${\lambda_{J,
clump}^{th}}$ and 0.3${\lambda_{J, clump}^{th}}$. The ALMA emission morphology
of the impacted HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029 sheds light on
the capacities of HII regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and
possibly to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in HMSCs. Future ALMA
surveys covering a large number of impacted HMSCs with high turbulence are
needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated in this study.

This beautiful method was invented in 1968. Despite the honourable age, it
remains the preferable tool at hadron colliders. It delivers the lowest
calibration systematics, which still often dominates the overall luminosity
uncertainty at LHC experiments. Various details of the method are discussed in
the paper. One of the main factors limiting proton-proton van der Meer scan
accuracy is the beam-beam electromagnetic interaction. It modifies the shapes
of the colliding bunches and biases the measured luminosity. In the first years
of operation, four main LHC experiments did not attempt to correct the bias
because of its complexity. In 2012 a correction method was proposed and then
subsequently used by all experiments. It was based, however, on a simplified
linear approximation of the beam-beam force and, therefore, had limited

Surprisingly, such CFTs have been identified as the continuum limits of lattice

precluding the exploration via lattice models of aspects of non-compact

follows a series of previous works on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-staggered XXZ spin

with an integrable $D_2^2$ vertex model, we here identify integrable boundary

correspond to non-compact branes. In the context of the Potts model on a square
lattice, they correspond to wired boundary conditions at the physical
antiferromagnetic critical point. The relations with the boundary parafermion

therefore be exploited as a cooling mechanism. Kinetics teaches us that for a
particle to be cooled down by several orders of magnitude, it will typically
take many elastic collisions as each one only carries away a certain fraction
of the collision energy. Recently, for a system consisting of hot ions and cold
atoms, a much faster cooling process has been suggested where cooling over
several orders of magnitude can occur in a single step. Namely, in a
homo-nuclear atom-ion collision, an electron can resonantly hop from an
ultracold atom onto the hot ion, converting the cold atom into a cold ion.
Here, we demonstrate such swap cooling in a direct way as we experimentally
observe how a single energetic ion loses energy in a cold atom cloud. In order
to contrast swap cooling with standard sympathetic cooling, we perform the same
measurements with a hetero-nuclear atom-ion system, for which swap cooling
cannot take place, and indeed observe much different cooling dynamics. Ab
initio numerical model calculations agree well with our measured data and
corroborate our interpretations. We expect swap cooling to occur quite
universally in any homo-nuclear atom-ion collision. It should therefore be a
ubiquitous process in mixed atom-ion gases and plasmas. Furthermore, it offers
interesting prospects for fast cooling applications.

constituent quarks and diquarks, we calculate the pentaquark mass spectrum for
the complete $SU (3)_F$ lowest $S$- and $P$-wave multiplets, taking into
account dominant spin-spin, spin-orbit, orbital and tensor interactions. The
resulting spectrum is very rich and we work out the quark flavor compositions,

symmetry restricts the observable states in $\Lambda_b$-baryon, as well as in
the decays of the other weakly-decaying $b$-baryons, $\Xi_b$ and $\Omega_b$. In

that the indicator vectors of the Maximal Independent Sets of the graph are the
only binary fixed points of IGN, that they are attractive under simple
conditions on the activation function and we characterize their basins of
attraction. We enumerate a number of other fixed points and we prove
repulsivity for some classes. Based on extensive experiments and different
theoretical arguments we conjecture that IGN always converges and converges to
a binary solution for non-linear activations. If our conjectures are correct,
IGN would thus be a differentiable approximation algorithm for the Maximum
Weight Independent Set problem (MWIS), a central NP-hard optimization problem
with numerous applications. IGN is closely related to a greedy approximation
algorithm of MWIS by Kako et al. which has a proven approximation ratio.
Experimental results show that IGN provides solutions of very similar quality.
In the context of the Assignment Problem, IGN corresponds to an iterative
matrix normalization scheme which is closely related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp
algorithm except that it projects to a permutation matrix instead of a doubly
stochastic matrix. We relate our scheme to the Softassign algorithm and provide
comparative results. As Graph Normalization is differentiable, its iterations
can be embedded into a machine learning framework and used to train end-to-end
any model which includes a graphical optimization step which can be cast as a
maximum weight independent set problem. This includes problems such as graph

amount of data needed for meta-learning. Such a formulation can be studied in a
sequential learning setting, where tasks are presented in sequence. When
studying meta-learning in this online setting, a critical question arises: can
meta-learning improve over the sample complexity and regret of standard
empirical risk minimization methods, when considering both meta-training and
adaptation together? The answer is particularly non-obvious for meta-learning
algorithms with complex bi-level optimizations that may demand large amounts of

convergence PDF that varies the full set of $\Lambda$CDM parameters. Our Fisher
forecasts establish that the constraining power of the convergence PDF compares
favourably to the two-point correlation function for a Euclid-like survey area
at a single source redshift. When combined with a CMB prior from Planck, the
PDF constrains both the neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and the dark energy equation of
state $w_0$ more strongly than the two-point correlation function.

tremendous effort to develop classical effective neural networks into quantum
concept. In this paper, a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network with
deep residual learning (Res-HQCNN) is proposed. We firstly analysis how to
connect residual block structure with a quantum neural network, and give the
corresponding training algorithm. At the same time, the advantages and
disadvantages of transforming deep residual learning into quantum concept are
provided. As a result, the model can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
analogue to the backpropagation in classical neural networks.
  To explore the effectiveness of Res-HQCNN , we perform extensive experiments
for quantum data with or without noisy on classical computer. The experimental
results show the Res-HQCNN performs better to learn an unknown unitary
transformation and has stronger robustness for noisy data, when compared to
state of the arts. Moreover, the possible methods of combining residual
learning with quantum neural networks are also discussed.

safe motion planning in the context of autonomous driving systems.
Traditionally, pedestrian behavior prediction has been realized in terms of
forecasting future trajectories. However, recent evidence suggests that
predicting higher-level actions, such as crossing the road, can help improve
trajectory forecasting and planning tasks accordingly. There are a number of
existing datasets that cater to the development of pedestrian action prediction
algorithms, however, they lack certain characteristics, such as bird's eye view
semantic map information, 3D locations of objects in the scene, etc., which are
crucial in the autonomous driving context. To this end, we propose a new
pedestrian action prediction dataset created by adding per-frame 2D/3D bounding
box and behavioral annotations to the popular autonomous driving dataset,
nuScenes. In addition, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture that
incorporates various data modalities for predicting pedestrian crossing action.
By evaluating our model on the newly proposed dataset, the contribution of
different data modalities to the prediction task is revealed. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/PePScenes.

constructive yielding an algorithm to compute such an $\epsilon$-cover that
runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(M)$.
  Building on our structural result, we obtain significantly improved learning
algorithms for several fundamental high-dimensional probabilistic models with

$k$-mixtures of spherical Gaussians (with known common covariance), PAC
learning one-hidden-layer ReLU networks with $k$ hidden units (under the
Gaussian distribution), density and parameter estimation for $k$-mixtures of
linear regressions (with Gaussian covariates), and parameter estimation for
$k$-mixtures of hyperplanes. Our algorithms run in time {\em quasi-polynomial}

exponential in $k^{\Omega(1)}$.
  At a high-level our algorithms for all these learning problems work as
follows: By computing the low-degree moments of the hidden parameters, we are
able to find a vector space of polynomials that nearly vanish on the unknown

generalizations:
  1) ""Parabolic generalization"": if $I$ is a subset of simple roots, every root
with positive $I$-height is an ordered sum of roots of $I$-height 1, whose
partial sums are all roots. In fact we show this on the Lie algebra level, by
showing that every root space is spanned by the Lie words formed from root
vectors of $I$-height 1. As an application, we provide a ""minimal"" description
for the set of weights of every (non-integrable) simple highest weight module
over any Kac-Moody algebra. This seems to be novel even in finite type.
  2) Generalization to weights of weight modules: the PSP gives a chain of
roots between 0 (fixed) and any positive root. We generalize this to the
weights of weight modules to get a chain of weights between any two comparable
weights. This was shown by S. Kumar for any finite-dimensional simple module
over a semisimple Lie algebra. In this paper, we extend this result to (i) a
large class of highest weight modules over any Kac-Moody algebra

$\mathfrak{g}$; (ii) more generally, for non-highest weight modules such as
$\mathfrak{g}$ itself (adjoint representation) and arbitrary submodules of
parabolic Verma modules over $\mathfrak{g}$; (iii) arbitrary integrable modules

barlowite Cu$_3$Zn$_{x}$Cu$_{1-x}$(OH)$_6$FBr and herbertsmithite
Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. On all length scales probed, there is no evidence that
Zn substitutes onto the kagome layers, thereby preserving the QSL physics of
the kagome lattice. Our calculations show that antisite disorder is not
energetically favorable and is even less favorable in Zn-barlowite compared to
herbertsmithite. Site-specific X-ray diffraction measurements of Zn-barlowite
reveal that Cu$^{2+}$ and Zn$^{2+}$ selectively occupy distinct interlayer
sites, in contrast to herbertsmithite. Using the first measured Zn L-edge
inelastic X-ray absorption spectra combined with calculations, we discover a
systematic correlation between the loss of inversion symmetry from
pseudo-octahedral (herbertsmithite) to trigonal prismatic coordination
(Zn-barlowite) with the emergence of a new peak. Overall, our measurements
suggest that Zn-barlowite has structural advantages over herbertsmithite that
make its magnetic properties closer to an ideal QSL candidate: its kagome

accommodate a higher amount of Zn substitution.

instigated by Sagittarius, it is also driven by the intertwined influences of
the dark matter halo and the disc itself. We analyse an N-body simulation
following a Sagittarius-like galaxy interacting with a MW-like host to
disentangle these different influences during the stages of a minor merger. The
accelerations in the disc plane from each component are calculated for each

The analysis maps quantify and compare the scales of the individual

these passages is enhanced and extended by the distortion of the dark matter
halo; (iii) the interaction drives disc asymmetries within and perpendicular to

time eventually leading to the formation of a bar. These results have
interesting implications for identifying different influences within our own

for localized signatures of its effect at intermediate radii, the distortion of
the MW's dark matter halo should leave its imprint in the outer disc and the

might tangibly affect relativistic kinematics for particles propagating from

has so far focused exclusively on a subclass of scenarios such that the
quantum-gravity effects are independent of (macroscopic) curvature. It was
assumed that a phenomenology for quantum-gravity effects that are triggered by
curvature might be a dead end because of a double suppression: by the smallness
of the characteristic quantum-gravity length scale and by the smallness of
curvature. This state of affairs is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory in
light of some recent quantum-gravity studies providing evidence of the fact
that the presence of curvature might be required in order to have the novel
relativistic properties. We here analyze an explicit scenario for
curvature-induced quantum-gravity effects, and show that the smallness of
curvature does not pose a challenge for phenomenology since it is compensated
by the large distances traveled by the particles considered in the relevant
phenomenological studies. We also observe that the present data situation for

the dominant limitation of current cavity enhanced systems. A cavity is built
to this geometry and shown to simultaneously realize the capability required
for Doppler compensation, with a 5.04~mm $1/e^{2}$ diameter beam waist and an
enhancement factor of $>$5x at a finesse of 35. Furthermore, this has a tunable
Gouy phase, allowing the suppression of higher order spatial modes and the
avoidance of regions of instability. This approach can therefore enable
enhanced contrast and longer atom interferometry times while also enabling the
key features of cavity enhanced atom interferometry, power enhancement and the
reduction of aberrations. This is relevant to future reductions in the optical
power requirement of quantum technology, or in providing enhanced performance
for atom interferometers targeting fundamental science.

conventionally assessed by measuring the modification of the distributions of
jet observables with respect to the proton-proton baseline. However, the
steeply falling production spectrum introduces a strong bias toward small
energy losses that obfuscates a direct interpretation of the impact of medium
effects in the measured jet ensemble. Modern machine learning techniques offer
the potential to tackle this issue on a jet-by-jet basis. In this paper, we
employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose such modifications from
jet images where the training and validation is performed using the hybrid
strong/weak coupling model. By analyzing measured jets in heavy-ion collisions,
we extract the original jet transverse momentum, i.e., the transverse momentum
of an identical jet that did not pass through a medium, in terms of an energy
loss ratio. Despite many sources of fluctuations, we achieve good performance
and put emphasis on the interpretability of our results. We observe that the
angular distribution of soft particles in the jet cone and their relative
contribution to the total jet energy contain significant discriminating power,
which can be exploited to tailor observables that provide a good estimate of
the energy loss ratio. With a well-predicted energy loss ratio, we study a set
of jet observables to estimate their sensitivity to bias effects and reveal
their medium modifications when compared to a more equivalent jet population,
i.e., a set of jets with similar initial energy. Finally, we also show the
potential of deep learning techniques in the analysis of the geometrical
aspects of jet quenching such as the in-medium traversed length or the position
of the hard scattering in the transverse plane, opening up new possibilities
for tomographic studies.

contact between a ""rigid"" spherical indenter and a viscoelastic rough

predictions are then compared with experimental measurements, which show a
strong adhesion hysteresis mostly due to viscous energy dissipation occurring
during pull-off. This hysteresis is satisfactorily described by the contact
model which allows to distinguish the energy loss due to material dissipation
from the adhesion hysteresis due to elastic instability. Our analysis shows
that the pull-off force required to detach the surfaces is strongly influenced
by the detachment rate and the rms roughness amplitude, but it is almost
unaffected by the maximum load from which unloading starts. Moreover, the
increase in the boundary line separating contact and non-contact regions,
observed when moving from smooth to rough contacts, negligibly affects the
viscous dissipation. Such increase is much less significant than the reduction
in contact area, which therefore is the main parameter governing the strong
decrease in the effective surface energy.

diffraction effects are important when we consider GWs in the LIGO frequency

that the galaxy hosting the microlenses changes the lensing configuration
qualitatively, so we cannot treat the microlenses as isolated point mass lenses

$\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot$, diffraction effects significantly suppress the
microlensing magnification. Thus, our results suggest that gravitational waves
lensed by typical galaxy or galaxy cluster lenses may offer a relatively clean

average Universe, which is usually considered as the homogeneous and isotropic
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. However, inhomogeneities
may statistically bias the observational averages with respect to FLRW, notably
for distance measurements, due to a number of effects such as gravitational
lensing and redshift perturbations. In this article, we review the main known
theoretical results on average distance measures in cosmology, based on
second-order perturbation theory, and we fill in some of their gaps. We then
comprehensively test these theoretical predictions against ray tracing in a
high-resolution dark-matter $N$-body simulation. This method allows us to
describe the effect of small-scale inhomogeneities deep into the non-linear
regime of structure formation on light propagation up to $z=10$. We find that
numerical results are in remarkably good agreement with theoretical predictions
in the limit of super-sample variance. No unexpectedly large bias originates
from very small scales, whose effect is fully encoded in the non-linear power
spectrum. Specifically, the directional average of the inverse amplification
and the source-averaged amplification are compatible with unity; the change in
area of surfaces of constant cosmic time is compatible with zero; the biases on
other distance measures, which can reach slightly less than $1\%$ at high
redshift, are well understood. As a side product, we also confront the
predictions of the recent finite-beam formalism with numerical data and find
excellent agreement.

local groups each of size $r$. Each local group satisfies `$a$' local parity
checks to recover from `$a$' erasures in that local group and there are further
$h$ global parity checks to provide fault tolerance from more global erasure
patterns. Such an LRC is Maximally Recoverable (MR), if it offers the best
blend of locality and global erasure resilience -- namely it can correct all
erasure patterns whose recovery is information-theoretically feasible given the
locality structure (these are precisely patterns with up to `$a$' erasures in
each local group and an additional $h$ erasures anywhere in the codeword).
  Random constructions can easily show the existence of MR LRCs over very large
fields, but a major algebraic challenge is to construct MR LRCs, or even show
their existence, over smaller fields, as well as understand inherent lower
bounds on their field size. We give an explicit construction of
$(n,r,h,a,q)$-MR LRCs with field size $q$ bounded by
$\left(O\left(\max\{r,n/r\}\right)\right)^{\min\{h,r-a\}}$. This improves upon
known constructions in many relevant parameter ranges. Moreover, it matches the
lower bound from Gopi et al. (2020) in an interesting range of parameters where
$r=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, $r-a=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ and $h$ is a fixed constant with
$h\le a+2$, achieving the optimal field size of $\Theta_{h}(n^{h/2}).$
  Our construction is based on the theory of skew polynomials. We believe skew
polynomials should have further applications in coding and complexity theory;
as a small illustration we show how to capture algebraic results underlying
list decoding folded Reed-Solomon and multiplicity codes in a unified way

add additional timing parameters, and which model to attempt in subsequent
iterations. Using these tools, the algorithm can phase-connect timing data that
previously required substantial manual effort. We tested the algorithm on 100

SBP-SAT discretizations are consistent, conservative, adjoint consistent, and
energy stable are presented. For SATs leading to primal and adjoint consistent
discretizations, the error in output functionals is shown to be of order
$h^{2p}$ when a degree $p$ multidimensional SBP operator is used to discretize
the spatial derivatives. SAT penalty coefficients corresponding to various
discontinuous Galerkin fluxes developed for elliptic partial differential
equations are identified. We demonstrate that the original method of Bassi and
Rebay, the modified method of Bassi and Rebay, and the symmetric interior
penalty method are equivalent when implemented with SBP diagonal-E operators
that have diagonal norm matrix, e.g., the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto SBP operator
in one space dimension. Similarly, the local discontinuous Galerkin and the
compact discontinuous Galerkin schemes are equivalent for this family of
operators. The analysis remains valid on curvilinear grids if a degree $\le
p+1$ bijective polynomial mapping from the reference to physical elements is
used. Numerical experiments with the two-dimensional Poisson problem support
the theoretical results.

inverse problem of accelerated-MRI reconstruction whereas being robust to
variable imaging conditions. The efficiency and generalization capabilities
with different training datasets were studied, as well as recurrent network
units with decreasing complexity: the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), the Minimal
Gated Unit (MGU), and the Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN), to
reduce inference times. Validation was performed against Compressed Sensing
(CS) and further assessed based on data unseen during training. A pathology
study was conducted by reconstructing simulated white matter lesions and
prospectively undersampled data of a Multiple Sclerosis patient. Results:
Training on a single modality of 3T $T_1$-weighted brain data appeared
sufficient to also reconstruct 7T $T_{2}^*$-weighted brain and 3T
$T_2$-weighted knee data. The IndRNN is an efficient recurrent unit, reducing
inference time by 68\% compared to CS, whereas maintaining performance. The RIM
was able to reconstruct lesions unseen during training more accurately than CS
when trained on $T_2$-weighted knee data. Training on $T_1$-weighted brain data
and on combined data slightly enhanced the signal compared to CS. Conclusion:
The RIM is efficient when decreasing its complexity, which reduces the

that, in a HK rate region based on an additive Gaussian noise model, Gaussian

region is achievable in an interference channel. On the other hand, reference
[Khandani-arXiv:2011.12981] presents a method for code-book construction in a

wormholes may be traversed between any pair of mouths. In particular, in the
three-mouth case they have fundamental group $F_2$ (the free group on two
generators). By contrast, connecting three regions $A,B,C$ in pairs ($AB$,
$BC$, and $AC$) using three separate wormholes would give fundamental group
$F_3$. Our solutions are asymptotically flat up to the presence of possible
magnetic fluxes or cosmic strings that extend to infinity. The construction
begins with a two-mouth traversable wormhole supported by backreaction from
quantum fields. Inserting a sufficiently small black hole into its throat
preserves traversability between the original two mouths. This black hole is
taken to be the mouth of another wormhole connecting the original throat to a
new distant region of spacetime. Making the new wormhole traversable in a
manner similar to the original two-mouth wormhole provides the desired causal
connections. From a dual field theory point of view, when AdS asymptotics are
added to our construction, multiparty entanglement may play an important role
in the traversability of the resulting wormhole.

about the cluster formation process and also determine how cluster populations
are modified and destroyed, which have implications for using clusters as
tracers of galaxy assembly. Young massive cluster populations are often assumed
to be unchanged since cluster formation, and therefore their distribution of
masses and radii are used as the initial values. However, the first few hundred
million years of cluster evolution does change both cluster mass and cluster
radius, through both internal and external processes. In this paper, we use a
large suite of $N$-body cluster simulations in an appropriate tidal field to
determine the best initial mass and initial size distributions of young
clusters in the nearby galaxy M83. We find that the initial masses follow a
power-law distribution with a slope of -2.7 $\pm$ 0.4, and the half-mass radii
follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 2.57 $\pm$ 0.04 pc and a
dispersion of 1.59 $\pm$ 0.01 pc. The corresponding initial projected
half-light radius function has a mean of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.3 pc and a dispersion of
1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 pc. The evolution of the initial mass and size distribution
functions are consistent with mass loss and expansion due to stellar evolution,
independent of the external tidal field and the cluster's initial density
profile. Observed cluster sizes and masses should not be used as the initial
values, even when clusters are only a few hundred million years old.

chaotic and three-dimensional (3-D) nature makes them computationally expensive
to simulate. In this work, a dimensionality reduction technique is investigated
to exploit flows presenting an homogeneous direction, such as wake flows of
extruded two-dimensional (2-D) geometries. First, we examine the effect of the
homogeneous direction span on the wake turbulence dynamics of incompressible
flow past a circular cylinder at $Re=10^4$. It is found that the presence of a
solid wall induces 3-D structures even in highly constricted domains. The 3-D
structures are rapidly two-dimensionalised by the large-scale K\'{a}rm\'{a}n
vortices if the cylinder span is 50\% of the diameter or less, as a result of
the span being shorter than the natural wake Mode B instability
wavelength[...]. With this physical understanding, a 2-D data-driven model that
incorporates 3-D effects, as found in the 3-D wake flow, is presented. The 2-D
model is derived from a novel flow decomposition based on a local spanwise
average of the flow, yielding the spanwise-averaged Navier-Stokes (SANS)
equations[...]. A machine-learning (ML) model is employed to provide closure to
the SANS equations. In the a-priori framework, the ML model yields accurate
predictions of the SSR terms, in contrast to a standard eddy-viscosity model
which completely fails to capture the closure term structures[...]. In the
a-posteriori analysis, while we find evidence of known stability issues with
long-time ML predictions for dynamical systems, the closed SANS equations are
still capable of predicting wake metrics and induced forces with errors from
1-10%. This results in approximately an order of magnitude improvement over
standard 2-D simulations while reducing the computational cost of 3-D
simulations by 99.5%.

study how emission from dark matter annihilation is affected by baryonic
processes. These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with
structure, stellar populations, and stellar and halo masses comparable to those
of the Milky Way. They resolve dark matter structures with mass above $\sim
10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and are each available in both full-physics and
dark-matter-only versions. In the full-physics case, formation of the stellar
galaxy enhances annihilation radiation from the dominant smooth component of
the galactic halo by a factor of three, and its central concentration increases
substantially. In contrast, subhalo fluxes are $reduced$ by almost an order of
magnitude, partly because of changes in internal structure, partly because of
increased tidal effects; they drop relative to the flux from the smooth halo by
1.5 orders of magnitude. The expected flux from the brightest subhalo is four
orders of magnitude below that from the smooth halo, making it very unlikely
that any subhalo will be detected before robust detection of the inner Galaxy.
We use recent simulations of halo structure across the full $\Lambda$CDM mass
range to extrapolate to the smallest (Earth-mass) subhaloes, concluding, in
contrast to earlier work, that the total annihilation flux from Milky Way
subhaloes will be less than that from the smooth halo, as viewed both from the
Sun and by a distant observer. Fermi-LAT may marginally resolve annihilation
radiation from the very brightest subhaloes, which, typically, will contain

short-range dipole-dipole interaction can lead to ordering into various stripe

thermal transitions as a function of the interaction range using simulated
annealing and Monte Carlo methods. For the special case of zero wave vector
ferrodipolar order, incorporating dipole-electron interactions and integrating
out the electrons leads to a six-state clock model for the dipole ordering.
Finally, we discuss the impact of the various dipole orders on the electronic
band structure and the local tunneling density of states. Our work may be
relevant to studies of ""molecular graphene"" -- CO molecules arranged on the

the star CI Tau in the $^{12}$CO & $^{13}$CO $J=3$-2 and CS $J=7$-6 emission
lines. Our recent work demonstrated that the disc around CI Tau contains three
gaps and rings in continuum emission, and we look for their counterparts in the
gas emission. While we find no counterpart of the third gap and ring in
$^{13}$CO, the disc has a gap in emission at the location of the second
continuum ring (rather than gap). We demonstrate that this is mostly an
artefact of the continuum subtraction, although a residual gap still remains
after accounting for this effect. Through radiative transfer modelling we
propose this is due to the inner disc shadowing the outer parts of the disc and
making them colder. This raises a note of caution in mapping high-resolution
gas emission lines observations to the gas surface density - while possible,
this needs to be done carefully. In contrast to $^{13}$CO, CS emission shows
instead a ring morphology, most likely due to chemical effects. Finally, we
note that $^{12}$CO is heavily absorbed by the foreground preventing any
morphological study using this line.

planetary bodies. The initial fragment stream is extremely eccentric, while
observational evidence suggest that discs are circular or nearly so. Here we
propose a novel mechanism to bridge this gap and show that the fragments can
rapidly circularise through dust or gas drag when they interact with a
pre-existing compact disc. We assume that the tidal stream mainly consists of
small cohesive fragments in the size range 10-1000 m, capable of resisting the
WD tidal forces, whereas the compact discs span a wide mass range. We provide
an analytical model, accompanied by N-body simulations, and find a large
parameter space in fragment sizes and orbital separation that leads to full
circularization. Partial circularization is possible for compact discs that are
several orders of magnitudes less massive. We show that dust-induced
circularization inherently produces gas as tidal fragments collisionally
vaporize the pre-existing dust along their path. We show that ongoing gas
production has a higher probability to occur during the early stages of tidal
disruption events, resulting from the fact that smaller fragments are the first
to circularize. Intermittent gas production however becomes more likely as the
tidal stream matures. This could explain why only a small subset of systems
with dusty compact discs also have an observed gaseous component. Additionally,
the interaction yields fragment erosion by collisional shattering, sputtering,
sublimation and possibly ram-pressure. Material scattered by the collisions
might form a thin dusty halo that evolves through PR drag, in compatibility
with observed infrared variability.

line-depth ratio (LDR) method in which we use only Fe I lines. As opposed to
the conventional LDR method with lines of multiple species involved, the LDR of
this kind is insensitive to the surface gravity effects and expected to
circumvent the uncertainty originating in the upper atmosphere of RSGs.
Therefore, the LDR--Teff relations that we calibrated empirically with red
giants may be directly applied to RSGs, though various differences, e.g.,
caused by the three-dimensional non-LTE effects, between the two groups of
objects need to be kept in mind. Using the near-infrared YJ-band spectra of
nine well-known solar-metal red giants observed with the WINERED
high-resolution spectrograph, we selected 12 pairs of Fe I lines least
contaminated with other lines. Applying their LDR--Teff relations to ten nearby
RSGs, the resultant Teff with the internal precision of 30--70 K shows good
agreement with previous observational results assuming one-dimensional LTE and
with Geneva's stellar evolution model. We found no evidence of significant
systematic bias caused by various differences, including those in the size of
the non-LTE effects, between red giants and RSGs except for one line pair which
we rejected because the non-LTE effects may be as large as ~250 K.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to evaluate the systematic bias, and further
study is required, e.g., with including the three-dimensional non-LTE
calculations of all the lines involved.

using only the frustration graph $G$ of a Hamiltonian $H$, i.e., the network of
anticommutation relations between the Pauli terms in $H$ in a given basis.
Specifically, when $G$ is (even-hole, claw)-free, we construct an explicit
free-fermion solution for $H$ using only this structure of $G$, even when no
Jordan-Wigner transformation exists. The solution method is generic in that it
applies for any values of the couplings. This mapping generalizes both the
classic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis solution of the XY model and an exact solution of a
spin chain recently given by Fendley, dubbed ""free fermions in disguise."" Like
Fendley's original example, the free-fermion operators that solve the model are
generally highly nonlinear and nonlocal, but can nonetheless be found
explicitly using a transfer operator defined in terms of the independent sets
of $G$. The associated single-particle energies are calculated using the roots
of the independence polynomial of $G$, which are guaranteed to be real by a
result of Chudnovsky and Seymour. Furthermore, recognizing (even-hole,
claw)-free graphs can be done in polynomial time, so recognizing when a spin
model is solvable in this way is efficient. We give several example families of
solvable models for which no Jordan-Wigner solution exists, and we give a
detailed analysis of such a spin chain having 4-body couplings using this

$\mathrm{m}_r < 21.5$ mag by simulating what the brighter objects with well
determined classifications would look like if they were at higher redshifts.
The CNNs reach 97\% accuracy to $\mathrm{m}_r<21.5$ on their training sets,
suggesting that they are able to recover features more accurately than the
human eye. We then used the trained CNNs to classify the vast majority of the
other DES images. The final catalog comprises five independent CNN predictions
for each classification scheme, helping to determine if the CNN predictions are
robust or not. We obtain secure classifications for $\sim$ 87\% and 73\% of the
catalog for the ETG vs. LTG and edge-on vs. face-on models, respectively.
Combining the two classifications (a) and (b) helps to increase the purity of
the ETG sample and to identify edge-on lenticular galaxies (as ETGs with high
ellipticity). Where a comparison is possible, our classifications correlate
very well with S\'ersic index (\textit{n}), ellipticity ($\epsilon$) and
spectral type, even for the fainter galaxies. This is the largest multi-band
catalog of automated galaxy morphologies to date.

triplet superconductors. It is demonstrated that the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG)
quasiparticle dispersion undergoes dramatic reconstruction due to the twist. In
particular, the velocity of the neutral massless Dirac excitations near the gap
nodes is strongly renormalized by the interlayer hopping and vanishes at a
``magic angle'' where in the limit of a circular Fermi surface a quadratic band
touching is formed. In addition, it is shown that the BdG disperion can be
tuned with an interlayer displacement field, magnetic field, and current, which
can suppress the velocity renormalization, create finite BdG Fermi surfaces, or
open a gap, respectively. Finally, interactions between quasiparticles are
shown to lead to the emergence of a correlated superconducting state breaking
time-reversal symmetry in the vicinity of the magic angle. Estimates of the
magic angle in a variety of nodal superconductors are presented, ranging from
the cuprates to the organic and heavy fermion superconductors, all of which are
shown to be promising for the experimental realization of our proposal.

Group. Its isolation, extended star formation history (SFH), and recent
perigalacticon passage (~1 Gyr ago) make Leo~I one of the most interesting
nearby stellar systems. Here, we analyse deep photometric Hubble Space
Telescope data via colour-magnitude diagram fitting techniques to study its
global and radially-resolved SFH. We find global star formation enhancements in
Leo I ~13, 5.5, 2.0, and 1.0 Gyr ago, after which it was substantially
quenched. Within the context of previous works focused on Leo I, we interpret
the most ancient and the youngest ones as being linked to an early formation
(surviving reionisation) and the latest perigalacticon passage (transition from
dIrr to dSph), respectively. We clearly identify the presence of very metal
poor stars ([Fe/H]~-2) ageing ~5-6 and ~13 Gyr old. We speculate with the
possibility that this metal-poor population in Leo I is related to the merging
with a low mass system (possibly an ultra-faint dwarf). This event would have
triggered star formation (peak of star formation ~5.5 Gyr ago) and accumulated
old, metal poor stars from the accreted system in LeoI. Some of the stars born
during this event would also form from accreted gas of low-metallicity (giving
rise to the 5-6 Gyr low-metallicity tail). Given the intensity and extension of
the 2.0 Gyr burst, we hypothesise that this enhancement could also have an
external origin. Despite the quenching of star formation around 1 Gyr ago (most
probably induced by ram pressure stripping with the Milky Way halo at
pericentre), we report the existence of stars as young as 300-500 Myr. We also
distinguish two clear spatial regions: the inner ~190 pc presents an
homogeneous stellar content (size of the gaseous star forming disc in LeoI from
~4.5 to 1 Gyr ago), whereas the outer regions display a clear positive age
gradient.

subhalo orbital pericenters, $r_{\rm peri}$, correlate with their dark matter
halo structural properties. Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity,
$V_{\rm max}$, subhalos with smaller $r_{\rm peri}$ are more concentrated (have
smaller $r_{\rm max}$ values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak
circular velocities, $V_{\rm peak}$, prior to infall. These trends provide
information that can tighten constraints on the inferred $V_{\rm max}$ and
$V_{\rm peak}$ values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using
published pericenter estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way
dwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa
Minor) have relatively small pericenters, and this pushes their inferred
$r_{\rm max}$ and $V_{\rm max}$ values lower than they would have been without
pericenter information. For Draco, we infer $V_{\rm max} = 23.5 \, \pm 3.3$ km
s$^{-1}$ (compared to $27.3 \, \pm 7.1$ km s$^{-1}$ without pericenter
information). Such a shift exacerbates the traditional Too Big to Fail problem.
Draco's peak circular velocity range prior to infall narrows from $V_{\rm peak}
= 21 - 49$ km s$^{-1}$ without pericenter information to $V_{\rm peak} = 25-37$
km s$^{-1}$ with the constraint. Over the full population of classical dwarf
spheroidals, we find no correlation between $V_{\rm peak}$ and stellar mass
today, indicative of a high level of stochasticity in galaxy formation at
stellar masses below $\sim 10^7$ M$_\odot$. As proper motion measurements for
dwarf satellites become more precise, they should enable useful priors on the
expected structure and evolution of their host dark matter subhalos.

We show that the constraints from atmospheric neutrinos strongly depend on the
assumption that the neutrino eigenstates interacting diagonally with the
gravitational field coincide with the mass eigenstates, which is not \textit{a
priori} justified: this is particularly clear in the case that the basis of
diagonal gravitational interaction coincide with the flavor basis, which cannot
be constrained by the observation of atmospheric neutrinos. Finally, we
quantitatively study the effect of a VEP on the flavor composition of the
astrophysical neutrinos, stressing again the interplay with the basis in which
the VEP is diagonal: we find that for some choices of such basis the flavor

wave experiment, most sensitive to $10^{-2}- 10$ Hz, could have on potential
detections of cosmological stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs).
Specific proposed midband experiments considered are TianGo, B-DECIGO and
AEDGE. We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve
combining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the
midband improves sensitivity to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at
$10^{-2} - 10$ Hz. We consider GW emission from cosmic strings and phase
transitions as benchmark examples of cosmological SGWBs. We explicitly model
various astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole
mergers. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband
experiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and LISA, significantly improve
sensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from astrophysical
SGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves
sensitivity to cosmic string tension $G\mu$ by up to a factor of $10$, driven
by improved component separation from astrophysical sources. For phase
transitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking at $0.1 - 1$ Hz,
which for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of
$T_*\sim 10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA. The
midband closes an energy gap and better captures characteristic spectral shape
information. It thus substantially improves measurement of the properties of
phase transitions at lower energies of $T_* \sim O(10^3)$ GeV, potentially
relevant to new physics at the electroweak scale, whereas in this energy range
LISA alone will detect an excess but not effectively measure the phase
transition parameters. Our modelling code and chains are publicly available.

AGNs. According to the standard picture, they are launched at accretion disc
scales with relativistic velocities, up to 0.3-0.4 c. Their high kinetic power
is enough to induce an efficient feedback on galactic-scale, possibly
contributing to the co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) and the host galaxy. It is therefore of paramount importance to fully
understand the UFO physics, in particular the forces driving their acceleration
and the relation with the accretion flow they originate from. In this paper we
investigate the impact of special relativity effects on the radiative pressure
exerted onto the outflow. The radiation received by the wind decreases for
increasing outflow velocity v, implying that the standard Eddington limit
argument has to be corrected according to v. Due to the limited ability of the
radiation to counteract the SMBH gravity, we expect to find lower typical
velocities with respect to the non-relativistic scenario. We integrate the
relativistic-corrected outflow equation of motion for a realistic set of
starting conditions. We concentrate on UFO typical values of ionisation, column
density and launching radius. We explore a one-dimensional, spherical geometry
and a 3D setting with a rotating thin accretion disc. We find that the
inclusion of relativistic effects leads to sizeable differences in the wind
dynamics and that v is reduced up to 50% with respect to the non-relativistic
treatment. We compare our results with a sample of UFO from the literature, and
we find that the relativistic-corrected velocities are systematically lower
than the reported ones, indicating the need for an additional mechanism, such
as magnetic driving, to explain the highest velocity components. These
conclusions, derived for AGN winds, have a general applicability.

theory for one-layer perceptrons that can predict performance on classification

performance of Echo State Networks and connectionist models for symbolic
reasoning known as Vector Symbolic Architectures. In this paper, we first show
that the proposed perceptron theory can predict the performance of Echo State
Networks, which could not be described by the previous theory. Second, we apply
our perceptron theory to the last layers of shallow randomly connected and deep
multi-layer networks. The full theory is based on Gaussian statistics, but it
is analytically intractable. We explore numerical methods to predict network
performance for problems with a small number of classes. For problems with a
large number of classes, we investigate stochastic sampling methods and a
tractable approximation to the full theory. The quality of predictions is
assessed in three experimental settings, using reservoir computing networks on
a memorization task, shallow randomly connected networks on a collection of
classification datasets, and deep convolutional networks with the ImageNet
dataset. This study offers a simple, bipartite approach to understand deep
neural networks: the input is encoded by the last-but-one layers into a
high-dimensional representation. This representation is mapped through the
weights of the last layer into the postsynaptic sums of the output neurons.
Specifically, the proposed perceptron theory uses the mean vector and
covariance matrix of the postsynaptic sums to compute classification accuracies
for the different classes. The first two moments of the distribution of the
postsynaptic sums can predict the overall network performance quite accurately.

analysing Balmer line ratios obtaining a mean $E(B-V)$ of 0.2-0.3. The

indeterminate strings. A regular string is one that is ""isomorphic"" to a string
whose entries all consist of a single letter, but which nevertheless may itself
include entries containing multiple letters. A string that is not regular is
said to be indeterminate. We begin by proposing a new model for the
representation of strings, regular or indeterminate, then go on to describe a
linear time algorithm to determine whether or not a string $x = x[1..n]$ is
regular and, if so, to replace it by a lexicographically least (lex-least)
string $y$ whose entries are all single letters. Furthermore, we connect the
regularity of a string to the transitive closure problem on a graph, which in
our special case can be efficiently solved. We then introduce the idea of a
feasible palindrome array MP of a string, and prove that every feasible MP
corresponds to some (regular or indeterminate) string. We describe an algorithm
that constructs a string $x$ corresponding to given feasible MP, while ensuring
that whenever possible $x$ is regular and if so, then lex-least. A final
section outlines new research directions suggested by this changed perspective
on regular and indeterminate strings.

Forster says that if $R$ is a noetherian ring of Krull

sharp: there exist examples that cannot be generated by fewer than $d+n$
elements. We view projective $R$-modules as $R$-forms of the non-unital
$R$-algebra where the product of any two elements is $0$. The first two authors
generalized Forster's theorem to forms of other algebras (not necessarily
commutative, associative or unital); A. Shukla and the third author then showed
that this generalized Forster bound is optimal for \'etale algebras.
  In this paper, we prove new upper and lower bound on the number of generators

find indications of large-scale asymmetries in the outer regions of the primary

masses are firmly above debris disc level for all stars. The primaries have
about three times more dust in their discs than the secondaries. In the case of

longer form in them. Considering that there have been no massive gas discs
identified to date in intermediate separation binaries (i.e., binaries at a few

causes the removal of gas, with tidal interaction truncating the discs and
hence shortening the accretion timescale. More systematic studies in this

application of quantum devices. In the research presented in this thesis, I
investigate the complexity-theoretic and physical foundations of quantum
sampling algorithms. I assess the computational power of natural quantum
simulators and close loopholes in the complexity-theoretic argument for the
classical intractability of quantum samplers (Part I). I shed light on how and
under which conditions quantum sampling devices can be tested or verified in
regimes that are not simulable on classical computers (Part II). Finally, I
explore the computational boundary between classical and quantum computing
devices (Part III). In particular, I develop efficiently computable measures of
the infamous Monte Carlo sign problem and assess those measures both in terms
of their practicability as a tool for alleviating or easing the sign problem
and the computational complexity of this task.
  An overarching theme of the thesis is the quantum sign problem which arises
due to destructive interference between paths -- an intrinsically quantum
effect. The (non-)existence of a sign problem takes on the role as a criterion
which delineates the boundary between classical and quantum computing devices.
I begin the thesis by identifying the quantum sign problem as a root of the
computational intractability of quantum output probabilities. It turns out that
the intricate structure of the probability distributions the sign problem gives
rise to, prohibits their verification from few samples. In an ironic twist, I
show that assessing the intrinsic sign problem of a quantum system is again an
intractable problem.

work, we show that generalisations of well-established figures of merit of
physical qubits, such as relaxation times, to logical qubits fail and do not
capture dynamics of logical qubits. We experimentally illustrate that, in
particular, spatial noise correlations can give rise to rich and
counter-intuitive dynamical behavior of logical qubits. We show that a suitable
set of observables, formed by code space population and logical operators
within the code space, allows one to track and characterize the dynamical

characterisation tools used in this work will help to guide and benchmark
experimental implementations of logical qubits.

  Occupancy Grid Maps",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new reactive temporal logic planning algorithm for
multiple robots that operate in environments with unknown geometry modeled
using occupancy grid maps. The robots are equipped with individual sensors that
allow them to continuously learn a grid map of the unknown environment using
existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods. The goal of the
robots is to accomplish complex collaborative tasks, captured by global Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. The majority of existing LTL planning approaches
rely on discrete abstractions of the robot dynamics operating in known
environments and, as a result, they cannot be applied to the more realistic
scenarios where the environment is initially unknown. In this paper, we address
this novel challenge by proposing the first reactive, abstraction-free, and
distributed LTL planning algorithm that can be applied for complex mission
planning of multiple robots operating in unknown environments. The proposed
algorithm is reactive, i.e., planning is adapting to the updated environmental
map and abstraction-free as it does not rely on designing abstractions of the
robot dynamics. Also, our algorithm is distributed in the sense that the global
LTL task is decomposed into single-agent reachability problems constructed
online based on the continuously learned map. The proposed algorithm is
complete under mild assumptions on the structure of the environment and the
sensor models. We provide extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments that illustrate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed
algorithm can address complex planning tasks for large-scale multi-robot
systems in unknown environments.

data distributed over a trusted network, where communication constraints can
create a performance bottleneck. A number of recent approaches propose to
overcome this bottleneck through compression of gradient updates. However, as
models become larger, so does the size of the gradient updates. In this paper,
we propose an alternate approach to learn from distributed data that quantizes
data instead of gradients, and can support learning over applications where the
size of gradient updates is prohibitive. Our approach leverages the dependency
of the computed gradient on data samples, which lie in a much smaller space in
order to perform the quantization in the smaller dimension data space. At the
cost of an extra gradient computation, the gradient estimate can be refined by
conveying the difference between the gradient at the quantized data point and
the original gradient using a small number of bits. Lastly, in order to save
communication, our approach adds a layer that decides whether to transmit a
quantized data sample or not based on its importance for learning. We analyze
the convergence of the proposed approach for smooth convex and non-convex
objective functions and show that we can achieve order optimal convergence
rates with communication that mostly depends on the data rather than the model
(gradient) dimension. We use our proposed algorithm to train ResNet models on
the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and show that we can achieve an order of
magnitude savings over gradient compression methods. These communication
savings come at the cost of increasing computation at the learning agent, and
thus our approach is beneficial in scenarios where communication load is the
main problem.

Wearable devices often carry sensitive information from users which are exposed

being counterfeited between the fabrication process and vendors' storage.
Hence, not only securing personal data is becoming a crucial obligation, but
also device verification is another challenge. To address biometrics
authentication and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) need to be put in
place to mitigate the security and privacy of the users. Among biometrics
modalities, Electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric has become popular as it
can authenticate patients and monitor the patient's vital signs. However,
researchers have recently started to study the vulnerabilities of the ECG
biometric systems and tried to address the issues of spoofing. Moreover, most
of the wearable is enabled with CPU and memories. Thus, volatile memory-based
(NVM) PUF can be easily placed in the device to avoid counterfeit. However,
many research challenged the unclonability characteristics of PUFs. Thus, a
careful study on these attacks should be sufficient to address the need. In

traditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by
humans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we
need to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the
particularities required by these new types of systems. Objective: The purpose
of this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize
the current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML
systems. Method: I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I
systematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted
a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these
studies. Results: The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE
aspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018
onwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of
tools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among
researchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool
prototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the
challenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and
interviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in
industrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose
solutions. Conclusion: The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing
the challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in
identifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or
updating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.

further increased by using ALS in addition. A doubling of efficiency was
possible for national estimates and even larger efficiencies were observed at
the sub-national level. Average annual estimates were considerably more precise
than pooled estimates using NFI data from all years at once. The combination of
remotely-sensed with NFI field data yields reliable estimates which is not

Close examination casts some doubts on the reality of the slowly varying

possible explanation is radio emission from the exoplanet $\tau$ Bootis b via
the cyclotron maser mechanism. Assuming a planetary origin, we derived limits
for the planetary polar surface magnetic field strength, finding values
compatible with theoretical predictions. Further low-frequency observations are
required to confirm this possible first detection of an exoplanetary radio

background is reduced by a factor of 1.4$\times10^{5}$ resulting in a 9.7\%
cosmic contamination in the selected neutrino candidate events, for visible
energies greater than 200~MeV, while the neutrino signal efficiency is retained
at 88.4\% for $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current interactions in the fiducial volume
in the same energy region. This significantly improved performance compared to
existing reconstruction algorithms, marks a major milestone toward reaching the
scientific goals of LArTPC neutrino oscillation experiments operating near the

which can be integrated along arbitrary spatio-temporal trajectories with
dynamically varying integration windows, depending on scene motion. We propose
an algorithm that estimates pixel motion from photon timestamp data and

excited with a wide range in eccentricity and inclination and their
compositions are diverse, with a general trend toward dry objects in the inner
belt and more water-rich objects in the outer belt. Here we review models of
the asteroid belt's origins and dynamical history. The classical view is that
the belt was born with several Earth masses in planetesimals, then strongly
depleted. However, it is possible that very few planetesimals ever formed in
the asteroid region and that the belt's story is one of implantation rather
than depletion. A number of processes may have implanted asteroids from
different regions of the Solar System, dynamically removed them, and excited
their orbits. During the gaseous disk phase these include the effects of giant
planet growth and migration and sweeping secular resonances. After the gaseous
disk phase these include scattering from resident planetary embryos, chaos in
the giant planets' orbits, the giant planet instability, and long-term
dynamical evolution. Different global models for Solar System formation imply
contrasting dynamical histories of the asteroid belt. Vesta and Ceres may have
been implanted from opposite regions of the Solar System -- Ceres from the
Jupiter-Saturn region and Vesta from the terrestrial planet region -- and could
therefore represent very different formation conditions.

independently from a known distribution that could be resource-dependent. Upon
its arrival and revealing itself, an online decision has to be made on whether
or not to accept the request. If accepted, another online decision should also
be made to specify on assigning which resource to serve the request, then a

to maximize the total collected reward subject to the capacity constraints. We
develop near-optimal policies for our problem under two settings separately.
When the reward distribution has a finite support, we assume that given each
reward realization, the size distributions for different resources are
perfectly positive correlated and we propose an adaptive threshold policy. We
show that with certain regularity conditions on the size distribution, our
policy enjoys an optimal $O(\log T)$ regret bound, where $T$ denotes the total

  We study the case where we are given an explicit description of each random

ProSGPV has superior inference performance and comparable prediction

accurately observe ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and cosmic neutrinos
from space with sensitivity over the full celestial sky. POEMMA will observe
the extensive air showers (EASs) from UHECRs and UHE neutrinos above 20 EeV via
air fluorescence. Additionally, POEMMA will observe the Cherenkov signal from
upward-moving EASs induced by Earth-interacting tau neutrinos above 20 PeV. The
POEMMA spacecraft are designed to quickly re-orientate to follow up transient
neutrino sources and obtain unparalleled neutrino flux sensitivity. Developed
as a NASA Astrophysics Probe-class mission, POEMMA consists of two identical
satellites flying in loose formation in 525 km altitude orbits. Each POEMMA
instrument incorporates a wide field-of-view (45$^\circ$) Schmidt telescope
with over 6 m$^2$ of collecting area. The hybrid focal surface of each
telescope includes a fast (1~$\mu$s) near-ultraviolet camera for EAS
fluorescence observations and an ultrafast (10~ns) optical camera for Cherenkov
EAS observations. In a 5-year mission, POEMMA will provide measurements that
open new multi-messenger windows onto the most energetic events in the
universe, enabling the study of new astrophysics and particle physics at these
otherwise inaccessible energies.

  Rectification and Anatomically-constrained Optimization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate vertebra localization and identification are required in many
clinical applications of spine disorder diagnosis and surgery planning.
However, significant challenges are posed in this task by highly varying
pathologies (such as vertebral compression fracture, scoliosis, and vertebral
fixation) and imaging conditions (such as limited field of view and metal
streak artifacts). This paper proposes a robust and accurate method that
effectively exploits the anatomical knowledge of the spine to facilitate
vertebra localization and identification. A key point localization model is
trained to produce activation maps of vertebra centers. They are then
re-sampled along the spine centerline to produce spine-rectified activation
maps, which are further aggregated into 1-D activation signals. Following this,
an anatomically-constrained optimization module is introduced to jointly search
for the optimal vertebra centers under a soft constraint that regulates the
distance between vertebrae and a hard constraint on the consecutive vertebra
indices. When being evaluated on a major public benchmark of 302 highly
pathological CT images, the proposed method reports the state of the art
identification (id.) rate of 97.4%, and outperforms the best competing method
of 94.7% id. rate by reducing the relative id. error rate by half.

showed promising performance in automatic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions
segmentation. These techniques have even outperformed human experts in

Challenge (ISBI Challenge). However state-of-the-art approaches trained to
perform well on highly-controlled datasets fail to generalize on clinical data
from unseen datasets. Instead of proposing another improvement of the
segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel method robust to domain shift and
performing well on unseen datasets, called DeepLesionBrain (DLB). This
generalization property results from three main contributions. First, DLB is
based on a large group of compact 3D CNNs. This spatially distributed strategy
ensures a robust prediction despite the risk of generalization failure of some
individual networks. Second, DLB includes a new image quality data augmentation
to reduce dependency to training data specificity (e.g., acquisition protocol).
Finally, to learn a more generalizable representation of MS lesions, we propose
a hierarchical specialization learning (HSL). HSL is performed by pre-training
a generic network over the whole brain, before using its weights as
initialization to locally specialized networks. By this end, DLB learns both
generic features extracted at global image level and specific features
extracted at local image level. DLB generalization was validated in
cross-dataset experiments on MSSEG'16, ISBI challenge, and in-house datasets.
During experiments, DLB showed higher segmentation accuracy, better
segmentation consistency and greater generalization performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, DLB offers a robust framework well-suited
for clinical practice.

Additionally, we define four heuristics to refine candidate patches to increase
the likelihood of correcting type errors while preserving the transformation
behavior. We implemented our approach for the ATL language using the

are limited both by uncertainties in the fundamental scale, and by
uncertainties in our models of stellar evolution, even for stars similar to the
Sun. For example, we show that current uncertainties on measured
interferometric angular diameters and bolometric fluxes set a systematic
uncertainty floor of $\sim$2% in temperature, $\sim$2% in luminosity, and
$\sim$4% in radius. Comparisons between widely available model grids suggest
uncertainties of order $\sim$5% in mass and $\sim$20% in age for main sequence

this range of stars, the model dependent uncertainties are a complex function
of luminosity, temperature, and metallicity. We provide open-source software
for approximating these uncertainties for individual targets, and discuss

ubiquitously have a diffuse Ly$\alpha$ emitting halo in the CGM extending to
the halo virial radius and beyond; 3) Remaining neutral hydrogen at the epoch
of reionization makes a strong dimming of Ly$\alpha$ emission for galaxies at

host galaxies by regulating star-formation activity. Therefore, to understand
the impact of AGN on star formation, it is essential to trace the molecular gas
out of which stars form. In this paper we present the first systematic study of
the CO properties of AGN hosts at z~2 for a sample of 27 X-ray selected AGN
spanning two orders of magnitude in AGN bolometric luminosity (Lbol=
10^44.7-10^46.9 erg/s) by using ALMA Band 3 observations of the CO(3-2)
transition (~1"" angular resolution). To search for evidence of AGN feedback on
the CO properties of the host galaxies, we compared our AGN with a sample of
inactive (i.e., non-AGN) galaxies from the PHIBSS survey with similar redshift,
stellar masses, and SFRs. We used the same CO transition as a consistent proxy
for the gas mass for the two samples in order to avoid systematics involved
when assuming conversion factors. By adopting a Bayesian approach to take upper
limits into account, we analyzed CO luminosities as a function of stellar
masses and SFRs, as well as the ratio LCO(3-2)/M* (proxy for the gas fraction).
The two samples show statistically consistent trends in the LCO(3-2)-Lfir and
LCO(3-2)-M* planes. However, there are indications that AGN feature lower
CO(3-2) luminosities (0.4-0.7 dex) than inactive galaxies at the 2-3sigma level
when we focus on the subset of parameters where the results are better
constrained and on the distribution of the mean LCO(3-2)/M*. Therefore, even by
conservatively assuming the same excitation factor r31, we would find lower
molecular gas masses in AGN, and assuming higher r31 would exacerbate this
difference. We interpret our result as a hint of the potential effect of AGN
activity (e.g., radiation and outflows), which may be able to heat, excite,
dissociate, and/or deplete the gas reservoir of the host galaxies. (abridged)

Universe, which provides an effective description of the evolution of
4-dimensional string-inspired cosmologies from inflation till the present
epoch. In the context of this ""stringy RVM"" version, it is assumed that the
early Universe is characterised by purely gravitational degrees of freedom,
from the massless gravitational string multiplet, including the antisymmetric
tensor field. The latter plays an important role, since its dual gives rise to
a `stiff' gravitational-axion ""matter"", which in turn couples to the
gravitational anomaly terms, assumed to be non-trivial at early epochs. In the
presence of primordial gravitational wave (GW) perturbations, such anomalous
couplings lead to an RVM-like dynamical inflation, without external inflatons.
We review here this framework and discuss potential scenarios for the
generation of such primordial GW, among which the formation of unstable domain
walls, which eventually collapse in a non-spherical-symmetric manner, giving
rise to GW. We also remark that the same type of ""stiff"" axionic matter could
provide, upon the generation of appropriate potentials during the
post-inflationary eras, (part of) the Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe, which
could well be ultralight, depending on the parameters of the string-inspired
model. All in all, the new (stringy) mechanism for RVM-inflation preserves the
basic structure of the original (and more phenomenological) RVM, as well as its
main advantages: namely, a mechanism for graceful exit and for generating a
huge amount of entropy capable of explaining the horizon problem. It also
predicts axionic DM and the existence of mild dynamical Dark Energy (DE) of
quintessence type in the present universe, both being ""living fossils"" of the
inflationary stages of the cosmic evolution.

performances from these models. Motivated by the observation that GAN ensembles
often outperform single GANs in generation tasks, we propose to construct GAN
ensembles for anomaly detection. In the proposed method, a group of generators
and a group of discriminators are trained together, so every generator gets
feedback from multiple discriminators, and vice versa. Compared to a single
GAN, a GAN ensemble can better model the distribution of normal data and thus
better detect anomalies. Our theoretical analysis of GANs and GAN ensembles
explains the role of a GAN discriminator in anomaly detection. In the empirical
study, we evaluate ensembles constructed from four types of base models, and
the results show that these ensembles clearly outperform single models in a
series of tasks of anomaly detection.

and structure of the input graphs, as well as the features of the underlying
hardware. No single set of optimizations or one hardware platform works well
across all settings. To achieve high performance, the programmer must carefully
select which set of optimizations and hardware platforms to use. The GraphIt
programming language makes it easy for the programmer to write the algorithm
once and optimize it for different inputs using a scheduling language. However,
GraphIt currently has no support for generating high performance code for GPUs.
Programmers must resort to re-implementing the entire algorithm from scratch in
a low-level language with an entirely different set of abstractions and
optimizations in order to achieve high performance on GPUs.
  We propose GG, an extension to the GraphIt compiler framework, that achieves
high performance on both CPUs and GPUs using the same algorithm specification.
GG significantly expands the optimization space of GPU graph processing
frameworks with a novel GPU scheduling language and compiler that enables
combining graph optimizations for GPUs. GG also introduces two performance
optimizations, Edge-based Thread Warps CTAs load balancing (ETWC) and
EdgeBlocking, to expand the optimization space for GPUs. ETWC improves load
balancing by dynamically partitioning the edges of each vertex into blocks that
are assigned to threads, warps, and CTAs for execution. EdgeBlocking improves
the locality of the program by reordering the edges and restricting random
memory accesses to fit within the L2 cache. We evaluate GG on 5 algorithms and
9 input graphs on both Pascal and Volta generation NVIDIA GPUs, and show that
it achieves up to 5.11x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU graph processing
frameworks, and is the fastest on 66 out of the 90 experiments.

systems have been proposed as models of the propagation of long internal waves
along the interface of a two-layer system of fluids with rigid-lid condition

We first present some theoretical properties of well-posedness, conservation
laws and Hamiltonian structure of the systems. Then the corresponding periodic
initial-value problem is discretized in space by the spectral Fourier Galerkin
method and for each system, error estimates for the semidiscrete approximation
are proved. The rest of the paper is concerned with the study of existence and
the numerical simulation of some issues of the dynamics of solitary-wave
solutions. Standard theories are used to derive several results of existence of
classical and generalized solitary waves, depending on the parameters of the
models. A numerical procedure is used to generate numerically approximations of
solitary waves. These are taken as initial conditions in a computational study
of the dynamics of the solitary waves, both classical and generalized. To this
end, the spectral semidiscretizations of the periodic initial-value problem for
the systems are numerically integrated by a fourth-order
Runge-Kutta-composition method based on the implicit midpoint rule. The fully
discrete scheme is then used to approximate the evolution of perturbations of
computed solitary wave profiles, and to study computationally the collisions of
solitary waves as well as the resolution of initial data into trains of

electronic investigation of BFO/LSMO superlattice using standing-wave hard
X-ray photoemission spectroscopy in the first-order Bragg as well as
near-total-reflection geometry. Our results show that the interfaces of BFO on

an interdiffusion length of around 1.2 unit cells. The two interfaces also
exhibit different chemical gradients, with the BFO/LSMO interface being
Sr-terminated by a spectroscopically distinctive high binding energy component
in Sr 2p core-level spectra, which is spatially contained within 1 unit cell
from the interface. From the electronic point of view, unique valence band
features were observed for bulk-BFO, bulk-LSMO and their interfaces. Our X-ray
optical analysis revealed a unique electronic signature at the BFO/LSMO

Valence band decomposition based on the Bragg-reflection standing-wave

work demonstrates that standing-wave hard x-ray photoemission is a reliable
non-destructive technique for probing depth-resolved electronic structure of

boundaries of synchronously rotating planets around low mass stars. However,
other rotational states are possible, particularly when higher eccentricity
orbits can be maintained in a system, including spin-orbit resonant
configurations. Additionally, the oscillating strain as a planet moves from
periastron to apoastron results in friction and tidal heating, which can be an
important energy source. Here, we simulate the climate of ocean-covered planets
near the inner edge of the habitable zone around M to solar stars with
ROCKE-3D, and leverage the planetary evolution software package, VPLanet, to
calculate tidal heating rates for Earth-sized planets orbiting 2600 K and 3000
K stars. This study is the first to use a 3-D General Circulation Model that
implements tidal heating to investigate habitability for multiple resonant
states. We find that in the absence of tidal heating, the resonant state has
little impact on the inner edge, because for a given stellar flux, higher-order
states tend to be warmer than synchronous rotators, but for a given
temperature, have drier upper atmospheres. However, when strong tidal heating
is present, the rotational component implies a strong dependence of habitable
conditions on the system evolution and rotational state. Since tidal and
stellar heating both decrease with orbital distance, this results in a compact
orbital width separating temperate and uninhabitable climates. We summarize
these results and also compare ROCKE-3D to previously published simulations of
the inner edge that used a modified version of the NCAR CAM4 model.

airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease

intermediaries such as banks, payment networks, and payment processors in order
to authorize and process payment transactions. While these communication
networks are designed to be highly available with continuous uptime, there may
be times when an end-user experiences little or no access to network
connectivity.
  The growing interest in digital forms of payments has led central banks
around the world to explore the possibility of issuing a new type of
central-bank money, known as central bank digital currency (CBDC). To
facilitate the secure issuance and transfer of CBDC, we envision a CBDC design
under a two-tier hierarchical trust infrastructure, which is implemented using
public-key cryptography with the central bank as the root certificate authority
for generating digital signatures, and other financial institutions as
intermediate certificate authorities. One important design feature for CBDC
that can be developed under this hierarchical trust infrastructure is an
offline capability to create secure point-to-point offline payments through the
use of authorized hardware. An offline capability for CBDC as digital cash can
create a resilient payment system for consumers and businesses to transact in
any situation.
  We propose an offline payment system (OPS) protocol for CBDC that allows a
user to make digital payments to another user while both users are temporarily
offline and unable to connect to payment intermediaries (or even the Internet).
OPS can be used to instantly complete a transaction involving any form of
digital currency over a point-to-point channel without communicating with any
payment intermediary, achieving virtually unbounded throughput and real-time
transaction latency.

basal dislocation. Here, we have studied basal dislocations and ripplocations,
in single and multiple van der Waals layers, using analytical and computational
techniques. Expressions for the energetic and structural scaling factors of
surface ripplocations are derived, which are in close correspondence to the
physics of a classical carpet ruck. Our simulations demonstrate that the
lowest-energy structure of dislocation pile-ups in layered materials is the
ripplocation, while large dislocation pile-ups in bulk graphite demonstrate
multilayer delamination, curvature and voids. This can provide a concise
explanation for the large volumetric expansion seen in irradiated graphite.

federated learning, only a subset of clients can participate in each training
round. While most prior works assume uniform and unbiased client selection,
recent work on biased client selection has shown that selecting clients with
higher local losses can improve error convergence speed. However, previously
proposed biased selection strategies either require additional communication
cost for evaluating the exact local loss or utilize stale local loss, which can
even make the model diverge. In this paper, we present a bandit-based

  In our companion paper, we introduced a new family of prioritised default
bilattices, $\mathbf J_n$, for $n \in \omega$, with $\mathbf J_0$ being
Belnap's seminal example. We gave a duality for the variety $\mathcal V_n$
generated by $\mathbf J_n$, with the objects of the dual category $\mathcal

  Here we study the dual category in depth. We give an axiomatisation of the
category $\mathcal X_n$ and show that it is isomorphic to a category $\mathcal
Y_n$ of single-sorted topological structures. The objects of $\mathcal Y_n$ are
Priestley spaces endowed with a continuous retraction in which the order has a
natural ranking. We show how to construct the Priestley dual of the underlying
bounded distributive lattice of an algebra in $\mathcal V_n$ via its dual in
$\mathcal Y_n$; as an application we show that the size of the free algebra

being equipped with an underground muon detector (UMD), consisting of 219 10
$\mathrm{m^2}$-modules, each segmented into 64 scintillators coupled to silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs). Direct access to the shower muon content allows for
the study of both of the composition of primary cosmic rays and of high-energy
hadronic interactions in the forward direction. As the muon density can vary
between tens of muons per m$^2$ close to the intersection of the shower axis
with the ground to much less than one per m$^2$ when far away, the necessary
broad dynamic range is achieved by the simultaneous implementation of two
acquisition modes in the read-out electronics: the binary mode, tuned to count
single muons, and the ADC mode, suited to measure a high number of them. In
this work, we present the end-to-end calibration of the muon detector modules:
first, the SiPMs are calibrated by means of the binary channel, and then, the
ADC channel is calibrated using atmospheric muons, detected in parallel to the
shower data acquisition. The laboratory and field measurements performed to
develop the implementation of the full calibration chain of both binary and ADC
channels are presented and discussed. The calibration procedure is reliable to
work with the high amount of channels in the UMD, which will be operated
continuously, in changing environmental conditions, for several years.

interacts with a molecular cloud in the NW and SE areas and with an atomic
cloud in the NE.
  In this work we aim at investigating the origin of the complex morphology and
multi-thermal X-ray emission observed in SNR IC 443, through the study of the
effect of the inhomogeneous ambient medium in shaping its observed structure,
and the exploration of the main parameters characterizing the remnant.
  We developed a 3D HD model for IC 443, which describes the interaction of the
SNR with the environment, parametrized in agreement with the results of the
multi-wavelength data analysis. We performed an ample exploration of the
parameter space describing the initial blast wave and the environment, and the
surrounding clouds. From the simulations, we synthesized the X-ray emission
maps and spectra and compared them with actual X-ray data collected by
XMM-Newton.
  Our model explains the origin of the complex X-ray morphology of SNR IC 443
in a natural way, being able to reproduce, for the first time, most of the
observed features, including the centrally-peaked X-ray morphology
(characteristic of MM SNRs) when considering the origin of the explosion at the
position where the PWN CXOU J061705.3+222127 was at the time of the explosion.
In the model which best reproduces the observations, the mass of the ejecta and
the energy of the explosion are $\sim 7 M_\odot$ and $\sim10^{51}$ erg,
respectively. From the exploration of the parameter space, we found that the
density of the clouds is $n>300$ cm$^{-3}$ and that the age of SNR IC 443 is

properties. For antiferromagnetically coupled spin sites, there are two
limiting scenarios: spin chains in which the spins can exhibit a long-range

techniques can be effective in converting high-dimensional sparse graphs into
low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces, preserving maximally the

Gaussian distribution-based graph embedding with important uncertainty

properties into a vector with a smaller dimension, hence, node similarity in
the original complex irregular spaces can be easily quantified in the embedded
vector spaces using standard metrics. The generated nonlinear and highly

customers' product feature preferences using choice data. Using these models at
scale, however, can result in numerical imprecision and optimization failure
due to a combination of large-valued covariates and the softmax probability
function. Standard machine learning approaches alleviate these concerns by
applying a normalization scheme to the matrix of covariates, scaling all values
to sit within some interval (such as the unit simplex). While this type of
normalization is innocuous when using models for prediction, it has the side
effect of perturbing the estimated coefficients, which are necessary for
researchers interested in inference. This paper shows that, for two common
classes of normalizers, designated scaling and centered scaling, the
data-generating non-scaled model parameters can be analytically recovered along
with their asymptotic distributions. The paper also shows the numerical

The atmospheric
conditions fuel the ocean circulation and its variability, but the extent to
which ocean processes can affect the atmosphere at decadal time scales remains
unclear. In particular, such low-frequency variability is difficult to extract
from the short observational record, meaning that climate models are the
primary tools deployed to resolve this question. Here, we assess how the
ocean's intrinsic variability leads to patterns of upper-ocean heat content
that vary at decadal time scales. These patterns have the potential to feed
back on the atmosphere and thereby affect climate modes of variability, such as
El Ni\~no or the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. We use the output from a
global ocean-sea ice circulation model at three different horizontal
resolutions, each driven by the same atmospheric reanalysis. To disentangle the
variability of the ocean's direct response to atmospheric forcing from the
variability due to intrinsic ocean dynamics, we compare model runs driven with
inter-annually varying forcing (1958-2018) and model runs driven with
repeat-year forcing. Models with coarse resolution that rely on eddy
parameterizations, show (i) significantly reduced variance of the upper-ocean
heat content at decadal time scales and (ii) differences in the spatial
patterns of low-frequency variability compared with higher resolution models.
Climate projections are typically done with general circulation models with
coarse-resolution ocean components. Therefore, these biases affect our ability
to predict decadal climate modes of variability and, in turn, hinder climate
projections. Our results suggest that for improving climate projections, the
community should move towards coupled climate models with higher oceanic
resolution.

previous studies suggest. Electrons in Mars's magnetosheath originate in the
solar wind and are accelerated by an electric field when they cross the bow
shock. Assuming that this acceleration is localized solely to the shock, the
field-aligned electron distributions in the sheath are expected to be highly
asymmetric. However, such an asymmetry is not observed in this study. Based on
the analysis here, it is suggested that an additional parallel acceleration
takes place downstream of the Martian bow shock. This additional acceleration
suppresses the expected asymmetry of the electron distribution. Consequently,
along a flux tube in the magnetosheath that is tied on both ends to the bow
shock the difference in energization between parallel and anti-parallel
electrons is less than about 20 eV. Where this energization difference is
expected to be maximal, we find the energization difference to be at most 25%
of the predicted value.

goals can be reached with a simple polynomial exploration procedure, called IW,
that runs in time exponential in the problem width. Such problems have indeed a
bounded width: a width that does not grow with the number of problem variables
and is often no greater than two. Yet, while the notion of width has become
part of the state-of-the-art planning algorithms like BFWS, there is still no
good explanation for why so many benchmark domains have bounded width. In this
work, we address this question by relating bounded width and serialized width
to ideas of generalized planning, where general policies aim to solve multiple
instances of a planning problem all at once. We show that bounded width is a
property of planning domains that admit optimal general policies in terms of
features that are explicitly or implicitly represented in the domain encoding.
The results are extended to much larger class of domains with bounded
serialized width where the general policies do not have to be optimal. The
study leads also to a new simple, meaningful, and expressive language for
specifying domain serializations in the form of policy sketches which can be
used for encoding domain control knowledge by hand or for learning it from
traces. The use of sketches and the meaning of the theoretical results are all
illustrated through a number of examples.

proposes a novel approach towards enhancing the security of the User Layer (UL)
in the MCC environment. The approach named MINDPRES (Mobile- Cloud Intrusion
Detection and Prevention System) combines a host-based IDS and network-based
IDS using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It applies dynamic analysis of both
device resources and network traffic in order to detect malicious activities at
the UL in the MCC environment. Preliminary investigations show that our
approach will enhance the security of the UL in the MCC environment. Our future
work will include the development and the evaluation of the proposed model
across the various mobile platforms in the MCC environment.

DRAGraces is more straightforward and easy to use and is less likely to be

starts moving with respect to the universal expansion at $z_{\rm eq}\sim 3,200$
while baryons remain frozen until $z_{\rm rec}\sim 1,100$. It has been
suggested that in this case post-linear corrections to the evolution of small
fluctuations would result, for the standard $\Lambda$-dominated cold DM (CDM)
model, in delayed formation of early objects as supersonic advection flows
develop after recombination, so baryons are not immediately captured by the DM
gravity on small scales. We develop the hydrodynamical description of such
two-component advection and show that, in the supersonic regime, the advection
within irrotational fluids is governed by the gradient of the difference of the
kinetic energies of the two (DM and baryonic here) components. We then apply
this formalism to the case where DM is made up of LIGO-type black holes (BHs)
and show that there the advection process on scales relevant for early
structure collapse will differ significantly from the earlier discussed (CDM)
case because of the additional granulation component to the density field
produced during inflation. The advection here will lead efficiently to the
common motion of the DM and baryon components on scales relevant for collapse
and formation of first luminous sources.This leads to early collapse making
easier to explain the existence of supermassive BHs observed in quasars at high
$z>7$. The resultant net advection rate reaches minimum around $< 10^9M_\odot$
and subsequently rises to a secondary maximum near the typical mass of $\sim
10^{12}M_\odot$, which may be an important consideration for formation of

producing high quality depth maps given only image sequences as input. However,
its performance usually drops when estimating on border areas or objects with
thin structures due to the limited depth representation ability. In this paper,
we address this problem by proposing a semantic-guided depth representation
enhancement method, which promotes both local and global depth feature
representations by leveraging rich contextual information. In stead of a single
depth network as used in conventional paradigms, we propose an extra semantic
segmentation branch to offer extra contextual features for depth estimation.
Based on this framework, we enhance the local feature representation by
sampling and feeding the point-based features that locate on the semantic edges
to an individual Semantic-guided Edge Enhancement module (SEEM), which is
specifically designed for promoting depth estimation on the challenging
semantic borders. Then, we improve the global feature representation by
proposing a semantic-guided multi-level attention mechanism, which enhances the
semantic and depth features by exploring pixel-wise correlations in the
multi-level depth decoding scheme. Extensive experiments validate the distinct
superiority of our method in capturing highly accurate depth on the challenging
image areas such as semantic category borders and thin objects. Both
quantitative and qualitative experiments on KITTI show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

pixel-wise segmentations, which are expensive to obtain in practice. Mixed
supervision could mitigate this difficulty, with a small fraction of the data
containing complete pixel-wise annotations, while the rest being less
supervised, e.g., only a handful of pixels are labeled. In this work, we
propose a dual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher) receives
strong annotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by limited
supervision and guided by the upper branch. In conjunction with a standard
cross-entropy over the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates two
important terms: (i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the less-supervised
images, which encourages confident student predictions at the bottom branch;
and (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which transfers the knowledge from
the predictions generated by the strongly supervised branch to the
less-supervised branch, and guides the entropy (student-confidence) term to
avoid trivial solutions. Very interestingly, we show that the synergy between
the entropy and KL divergence yields substantial improvements in performances.
Furthermore, we discuss an interesting link between Shannon-entropy
minimization and standard pseudo-mask generation and argue that the former
should be preferred over the latter for leveraging information from unlabeled
pixels. Through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show
the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in segmenting the left-ventricle
endocardium in MRI images. We demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms other strategies to tackle semantic segmentation within a
mixed-supervision framework. More interestingly, and in line with recent
observations in classification, we show that the branch trained with reduced

blueshifted bow shock traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers was 28 km s-1
corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 60 years. The direction of the maser
outflow is slightly tilted compared with the radio jet, which could suggest a
more recent ejection episode during the accretion burst event. The total flux
density of the 22 GHz H2O masers has gradually increased from early 2017 and
has become almost constant in 2018. For the first time, we reveal extended H2O
maser emission at 22 GHz in a star forming region, which is partly resolved out
by VERA and even by the most extended VLA configurations. We find that the flux
variation of such an extended component is similar to that of the unresolved
maser emission. We also conducted observations of the submillimeter continuum
and the 321 GHz H2O masers with ALMA at Band 7. The continuum emission does not
show significant variations compared with the previous observations performed 5
months before. We mapped the 321 GHz H2O masers in S255 NIRS 3 providing the
fourth example, for this maser, of the spatial distribution in a high-mass
star-forming region. The lower ratio of the 22 GHz/321 GHz maser luminosity in
the blueshifted bow shock suggests a temperature (>1000 K), higher than for the
other maser features in this region. We conclude that the bow shock structure
traced by the 22 GHz H2O maser features is unlikely to be originating at the
interface between the radio jet powered by the recent accretion outburst and
the surrounding medium. The brightening of the 22 GHz H2O masers could be due
to radiative excitation by photons form the infrared outburst escaping along

such mechanism is the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
description. When a bug gets a CVE, it is referenced by its CVE ID. Thus we
explore thousands of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects, on
Github, to determine if developers reference or discuss CVEs in their code,
commits, and issues. CVEs will often refer to 3rd party software dependencies
of a project and thus the bug will not be in the actual product itself. We
study how many of these references are intentional CVE references, and how many
are relevant bugs within the projects themselves. We investigate how the bugs
that reference CVEs are fixed and how long it takes to fix these bugs. The
results of our manual classification for 250 bug reports show that 88 (35%), 32
(13%), and 130 (52%) are classified into ""Version Update"", ""Fixing Code"", and
""Discussion"". To understand how long it takes to fix those bugs, we compare two
periods, Reporting Period, a period between the disclosure date of
vulnerability information in CVE repositories and the creation date of the bug
report in a project, and Fixing Period, a period between the creation date of
the bug report and the fixing date of the bug report. We find that 44% of bug

with data scarcity, we propose an effective training data generation process by
fitting a 3D car model with dynamic parts to vehicles in real images before
reconstructing human-vehicle interaction (VHI) scenarios. Our approach is fully
automatic without any human interaction, which can generate a large number of

Fornax formed in E-MOSAICS, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation that
self-consistently follows the formation and evolution of GCs in the EAGLE
galaxy formation model. In EAGLE, Fornax-mass haloes are cuspy and well
described by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We post-process the E-MOSAICS to
account for GC orbital decay by dynamical friction, which is not included in
the original model. Dynamical friction causes 33 per cent of GCs with masses
$M_{\rm GC}\geq4\times10^4 {~\rm M_\odot}$ to sink to the centre of their host
where they are tidally disrupted. Fornax has a total of five GCs, an
exceptionally large number compared to other galaxies of similar stellar mass.
In the simulations, we find that only 3 per cent of the Fornax analogues have
five or more GCs, while 30 per cent have only one and 35 per cent have none. We
find that GC systems in satellites are more centrally concentrated than in
field dwarfs, and that those formed in situ (45 per cent) are more concentrated
than those that were accreted. The survival probability of a GC increases
rapidly with the radial distance at which it formed ($r_{\rm init}$): it is 37
per cent for GCs with $r_{\rm init} \leq 1$ kpc and 92 per cent for GCs with
$r_{\rm init} \geq 1$ kpc. The present-day radial distribution of GCs in
E-MOSAICS turns out to be indistinguishable from that in Fornax, demonstrating
that, contrary to claims in the literature, the presence of five GCs in the

and a-CNT and a-CNS. Results showed that a-CNT and a-CNS have distinct elastic
properties and fracture patterns concerning their pristine analogs. Both a-CNT
and a-CNS presented a non-elastic regime before their total rupture, whereas
the CNT and CNS undergo a direct conversion to fractured forms after a critical
strain threshold. The critical strain for the fracture of the a-CNT and a-CNS
are about 30% and 25%, respectively, and they are lower than the corresponding
CNT and CNS cases. Although less resilient to tension, the amorphous tubular
structures have similar thermal stability in relation to the pristine cases
with melting points of 5500K, 6300K, 5100K, and 5900K for a-CNT, CNT, a-CNS,
and CNS, respectively. An interesting result is whereas the behavior of the
pristine systems is substantially different depending on the system being a
nanotube or a nanoscroll, thus indicating that the topology plays an important
role, the same is not true for the amorphous version of the nanostructures,
thus indicating that the structural disorder overcomes the topological
features.

had major or minor mergers (mass ratios $\ge 0.3$ and $0.1-0.3$, respectively)
tend to have a higher triaxiality parameter and ex-situ stellar fractions than
those that had exclusively very minor mergers or formed in the absence of

hole-to-stellar mass ratios and quenched later than other SRs, leaving imprints
on their $z=0$ chemical composition. For the vast majority of SRs we find that
quenching, driven by active galactic nuclei feedback, precedes kinematic
transformation, except for satellite SRs, in which these processes happen in
tandem. However, in $\approx 50$\% of these satellites, satellite-satellite
mergers are responsible for their SR fate, while environment (i.e. tidal field
and interactions with the central) can account for the transformation in the
rest. By splitting SRs into kinematic sub-classes, we find that flat SRs prefer
major mergers; round SRs prefer minor or very minor mergers; prolate SRs prefer
gas-poor mergers. Flat and prolate SRs are more common among satellites hosted
by massive halos ($>10^{13.6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) and centrals of high masses
($M_{\star} > 10^{10.5}\, \rm M_{\odot}$). Although EAGLE galaxies display
kinematic properties that broadly agree with observations, there are areas of
disagreement, such as inverted stellar age and velocity dispersion profiles. We

momentum, the occurrence of normal reflection depends on the relative
orientation between the Fermi arcs and the normal of the junction, which is a
direct result of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Consequently, a crossover from
the suppressed to perfect AR occurs with varying the orientation of the planar
junction, giving rise to a change from double-peak to plateau structure in
conductance spectra. Moreover, such a crossover can be facilitated by imposing
a magnetic field, making electrons slide along the Fermi arcs so as to switch

detection of Fermi arcs and open the possibilities of exploring novel

optical quantum technology because the frequency range suitable for photon
manipulation and communication usually varies widely. Recently, an efficient
frequency conversion system using a double-$\Lambda$ four-wave mixing (FWM)
process based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has attracted
considerable attention because of its potential to achieve a nearly 100%
conversion efficiency (CE). To obtain such a high CE, the spontaneous emission
loss in this resonant-type FWM system must be suppressed considerably. A simple
solution is to arrange the applied laser fields in a backward configuration.
However, the phase mismatch due to this configuration can cause a significant
decrease in CE. Here, we demonstrate that the phase mismatch can be effectively
compensated by introducing the phase shift obtained by two-photon detuning.
Under optimal conditions, we observe a wavelength conversion from 780 to 795 nm
with a maximum CE of 91.2(6)% by using this backward FWM system at an optical
depth of 130 in cold rubidium atoms. The current work represents an important
step toward achieving low-loss, high-fidelity EIT-based quantum frequency
conversion.

arbitrarily polarized sources, with neither a restriction on FoV nor with any a
priori assumption regarding the polarization state of the source. We verify the
resulting formula with an all-sky observation using the Murchison Widefield
Array (MWA) telescope. Methods: The sensitivity expression is developed from
first principles by applying the concept of System Equivalent Flux Density
(SEFD) to a polarimetric radio interferometer not by computing $A_e/T_{sys}$.
The SEFD is calculated from the standard deviation of the noisy flux density
estimate for a target source due to system noise. Results: The SEFD for a
polarimetric radio interferometer is generally not $1/\sqrt{2}$ of a
single-polarized interferometer as is often assumed for narrow FoV. This
assumption can lead to significant errors for a dual-polarized dipole based
system, which is common in low-frequency radio astronomy: up to $\sim 15\%$ for
a zenith angle (ZA) coverage of $45^\circ$, and up to $\sim45\%$ for $60^\circ$
coverage. The worst case errors occur in the diagonal planes of the dipole for
very wide FoV. This is demonstrated through theory, simulation and
observations. Furthermore, using the resulting formulation, calculation of the
off-zenith sensitivity is straightforward and unambiguous. Conclusions: For
wide FoV observations pertinent to low-frequency radio interferometer such as
the SKA-Low, the narrow FoV and the single-polarized sensitivity expressions
are not correct and should be replaced by the formula derived in this paper.

coordinate-invariant degrees of freedom of the linear gravitational field. The
coordinate freedom of general relativity can be exploited to cast the field
equations into Maxwellian form, but such forms can be mere mirages of the
coordinate choice -- mirages such as vector gravitational waves. A coordinate
choice that yields perfectly-Maxwellian field equations, will yield a force
equation that is not Lorentzian. If field definitions are chosen to obtain
Lorentz-like terms in the force equation, then Maxwellian forms are compromised
in the field equations. Many treatments of gravito-electromagnetism will make
inconsistent ordering choices between the field equations and force equations,

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has been widely applied in transportation
demand prediction due to its excellent ability to capture non-Euclidean spatial
dependence among station-level or regional transportation demands. However, in
most of the existing research, the graph convolution was implemented on a
heuristically generated adjacency matrix, which could neither reflect the real
spatial relationships of stations accurately, nor capture the multi-level
spatial dependence of demands adaptively. To cope with the above problems, this
paper provides a novel graph convolutional network for transportation demand
prediction. Firstly, a novel graph convolution architecture is proposed, which
has different adjacency matrices in different layers and all the adjacency
matrices are self-learned during the training process. Secondly, a layer-wise
coupling mechanism is provided, which associates the upper-level adjacency
matrix with the lower-level one. It also reduces the scale of parameters in our
model. Lastly, a unitary network is constructed to give the final prediction
result by integrating the hidden spatial states with gated recurrent unit,
which could capture the multi-level spatial dependence and temporal dynamics
simultaneously. Experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, NYC
Citi Bike and NYC Taxi, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our
model over the state-of-the-art ones.

prestin (SLC26a5), in high density, whose charge movement is evidenced as a
nonlinear capacitance (NLC). NLC is bell-shaped, with its peak occurring at a
voltage, Vh, where sensor charge is equally distributed across the plasma
membrane. Thus, Vh provides information on the conformational state of prestin.
Vh is sensitive to membrane tension, shifting to positive voltage as tension
increases and is the basis for considering prestin piezoelectric (PZE). NLC can
be deconstructed into real and imaginary components that report on charge
movements in phase or 90 degrees out of phase with AC voltage. Here we show in
membrane macro-patches of the OHC that there is a partial trade-off in the
magnitude of real and imaginary components as interrogation frequency
increases, as predicted by a recent PZE model (Rabbitt, 2020). However, we find
similar behavior in a simple kinetic model of prestin that lacks piezoelectric
coupling, the meno presto model. At a particular frequency, Fis, the complex
component magnitudes intersect. Using this metric, Fis, which depends on the
frequency response of each complex component, we find that initial Vh
influences Fis; thus, by categorizing patches into groups of different Vh,
(above and below -30 mV) we find that Fis is lower for the negative Vh group.
We also find that the effect of membrane tension on complex NLC is dependent,
but differentially so, on initial Vh. Whereas the negative group exhibits
shifts to higher frequencies for increasing tension, the opposite occurs for
the positive group. Despite complex component trade-offs, the low-pass roll-off
in absolute magnitude of NLC, which varies little with our perturbations and is
indicative of diminishing total charge movement, poses a challenge for a role
of voltage-driven prestin in cochlear amplification at very high frequencies.

which of those can be efficiently analyzed/has good theoretical properties. For
this task, we present an R library called IsoCheck that checks the isomorphism
of multi-stage 2^n factorial experiments with randomization restrictions.
Through representing the factors and their combinations as a finite projective
geometry, IsoCheck recasts the problem of searching over all possible
relabelings as a search over collineations, then exploits projective geometric
properties of the space to make the search much more efficient. Furthermore, a
bitstring representation of the factorial effects is used to characterize all
possible rearrangements of designs, thus facilitating quick comparisons after
relabeling. We present several examples with R code to illustrate the usage of
the main functions in IsoCheck. Besides checking equivalence and isomorphism of
2^n multi-stage factorial designs, we demonstrate how the functions of the
package can be used to create a catalog of all non-isomorphic designs, and
subsequently rank these designs based on a suitably defined ranking criterion.

challenges to the power system. A cost-effective reserve deployment and
uncertainty pricing mechanism are critical to deal with the uncertainty and
variability of RES. To this end, this paper proposes a novel locational
marginal pricing mechanism in day-ahead market for managing uncertainties from
RES. Firstly, an improved multi-ellipsoidal uncertainty set (IMEUS) considering
the temporal correlation and conditional correlation of wind power forecast is
formulated to better capture the uncertainty of wind power. The dimension of
each ellipsoidal subset is optimized based on a comprehensive evaluation index
to reduce the invalid region without large loss of modeling accuracy, so as to
reduce the conservatism. Then, an IMEUS-based robust unit commitment (RUC)
model and a robust economic dispatch (RED) model are established for the
day-ahead market clearing. Both the reserve cost and ramping constraints are
considered in the overall dispatch process. Furthermore, based on the
Langrangian function of the RED model, a new locational marginal pricing
mechanism is developed. The uncertainty locational marginal price (ULMP) is
introduced to charge the RES for its uncertainties and reward the generators
who provide reserve to mitigate uncertainties. The new pricing mechanism can
provide effective price signals to incentivize the uncertainty management in
the day-ahead market. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is
verified via numerous simulations on the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 118-bus

systems consisting of multiple devices, networks, and/or plants. Those systems
are often characterized by a pair of multivariate datasets. To detect anomaly
in such a system and localize element(s) associated with anomaly, one would
need to estimate scores that quantify anomalousness of the entire system as
well as its elements. However, it is not trivial to estimate such scores by
considering changes of relationships between the elements, which strongly
correlate with each other. Moreover, it is necessary to estimate the scores for
the entire system and its elements from a single framework, in order to
identify relationships among the scores for localizing elements associated with
anomaly. Here, we developed a new method to quantify anomalousness of an entire
system and its elements simultaneously.
  The purpose of this paper is threefold. The first one is to propose a new
anomaly detection method: Double Kernelized Scoring (DKS). DKS is a unified
framework for entire-system anomaly scoring and element-wise anomaly scoring.
Therefore, DKS allows for conducting simultaneously 1) anomaly detection for
the entire system and 2) localization for identifying faulty elements
responsible for the system anomaly. The second purpose is to propose a new
kernel function: Matrix Kernel. The Matrix Kernel is defined between general
matrices, which might have different dimensions, allowing for conducting
anomaly detection on systems where the number of elements change over time. The
third purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
experimentally. We evaluated the proposed method with synthetic and real time
series data. The results demonstrate that DKS is able to detect anomaly and
localize the elements associated with it successfully.

previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the
annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the
relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20%
increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched
annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm
that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the
tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64,
128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of
labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better

paper proposes predictive time-series models of occupancy patterns using LSTM.
Prediction signal for future room occupancy status on the next time span (e.g.,
next 30 minutes) can be directly used to operate HVAC. For example, based on
the prediction and considering the time for cooling or heating, HVAC can be
turned on before the room is being used (e.g., turn on 10 minutes earlier).
Also, based on the next room empty prediction timing, HVAC can be turned off
earlier, and it can help us increase the efficiency of HVAC while not
decreasing comfort. We demonstrate our approach's capabilities using real-world

spectroscopy, both with respect to achieving high signal-to-noise ratios or
when targeting high-precision radial velocity measurements, with multi-mode
fiber-fed high-resolution spectrographs. Traditionally, modal noise is reduced
by agitating or ""shaking"" the fiber. This way, the light propagating in the
fiber is redistributed over many different modes. However, in case of fibers
with only a limited number of modes, e.g. at near-infrared wavelengths or in
adaptive-optics assisted systems, this method becomes very inefficient. The
strong agitation that would be needed stresses the fiber and could lead to
focal ratio degradation, or worse, to damaging the fiber. As an alternative
approach, we propose to make use of a classic optical double scrambler, a
device that is already implemented in many high-precision radial-velocity
spectrographs, to mitigate the effect of modal noise by rotating the
scrambler's first fiber end during each exposure. Because of the rotating
illumination pattern of the scrambler's second fiber, the modes that are
excited vary continuously. This leads to very efficient averaging of the modal
pattern at the fiber exit and to a strong reduction of modal noise. In this
contribution, we present a prototype design and preliminary laboratory results

monthly since 2007 at an observing frequency of 1.4 GHz. The wide dispersion
measure (DM) range of the pulsar sample and the uniformity of the observing
procedure make the data-set extremely valuable for studies of flux density
variability and the interstellar medium. Here, we present flux density
measurements and modulation indices of these pulsars over this period. We
derive the structure function from the light curves and discuss the
contributions to it from measurement noise, intrinsic variability and
interstellar scintillation. Despite a large scatter, we show that the
modulation index is inversely correlated with DM, and can be generally
described by a power-law with an index of $\sim-0.7$ covering DMs from $\sim10$
to 1000 cm$^{-3}$ pc. We present refractive timescales and/or lower limits for
a group of 42 pulsars. These often have values significantly different from
theoretical expectations, indicating the complex nature of the interstellar
medium along individual lines of sight. In particular, local structures and
non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations are likely playing important roles in the
observed flux density variation of many of these pulsars.

Palma (SPAIN). MARVEL consists of an array of four 80 cm telescopes linked
through optical fibers to a single high-resolution echelle spectrograph,
optimized for extreme-precision radial velocity measurements. It can observe
the radial velocities of four different stars simultaneously or, alternatively,
combine the flux from four telescopes pointing to a single faint target in one

training and sampling on high-dimensional datasets remains challenging.
Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a
diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a
sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM
is trained with recovery likelihood, which maximizes the conditional
probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at
a higher noise level. Optimizing recovery likelihood is more tractable than
marginal likelihood, as sampling from the conditional distributions is much
easier than sampling from the marginal distributions. After training,
synthesized images can be generated by the sampling process that initializes
from Gaussian white noise distribution and progressively samples the
conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method
generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional
CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.58 and inception score 8.30, superior to the
majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs,
our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and
still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the
normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/ruiqigao/recovery_likelihood.

of dusty solid material. However, it is unclear how early this process begins.
We study the physical structure and grain growth in the edge-on disk that
surrounds the ~1 Myr old low-mass (~0.55 Msun) protostar embedded in the Bok
Globule CB26 to examine how much grain growth has already occurred in the
protostellar phase. We combine the SED between 0.9 ${\mu}$m and 6.4 cm with
high angular resolution continuum maps at 1.3, 2.9, and 8.1 mm, and use the
radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to conduct a detailed modelling of the dust
emission from the disk and envelope of CB 26. We infer inner and outer disk
radii of around 16 au and 172$\pm$22 au, respectively. The total gas mass in
the disk is ~0.076 Msun, which amounts to ~14% of the mass of the central star.
The inner disk contains a compact free-free emission region, which could be
related to either a jet or a photoevaporation region. The thermal dust emission
from the outer disk is optically thin at mm wavelengths, while the emission
from the inner disk midplane is moderately optically thick. Our best-fit
radiative transfer models indicate that the dust grains in the disk have
already grown to pebbles with diameters of the order of 10 cm in size. Residual
8.1 mm emission suggests the presence of even larger particles in the inner
disk. For the optically thin mm dust emission from the outer disk, we derive a
mean opacity slope of 0.6$\pm$0.4, which is consistent with the presence of
large dust grains. The presence of cm-sized bodies in the CB 26 disk indicates
that solids grow rapidly already during the first million years in a
protostellar disk. It is thus possible that Class II disks are already seeded
with large particles and may contain even planetesimals.

Most recently, several researchers attempted to compare neighboring nodes in

between entities which are also important for neighborhood matching. In
addition, existing methods paid less attention to the positive interactions

study their influence on data volume and accuracy when applied to geospatial
data sets with different structural behaviour. The performance of the

disproportionately affected ex-ante poorer areas. In this paper, we provide the
first evidence of the impact of these austerity measures on two different but
complementary elements of crime -- the crime rate and the less-studied
concentration of crime -- over the period 2011-2015 in England and Wales, and
document four new facts. First, areas more exposed to the welfare reforms
experience increased levels of crime, an effect driven by a rise in violent
crime. Second, both violent and property crime become more concentrated within
an area due to the welfare reforms. Third, it is ex-ante more deprived
neighborhoods that bear the brunt of the crime increases over this period.
Fourth, we find no evidence that the welfare reforms increased recidivism,
suggesting that the changes in crime we find are likely driven by new
criminals. Combining these results, we document unambiguous evidence of a
negative spillover of the welfare reforms at the heart of the UK government's
austerity program on social welfare, which reinforced the direct
inequality-worsening effect of this program. Guided by a hedonic house price
model, we calculate the welfare effects implied by the cuts in order to provide
a financial quantification of the impact of the reform. We document an implied
welfare loss of the policy -- borne by the public -- that far exceeds the
savings made to government coffers.

within a single sparse computational kernel. We show that a system that looks

Specifically, we propose a domain-specific data-flow graph model of imperative

We construct a product on this bundle covering the fusion of loops, i.e., the

a bundle of bimodules over a certain von Neumann algebra bundle, and realize
our product fibrewise using the Connes fusion of von Neumann bimodules. Our

functorial field theories, and index theory. It is related to the pair of pants

compression framework that is fast, robust to sampling, and applicable to high

topologies is hardly scaleable to more than just a few thousand points. We
tackle the task with a novel neural network architecture characterized by
weight sharing and autodecoding. Our architecture uses parameters much more
efficiently than previous work, allowing us to be deeper and scalable.
Futhermore, we show that the currently only tractable training criterion for
point cloud compression, the Chamfer distance, performances poorly for high
resolutions. To overcome this issue, we pair our architecture with a new
training procedure based upon a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) for which we
state two approximation algorithms. We solve the QAP in parallel to gradient
descent. This procedure acts as a surrogate loss and allows to implicitly
minimize the more expressive Earth Movers Distance (EMD) even for point clouds
with way more than $10^6$ points. As evaluating the EMD on high resolution
point clouds is intractable, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach based on
k-d trees, the EM-kD, as a scaleable and fast but still reliable upper bound
for the EMD. NeuralQAAD is demonstrated on COMA, D-FAUST, and Skulls to
significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art visually and in terms of
the EM-kD. Skulls is a novel dataset of skull CT-scans which we will make
publicly available together with our implementation of NeuralQAAD.

fluctuations due to inhomogeneous distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs)
in the case where PBHs eventually dominate and reheat the universe by Hawking
evaporation. The initial PBH density fluctuations are isocurvature in nature.
We find that most of the induced GWs are generated right after evaporation,
when the universe transits from the PBH dominated era to the radiation
dominated era and the curvature perturbation starts to oscillate wildly. The
strongest constraint on the amount of the produced GWs comes from the big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). We improve previous constraints on the PBH fraction and
find that it cannot exceed $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, this maximum fraction
decreases as the mass increases and reaches $10^{-9}$ for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim
5\times10^8 {\rm g}$, which is the largest mass allowed by the BBN constraint
on the reheating temperature. Considering that PBH may cluster above a given
clustering scale, we also derive a lower bound on the scale of clustering.
Interestingly, the GW spectrum for $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^4 -10^8 {\rm g}$ enters
the observational window of LIGO and DECIGO and could be tested in the future.
Although we focus on the PBH dominated early universe in this paper, our
methodology is applicable to any model with early isocurvature perturbation.

the near- and far-field planes of the signal and idler modes. We certify EPR
correlations with high statistical significance of up to 45 standard
deviations. Furthermore, we determine the entanglement of formation of our
source to be greater than one, indicating a dimensionality of greater than 2.
Operating at telecommunication wavelengths around 1550 nm, our source is
compatible with today's deployed telecommunication infrastructure, thus paving
the way for integrating sources of high-dimensional entanglement into
quantum-communication infrastructures.

analyse the problem of computing higher symmetries for the conformal

compelling evidence for the assumed connection between the level of mixed

While there
exists a variety of models hosting these excitations, typical fracton systems
require rather complicated many-particle interactions. Here, we discuss fracton
behavior in the more common physical setting of classical kagome spin models
with frustrated two-body interactions only. We investigate systems with
different types of elementary spin degrees of freedom (three-state Potts, XY,
and Heisenberg spins) which all exhibit characteristic subsystem symmetries and
fracton-like excitations. The mobility constraints of isolated fractons and
bound fracton pairs in the three-state Potts model are, however, strikingly
different compared to the known type-I or type-II fracton models. One may still
explain these properties in terms of type-I fracton behavior and construct an
effective low-energy tensor gauge theory when considering the system as a 2D
cut of a 3D cubic lattice model. Our extensive classical Monte-Carlo
simulations further indicate a crossover into a low temperature glassy phase
where the system gets trapped in metastable fracton states. Moving on to XY
spins, we find that in addition to fractons the system hosts fractional vortex
excitations. As a result of the restricted mobility of both types of defects,
our classical Monte-Carlo simulations do not indicate a Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition but again show a crossover into a glassy low-temperature regime.
Finally, the energy barriers associated with fractons vanish in the case of
Heisenberg spins, such that defect states may continuously decay into a ground
state. These decays, however, exhibit a power-law relaxation behavior which
leads to slow equilibration dynamics at low temperatures.

time-derivatives of the well-known continuous-time definition by
forward-shifts. With this definition, the class of flat systems corresponds
exactly to the class of systems which can be linearized by a discrete-time
endogenous dynamic feedback as it is proposed in the literature. Recently,
verifiable necessary and sufficient differential-geometric conditions for this
property have been derived. In the present contribution, we make an attempt to
take into account also backward-shifts. This extended approach is motivated by
the one-to-one correspondence of solutions of flat systems to solutions of a
trivial system as it is known from the continuous-time case. If we transfer
this idea to the discrete-time case, this leads to an approach which also
allows backward-shifts. To distinguish the classical definition with
forward-shifts and the approach of the present paper, we refer to the former as
forward-flatness. We show that flat systems (in the extended sense with
backward-shifts) still share many beneficial properties of forward-flat
systems. In particular, they still are reachable/controllable, allow a
straightforward planning of trajectories and can be linearized by a certain
subclass of dynamic feedbacks.

large body of research works already reported, current key technological
challenges include those of multi-agent learning and long-term autonomy.
Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent LfD
robotic learning is introduced, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of
open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex
environments. In particular, the designed architecture capitalizes on the
recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, by establishing a
Federated Learning (FL)-based framework for incarnating a multi-human
multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The fundamental
conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes
(implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a
network of robotic platforms, while global AI models (underpinning the
aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created and shared among the
network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot
interaction instances. Regarding pivotal novelties, the designed cognitive
architecture a) introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the
conventional LfD learning paradigm to support large-scale multi-agent
operational settings, b) elaborates previous FL-based self-learning robotic
schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop and c) consolidates
the fundamental principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled
learning methodologies for modelling the multi-level inter-dependencies among
the robotic tasks. The applicability of the proposed framework is explained
using an example of a real-world industrial case study for agile

to the large amount of data. For example, in atmospheric transmittance
spectroscopy, the solar occultation channel (SO) of the NOMAD instrument
onboard the ESA ExoMars2016 satellite called Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) had
produced $\sim$10 millions of spectra in 20000 acquisition sequences since the
beginning of the mission in April 2018 until 15 January 2020. Other datasets
are even larger with $\sim$billions of spectra for OMEGA onboard Mars Express
or CRISM onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Usually, new lines are discovered
after a long iterative process of model fitting and manual residual analysis.
Here we propose a new method based on unsupervised machine learning, to
automatically detect new minor species. Although precise quantification is out
of scope, this tool can also be used to quickly summarize the dataset, by
giving few endmembers (""source"") and their abundances. We approximate the
dataset non-linearity by a linear mixture of abundance and source spectra
(endmembers). We used unsupervised source separation in form of non-negative
matrix factorization to estimate those quantities. Several methods are tested
on synthetic and simulation data. Our approach is dedicated to detect minor
species spectra rather than precisely quantifying them. On synthetic example,
this approach is able to detect chemical compounds present in form of 100
hidden spectra out of $10^4$, at 1.5 times the noise level. Results on
simulated spectra of NOMAD-SO targeting CH$_{4}$ show that detection limits
goes in the range of 100-500 ppt in favorable conditions. Results on real
martian data from NOMAD-SO show that CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O are present, as

been exponentially increased leading to the discovery of a wide category of
materials including intermetallics and oxides. Even though the reported
materials were found to show excellent magnetocaloric properties on laboratory
scale, only a restricted family among them could be upscaled toward industrial
levels and implemented as refrigerants in magnetic cooling devices. On the
other hand, in the most of reported reviews, the magnetocaloric materials are
usually discussed in terms of their adiabatic temperature and entropy changes,
which is not enough to get more insight about their large scale applicability.
In this review, not only the fundamental properties of recently reported
magnetocaloric materials are discussed but also their thermodynamic performance
in functional devices. The reviewed families particularly include Gd1-xRx
alloys, LaFe13-xSix, MnFeP1-xAsx and R1-xAxMnO3 based compounds. Other relevant
practical aspects such as mechanical stability, synthesis and corrosion issues
are discussed. In addition, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that play a
crucial role in the control of magnetic and magnetocaloric properties are
regarded. In order to reproduce the needed magnetocaloric parameters, some
practical models are proposed. Finally, the concepts of the rotating
magnetocaloric effect and multilayered magnetocalorics are introduced.

multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) receivers. However, it is
still unclear if such methods are truly competitive with respect to
conventional methods in realistic scenarios and under practical constraints. In
addition to enabling accurate signal reconstruction on realistic channel
models, MU-MIMO receive algorithms must allow for easy adaptation to a varying
number of users without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing work,
we propose an ML-enhanced MU-MIMO receiver that builds on top of a conventional
linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) architecture. It preserves the
interpretability and scalability of the LMMSE receiver, while improving its
accuracy in two ways. First, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to
compute an approximation of the second-order statistics of the channel
estimation error which are required for accurate equalization. Second, a
CNN-based demapper jointly processes a large number of orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols and subcarriers, which allows it
to compute better log likelihood ratios (LLRs) by compensating for channel
aging. The resulting architecture can be used in the up- and downlink and is
trained in an end-to-end manner, removing the need for hard-to-get perfect
channel state information (CSI) during the training phase. Simulation results
demonstrate consistent performance improvements over the baseline which are
especially pronounced in high mobility scenarios.

over time-varying multi-agent networks. The state of each agent represents the
amount of used resources (or produced utilities) while the total amount of
resources is fixed. The idea is to optimally allocate the resources among the
group of agents by minimizing the overall cost function subject to fixed sum of
resources. Each agents' information is restricted to its own state and cost
function and those of its immediate in-neighbors. This is motivated by
distributed applications such as mobile edge-computing, economic dispatch over
smart grids, and multi-agent coverage control. This work provides a fast
convergent solution (in comparison with linear dynamics) while considering
relaxed network connectivity with quantized communication links. The proposed
dynamics reaches optimal solution over switching (possibly disconnected)
undirected networks as far as their union over some bounded non-overlapping
time-intervals has a spanning-tree. We prove feasibility of the solution,
uniqueness of the optimal state, and convergence to the optimal value under the
proposed dynamics, where the analysis is applicable to similar 1st-order
allocation dynamics with strongly sign-preserving nonlinearities, such as
actuator saturation.

recent advances have significantly increased the size of the networks that
verification tools can handle. However, most methods are designed for
verification of an idealized model of the actual network which works over real
arithmetic and ignores rounding imprecisions. This idealization is in stark
contrast to network quantization, which is a technique that trades numerical
precision for computational efficiency and is, therefore, often applied in
practice. Neglecting rounding errors of such low-bit quantized neural networks
has been shown to lead to wrong conclusions about the network's correctness.
Thus, the desired approach for verifying quantized neural networks would be one
that takes these rounding errors into account. In this paper, we show that
verifying the bit-exact implementation of quantized neural networks with
bit-vector specifications is PSPACE-hard, even though verifying idealized
real-valued networks and satisfiability of bit-vector specifications alone are
each in NP. Furthermore, we explore several practical heuristics toward closing
the complexity gap between idealized and bit-exact verification. In particular,
we propose three techniques for making SMT-based verification of quantized
neural networks more scalable. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed
methods allow a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude over existing
approaches.

allow operation of them in a variety of configurations such as slow unbuffered,
slow buffered, fast buffered or unbuffered modes to optimise the detector
performance for a given application. Normally at ESO, for low noise operation,
the detectors are operated in slow unbuffered mode. Whilst the slow unbuffered
mode offers a simple interface to the external preamplifier electronics, the
detector operation in this mode can suffer from reduced pixel frequency
response and higher electrical crosstalk between the readout channels. In the
context of the detector systems required for the first generation instruments
of the ELT (MICADO, HARMONI and METIS), an exercise was undertaken to evaluate
the noise, speed and crosstalk performance of the detectors in the slow
buffered mode. A test preamplifier has been designed with options to operate a
H2RG detector in buffered or unbuffered and with or without using the reference
output, so a direct performance comparison can be made between different modes.
This paper presents the performance advantages such as increased pixel
frequency response, elimination of electrical crosstalk between the readout
channels and the noise performance in the buffered mode operation. These
improvements allow us to achieve the same frame readout time using half the

pressure drop in capillary pipes and ducts. This voltage is generated by a
process which is termed spin hydrodynamic generation (SHDG), a result of the
collective electron spin--coupling to the vorticity field in the laminar flow
in combination with an inverse spin-Hall effect. We study this phenomenon in
laminar duct flows with different width-to-height aspect ratios ranging from 1
(square ducts) to infinite (two dimensional channels). First, we analytically
solve the governing Valet-Fert spin diffusion equations for the SHDG by means
of the method of small parameters together with proper boundary conditions for
the set of inhomogeneous elliptic partial differential equations. Secondly, the
proposed linear scaling law is validated through a series of experiments using
capillary tubes with rectangular and square cross-sections. The experimental
results show a very good agreement to the analytically found scaling law. A
subsequent substitution of the bulk velocity of the laminar wall-bounded flows
by the pressure drop reveals a universal scaling law for the electrical voltage
that incorporates all pipe and duct geometries which we could study in our
experiments. Finally, the efficiency of the system is estimated for circular
pipes, rectangular and square ducts. This study shows that the efficiency of a
spin hydrodynamic generator is the same for a circular pipe and a square duct
with the same diameter and height, respectively. Hence, due to the ease of
manufacturing and the possibility to scale the experiments up to parallel
settings in a compact form, micro-channels with a square cross-section seem to
be the optimum for a spin hydrodynamic generator.

magnetic materials, in which extrinsic process related to scattering effects

Recently, AHE has been counterintuitively observed in non-magnetic topological
materials and attributed to the existence of Weyl points. However, the Weyl
point scenario would lead to unsaturated AHE even in large magnetic fields and
contradicts the saturation of AHE in several tesla (T) in experiments. In this
work, we investigate the Hall effect of ZrTe5 and HfTe5 thin flakes in static
ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 33 T. We find the AHE saturates to 55 (70)
Ohm^-1*cm^-1 for ZrTe5 (HfTe5) thin flakes above ~ 10 T. Combining detailed
magnetotransport experiments and Berry curvature calculations, we clarify that
the splitting of massive Dirac bands without Weyl points can be responsible for

their material parameters. A typical example coming from geotechnical
engineering is the slope stability problem where the soil's cohesion is modeled
as a random field. An efficient manner to account for this uncertainty is the
novel sampling method called p-refined Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (p-MLQMC).
The p-MLQMC method uses a hierarchy of p-refined Finite Element meshes combined
with a deterministic Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling rule. This combination yields a
significant computational cost reduction with respect to classic Multilevel
Monte Carlo. However, in previous work, not enough consideration was given how
to incorporate the uncertainty, modeled as a random field, in the Finite
Element model with the p-MLQMC method. In the present work we investigate how
this can be adequately achieved by means of the integration point method. We
therefore investigate how the evaluation points of the random field are to be
selected in order to obtain a variance reduction over the levels. We consider
three different approaches. These approaches will be benchmarked on a slope
stability problem in terms of computational runtime. We find that for a given
tolerance the Local Nested Approach yields a speedup up to a factor five with

good performance of these coronagraphs, a precise control of the centering of
the star image in real time is needed. We previously developed and validated
the quadrant analysis of coronagraphic images for tip-tilt sensing estimator
(QACITS) pointing estimator to address this issue. While this approach is not
wavelength-dependent in theory, it was never implemented for mid-IR
observations, which leads to specific challenges and limitations. Here, we

the performance of the QACITS estimator for the centering control of the star

the QACITS-based correction loop is able to control the centering of the star

abundance and the mixing length parameter ($\alpha_{ML}$), using precise
photometric data for main-sequence (MS) stars in a cluster with negligible
reddening and well-determined distance. The method has been applied first to a
mock data set generated to mimic Hyades MS stars and then to the real Hyades
cluster. We tested the impact on the results of varying the number of stars in
the sample, the photometric errors, and the estimated [Fe/H]. The analysis of
the synthetic data set shows that $\alpha_{ML}$ is recovered with a very good
precision in all the analysed cases (with an error of few percent), while
[Fe/H] and the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ are more
problematic. If spectroscopic determinations of [Fe/H] are not available and
thus [Fe/H] has to be recovered alongside with $\Delta Y/\Delta Z$ and
$\alpha_{ML}$, the well-known degeneracy between [Fe/H]-$\Delta Y/\Delta
Z$-$\alpha_{ML}$ could result in a large uncertainty on the recovered
parameters, depending on the portion of the MS used for the analysis. On the
other hand, the prior knowledge of an accurate [Fe/H] value puts a strong
constraint on the models, leading to a more precise parameters recovery. Using
the current set of PISA models, the most recent [Fe/H] value and the Gaia
photometry and parallaxes for the Hyades cluster, we obtained the average
values $<\alpha_{ML}>=2.01\pm0.05$ and $<\Delta Y/\Delta Z>=2.03\pm0.33$,
sensitively reducing the uncertainty in these important parameters.

requires significant resources, the available protein data size is relatively
small, which consequently decreases model performance. Here we propose two
methods to construct a deep learning framework that exhibits superior
performance with a small labeled dataset. At first, we use transfer learning in
encoding protein sequences with a pretrained model, which trains general
sequence representations in an unsupervised manner. Second, we use a Bayesian
neural network to make a robust model by estimating the data uncertainty. As a
result, our model performs better than the previous baselines for predicting
drug-protein interactions. We also show that the quantified uncertainty from
the Bayesian inference is related to the confidence and can be used for

medical image computing and computer assisted interventions. One example is the
registration of 2D X-ray images with preoperative three-dimensional computed
tomography (CT) images in intraoperative surgical guidance systems. Due to the
high safety requirements in medical applications, estimating registration
uncertainty is of a crucial importance in such a scenario. However, previously
proposed methods, including classical iterative registration methods and deep
learning-based methods have one characteristic in common: They lack the
capacity to represent the fact that a registration problem may be inherently
ambiguous, meaning that multiple (substantially different) plausible solutions
exist. To tackle this limitation, we explore the application of invertible
neural networks (INN) as core component of a registration methodology. In the
proposed framework, INNs enable going beyond point estimates as network output
by representing the possible solutions to a registration problem by a
probability distribution that encodes different plausible solutions via
multiple modes. In a first feasibility study, we test the approach for a 2D 3D
registration setting by registering spinal CT volumes to X-ray images. To this
end, we simulate the X-ray images taken by a C-Arm with multiple orientations
using the principle of digitially reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Due to the
symmetry of human spine, there are potentially multiple substantially different
poses of the C-Arm that can lead to similar projections. The hypothesis of this
work is that the proposed approach is able to identify multiple solutions in
such ambiguous registration problems.

attention to developing predictive models that provide explanations of why an

post-hoc diagnostics after fitting a relatively complex model or embedded into
an intrinsically interpretable model. In this paper, we propose the explainable
recommendation systems based on a generalized additive model with manifest and
latent interactions (GAMMLI). This model architecture is intrinsically
interpretable, as it additively consists of the user and item main effects, the
manifest user-item interactions based on observed features, and the latent
interaction effects from residuals. Unlike conventional collaborative filtering
methods, the group effect of users and items are considered in GAMMLI. It is
beneficial for enhancing the model interpretability, and can also facilitate
the cold-start recommendation problem. A new Python package GAMMLI is developed
for efficient model training and visualized interpretation of the results. By
numerical experiments based on simulation data and real-world cases, the
proposed method is shown to have advantages in both predictive performance and
explainable recommendation.

to the combination of changing viewpoints, motion, and occlusions over time. We
observe that having the complete geometry of objects aids in their tracking,
and thus propose to jointly infer the complete geometry of objects as well as
track them, for rigidly moving objects over time. Our key insight is that
inferring the complete geometry of the objects significantly helps in tracking.
By hallucinating unseen regions of objects, we can obtain additional
correspondences between the same instance, thus providing robust tracking even
under strong change of appearance. From a sequence of RGB-D frames, we detect
objects in each frame and learn to predict their complete object geometry as
well as a dense correspondence mapping into a canonical space. This allows us
to derive 6DoF poses for the objects in each frame, along with their
correspondence between frames, providing robust object tracking across the
RGB-D sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world RGB-D data
demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on dynamic object
tracking. Furthermore, we show that our object completion significantly helps
tracking, providing an improvement of $6.5\%$ in mean MOTA.

to mis-positioning of their electrodes, which results in a symmetry breaking
and leads to extra local minima in the trapping potential \cite{pedregosa17}
disturbing the operation of the trap. In this work, we analytically describe
the RF-potential of a realistic octupole trap by including lower order terms to
the well-established equation for a perfectly symmetric octupole trap. We
describe the geometry by a combination of identified defects, characterised by
simple analytical expressions. A complete equation is proposed for a trap with
any electrode deviation relying on a combination of the simple cases where the
defects are taken individually. Our approach is validated by comparison between
analytical and numerical results for defect sizes up to 4\% of the trap radius.
As described in \cite{pedregosa18}, an independent fine-tuning of the amplitude
of the RF voltage applied on each electrode can be used to mitigate the
geometrical defects of a realistic trap. In a different way than in
\cite{pedregosa18}, the knowledge of an analytical equation for the potential
allows to design the set of RF-voltages required for this compensation, based
on the experimental measurement of the ion position in the trap, without
information concerning the exact position of each electrode, and with a small
number of iterations. The requirements, performances and limitations of this
protocol are discussed via comparison of numerical simulations and analytical
results.

reactors rely on the application of the summation method, where the individual
contributions from the different radioactive nuclides that undergo a beta decay

fission-product yields is essential to this calculation.
  We have coupled for the first time the predictions of the general fission
model GEF for the fission yields to fission-product beta-decay data in a
summation calculation of reactor antineutrino energy spectra. The first
comparisons performed between the spectra from GEF and those obtained with the
evaluated nuclear databases exhibited large discrepancies that highlighted the
exigency of the modelisation of the antineutrino spectra and showing their
usefulness in the evaluation of nuclear data. Additional constraints for the
GEF model were thus needed in order to reach the level of accuracy required.
The quality of different sources of information on the fission yields has been
investigated with GEF, and the benefit of a combined analysis is demonstrated.
The quality of fission yields emerging from different experimental techniques
has been analyzed and indications for shortcomings of mass yields for some of
the studied fissioning systems were provided.
  The combination of a careful study of the independent isotopic yields and the
adjunction of the LOHENGRIN fission-yield data as additional constraints led to
a substantially improved agreement between the antineutrino spectra computed
with GEF and with the evaluated data. The comparison of inverse beta-decay
yields computed with GEF with those measured by the Daya Bay experiment shows
the excellent level of predictiveness of the GEF model for the fundamental or
applied antineutrino physics.

linear functions of the system variables. The quasilinearity of the QSDE leads
to tractable dynamics of mean values and higher-order multi-point moments of
the system variables driven by vacuum input fields. This allows for the
closed-form computation of the quasi-characteristic function of the invariant
quantum state of the system and infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rates for a
class of cost functionals. The tractability of the moment dynamics is also used
for mean square optimal Luenberger observer design in a measurement-based
filtering problem for a quasilinear quantum plant, which leads to a Kalman-like
quantum filter.

there is a novel proposal of a quantum battery based on environmental

broken in order to ""redistribute the energy"" creating a population imbalance
between the sites. In this paper, the dynamics of the system is calculated
under the single-excitation approximation and there is no discussion about its
energetics. We do not discuss the authors' approach or numerical results on the
single-excitation framework, but we would like to point out that observing the
single-excitation populations is insufficient to obtain any information about
the system's energetics. Since an infinite probe is attached to break the
symmetries, it not only redistributes the energies as the authors suggest but
the environment also exchanges energy with the system. Moreover, the
accumulation of a single-excitation population at a specific site does not
ensure that this site has more energy that can be extracted to do useful work.
Thus, despite their single-excitation populations being correct, the
para-Benzene's energetics do not behave as a battery.

reformulation and the constraint generation algorithm proposed by Dias et al.

instances of the literature. Our numerical experiments reveal that
perturbations of the order of $\pm 5\%$ on aircraft velocities can be accounted
for without significantly impacting the objective function compared to the
deterministic case. Our tests also show that for greater levels of uncertainty,
several instances fail to admit conflict-free solutions, thus highlighting
existing risk factors in aircraft conflict resolution. We attempt to explain
this behavior by further analyzing pre- and post-optimization aircraft
trajectories. Our findings show that most infeasible instances have both a

that $x-z$ and $y-z$ are perpendicular to each other is at most $O(n^{q-2})$.
This improves on the previously best known bound due to Naslund \cite{Naslund}
and refutes a conjecture of Ge and Shangguan \cite{Ge}. A lower bound of
$n^{q/3}$ is also presented.
  It is also shown that a subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ avoiding triangles with
all right angles can have size at most $O(n^{2q-2})$. Furthermore,
asymptotically tight bounds are given for the largest possible size of a subset
$A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^n$ for which $x-y$ is not self-orthogonal for any
distinct $x,y\in A$. The exact answer is determined for $q=3$ and $n\equiv
2\pmod {3}$.
  Our methods can also be used to bound the maximum possible size of a binary
code where no two codewords have Hamming distance divisible by a fixed prime
$q$. Our lower- and upper bounds are asymptotically tight and both are sharp in
infinitely many cases.

and scientific computing. In practice, a map between two shapes is commonly
represented by two meshes with same connectivity and different embedding. The
standard approach is to input a meshing of one of the two domains plus a
function that projects its boundary to the other domain, and then solve for the
position of the interior vertices. Inspired by basic principles in mesh
generation, in this paper we present the reader a novel point of view on mesh
parameterization: we consider connectivity as an additional unknown, and assume
that our inputs are just two boundaries that enclose the domains we want to
connect. We compute the map by simultaneously growing the same mesh inside both
shapes.This change in perspective allows us to recast the parameterization
problem as a mesh generation problem, granting access to a wide set of mature
tools that are typically not used in this setting. Our practical outcome is a
provably robust yet trivial to implement algorithm that maps any planar shape
with simple topology to a homotopic domain that is weakly visible from an inner
convex kernel. Furthermore, we speculate on a possible extension of the
proposed ideas to volumetric maps, listing the major challenges that arise.
Differently from prior methods, for which we show that a volumetric extension
is not possible, our analysis leaves us reasoneable hopes that the robust
generation of volumetric maps via compatible mesh generation could be obtained
in the future.

Existing methods adopt the frame-level prediction paradigm to learn from the

large solution space. This paper attempts to explore the proposal-based
prediction paradigm for point-level annotations, which has the advantage of
more constrained solution space and consistent predictions among neighboring

to train a keypoint detector. At the location prediction stage, a simple but

then introduced to bridge the fully-supervised framework with weak supervision.
To our best of knowledge, this is the first work to leverage the

any casualties at the country- and grid-cell-level, respectively, while stage
three applies a regression model for truncated data to predict the number of

framework, we focus on the role of governmental arms imports as a processual
factor allowing governments to intensify or deter from fighting. We further
argue that a grid cell's geographic remoteness is bound to moderate the effects

region is $\sim 0.13$~mG. The same transitions in maser emission toward the
neighboring DR~21(OH) and W~75S-FR1 regions also exhibit the Zeeman splitting.
Along with the OH data, we use [C{\sc ii}] 158 $\mu$m line and hydrogen radio
recombination line data to constrain the physical conditions and the kinematics
of the region. We find the OH column density to be $\sim
3.6\times10^{16}(T_{\rm ex}/25~{\rm K})~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and that the 1665 and
1667 MHz absorption lines are originating from the gas where OH and C$^+$ are
co-existing in the PDR. Under reasonable assumptions, we find the measured
magnetic field strength for the PDR to be lower than the value expected from
the commonly discussed density--magnetic field relation while the field
strength values estimated from the maser emission are roughly consistent with
the same. Finally, we compare the magnetic field energy density with the
overall energetics of DR~21's PDR and find that, in its current evolutionary
stage, the magnetic field is not dynamically important.

We follow a typical participatory design approach including experts and

employ a real-time social signal interpretation together with a computational

the bi-attentive visual features by applying semantic attention. Finally,
self-attention is employed to automatically fetch the sentiment-rich multimodal

the third continuum emission from highly charged argon ions/molecules. This

important information about the properties of nuclear-matter equation of state
from the early part of the signal through tidal effects to the properties and
oscillation frequencies of the merger product. We investigate a direct link
between the properties of isolated neutron stars and their merger, by comparing
the frequency of the fundamental oscillation mode ($f$-mode) of neutron stars
with the gravitational-wave frequency associated with the merger of two neutron
stars. We calculate the quadrupolar ($l=2$) $f$-mode oscillation ($f_{2f}$) of
non-rotating and rotating neutron stars using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code in
the conformally-flat approximation and obtain the gravitational-wave frequency
associated with the peak amplitude ($f_{\rm max}$) of binary-neutron stars from
a set of publicly available simulations. We find that $f_{\rm max}$ and
$f_{2f}$ differ by about 1\%, on average, across forty-five equal-mass systems
with different total mass and equations of state. Assuming that the
gravitational-wave frequency is still approximately equal to twice the orbital
frequency $\Omega$ near the merger, the result indicates that the condition for
tidal resonance $|m|\Omega = f_{2f}$ is satisfied to high accuracy near the
merger, where $m=2$ is the azimuthal quantum number. Moreover, the well
established universal relation between $f_{\rm max}$ and the tidal
deformability of equal-mass binary systems can now be explained by a similar
relation between $f_{2f}$ and the tidal deformability of isolated neutron
stars, which has been demonstrated to be associated with the nearly
incompressible properties of neutron stars. Our findings suggest that it is
possible to relate the gravitational-wave signal at the merger of a binary
neutron star system directly to the fundamental oscillation modes and the mass
ratio.

result in the context of log-concave sources. For sources with two-sided

unique equilibrium. In contrast, for sources with semi-unbounded support, there
may be a finite upper bound on the number of bins in equilibrium depending on

decrease as the number of bins increases. Furthermore, for strictly log-concave

  In particular, the detailed analysis of long-exposure images enables to

learning framework, which formulates the depth completion as a two-stage

First, a coarse dense depth map is obtained by a simple CNN framework. Then, a
refined depth map is further obtained using a residual learning strategy in the
coarse-to-fine stage with a coarse depth map and color image as input.
Specially, in the coarse-to-fine stage, a channel shuffle extraction operation
is utilized to extract more representative features from the color image and
coarse depth map, and an energy based fusion operation is exploited to
effectively fuse these features obtained by channel shuffle operation, thus
leading to more accurate and refined depth maps. We achieve SoTA performance in
RMSE on KITTI benchmark. Extensive experiments on other datasets future
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art depth

limited appearance and pose variation. The most challenging scenarios are
rarely included because they are too difficult to capture due to safety
reasons, or they are very unlikely to happen. The strict safety requirements in
assisted and autonomous driving applications call for an extra high detection
accuracy also in these rare situations. Having the ability to generate people
images in arbitrary poses, with arbitrary appearances and embedded in different
background scenes with varying illumination and weather conditions, is a
crucial component for the development and testing of such applications. The
contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we describe an augmentation
method for controlled synthesis of urban scenes containing people, thus
producing rare or never-seen situations. This is achieved with a data generator
(called DummyNet) with disentangled control of the pose, the appearance, and
the target background scene. Second, the proposed generator relies on novel
network architecture and associated loss that takes into account the
segmentation of the foreground person and its composition into the background
scene. Finally, we demonstrate that the data generated by our DummyNet improve
performance of several existing person detectors across various datasets as
well as in challenging situations, such as night-time conditions, where only a
limited amount of training data is available. In the setup with only day-time
data available, we improve the night-time detector by $17\%$ log-average miss
rate over the detector trained with the day-time data only.

The process of creation of new particles is modelled by a fertility function

initial conditions correspond to a single RTP with even probability density,
the system is parity-invariant. The equations of motion can be solved in the
Laplace domain, in terms of the density of right-movers at the origin. At large
time, this density is shown to grow exponentially, at a rate that depends only
on the fertility function and fertility rate. Moreover, the total density of
RTPs (divided by the density of right-movers at the origin), reaches a
stationary state that does not depend on the initial conditions, and presents a
local minimum at the fertile site.

this work, we propose a principled meta-learning based approach to OCDA for

domain into multiple sub-target domains by image styles, extracted in an
unsupervised manner. Then, different sub-target domains are split into
independent branches, for which batch normalization parameters are learnt to
treat them independently. A meta-learner is thereafter deployed to learn to
fuse sub-target domain-specific predictions, conditioned upon the style code.
Meanwhile, we learn to online update the model by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML) algorithm, thus to further improve generalization. We validate the
benefits of our approach by extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real

objects provide important information for robots to use for exploration and
navigation. To identify and segment contextual information from complex images
obtained in these environments, data-driven methods such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) are used. However, these methods require large amounts
of human labeled data which are slow and time-consuming to obtain. Weakly
supervised methods address this limitation by generating pseudo segmentation
labels (PSLs). In this paper, we present the novel Weakly Supervised Mask Data
Distillation (WeSuperMaDD) architecture for autonomously generating PSLs using
CNNs not specifically trained for the task of context segmentation; i.e., CNNs
trained for object classification, image captioning, etc. WeSuperMaDD uniquely
generates PSLs using learned image features from sparse and limited diversity
data; common in robot navigation tasks in human-centred environments (malls,
grocery stores). Our proposed architecture uses a new mask refinement system
which automatically searches for the PSL with the fewest foreground pixels that
satisfies cost constraints. This removes the need for handcrafted heuristic
rules. Extensive experiments successfully validated the performance of
WeSuperMaDD in generating PSLs for datasets with text of various scales, fonts,
and perspectives in multiple indoor/outdoor environments. A comparison with
Naive, GrabCut, and Pyramid methods found a significant improvement in label
and segmentation quality. Moreover, a context segmentation CNN trained using
the WeSuperMaDD architecture achieved measurable improvements in accuracy
compared to one trained with Naive PSLs. Our method also had comparable
performance to existing state-of-the-art text detection and segmentation
methods on real datasets without requiring segmentation labels for training.

Specifically, we first use variational shadow quantum circuits to extract
classical features in a convolution way and then utilize a fully-connected
neural network to complete the classification task. We show that this method
could sharply reduce the number of parameters and thus better facilitate
quantum circuit training. Simultaneously, less noise will be introduced since
fewer quantum gates are employed in such shadow circuits. Moreover, we show
that the Barren Plateau issue, a significant gradient vanishing problem in
quantum machine learning, could be avoided in VSQL. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficiency of VSQL in quantum classification via numerical experiments on the
classification of quantum states and the recognition of multi-labeled
handwritten digits. In particular, our VSQL approach outperforms existing
variational quantum classifiers in the test accuracy in the binary case of
handwritten digit recognition and notably requires much fewer parameters.

the stochastic gradient flow associated with the cost function with a quadratic
penalization. Specifically, we prove a Poincar\'e inequality for a penalized

the data and of the number of nodes. As our penalization biases the weights to
be bounded, this leads us to study how well a network with bounded weights can
approximate a given function of bounded variation (BV).

less than $R$, is of order $R^{-1/9}$ with respect to the unconstrained problem
(the global optimum). The proof is novel in this topic and is inspired by
techniques from regularity theory of elliptic partial differential equations.

tuning constant to manage the modeling capability. Weibull is a flexible and
popular distribution for problems in engineering. In this study, this method is
used to estimate the parameters of Weibull distribution when non-identical
observations exist. Since the main idea is based on modeling capability of
objective function
$\rho(x;\boldsymbol{\theta})=\log_q\big[f(x;\boldsymbol{\theta})\big]$, we
observe that the finiteness of score functions cannot play a role in the robust
estimation for inliers. The properties of Weibull distribution are examined. In
the numerical experiment, the parameters of Weibull distribution are estimated
by $\log_q$ and its special form, $\log$, likelihood methods if the different
designs of contamination into underlying Weibull distribution are applied. The
optimization is performed via genetic algorithm. The modeling competence of
$\rho(x;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and insensitiveness to non-identical observations
are observed by Monte Carlo simulation. The value of $q$ can be chosen by use
of the mean squared error in simulation and the $p$-value of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test statistic used for evaluation of fitting competence. Thus, we can overcome
the problem about determining of the value of $q$ for real data sets.

such as fraud. To cut down probability of potential fraud, ID Card of users are
collected to be verified so people can verify users whenever an undesirable

for the ID Card is required. To verify ID cards, the ID Card repository will be
connected to an automated ID Card Verification API. The ID Card repository is
meant to be used both on mobile phones and desktop computers, so the concept of
progressive web application is used. To be able to upload images smoothly and
build progressive web application, the ID Card repository is built using
ReactJS and Ant Design. Server side is powered by Strapi and MongoDB. GraphQL
API is utilized to connect client side and server side. It involves queries to
fetch data. To fetch data on the client side, Apollo client is used to in
ReactJS. Git is utilized for version control system which gives contribution to
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. In this paper, we will discuss
why Strapi is best suited on server side and how Ant Design, a library to style

of the sum of the flow-time and the tardiness of tasks or jobs with unequal
release dates (occurrence date), with application to maintenance planning and
scheduling. Firstly, the policy of real-time maintenance is defined for
minimizing the cost of tardiness and critical states. The required local
optimality rule (FTR) is proved, in order to minimize the sum or the linear
combination of the tasks' flow-time and tardiness costs. This rule has served
to design a scheduling algorithm, with O(n 3) complexity when it is applied to
schedule a set of n tasks on one processor. To evaluate its performance, the
results are compared to a lower bound that is provided, in a numerical case
study. Using this algorithm in combination with the tasks urgency criterion, a
real-time algorithm is developed to schedule the tasks on q parallel
processors. This latter algorithm is finally applied to schedule and assign
preventive maintenance tasks to processors in the case of a distributed system.
Its efficiency enables, as shown in the numerical example, to minimize the cost
of preventive maintenance tasks, expressed as the sum of the tasks tardiness
and flow-time. This corresponds to costs of critical states and of tardiness of
preventive maintenance.

convergence can always be achieved with tight convergence thresholds, which
requires just a modest number of iterations. Our convergence benchmark study
and our illustrative applications focus on open-shell molecules, also
antiferromagnetically coupled systems, for which it is notoriously complicated
to converge the Roothaan-Hall self-consistent field (SCF) equations. We compare
the number of TRAH iterations to reach convergence with those of Pulay's and
Kolmar's (K) variant of the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS)
method and also analyze the obtained SCF solutions. Often TRAH-SCF finds a
symmetry-broken solution with a lower energy than DIIS and KDIIS. For
unrestricted calculations, this is accompanied by a larger spin contamination,
i.e. larger deviation from the desired spin-restricted <S^2> expectation value.
However, there are also rare cases in which DIIS finds a solution with a lower
energy than KDIIS and TRAH. In rare cases, both TRAH-SCF and KDIIS may also
converge to an excited-state determinant solution. For those calculations with
negative-gap TRAH solutions, standard DIIS always diverges. If comparable, TRAH
usually needs more iterations to converge than DIIS and KDIIS because for every
new set of orbitals the level-shifted Newton-Raphson equations are solved
approximately and iteratively by means of an eigenvalue problem. Nevertheless,
the total runtime of TRAH-SCF is still competitive with the DIIS-based
approaches even if extended basis sets are employed, which is illustrated for a
large hemocyanin model complex.

are attributed to the inverse two-plasmon decay of the counterpropagating
monochromatic plasma waves which are excited by the energetic electrons and the
positron beam accelerated by the laser. Particle-in-cell simulations show the

as $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the plasma density. In the self-consistent scenario of
pair production by an ultraintense laser striking a solid target,
particle-in-cell simulations, which account for quantum electrodynamic effects
(photon emission and pair production), show that dense (greater than the
relativistically-corrected critical density) and hot pair plasmas can be
created. The harmonic spectrum shows weak low order harmonics, indicating a
high laser absorption due to quantum electrodynamic effects. The characteristic
signals at harmonics of the plasma frequency are absent, because broadband
plasma waves are excited due to the high plasma inhomogeneity introduced by the

graphics. Most existing matting methods leverage a user-supplied trimap as an
auxiliary input to produce good alpha matte. However, obtaining high-quality
trimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods.
Recently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality
is still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without
the trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which
is the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective
procedure and depends on the user's intention. To this end, this paper proposes
an improved deep image matting framework which is trimap-free and only needs
several user click interactions to eliminate the ambiguity. Moreover, we
introduce a new uncertainty estimation module that can predict which parts need
polishing and a following local refinement module. Based on the computation
budget, users can choose how many local parts to improve with the uncertainty
guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method performs
better than existing trimap-free methods and comparably to state-of-the-art
trimap-based methods with minimal user effort.

considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty
estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another
popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our
central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like
models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first
uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the
second relies on a finite number of independent models.
  To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of
randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a
fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to
change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the
overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal
configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to
implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the

scales of the order of $100 \ \text{Mpc}$, at which our universe begins to
appear homogeneous and isotropic. We find that the order of magnitude of the
""emerged"" cosmological constant agrees with astrophysical observations and is
related in a natural way to baryonic matter density. Thus, there is no
coincidence problem in our framework.

large number of devices to collaboratively learn a model without sharing their
raw data. Despite its practical efficiency and effectiveness, the iterative
on-device learning process incurs a considerable cost in terms of learning time
and energy consumption, which depends crucially on the number of selected
clients and the number of local iterations in each training round. In this
paper, we analyze how to design adaptive FL that optimally chooses these
essential control variables to minimize the total cost while ensuring
convergence. Theoretically, we analytically establish the relationship between
the total cost and the control variables with the convergence upper bound. To
efficiently solve the cost minimization problem, we develop a low-cost
sampling-based algorithm to learn the convergence related unknown parameters.
We derive important solution properties that effectively identify the design
principles for different metric preferences. Practically, we evaluate our
theoretical results both in a simulated environment and on a hardware
prototype. Experimental evidence verifies our derived properties and
demonstrates that our proposed solution achieves near-optimal performance for
various datasets, different machine learning models, and heterogeneous system
settings.

strategy is coupled. The recently proposed KIF is a kind of inviscid flux,
whose microscopic mechanism makes it good at solving shock waves, with
advantages against the shock instability phenomenon. When developing the
implicit KIF, a phenomenon is noticed that the kinetic flux vector splitting
(KFVS) part in boundary layers not only reduces the accuracy, but seriously
reduces the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number as well. As a result, in this
paper, a new weight is proposed about how to combine the KFVS method well with
the totally thermalized transport (TTT) method. Besides admitting the using of
larger CFL numbers, this new weight brings about more accurate numerical
results like pressure, friction coefficient and heat flux when solving shock
waves, boundary layers and complex supersonic/hypersonic flows. In order to
examine the validity, accuracy and efficiency of the present method, six
numerical test cases, covering the whole speed regime, are conducted, including
the hypersonic viscous flow past a cylinder, the hypersonic double-cone flow,
the hypersonic double-ellipsoid flow, the laminar shock boundary layer
interaction, the supersonic flow around a ramp segment and the lid-driven
cavity flow. The advantages of this scheme and corresponding mechanisms are to
be discussed in detail.

bundling, and recursive oversight. We argue that these barriers are less

`privacy-enhancing technologies' (PETs), such as secure computation and
federated learning, may substantially reduce lingering use-misuse trade-offs in

brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic, yet compact enough to
produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been
detected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained
elusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB
20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif
and LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its
activity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind
interaction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower
frequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections
establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For
bursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at
1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB
rate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at
90% confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds
cause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean
environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.

that black holes are characterized by the mass-to-circumference relation $4\pi

by the opposite inequality $4\pi {\cal M}/{\cal C}<1$ (here ${\cal C}$ is the
circumference of the smallest ring that can engulf the self-gravitating compact
object in all azimuthal directions). It has recently been proved that a
necessary condition for the validity of this conjecture in horizonless
spacetimes of spatially regular charged compact objects is that the mass ${\cal
M}$ be interpreted as the mass contained within the engulfing sphere (and not
as the asymptotically measured total ADM mass). In the present paper we raise
the following physically intriguing question: Is it possible to formulate a
unified version of the hoop conjecture which is valid for both black holes and
horizonless compact objects? In order to address this important question, we
analyze the behavior of the mass-to-circumference ratio of Kerr-Newman black
holes. We explicitly prove that if the mass ${\cal M}$ in the hoop relation is
interpreted as the quasilocal Einstein-Landau-Lifshitz-Papapetrou and Weinberg
mass contained within the black-hole horizon, then these charged and spinning
black holes are characterized by the sub-critical mass-to-circumference ratio

densities, price volatility and climate change. Quantitative models play an
important role in understanding food systems' expected responses to shocks and
stresses. Here, we present a stylised mathematical model of a national-level
food system that incorporates domestic supply of a food commodity,
international trade, consumer demand, and food commodity price. We derive a
critical compound parameter signalling when domestic supply will become
unsustainable and the food system entirely dependent on imports, which results
in higher commodity prices, lower consumer demand and lower inventory levels.
Using Bayesian estimation, we apply the dynamic food systems model to infer the
sustainability of the UK pork industry. We find that the UK pork industry is
currently sustainable but because the industry is dependent on imports to meet
demand, a decrease in self-sufficiency below 50% (current levels are 60-65%)
would lead it close to the critical boundary signalling its collapse. Our model
provides a theoretical foundation for future work to determine more complex
causal drivers of food system vulnerability.

conditions on the penalty term. Next, allowing both $p$ and $k$ to diverge, we
derive limiting distributions of the spiked sample eigenvalues using random

been assumed in the existing literature. Based on the above derived results, we
formulate a generalized estimation criterion and show that it can consistently
estimate $k$, while $k$ can be fixed or grow at an order of $k=o(n^{1/3})$. We

proximity (~150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, have revealed
many clues about its nature -- including a 16.3-day periodicity in its
activity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110-188
MHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are
seen down to the lowest-observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their
spectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude
stronger constraint on the optical depth due to free-free absorption in the
source's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly
flat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at
300-1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths
(~40-160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due
to scattering. We find ~2-3 rad/m^2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure
that may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the
LOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly
detected bursts from the uGMRT (200-450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400-800 MHz).
Simultaneous observations show 5 CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected
by LOFAR. We find that the burst activity is systematically delayed towards
lower frequencies by ~3 days from 600 MHz to 150 MHz. We discuss these results
in the context of a model in which FRB 20180916B is an interacting binary
system featuring a neutron star and high-mass stellar companion.

luminosity distance $\lesssim 3~\mathrm{Gpc}$, which is the aLIGO/Virgo
observational horizon limit, the average magnification keeps as unity, namely
unbiased estimation, with the relative distance uncertainty
$\sigma(\hat{d})/\hat{d}\simeq0.5\%\sim1\%$. Beyond this observational horizon,
the estimation bias can not be ignored, and with the scatters
$\sigma(\hat{d})/\hat{d} = 1\%\sim 15\%$. Furthermore, we forecast these
numbers for Einstein Telescope. We find that the average magnification keeps
closely as unity for the observed luminosity distance $\lesssim
90~\mathrm{Gpc}$. The luminosity distance estimation error due to lensing for
Einstein Telescope is about $\sigma(\hat{d})/\hat{d} \simeq 10\%$ for the

this sizable error is not due to the selection effect. It purely comes from the

agents and the games they play evolve strategically over time. We focus on
arguably the most archetypal game-theoretic setting -- zero-sum games (as well
as network generalizations) -- and the most studied evolutionary learning
dynamic -- replicator, the continuous-time analogue of multiplicative weights.
Populations of agents compete against each other in a zero-sum competition that
itself evolves adversarially to the current population mixture. Remarkably,
despite the chaotic coevolution of agents and games, we prove that the system
exhibits a number of regularities. First, the system has conservation laws of
an information-theoretic flavor that couple the behavior of all agents and
games. Secondly, the system is Poincar\'{e} recurrent, with effectively all
possible initializations of agents and games lying on recurrent orbits that
come arbitrarily close to their initial conditions infinitely often. Thirdly,
the time-average agent behavior and utility converge to the Nash equilibrium

as a multi-source domain adaptation and label unification problem, and proposes
a novel method for it. Our method consists of a partially-supervised adaptation
stage and a fully-supervised adaptation stage. In the former, partial knowledge
is transferred from multiple source domains to the target domain and fused
therein. Negative transfer between unmatching label spaces is mitigated via
three new modules: domain attention, uncertainty maximization and
attention-guided adversarial alignment. In the latter, knowledge is transferred
in the unified label space after a label completion process with pseudo-labels.
Extensive experiments on three different tasks - image classification, 2D
semantic image segmentation, and joint 2D-3D semantic segmentation - show that
our method outperforms all competing methods significantly.

optical excited states in optoelectronic materials, as it allows for a direct
visualization of the movement of energy carriers in space and time. Important
information on the influence of trap-states can be obtained using this
technique, typically observed as a slow-down of the energy transport as
carriers are trapped at defect sites. To date, however, studies of the
trap-state dynamics have been mostly limited to phenomenological descriptions
of the early time-dynamics. In this report, we show how long-acquisition-time
transient photoluminescence microscopy can be used to provide a detailed map of
the trap-state landscape in 2D perovskites, in particular when used in
combination with transient spectroscopy. We reveal anomalous spatial dynamics
of excitons in 2D perovskites, which cannot be explained with existing models
for trap limited exciton transport that only account for a single trap type.
Instead, using a continuous diffusion model and performing Brownian dynamics
simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by accounting for a
distinct distribution of traps in this material. Our results highlight the
value of transient microscopy as a complementary tool to more common transient
spectroscopy techniques in the characterization of the excited state dynamics
in semiconductors.

processes, such as artifacts or object lifecycles, form a business process
through their interactions. Coordination processes may be used to coordinate
these interactions, guiding the overall business process towards a meaningful
goal. A coordination process model specifies coordination constraints between
the interdependent processes in terms of semantic relationships. At run-time,
these coordination constraints must be enforced by a coordination process
instance. As the coordination of multiple interdependent processes is a complex
endeavor, several challenges need to be fulfilled to achieve optimal process
coordination. For example, processes must be allowed to run asynchronously and
concurrently, taking their complex relations into account. This paper
contributes the operational semantics of coordination processes, which enforces
the coordination constraints at run-time. Coordination processes form complex
structures to adequately represent processes and their relations, specifically
supporting many-to-many relationships. Based on these complex structures,
markings and process rules allow for the flexible enactment of the
interdependent processes while fulfilling all challenges. Coordination
processes represent a sophisticated solution to the complex problem of
coordinating interdependent, concurrently running processes.

method relies on ad hoc spatially resolved models for disease transmissionvia
virus-laden respiratory droplets, which are fit to existing exposure studies

pedestrian trajectories and orientations that we acquired during the pandemic.
This allows us to rank the investigated scenarios by the infection risks that
they present; importantly, the obtained hierarchy of risks is conserved across
all our transmission models (except the most pessimistic ones): Street
caf{\'e}s present the largest average rate of new infections caused by an
attendant, followed by busy outdoor markets, and then metro and train stations,
whereas the risks incurred while walking on fairly busy streets (average
density around 0.1 person/m${}^2$) are comparatively quite low. While none of
our ad hoc models can claim accuracy, their converging predictions lend
credence to these findings.} In scenarios with a moving crowd, we find that
density is the main factor influencing the estimated infection rate. Finally,
our study explores the efficiency of street and venue redesigns in mitigating
the viral spread: While the benefits of enforcing one-way foot traffic in

illegal extraction included rebound effect of fishing effort displacement by
MAs, level of enforcement, distance to surveillance authorities, wave exposure
and land-based access to the MA, and alternative economic activities in the

proportions indicating a poor state, and by the relative median size of limpets
fished within the MAs in comparison with neighbouring OA areas, with larger
relative sizes in the MA indicating a good state. A Bayesian-Belief Network

mechanism of contrastive loss has been less studied. In this paper, we
concentrate on the understanding of the behaviours of unsupervised contrastive
loss. We will show that the contrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function,
and the temperature {\tau} controls the strength of penalties on hard negative
samples. The previous study has shown that uniformity is a key property of
contrastive learning. We build relations between the uniformity and the
temperature {\tau} . We will show that uniformity helps the contrastive
learning to learn separable features, however excessive pursuit to the
uniformity makes the contrastive loss not tolerant to semantically similar
samples, which may break the underlying semantic structure and be harmful to
the formation of features useful for downstream tasks. This is caused by the
inherent defect of the instance discrimination objective. Specifically,
instance discrimination objective tries to push all different instances apart,
ignoring the underlying relations between samples. Pushing semantically
consistent samples apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior
informative to general downstream tasks. A well-designed contrastive loss
should have some extents of tolerance to the closeness of semantically similar
samples. Therefore, we find that the contrastive loss meets a
uniformity-tolerance dilemma, and a good choice of temperature can compromise
these two properties properly to both learn separable features and tolerant to
semantically similar samples, improving the feature qualities and the
downstream performances.

studies on energy consumption characterization aiming to improve smartphone

smartphones' components can be adapted to promote the best user experience with

To develop the energy consumption models, we established a method to identify
the components with the most influence in the smartphone's energy consumption
and identify the states of each influential device. Besides that, we
established a method to prove the robustness of the models constructed using
inaccurate hardware and a strategy to assess the accuracy of the model built.
After training and testing each strategy to model the energy consumption based
on the user's usage and perform the Nemenyi test, we demonstrated that it is
possible to get a Mean Absolute Error of 158.57mW when the smartphone's average
power is 1970.1mW. Some studies show that the leading smartphone's workload is
the user. Based on this fact, we developed an automatic model building
methodology that is capable of analyzing the user's usage data and build smart

user's usage pattern. With the automatic model building methodology, we can
adopt strategies to minimize the usage of components that drain the battery.

visualize both colloidal particles and trapped immiscible fluid within a
transparent, three-dimensional (3D) porous medium. We find that as non-surface
active particles deposit on the solid matrix, increasing amounts of trapped
fluid become mobilized. We unravel the underlying physics by analyzing the
extent of deposition, as well as the geometry of trapped fluid droplets, at the
pore scale: deposition increases the viscous stresses on trapped droplets,
overcoming the influence of capillarity that keeps them trapped. Given an
initial distribution of trapped fluid, this analysis enables us to predict the
extent of fluid mobilized through colloidal deposition. Taken together, our
work reveals a new way by which colloids can be harnessed to mobilize trapped
fluid from a porous medium.

  combination of geometrical and spectral information -- ThermoHead","10 pages, 16 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Thermography allows for the remote measurement of surface temperatures and is
widely used for the identification of energy losses, damage detection or
quality control. However, thermal imaging is strongly material dependent and
therefore measured and real temperatures can differ significantly. The emission
coefficient resides between 0 and 1 and changes mainly with the electrical
conductivity of the surface. While non-conductive surfaces (stone, wood, glass
etc.) have a high emissivity of ca. 0.9, metallic surfaces reside around 0.2.
If e.g. an object with a temperature of 100$^\circ$C and E=0.9 gets recorded
via thermography, the recording shows a temperature of 90$^\circ$C. The same
conditions for a metallic surface on the other hand can result in a measured
temperature of only 20$^\circ$C, so room temperature.
  This article introduces a novel method how to approximate the electrical
conductivity of surfaces by the combination of geometric and spectral
information. A new thermographic panorama system called ""ThermoHead"" is used to
generate high-resolution and geometrically calibrated thermal images of the
surrounding. For the geometric information, a 3D point cloud from the very same
point of view will be recorded with an arbitrary commercial available
terrestrial 3D laser scanner. Since both data sets have been recorded
successively from the exact same point of view, the congruent combination
allows to transfer all geometric informations from the terrestrial 3D laser
scanner to the thermographic measurement. The radiometric intensity depends on
e.g. the angle of incidence of the thermographic measurement, which is now
known and can be used to narrow down the electrical conductivity of the
measured object.

experience from the data that provide for us the reality through the feelings.
Generally speaking, it is possible to see the analogy of knowledge elaboration
between humankind's way and the artificial system's way. Digital data are the
""feelings"" of an artificial system, and it needs to invent a method of
extraction of knowledge from the Universe of data.
  The cognitive computing paradigm implies that a system should be able to
extract the knowledge from raw data without any human-made algorithm. The first
step of the paradigm is analysis of raw data streams through the discovery of
repeatable patterns of data. The knowledge of relationships among the patterns
provides a way to see the structures and to generalize the concepts with the
goal to synthesize new statements. The cognitive computing paradigm is capable
of mimicking the human's ability to generalize the notions. It is possible to
say that the generalization step provides the basis for discovering the
abstract notions, revealing the abstract relations of patterns and general
rules of structure synthesis.
  If anyone continues the process of structure generalization, then it is
possible to build the multi-level hierarchy of abstract notions. Moreover,
discovering the generalized classes of notions is the first step towards a
paradigm of artificial analytical thinking. The most critical possible
responsibility of cognitive computing could be the classification of data and
recognition of input data stream's states. The synthesis of new statements
creates the foundation for the foreseeing the possible data states and
elaboration of knowledge about new data classes by employing synthesis and
checking the hypothesis.

of subharmonic functions, or a $\delta$-subharmonic function, and the upper

of a numerical solution with curvilinear elements. However, those points are
likely to be located slightly outside the domain, even when the vertices of the
curvilinear elements lie within the curved domain. This misallocation of grid
points generates a mesh error, called geometric approximation error. This error
is smaller than the discretization error but large enough to significantly
degrade a long-time integration. Moreover, this mesh error is considered to be
the leading cause of conservation error. Two novel schemes are proposed to
improve conservation error and/or discretization error for long-time
integration caused by geometric approximation error: The first scheme retrieves
the original divergence of the original domain; the second scheme reconstructs
the original path of differentiation, called connection, thus retrieving the
original connection. The increased accuracies of the proposed schemes are
demonstrated by the conservation error for various partial differential
equations with moving frames on the sphere.

dichalcogenides with spin-orbit coupling can generate valley magnetization when
the inversion symmetry is broken, for example, by an electric field, regardless
of time-reversal symmetry. A nontrivial Berry curvature can also lead to
anomalous transport responses, such as the anomalous Hall effect and the
anomalous Nernst effect. Applied to a bilayer WSe$_2$, an electric field can
tune the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, which has important
consequences for the orbital magnetization and the anomalous Nernst responses.
The orbital magnetization and its two contributions, one due to the magnetic
moment and one due to the Berry curvature, are calculated and interpreted in
terms of opposite circulating currents of the bands in the two layers. The
valley anomalous Nernst coefficient and spin Nernst coefficient are also
calculated. We find that a finite electric field leads to peaks and dips in the
Nernst responses that have the signs of the Berry curvatures of the bands and
are proportional to their magnitudes; it also enhances the valley Nernst
responses. These experimentally verifiable findings may be promising for
