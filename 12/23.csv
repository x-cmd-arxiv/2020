  photometric classification of supernovae","MNRAS accepted version Aug 2021","MNRAS 508, 1-18 (2021)","10.1093/mnras/stab2343",,"astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In preparation for photometric classification of transients from the Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) we run tests with different training data sets.
Using estimates of the depth to which the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic
Telescope (4MOST) Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) can classify
transients, we simulate a magnitude-limited sample reaching $r_{\textrm{AB}}
\approx$ 22.5 mag. We run our simulations with the software snmachine, a
photometric classification pipeline using machine learning. The
machine-learning algorithms struggle to classify supernovae when the training
sample is magnitude-limited, in contrast to representative training samples.
Classification performance noticeably improves when we combine the
magnitude-limited training sample with a simulated realistic sample of faint,
high-redshift supernovae observed from larger spectroscopic facilities; the
algorithms' range of average area under ROC curve (AUC) scores over 10 runs
increases from 0.547-0.628 to 0.946-0.969 and purity of the classified sample
reaches 95 per cent in all runs for 2 of the 4 algorithms. By creating new,
artificial light curves using the augmentation software avocado, we achieve a
purity in our classified sample of 95 per cent in all 10 runs performed for all
machine-learning algorithms considered. We also reach a highest average AUC
score of 0.986 with the artificial neural network algorithm. Having `true'
faint supernovae to complement our magnitude-limited sample is a crucial
requirement in optimisation of a 4MOST spectroscopic sample. However, our
results are a proof of concept that augmentation is also necessary to achieve
the best classification results.

hypergraphs give rise to database schemas with desirable structural and
algorithmic properties. In a by-now classical paper, Beeri, Fagin, Maier, and
Yannakakis established several different equivalent characterizations of
acyclicity; in particular, they showed that the sets of attributes of a schema
form an acyclic hypergraph if and only if the local-to-global consistency
property for relations over that schema holds, which means that every
collection of pairwise consistent relations over the schema is globally
consistent. Even though real-life databases consist of bags (multisets), there
has not been a study of the interplay between local consistency and global
consistency for bags. We embark on such a study here and we first show that the
sets of attributes of a schema form an acyclic hypergraph if and only if the
local-to global consistency property for bags over that schema holds. After
this, we explore algorithmic aspects of global consistency for bags by
analyzing the computational complexity of the global consistency problem for
bags: given a collection of bags, are these bags globally consistent? We show
that this problem is in NP, even when the schema is part of the input. We then
establish the following dichotomy theorem for fixed schemas: if the schema is
acyclic, then the global consistency problem for bags is solvable in polynomial
time, while if the schema is cyclic, then the global consistency problem for
bags is NP-complete. The latter result contrasts sharply with the state of
affairs for relations, where, for each fixed schema, the global consistency
problem for relations is solvable in polynomial time.

exchange, filtering, as well as secretion processes with their large surface to
volume ratio. In this review, we focus on the developmental mechanisms that
control the early stages of lung branching morphogenesis. Lung branching
morphogenesis involves the stereotypic, recurrent definition of new branch
points, subsequent epithelial budding, and lung tube elongation. We discuss
current models and experimental evidence for each of these steps. Finally, we
discuss the role of the mesenchyme in determining the organ-specific shape.

for unknown neutron stars in binary systems requires specialized algorithms to

continuous gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars in binary systems in
early data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
detectors using the semicoherent, GPU-accelerated, BinarySkyHough pipeline. The
search analyzes the most sensitive frequency band of the LIGO detectors, 50 -
300 Hz. Binary orbital parameters are split into four regions, comprising
orbital periods of 3 - 45 days and projected semimajor axes of 2 - 40
light-seconds. No detections are reported. We estimate the sensitivity of the
search using simulated continuous wave signals, achieving the most sensitive
results to date across the analyzed parameter space.

of nonlocal particle systems. To be precise, we consider the best approximation
with respect to the 2-Wasserstein metric of a given absolutely continuous
probability measure $f \mathrm{d}x$ by a discrete probability measure $\sum_i
m_i \delta_{z_i}$, subject to a constraint on the particle sizes $m_i$. The
locations $z_i$ of the particles, their sizes $m_i$, and the number of
particles are all unknowns of the problem. We study a one-parameter family of
constraints. This is an example of an optimal location problem (or an optimal
sampling or quantization problem) and it has applications in economics, signal
compression, and numerical integration. We establish the asymptotic minimum
value of the (rescaled) approximation error as the number of particles goes to
infinity. In particular, we show that for the constrained best approximation of
the Lebesgue measure by a discrete measure, the discrete measure whose support
is a triangular lattice is asymptotically optimal. In addition, we prove an
analogous result for a problem where the constraint is replaced by a
penalization. These results can also be viewed as the asymptotic optimality of
the hexagonal tiling for an optimal partitioning problem. They generalise the
crystallization result of Bourne, Peletier and Theil (Communications in
Mathematical Physics, 2014) from a single particle system to a class of
particle systems, and prove a case of a conjecture by Bouchitt\'{e}, Jimenez
and Mahadevan (Journal de Math\'ematiques Pures et Appliqu\'ees, 2011).
Finally, we prove a crystallization result which states that optimal
configurations with energy close to that of a triangular lattice are
geometrically close to a triangular lattice.

  OptimizationProblems in Robust Causal Inference",,,,,"math.OC cs.AI cs.DM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying cause-effect relations among variables is a key step in the
decision-making process. While causal inference requires randomized
experiments, researchers and policymakers are increasingly using observational
studies to test causal hypotheses due to the wide availability of observational
data and the infeasibility of experiments. The matching method is the most used
technique to make causal inference from observational data. However, the pair
assignment process in one-to-one matching creates uncertainty in the inference
because of different choices made by the experimenter. Recently, discrete
optimization models are proposed to tackle such uncertainty. Although a robust
inference is possible with discrete optimization models, they produce nonlinear
problems and lack scalability. In this work, we propose greedy algorithms to
solve the robust causal inference test instances from observational data with
continuous outcomes. We propose a unique framework to reformulate the nonlinear
binary optimization problems as feasibility problems. By leveraging the
structure of the feasibility formulation, we develop greedy schemes that are
efficient in solving robust test problems. In many cases, the proposed
algorithms achieve global optimal solutions. We perform experiments on three
real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
and compare our result with the state-of-the-art solver. Our experiments show
that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the exact method in terms
of computation time while achieving the same conclusion for causal tests. Both
numerical experiments and complexity analysis demonstrate that the proposed
algorithms ensure the scalability required for harnessing the power of big data
in the decision-making process.

electronic transport properties of nanomaterials. Nanostructures selected in
this work are armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs). According to this method,
the nanostructure is modeled as a frame, and the beam element is applied for
illustrating the covalent interatomic interactions in bonds. In our
calculations, the terms of torsional, stretching, and bending energies are
considered. The selected pristine nanoribbon is a metal, and the purpose of
this study is to find the effects of mechanical loading, the vacancy defects
and their positions on the electrical conductance of the structure. We observe
that the presence of vacancy defects in the structure leads to the opening of
an energy gap, which changes the phase of the nanostructure from metal to the
semiconductor. We find that with increasing the number of point defects, the
energy gap size of the strained system grows. Besides, increasing the magnitude
of the local force reduces the conductance, and the energy gap of the system.
By changing parameters such as the number of point defects and magnitude local
forces, the transport gap of the system can be controlled. The results of this
research may be useful in the design of nanoelectromechanical systems.

the statistics curriculum. In the intervening decade the statistics education
community has acknowledged that computational skills are as important to
statistics and data science practice as mathematics. There remains a notable
gap, however, between our intentions and our actions. In this special issue of
the *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education* we have assembled a
collection of papers that (1) suggest creative structures to integrate
computing, (2) describe novel data science skills and habits, and (3) propose
ways to teach computational thinking. We believe that it is critical for the
community to redouble our efforts to embrace sophisticated computing in the
statistics and data science curriculum. We hope that these papers provide
useful guidance for the community to move these efforts forward.

  Vessels in Complex Environments","Submitted to the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  An enabling technology for future sea transports is safe and energy-efficient
autonomous maritime navigation in narrow environments with other marine vessels
present. This requires that the algorithm controlling the ship is able to
account for the vessel's dynamics, and obeys the rules specified in the
international regulations for preventing collision at sea (COLREGs). To account
for these properties, this work proposes a two-step optimization-based and
COLREGs-compliant motion planner tailored for large vessels. In the first step,
a lattice-based motion planner is used to compute a suboptimal trajectory based
on a library of precomputed motion primitives. To comply with the rules
specified in COLREGs, the lattice-based planner is augmented with discrete
states that represent what type of COLREGs situations that are active with
respect to other nearby vessels. The trajectory computed by the lattice-based
planner is then used as warm-start for the second receding-horizon step based
on direct optimal control techniques. The aim of the second step is to solve
the problem to local optimality with the discrete COLREGs states remained
fixed. The applicability of the proposed motion planner is demonstrated in
simulations, where it computes energy-efficient and COLREGs-compliant
trajectories. The results also show that the motion planner is able to prevent
complex collision situations from occurring.

transformation over the last couple of decades as a result of the ability to
nanostructure and synthesize myriads of materials and their alloys. The ZT
figure of merit, which quantifies the performance of a thermoelectric material
has more than doubled after decades of inactivity, reaching values larger than
two, consistently across materials and temperatures. Central to this ZT
improvement is the drastic reduction in the material thermal conductivity due
to the scattering of phonons on the numerous interfaces, boundaries,
dislocations, point defects, phases, etc., which are purposely included. In
these new generation of nanostructured materials, phonon scattering centers of
different sizes and geometrical configurations (atomic, nano- and macro-scale)
are formed, which are able to scatter phonons of mean-free-paths across the
spectrum. Beyond thermal conductivity reductions, ideas are beginning to emerge
on how to use similar hierarchical nanostructuring to achieve power factor
improvements. Ways that relax the adverse interdependence of the electrical
conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are targeted, which allows power factor
improvements. For this, elegant designs are required, that utilize for instance
non-uniformities in the underlying nanostructured geometry, non-uniformities in
the dopant distribution, or potential barriers that form at boundaries between
materials. A few recent reports, both theoretical and experimental, indicate
that extremely high power factor values can be achieved, even for the same
geometries that also provide ultra-low thermal conductivities. Despite the
experimental complications that can arise in having the required control in
nanostructure realization, in this colloquium, we aim to demonstrate, mostly
theoretically, that it is a very promising path worth exploring.

and recalibrate these universal relations using a large set of almost 2 million

so, we extend universal relations to a larger region of the EOS parameter

that the new fits yield a NS radius that is smaller by about 500 meters. This

All three stars are A-subtype W UMa stars of spectral type F. The light curve
solutions show that TYC 3700-1384-1 has a moderately low mass ratio of q =
0.182 +/- 0.001 and a degree of overcontact of f = 49%. For V1179 Her a mass
ratio q = 0.153 +/- 0.001 and a degree of overcontact of f = 48% is derived.
The solution for V1511 Her is inconclusive, however the mass ratio is expected
to be between 0.13 < q < 0.15. The evolutionary status is compared with
zero-age main sequence stars taking into account energy transfer from the
primary to the secondary component. The primary component of TYC 3700-1384-1
fits well in the main-sequence, while V1179 Her is more evolved. The period
study reveals for all three stars a continuously increasing period at a rate of
dP/dt = 6.1x10-7 d/yr, dP/dt = 5.0x10-7 d/yr and dP/dt = 9.6x10-7 d/yr for TYC

the modification of the batch size, and a change of optimization algorithm

optimization benchmarks. This algorithm speeds up the optimization time by a
factor of 23 on the largest model compared to existing algorithms used in
practice. The integration of the new algorithms in Discrete Choice Models
estimation software will significantly reduce the time required for model
estimation and therefore enable researchers and practitioners to explore new

been object of intensive research during the last years due to their potential
for photodetection. Photoresponse in these devices is typically caused by a
combination of two physical mechanisms: photoconductive effect (PCE) and
photogating effect (PGE). In earlier literature for monolayer (1L) MoS2
phototransistors PGE is generally attributed to charge trapping by polar
molecules adsorbed to the semiconductor channel, giving rise to a very slow
photoresponse. Thus, the photoresponse of 1L-MoS2 phototransistors at
high-frequency light modulation is assigned to PCE alone. Here we investigate
the photoresponse of a fully h-BN encapsulated monolayer (1L) MoS2
phototransistor. In contrast with previous understanding, we identify a rapidly
responding PGE mechanism that becomes the dominant contribution to
photoresponse under high-frequency light modulation. Using a Hornbeck-Haynes
model for the photocarrier dynamics, we fit the illumination power dependence
of this PGE and estimate the energy level of the involved traps. The resulting
energies are compatible with shallow traps in MoS2 caused by the presence of
sulfur vacancies.

collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then
characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of
features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the
firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local
outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn
""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise
early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases

using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the
results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early

  (Extended Abstract)","Extended abstract of the full paper to appear in ASPLOS 2021",,,,"cs.AR cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  3D NAND flash memory with advanced multi-level cell techniques provides high
storage density, but suffers from significant performance degradation due to a
large number of read-retry operations. Although the read-retry mechanism is
essential to ensuring the reliability of modern NAND flash memory, it can
significantly increase the read latency of an SSD by introducing multiple retry
steps that read the target page again with adjusted read-reference voltage
values. Through a detailed analysis of the read mechanism and rigorous
characterization of 160 real 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find new
opportunities to reduce the read-retry latency by exploiting two advanced
features widely adopted in modern NAND flash-based SSDs: 1) the CACHE READ
command and 2) strong ECC engine. First, we can reduce the read-retry latency
using the advanced CACHE READ command that allows a NAND flash chip to perform
consecutive reads in a pipelined manner. Second, there exists a large
ECC-capability margin in the final retry step that can be used for reducing the
chip-level read latency. Based on our new findings, we develop two new
techniques that effectively reduce the read-retry latency: 1) Pipelined
Read-Retry (PR$^2$) and 2) Adaptive Read-Retry (AR$^2$). PR$^2$ reduces the
latency of a read-retry operation by pipelining consecutive retry steps using
the CACHE READ command. AR$^2$ shortens the latency of each retry step by
dynamically reducing the chip-level read latency depending on the current
operating conditions that determine the ECC-capability margin. Our evaluation
using twelve real-world workloads shows that our proposal improves SSD response
time by up to 31.5% (17% on average) over a state-of-the-art baseline with only
small changes to the SSD controller.

much attention due to the wide range of satellite image applications. As the
clouds thicken, the process of removing the clouds becomes more challenging. In
such cases, using auxiliary images such as near-infrared or synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) for reconstructing is common. In this study, we attempt to solve
the problem using two generative adversarial networks (GANs). The first
translates SAR images into optical images, and the second removes clouds using
the translated images of prior GAN. Also, we propose dilated residual inception
blocks (DRIBs) instead of vanilla U-net in the generator networks and use
structural similarity index measure (SSIM) in addition to the L1 Loss function.
Reducing the number of downsamplings and expanding receptive fields by dilated
convolutions increase the quality of output images. We used the SEN1-2 dataset
to train and test both GANs, and we made cloudy images by adding synthetic
clouds to optical images. The restored images are evaluated with PSNR and SSIM.

that with the increase of dimension, the maximally violating states (MVS) show
a greater enhancement in the area of nonlocal region in comparison to the
maximally entangled states (MES) and the scaling of the increment, in this
case, grows faster than visibility. Moreover, we examine the robustness in the
sequential violation of CGLMP inequality using weak measurements, and find that
even for higher dimensions, two observers showing a simultaneous violation of
the CGLMP inequality as obtained for two-qubit states persists. We notice that
the complementarity between information gain and disturbance by measurements is
manifested by the decrease of the visibility in the first round and the
increase of the same in the second round with dimensions. Furthermore, the
amount of white noise that can be added to an MES so that it gives two rounds
of the violation, decreases with the dimension, while the same does not
appreciably change for the MVS.

with uncertainties which are generally within 0.1 km/s or ~25% smaller than in

compared to start-of-the-art compact convolutional neural network (CNN) models,
BNNs tend to produce a much lower accuracy on realistic datasets such as
ImageNet. In addition, the input layer of BNNs has gradually become a major
compute bottleneck, because it is conventionally excluded from binarization to
avoid a large accuracy loss. This work proposes FracBNN, which exploits
fractional activations to substantially improve the accuracy of BNNs.
Specifically, our approach employs a dual-precision activation scheme to
compute features with up to two bits, using an additional sparse binary
convolution. We further binarize the input layer using a novel thermometer
encoding. Overall, FracBNN preserves the key benefits of conventional BNNs,
where all convolutional layers are computed in pure binary MAC operations

FracBNN under a resource-constrained scenario, we implement the entire

MobileNetV2, surpassing the best-known BNN design on FPGAs with an increase of

outperforms a recently introduced BNN model with an increase of 2.4% in top-1

optimal parliament size of a given country. According to an old conjecture,
known as the cubic root law, there is a fairly universal power-law relation,
with an exponent close to 1/3, between the size of an elected parliament and
the country's population. Empirical data in modern European countries support
such universality but are consistent with a larger exponent. In this work, we
analyze this intriguing regularity using tools from complex networks theory. We
model the population of a democratic country as a random network, drawn from a
growth model, where each node is assigned a constituency membership sampled
from an available set of size $D$. We calculate analytically the modularity of
the population and find that its functional relation with the number of
constituencies is strongly non-monotonic, exhibiting a maximum that depends on
the population size. The criterion of maximal modularity allows us to predict
that the number of representatives should scale as a power-law in the size of
the population, a finding that is qualitatively confirmed by the empirical
analysis of real-world data.

registration and part segmentation of 3D point clouds. Learning discriminative
representations of local geometric features is unquestionably the most
important task for accurate point cloud analyses. However, it is challenging to
develop rotation or scale-invariant descriptors. Most previous studies have
either ignored rotations or empirically studied optimal scale parameters, which
hinders the applicability of the methods for real-world datasets. In this
paper, we present a new local feature description method that is robust to
rotation, density, and scale variations. Moreover, to improve representations
of the local descriptors, we propose a global aggregation method. First, we
place kernels aligned around each point in the normal direction. To avoid the
sign problem of the normal vector, we use a symmetric kernel point distribution
in the tangential plane. From each kernel point, we first projected the points
from the spatial space to the feature space, which is robust to multiple scales

segmentation on 3D point clouds. Our method showed superior performances when
compared to the state-of-the-art methods by reducing 70$\%$ of the rotation and
translation errors in the registration task. Our method also showed comparable

literature, such as the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre (FKG) inequality and the
celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality of Royen, are qualitative statements
which establish that any two functions of a certain type have non-negative
correlation. In this work we give a general approach that can be used to
bootstrap many qualitative correlation inequalities for functions over product
spaces into quantitative statements. The approach combines a new extremal
result about power series, proved using complex analysis, with harmonic
analysis of functions over product spaces. We instantiate this general approach
in several different concrete settings to obtain a range of new and
near-optimal quantitative correlation inequalities, including:
  $\bullet$ A quantitative version of Royen's celebrated Gaussian Correlation
Inequality. Royen (2014) confirmed a conjecture, open for 40 years, stating
that any two symmetric, convex sets must be non-negatively correlated under any
centered Gaussian distribution. We give a lower bound on the correlation in
terms of the vector of degree-2 Hermite coefficients of the two convex sets,
analogous to the correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over
$\{0,1\}^n$ obtained by Talagrand (1996).
  $\bullet$ A quantitative version of the well-known FKG inequality for
monotone functions over any finite product probability space, generalizing the
quantitative correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over $\{0,1\}^n$
obtained by Talagrand (1996). The only prior generalization of which we are
aware is due to Keller (2008, 2009, 2012), which extended Talagrand's result to
product distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$. We also give two different quantitative
versions of the FKG inequality for monotone functions over the continuous
domain $[0,1]^n$, answering a question of Keller (2009).

The personalized education became crucially important in future learning
environments. Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the detection of students'
knowledge states and predict future performance given their past outcomes for
providing adaptive solution to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Bayesian
Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a model to capture mastery level of each skill with
psychologically meaningful parameters and widely used in successful tutoring
systems. However, it is unable to detect learning transfer across skills
because each skill model is learned independently and shows lower efficiency in
student performance prediction. While recent KT models based on deep neural
networks shows impressive predictive power but it came with a price. Ten of
thousands of parameters in neural networks are unable to provide
psychologically meaningful interpretation that reflect to cognitive theory. In
this paper, we proposed an efficient student model called BKT-LSTM. It contains
three meaningful components: individual \textit{skill mastery} assessed by BKT,
\textit{ability profile} (learning transfer across skills) detected by k-means
clustering and \textit{problem difficulty}. All these components are taken into
account in student's future performance prediction by leveraging predictive
power of LSTM. BKT-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art student models in
student's performance prediction by considering these meaningful features
instead of using binary values of student's past interaction in DKT. We also
conduct ablation studies on each of BKT-LSTM model components to examine their
value and each component shows significant contribution in student's
performance prediction. Thus, it has potential for providing adaptive and
personalized instruction in real-world educational systems.

cover large angular areas of 16.3 deg^2 and 16.9 deg^2. Our sample contains
8302 and 9578 [OII] emitters at z=1.19 (NB816) and z=1.47 (NB921),
respectively. We detect a strong clustering signal over a wide angular range,
0.001 < \theta < 1 [deg], with the bias $b=1.61^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ (z=1.19) and
$b=2.09^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ (z=1.47). We also find a clear deviation of the
correlation from a simple power-law form. To interpret the measured clustering
signal, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that is constructed
to explain the spatial distribution of galaxies selected by a star formation
rate. The observed correlation function and number density are simultaneously
explained by the best-fitting HOD model. From the constrained HOD model, the
average mass of halos hosting the [OII] emitters is derived to be
$\log{M_{eff}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)}=12.70^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and
$12.61^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ at z=1.19 and 1.47, respectively, which will become
halos with the present-day mass, $M\sim 1.5 \times 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$. The
satellite fraction of the [OII] emitter sample is found to be $f_{sat}\sim
0.15$. All these values are consistent with the previous studies of similar
samples, but we obtain tighter constraints even in a larger parameter space due
to the larger sample size from the HSC. The results obtained for host halos of

field to prevent accidents and to provide a civilized environment for people. A
material that has recently attracted attention in research to reduce noise is
acoustic metamaterial, and most of the research projects so far have been
limited to the case of static media without flow. We have studied the sound
transmission properties of acoustic metamaterial with turbulent flow to develop
acoustic metamaterial that be used in transportation. In this paper, the effect
of geometrical structure, the convective effect, and the eddy effect on sound
propagation in acoustic metamaterial with turbulent flow are investigated, and
the relationships between them are analyzed. The convective effect and the eddy
effect both reduce the resonant strength of sound transmission loss resulting
from the unique geometry of the acoustic crystal, but shift the resonant
frequencies in opposite directions. In addition, when the convective effect and
the eddy effect of the airflow, as well as the intrinsic interaction effect
generated from the unique geometrical structure of the acoustic metamaterial
cannot be ignored, they exhibit competition phenomena with each other,
resulting in a widening of the resonance peak. As a result, these three effects
cause the shift of the resonance frequency of the sound transmission loss and
the widening of the resonance peak. The results of this study show that even in
the case of turbulent flow, acoustic metamaterial can be used for
transportation by properly controlling the geometric size and shape of the
acoustic metamaterial.

experiments like randomized benchmarking (RB) or gate set tomography (GST),

show how to resolve these inconsistencies, and quantify the rate of unmodeled

Adding wildcard error to an error model relaxes and weakens its predictions in
a controlled way. The amount of wildcard error required to restore consistency
with data quantifies how much unmodeled error was observed, in a way that
facilitates direct comparison to standard gate error rates. Using both
simulated and experimental data, we show how to use wildcard error to reconcile
error models derived from RB and GST experiments with inconsistent data, to
capture non-Markovianity, and to quantify all of a processor's observed error.

Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and tensor models, with which it shares some important
features. It is a model of $N$ scalar fields transforming in an $N$-dimensional
irreducible representation of $SO(3)$. The most relevant (in renormalization
group sense) invariant interaction is cubic in the fields and mediated by a
Wigner $3jm$ symbol. The latter can be viewed as a particular rank-3 tensor
coupling, thus highlighting the similarity to the SYK model, in which the
tensor coupling is however random and of even rank. As in the SYK and tensor
models, in the large-$N$ limit the perturbative expansion is dominated by
melonic diagrams. The lack of randomness, and the rapidly growing number of
invariants that can be built with $n$ fields, makes the AR model somewhat
closer to tensor models. We review the results from the old work of Amit and
Roginsky with the hindsight of recent developments, correcting and completing
some of their statements, in particular concerning the spectrum of the operator
product expansion of two fundamental fields. For $5.74<d<6$ the fixed-point
theory defines a real CFT, while for smaller $d$ complex dimensions appear,
after a merging of the lowest dimension with its shadow. We also introduce and
study a long-range version of the model, for which the cubic interaction is
exactly marginal at large $N$, and we find a real and unitary CFT for any

correlated regions in the liquid relax at either a much faster rate or a much
slower rate than the average. This collective phenomenon has been characterized
by measurements of a dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$, which are sometimes
interpreted in terms of the size of those relaxing regions and the intensity of
the fluctuations. We show that the results of those measurements can be
affected not only by the collective fluctuations in the relaxation rate, but
also by density fluctuations in the initial state and by single-particle
fluctuations. We also show that at very long times the average overlap $C(t)$
probing the similarity between an initial and a final state separated by a time
interval $t$ decays as a power law $C(t) \sim t^{-d/2}$. This is much slower
than the stretched exponential behavior $C(t) \sim {\rm e}^{-(t/\tau)^{\beta}}$
previously observed at times within one or two orders of magnitude of the
$\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$. We find that for times longer than
$10-100 \tau_{\alpha}$, the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ is dominated by
single particle fluctuations, and that $\chi_4(t) \approx C(t) \sim t^{-d/2}$.
Finally, we introduce a method to extract the collective relaxation
contribution to the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ by subtracting the
effects of single-particle fluctuations and initial state density fluctuations.
We apply this method to numerical simulations of two glass forming models: a
binary hard sphere system and a Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones system. This allows
us to extend the analysis of numerical data to timescales much longer than

discrepancies beyond what famous equidistribution results predict; this
phenomenon is known as Chebyshev's bias. Rubinstein and Sarnak have developed a
framework which allows to conditionally quantify biases in the distribution of
primes in general arithmetic progressions. Their analysis has been generalized
by Ng to the context of the Chebotarev density theorem, under the assumption of
the Artin holomorphy conjecture, the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, as well as
a linear independence hypothesis on the zeros of Artin $L$-functions. In this

These biases lie far beyond what the strongest effective forms of the
Chebotarev density theorem can predict. More precisely, we prove the existence
of an infinite family of Galois extensions and associated conjugacy classes
$C_1,C_2\subset {\rm Gal}(L/K)$ of same size such that the number of prime
ideals of norm up to $x$ with Frobenius conjugacy class $C_1$ always exceeds

$d-$level systems (qudits) that share the so-called `dual unitarity' property.
Namely, these systems generate unitary dynamics not only when propagating in
the time direction, but also when propagating in the space direction. We
consider space-time homogeneous (Floquet) circuits and perturb them with a
quenched single-site disorder, i.e. by applying independent single site random
unitaries drawn from arbitrary non-singular distribution over ${\rm SU}(d)$,
e.g. one concentrated around the identity, after each layer of the circuit. We
identify the spectral form factor at time $t$ in the limit of long chains as
the dimension of the commutant of a finite set of operators on a qudit ring of
$t$ sites. For general dual unitary circuits of qubits $(d=2)$ and a family of
their extensions to higher $d>2$, we provide explicit construction of the
commutant and prove that spectral form factor exactly matches the prediction of
circular unitary ensemble for all $t$, if only the local 2-qubit gates are
different from a SWAP (non-interacting gate). We discuss and partly prove
possible extensions of our results to a weaker (more singular) forms of
disorder averaging, as well as to quantum circuits with time-reversal symmetry,
and to computing higher moments of the spectral form factor.

by strong tidal forces in a tidal disruption event, or TDE. Half of the
elongated stream of debris comes back to the stellar pericenter where
relativistic apsidal precession induces a self-crossing shock. As a result, the
gas gets launched into an outflow that can experience additional interactions,
leading to the formation of an accretion disc. We carry out the first
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of this process, making use of the same
injection procedure to treat the self-crossing shock as in our previous
adiabatic study (Bonnerot & Lu 2020). Two sets of realistic parameters of the
problem are considered that correspond to different strengths of this initial
interaction. In both cases, we find that the injected matter has its
trajectories promptly circularized by secondary shocks taking place near the
black hole. However, the generated internal energy efficiently diffuses away in
the form of radiation, which results in a thin vertical profile of the formed
disc. The diffusing photons promptly irradiate the surrounding debris until
they emerge with a bolometric luminosity of $L\approx 10^{44} \, \rm erg\,
s^{-1}$. Towards the self-crossing shock, diffusion is however slowed that
results in a shallower luminosity increase, with a potentially significant
component in the optical band. Matter launched to large distances continuously
gains energy through radiation pressure, which can cause a significant fraction
to become unbound. This work provides direct insight into the origin of the
early emission from TDEs, which is accessed by a rapidly increasing number of
observations.

which both the Hamiltonian and ground state remain fully translational
invariant but the symmetry is `broken' by its anyon quasi-particles, in the
sense that its action maps them into a different super-selection sector. We
demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs when the fermionic spinons form a weak

leading to the amusing property that there is no local operator that can
transport the $\pi$-flux quasi-particle across a single Kitaev wire of fermonic

iterative method (LSIM) as the main approach, we explicitly show evidence of
twisting (in about 52% of halos) and stretching (in 48% of them) in the real
space. This is matched with the re-orientation observed in the eigenvectors of
the inertia tensor and gives us a clear picture of having a re-oriented stellar
distribution. We make a comparison between the shape profile of dark matter
(DM) halo and stellar distribution and quite remarkably see that their radial
profiles are fairly close, especially at small galactocentric radii where the
stellar disk is located. This implies that the DM halo is somewhat aligned with
stars in response to the baryonic potential. The level of alignment mostly
decreases away from the center. We study the impact of substructures in the
orbital circularity parameter. It is demonstrated that in some cases, far away
substructures are counter-rotating compared with the central stars and may flip
the sign of total angular momentum and thus the orbital circularity parameter.
Truncating them above 150 kpc, however, retains the disky structure of the
galaxy as per initial selection. Including the impact of substructures in the
shape of stars, we explicitly show that their contribution is subdominant.
Overlaying our theoretical results to the observational constraints from

for mobile robots to respect human groups when navigating around people. This
paper explores learning group-aware navigation policies based on dynamic group
formation using deep reinforcement learning. Through simulation experiments, we
show that group-aware policies, compared to baseline policies that neglect
human groups, achieve greater robot navigation performance (e.g., fewer

robot's movement impact on pedestrians. Our results contribute to the
development of social navigation and the integration of mobile robots into

for generative models: variational optimization and evolutionary algorithms.
The combination is realized for generative models with discrete latents by
using truncated posteriors as the family of variational distributions. The
variational parameters of truncated posteriors are sets of latent states. By
interpreting these states as genomes of individuals and by using the
variational lower bound to define a fitness, we can apply evolutionary
algorithms to realize the variational loop. The used variational distributions
are very flexible and we show that evolutionary algorithms can effectively and
efficiently optimize the variational bound. Furthermore, the variational loop
is generally applicable (""black box"") with no analytical derivations required.
To show general applicability, we apply the approach to three generative models
(we use noisy-OR Bayes Nets, Binary Sparse Coding, and Spike-and-Slab Sparse
Coding). To demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the novel variational
approach, we use the standard competitive benchmarks of image denoising and
inpainting. The benchmarks allow quantitative comparisons to a wide range of
methods including probabilistic approaches, deep deterministic and generative
networks, and non-local image processing methods. In the category of
""zero-shot"" learning (when only the corrupted image is used for training), we
observed the evolutionary variational algorithm to significantly improve the
state-of-the-art in many benchmark settings. For one well-known inpainting
benchmark, we also observed state-of-the-art performance across all categories
of algorithms although we only train on the corrupted image. In general, our
investigations highlight the importance of research on optimization methods for
generative models to achieve performance improvements.

planetary systems, no general model exists for describing their properties,
particularly for commensurabilities of any order and arbitrary values of the
eccentricities and inclinations. The present work presents a semi-analytical
model that describes the resonance strength, width, location and stability of
fixed points, as well as periods of small-amplitude librations. The model is
valid to any two gravitationally interacting massive bodies, and thus
applicable to planets around single or binary stars. Using a theoretical
framework in Poincar\'e and Jacobi reference system we develop a
semi-analytical method that employs a numerical evaluation of the averaged
resonant disturbing function. Validations of the model are presented comparing
its predictions with dynamical maps for real and fictitious systems. The model
is shown to describe very well many dynamical features of planetary resonances.
Notwithstanding the good agreements found in all cases, a small deviation is
noted in the location of the resonance centers for circumbinary systems. As a
consequence of its application to the HD31527 system we have found that the
updated best-fit solution leads to a high-eccentricity stable libration between
the middle and outer planets inside the 16/3 mean-motion resonance. This is the
first planetary system whose long-term dynamics appears dominated by such a
high-order commensurability. In the case of circumbinary planets, the overlap
of N/1 mean-motion resonances coincides very well with the size of the global
chaotic region close to the binary, as well as its dependence with the mutual
inclination.

dark matter on cosmological scales, but predictions differ notably in the
details. We used this opportunity and tested two semi-analytic models by the
Munich and Durham groups with data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). For the test we measured the scale-dependent galaxy
bias factor $b(k)$ and correlation factor $r(k)$ from linear to non-linear
scales of $k\approx10\,h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ at two redshifts $\bar{z}=0.35,0.51$
for galaxies with stellar mass between $5\times10^9$ and
$3\times10^{11}\,h_{\rm 70}^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Our improved gravitational
lensing technique accounts for the intrinsic alignment of sources and the
magnification of lens galaxies for better constraints for the galaxy-matter
correlation $r(k)$. Galaxy bias in CFHTLenS increases with $k$ and stellar
mass, it is colour-dependent, revealing the individual footprints of galaxy
types. Despite a reasonable model agreement for the relative change with both
scale and galaxy properties, there is a clear conflict for $b(k)$ with no model
preference: the model galaxies are too weakly clustered. This may flag a model
problem at $z\gtrsim0.3$ for all stellar masses. As in the models, however,
there is a high correlation $r(k)$ between matter and galaxy density on all
scales, and galaxy bias is typically consistent with a deterministic bias on
linear scales. Only our blue and low-mass galaxies of about
$7\times10^9\,h_{\rm 70}^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $\bar{z}=0.51$ show, contrary
to the models, a weak tendency towards a stochastic bias on linear scales where
$r_{\rm ls}=0.75\pm0.14\,{\rm(stat.)}\pm0.06\,{\rm(sys.)}$. This result is of
interest for cosmological probes, such as $E_{\rm G}$, that rely on a

observed at finite temperature for one-dimensional models with short-range
coupling, closely resembling a second-order phase transition. Thus, we will
analyze the finite temperature pseudo-transition property observed in some
one-dimensional models and its relationship with finite size effect. In
particular, we consider two chain models to study the finite size effects;
these are the Ising-Heisenberg tetrahedral chain and an Ising-Heisenberg-type
ladder model. Although the anomalous peaks of these one-dimensional models have
already been studied in the thermodynamic limit, here we will discuss the
finite size effects of the chain and why the peaks do not diverge in the
thermodynamic limit. So, we discuss the dependence of the finite size effects,
for moderately and sufficiently large systems, in which the specific heat and
magnetic susceptibility exhibit peculiar rounded towering peaks for a given
temperature. This behavior is quite similar to a continuous phase transition,
but there is no singularity. For moderately large systems, the peaks narrow and
increase in height as the number of unit cells is increased, and the location
of peak shifts slightly. Hence, one can naively induce that the sharp peak
should lead to a divergence in the thermodynamic limit. However, for a rather
large system, the height of a peak goes asymptotically to a finite value. Our
result confirms the dependence of the peak height with the number of unit cells
at the pseudo-critical temperature. We also provide an alternative empirical
function that satisfactorily fits specific heat and magnetic susceptibility at
pseudo-critical temperature. Certainly, our result is crucial to understand the
finite size correction behavior in quantum spin models, which in general are
only numerically tractable within the framework of the finite size analysis.

planets, raised an interest to the astrometric detection of exoplanets. Another
source of such wobbles (often also called jitter) is stellar magnetic activity.
A quantitative assessment of the stellar astrometric jitter is important for a
more reliable astrometric detection and characterisation of exoplanets. We
calculate the displacement of the solar photocentre due to the magnetic
activity for an almost 16-year period (February 2, 1999 - August 1, 2014). We
also investigate how the displacement depends on the spectral passband chosen
for observations, including the wavelength range to be covered by the upcoming
Small-JASMINE mission of JAXA. This is done by extending the SATIRE-S model for
solar irradiance variability to calculating the displacement of the solar
photocentre caused by the magnetic features on the surface of the Sun. We found
that the peak to peak amplitude of the solar photocentre displacement would
reach 0.5 mas if the Sun were located 10 pc away from the observer and observed
in the Gaia G filter. This is by far too small to be detected by the Gaia
mission. However, the Sun is a relatively inactive star so that one can expect
significantly larger signals for younger, and, consequently, more active stars.
The model developed in this study can be combined with the simulations of
emergence and surface transport of magnetic flux which have recently became
available to model the astrometric jitter over the broad range of magnetic
activities.

the last five decades. Despite their wide adoption, code quality metrics have
attracted a fair share of criticism. In this paper, first, we carry out a
qualitative exploration by surveying software developers to gauge their
opinions about current practices and potential gaps with the present set of
metrics. We identify deficiencies including lack of soundness, i.e., the
ability of a metric to capture a notion accurately as promised by the metric,
lack of support for assessing software architecture quality, and insufficient
support for assessing software testing and infrastructure. In the second part
of the paper, we focus on one specific code quality metric-LCOM as a case study
to explore opportunities towards improved metrics. We evaluate existing LCOM
algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively to observe how closely they
represent the concept of cohesion. In this pursuit, we first create eight
diverse cases that any LCOM algorithm must cover and obtain their cohesion
levels by a set of experienced developers and consider them as a ground truth.
We show that the present set of LCOM algorithms do poorly w.r.t. these cases.
To bridge the identified gap, we propose a new approach to compute LCOM and
evaluate the new approach with the ground truth. We also show, using a
quantitative analysis using more than 90 thousand types belonging to 261
high-quality Java repositories, the present set of methods paint a very
inaccurate and misleading picture of class cohesion. We conclude that the
current code quality metrics in use suffer from various deficiencies,
presenting ample opportunities for the research community to address the gaps.

is an effective and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of
the drug discovery process. Structure-based drug similarities and
sequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information
for DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based
chemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform
predictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, existing
similarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict interactions for any
new drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new
drugs, new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of
missing (undetected) interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI
prediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as
Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can
WkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any
need of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions (false
negatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the
influence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and
prediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ
diverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any
other DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over
five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in
predicting drug-target interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical
prediction ability of proposed methods to discover reliable interactions that
were not reported in the original benchmark datasets.

not add a term to the loss function as this is difficult to optimize and tune.
Instead, we design a new parameter-free network layer to explicitly force

our approach builds on standard Linux tools to share a graphical desktop with
remote users. We leverage these tools to deploy simulators on the web that
would typically be constrained to desktop computing environments. As an example
implementation of our approach, we introduce the SEAN Experimental Platform
(SEAN-EP). With SEAN-EP, remote users can virtually interact with a mobile
robot in the Social Environment for Autonomous Navigation, without installing
any software on their computer or needing specialized hardware. We validated
that SEAN-EP could quickly scale the collection of human feedback and its
usability through an online survey. In addition, we compared human feedback
from participants that interacted with a robot using SEAN-EP with feedback
obtained through a more traditional video survey. Our results suggest that
human perceptions of robots may differ based on whether they interact with the
robots in simulation or observe them in videos. Also, they suggest that people
perceive the surveys with interactive simulations as less mentally demanding
than video surveys.

can be extended to bipartite quantum-entangled Gaussian states. The meaning of
the two-particle visibility originally defined by Jaeger, Horne, Shimony, and
Vaidman with the use of an indirect method that first corrects the two-particle
probability distribution by adding and subtracting other distributions with
varying degree of entanglement, however, deserves further analysis.
Furthermore, the origin of complementarity between one-particle visibility and
two-particle visibility is somewhat elusive and it is not entirely clear what
is the best way to associate particular two-particle quantum observables with
the two-particle visibility. Here, we develop a direct method for quantifying
the two-particle visibility based on measurement of a pair of two-particle
observables that are compatible with the measured pair of single-particle
observables. For each of the two-particle observables the corresponding
visibility is computed, after which the absolute difference of the latter pair
of visibilities is considered as a redefinition of the two-particle visibility.
Our approach reveals a mathematical symmetry as it treats the two pairs of
one-particle or two-particle observables on equal footing by formally
identifying all four observable distributions as rotated marginal distributions
of the original two-particle probability distribution. The complementarity
relation between one-particle visibility and two-particle visibility obtained
with the direct method is exact in the limit of infinite Gaussian precision
where the entangled Gaussian state approaches an ideal EPR state. The presented
results demonstrate the theoretical utility of rotated marginal distributions
for elucidating the nature of two-particle visibility and provide tools for the
development of quantum applications employing continuous variables.

The first sample A shows signatures of magnetically ordered spins, and exhibits
one sharp $^7$Li peak with FWHM increasing significantly below 14~K.
$1/T_1^{stretch}$ of this sample displays a broad local maximum at 40~K,
followed by a very sharp peak at $T_N = 9\pm1$~K due to critical slowing down
of Ir spin fluctuations, a typical signature of magnetic long range order. In
order to shed light on the position-by-position variation of $1/T_1$ throughout
the sample, we use Inverse Laplace Transform $T_1$ analysis based on Tikhonov
regularization to deduce the density distribution function $P(1/T_1)$. We
demonstrate that $\sim 60\%$ of Ir spins are statically ordered at the NMR
measurement timescale but the rest of the sample volume remains paramagnetic
even at 4.2~K, presumably because of structural disorder induced primarily by
stacking faults. In order to further investigate the influence of structural
disorder, we compare these NMR results with those of a second sample B, which
has been shown by transmission electron microscope to have domains with
unwanted Ag inclusion at Li and Ir sites within the Ir honeycomb planes. The
sample B displays an additional NMR peak with relative intensity of $\sim
17\%$. The small Knight shift and $1/T_1$ of these defect-induced $^7$Li sites
and the enhancement of bulk susceptibility at low temperatures suggest that
these defects generate domains of only weakly magnetic Ir spins accompanied by
free spins, leading to a lack of clear signatures of long-range order. The
apparent lack of long-range order could be easily misinterpreted as evidence
for the realization of a spin liquid ground state in highly disordered Kitaev
lattice.

tight-binding calculations to the Linearized Boltzmann transport formalism. We
consider nanowires with diameters from 40nm (bulk-like) down to 3nm (1D), which
allows for the proper exploration of the power factor within a unified
large-scale atomistic description across a large diameter range. We find that
as the diameter of the nanowires is reduced below d < 10 nm, the Seebeck
coefficient increases substantially, a consequence of strong subband
quantization. Under phonon-limited scattering conditions, a considerable
improvement of ~6x in the power factor is observed around d = 10 nm. The
introduction of surface roughness scattering in the calculation reduces this
power factor improvement to ~2x. As the diameter is decreased down to d = 3 nm,
the power factor is diminished. Our results show that, although low effective
mass materials such as InAs can reach low-dimensional behavior at larger
diameters and demonstrate significant thermoelectric power factor improvements,
surface roughness is also stronger at larger diameters, which takes most of the
anticipated power factor advantages away. However, the power factor improvement
that can be observed around d = 10 nm, could prove to be beneficial as both the
Lorenz number and the phonon thermal conductivity are reduced at that diameter.
Thus, this work, by using large-scale full-band simulations that span the
corresponding length scales, clarifies properly the reasons behind power factor
improvements (or degradations) in low-dimensional materials. The elaborate
computational method presented can serve as a platform to develop similar
schemes for 2D and 3D material electronic structures.

variety of user interfaces (UIs) is a common aspect of daily life for many
people. To improve the accessibility of these devices and to enable their usage
in a variety of settings, building models that can assist users and accomplish
tasks through the UI is vitally important. However, there are several
challenges to achieve this. First, UI components of similar appearance can have
different functionalities, making understanding their function more important
than just analyzing their appearance. Second, domain-specific features like
Document Object Model (DOM) in web pages and View Hierarchy (VH) in mobile
applications provide important signals about the semantics of UI elements, but
these features are not in a natural language format. Third, owing to a large
diversity in UIs and absence of standard DOM or VH representations, building a
UI understanding model with high coverage requires large amounts of training
data.

trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,
nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for
neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate
computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,
whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide
a rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of
whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential
dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional
MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of
700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the
Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and
nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,
computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by
the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve
the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between
accuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight
four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask
microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are
technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are
inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with
the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our
understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of
model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

show that models solve task (1) very well, as expected, since all models are
pretrained on task (1). However, none of the pretrained V&L models is able to
adequately solve task (2), our counting probe, and they cannot generalise to
out-of-distribution quantities. We propose a number of explanations for these

fail to individuate entities in the visual input. While a selling point of
pretrained V&L models is their ability to solve complex tasks, our findings
suggest that understanding their reasoning and grounding capabilities requires
more targeted investigations on specific phenomena.

witnessed varieties of applications from different domains. Different from
conventional classification approaches, fair classification concerns the issues
of unintentional biases against the sensitive features (e.g., gender, race).
Due to high nonconvexity of fairness measures, existing methods are often
unable to model exact fairness, which can cause inferior fair classification
outcomes. This paper fills the gap by developing a novel unified framework to
jointly optimize accuracy and fairness. The proposed framework is versatile and
can incorporate different fairness measures studied in literature precisely as
well as can be applicable to many classifiers including deep classification
models. Specifically, in this paper, we first prove Fisher consistency of the
proposed framework. We then show that many classification models within this
framework can be recast as mixed-integer convex programs, which can be solved
effectively by off-the-shelf solvers when the instance sizes are moderate and
can be used as benchmarks to compare the efficiency of approximation
algorithms. We prove that in the proposed framework, when the classification
outcomes are known, the resulting problem, termed ""unbiased subdata selection,""
is strongly polynomial-solvable and can be used to enhance the classification
fairness by selecting more representative data points. This motivates us to
develop an iterative refining strategy (IRS) to solve the large-scale
instances, where we improve the classification accuracy and conduct the
unbiased subdata selection in an alternating fashion. We study the convergence
property of IRS and derive its approximation bound. More broadly, this
framework can be leveraged to improve classification models with unbalanced
data by taking F1 score into consideration.

paper we study their general properties putting forward a number of
conjectures. We conjecture that an RG operator is always a conformal primary
such that the OPE of this operator with its conjugate must contain the
perturbing UV operator when taken in one order and the leading irrelevant
operator (when it exists) along which the flow enters the IR fixed point, when
taken in the other order. We support our conjectures by perturbative
calculations for flows between nearby fixed points, by a non-perturbative
variational method inspired by the variational method proposed by J.~Cardy for
massive RG flows, and by numerical results obtained using boundary TCSA. The
variational method has a merit of its own as it can be used as a first
approximation in charting the global structure of the space of boundary RG
flows. We also discuss the role of the RG operators in the transport of states

the problem of heat transport unitedly for both conventional energy-preserving
system-environment interactions and non-energy preserving system-environment
interactions. For the former interaction, as the inter-system interaction
strength increases, at first this approximation gets worse as expected, but
then counterintuitively gets better even for a stronger inter-system coupling.
For the latter interaction with asymmetry, this approximation gets
progressively worse. In this case we realize a perfect thermal rectification,

tighter global cap on CO2 emissions in order to investigate the effect of
different levels of reliance on variable sources. Our results show that a
supergrid option decreases total system cost by a maximum of 5%, compared to
continental grid integration. This maximum effect is achieved when (i) the
generation is constrained to be made up almost entirely by renewables, (ii) the
land available for VRE farms is relatively limited and the demand is relatively
high and (iii) the cost for solar PV and storage is high. The importance of
these two factors is explained by that a super grid allows for harnessing of
remote wind-, solar- and hydro resources as well as management of variations,
both of which are consequential only in cases where dispatchable resources are
limited or very costly. As for the importance of the cost for storage, it
represents a competing variation management option, and when it has low cost,
it substitutes part of the role of the supergrid, which is to manage variations
through long-distance trade. The cost decrease from a Eurasian supergrid was
found to be between 0% and 5%, compared to the cost in the case of
continental-scale grids. We conclude that the benefits of a supergrid from a
techno-economic perspective are in most cases negligible, or modest at best.17

adversarial attacks. Adversarial Training (AT) is a technique that
approximately solves a robust optimization problem to minimize the worst-case
loss and is widely regarded as the most effective defense. Due to the high
computation time for generating strong adversarial examples in the AT process,
single-step approaches have been proposed to reduce training time. However,
these methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting where adversarial accuracy
drops during training, and although improvements have been proposed, they
increase training time and robustness is far from that of multi-step AT. We
develop a theoretical framework for adversarial training with FW optimization
(FW-AT) that reveals a geometric connection between the loss landscape and the
$\ell_2$ distortion of $\ell_\infty$ FW attacks. We analytically show that high
distortion of FW attacks is equivalent to small gradient variation along the
attack path. It is then experimentally demonstrated on various deep neural
network architectures that $\ell_\infty$ attacks against robust models achieve
near maximal distortion, while standard networks have lower distortion. It is
experimentally shown that catastrophic overfitting is strongly correlated with
low distortion of FW attacks. This mathematical transparency differentiates FW
from Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) optimization. To demonstrate the utility
of our theoretical framework we develop FW-AT-Adapt, a novel adversarial
training algorithm which uses a simple distortion measure to adapt the number
of attack steps during training to increase efficiency without compromising
robustness. FW-AT-Adapt provides training time on par with single-step fast AT
methods and closes the gap between fast AT methods and multi-step PGD-AT with

communications with neighbors. At each step, every agent updates its local
global state estimation, based on which it solves an approximate Q-factor

technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases,
critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and
September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model
hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the
recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the
Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were
constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the
reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase
again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over
Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to
provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very

for this data deluge, we developed the Photometric LSST Astronomical
Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC), a competition which aimed to
catalyze the development of robust classifiers under LSST-like conditions of a
non-representative training set for a large photometric test set of imbalanced
classes. Over 1,000 teams participated in PLAsTiCC, which was hosted in the
Kaggle data science competition platform between Sep 28, 2018 and Dec 17, 2018,
ultimately identifying three winners in February 2019. Participants produced
classifiers employing a diverse set of machine learning techniques including
hybrid combinations and ensemble averages of a range of approaches, among them
boosted decision trees, neural networks, and multi-layer perceptrons. The
strong performance of the top three classifiers on Type Ia supernovae and
kilonovae represent a major improvement over the current state-of-the-art
within astronomy. This paper summarizes the most promising methods and
evaluates their results in detail, highlighting future directions both for
classifier development and simulation needs for a next generation PLAsTiCC data

  Forum",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective method for control of
constrained systems but is susceptible to the external disturbances and
modeling error often encountered in real-world applications. To address these
issues, techniques such as Tube MPC (TMPC) utilize an ancillary
offline-generated robust controller to ensure that the system remains within an
invariant set, referred to as a tube, around an online-generated trajectory.
However, TMPC is unable to modify its tube and ancillary controller in response
to changing state-dependent uncertainty, often resulting in overly-conservative
solutions. Dynamic Tube MPC (DTMPC) addresses these problems by simultaneously
optimizing the desired trajectory and tube geometry online. Building upon this
framework, Adaptive DTMPC (ADTMPC) produces better model approximations by
reducing model uncertainty, resulting in more accurate control policies. This
work presents an experimental analysis and performance evaluation of TMPC,
DTMPC, and ADTMPC for an uncertain nonlinear system. In particular, DTMPC is
shown to outperform TMPC because it is able to dynamically adjust to changing
environments, limiting aggressive control and conservative behavior to only the
cases when the constraints and uncertainty require it. Applied to a pendulum
testbed, this enables DTMPC to use up to 30% less control effort while
achieving up to 80% higher speeds. This performance is further improved by
ADTMPC, which reduces the feedback control effort by up to another 35%, while
delivering up to 34% better trajectory tracking. This analysis establishes that
the DTMPC and ADTMPC frameworks yield significantly more effective robust
control policies for systems with changing uncertainty, goals, and operating
conditions.

Laboratory enables the development of VLSI digital circuits with millions of

multi-phase AC biasing techniques already encounter serious challenges for
scaling circuits above several hundred thousand junctions. In this work, we
propose a novel AC-based biasing scheme for RSFQ-type logic families requiring
DC bias. The major step toward this scheme is a superconducting AC/DC rectifier
which we introduced at ASC 2014. Initially, we proposed to connect the
rectifiers to 'payload cells' via superconducting inductors with large
inductance in order to reduce parasitic effects of flux quantization. Recently,
we discovered that this powering scheme works even better at a much lower value
of the inductance, when it is just sufficient to hold only one or two flux
quanta in the inductive loop between the converter and the payload. In this
case, flux quantization in the loop becomes beneficial because the value of
current fed into the payload is defined by the value of the coupling
inductance. Therefore, our AC/SFQ converter powers the payload cell by a single
flux quantum rather than by DC current. Such mode of operation is extremely
energy efficient because the energy is used only to recover flux quantum
consumed by the cell during the logic operation. We present designs of AC/SFQ
converters comprising an AC/DC rectifier and a current conditioning circuit
which we termed an SFQ filter. We also present test results and demonstrate
AC/SFQ powering a payload circuit using circuits fabricated in a new, 150-nm

Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb Josephson junctions with 600 $\mu$A/$\mu$$m^2$ critical current

Subregional T2 values and four-year changes were calculated using a
musculoskeletal radiologist's segmentations (Reader 1) and the model's

Results: Model segmentations agreed with Reader 1 segmentations with a Dice

subregions agreed with those of Reader 1 with an average Spearman correlation
of 0.89 and average mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.34 ms. The model's estimated

almost infinite degrees-of-freedom in body deformation. When multiple actuators
are used, it becomes more difficult as deformation can also occur on actuators
caused by interaction between each other. To tackle this problem, we present a
method in this paper to sense and reconstruct 3D deformation on pneumatic soft
robots by first integrating multiple low-cost sensors inside the chambers of
pneumatic actuators and then using machine learning to convert the captured
signals into shape parameters of soft robots. An exterior motion capture system
is employed to generate the datasets for both training and testing. With the
help of good shape parameterization, the 3D shape of a soft robot can be
accurately reconstructed from signals obtained from multiple sensors. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two designs of soft robots --
a robotic joint and a deformable membrane. After parameterizing the deformation
of these soft robots into compact shape parameters, we can effectively train
the neural networks to reconstruct the 3D deformation from the sensor signals.
The sensing and shape prediction pipeline can run at 50Hz in real-time on a

using 2MASS and WISE and by observed-to-model WISE fluxes, and are also
estimated using dust mass-loss rates from literature assuming a typical

and height of the highest peak in the power spectrum of oscillation. Absolute
magnitudes are obtained from the 2MASS Ks band and the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Our
results follow. (i) Substantial mass loss sets in at pulsation periods above
~60 and ~100 days, corresponding to Asymptotic-Giant-Branch stars at the base
of the period-luminosity sequences C' and C. (ii) The mass-loss rate starts to
rapidly increase in semiregulars for which the luminosity is just above the
Red-Giant-Branch tip and gradually plateaus to a level similar to that of
Miras. (iii) The mass-loss rates in Miras do not depend on luminosity,
consistent with pulsation-enhanced dust-driven winds. (iv) The accumulated mass
loss on the Red Giant Branch consistent with asteroseismic predictions reduces
the masses of red-clump stars by 6.3%, less than the typical uncertainty on
their asteroseismic masses. Thus mass loss is currently not a limitation of
stellar age estimates for galactic archaeology studies.

individual differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We
found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk
perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic
factors played a more important role than app design choices such as
decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and
the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the
different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an
inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by
state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of
people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas).
Our mediation analysis showed that one's perception of the public health
benefits offered by the app and the adoption willingness of other people had a
larger effect in explaining the observed effects of app design choices and
individual differences than one's perception of the app's security and privacy

  reversals?",,,"10.1093/gji/ggaa542",,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study predictions of reversals of Earth's axial magnetic dipole field that
are based solely on the dipole's intensity. The prediction strategy is,
roughly, that once the dipole intensity drops below a threshold, then the field
will continue to decrease and a reversal (or a major excursion) will occur. We
first present a rigorous definition of an intensity threshold-based prediction
strategy and then describe a mathematical and numerical framework to
investigate its validity and robustness in view of the data being limited. We
apply threshold-based predictions to a hierarchy of numerical models, ranging
from simple scalar models to 3D geodynamos. We find that the skill of
threshold-based predictions varies across the model hierarchy. The differences
in skill can be explained by differences in how reversals occur: if the field
decreases towards a reversal slowly (in a sense made precise in this paper),
the skill is high, and if the field decreases quickly, the skill is low. Such a
property could be used as an additional criterion to identify which models
qualify as Earth-like. Applying threshold-based predictions to Virtual Axial
Dipole Moment (VADM) paleomagnetic reconstructions (PADM2M and Sint-2000)
covering the last two million years, reveals a moderate skill of
threshold-based predictions for Earth's dynamo. Besides all of their
limitations, threshold-based predictions suggest that no reversal is to be
expected within the next 10 kyr. Most importantly, however, we show that
considering an intensity threshold for identifying upcoming reversals is
intrinsically limited by the dynamic behavior of Earth's magnetic field.

in efficiency over the past year. However, even these newest devices can only
extract a small portion of the droplet energy. In this paper, we theoretically
investigate the contributions of hydrodynamic and electric losses in limiting
the efficiency of droplet electricity generators (DEG). Noting that the
electro-mechanical energy conversion occurs during the recoil that immediately
follows droplet impact, we identify three limits on existing droplet electric
generators: (i) the impingement velocity is limited in order to maintain the
droplet integrity; (ii) much of droplet mechanical energy is squandered in
overcoming viscous shear force with the substrate; (iii) insufficient
electrical charge of the substrate. Of all these effects, we found that up to
83% of the total energy available was lost by viscous dissipation during
spreading. Minimizing this loss by using cascaded DEG devices to reduce the
droplet kinetic energy may increase future devices efficiency beyond 10%.

essential to visualize and interpret higher resolution linkage across scales.
There is a substantial normal variation of kidney morphometry and appearance
across body size, sex, and imaging protocols in abdominal computed tomography
(CT). A volumetric atlas framework is needed to integrate and visualize the
variability across scales. However, there is no abdominal and retroperitoneal
organs atlas framework for multi-contrast CT. Hence, we proposed a
high-resolution CT retroperitoneal atlas specifically optimized for the kidney
across non-contrast CT and early arterial, late arterial, venous and delayed
contrast enhanced CT. Briefly, we introduce a deep learning-based volume of

pipeline to register abdominal volumes to a high-resolution CT atlas template.
To generate and evaluate the atlas, multi-contrast modality CT scans of 500

we develop PV-RAN, the first open-source virtual RAN platform that enables the

show that the C*-envelope for a cosystem always exists and we explain how it

co-universal, in the sense of Carlsen, Larsen, Sims and Vittadello, for the
Fock tensor algebra equipped with its natural coaction. This yields the
existence of a co-universal C*-algebra, generalizing previous results of

realize the C*-envelope of the tensor algebra as the reduced cross sectional

  network for 3D point clouds",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To enhance the ability of neural networks to extract local point cloud
features and improve their quality, in this paper, we propose a multiscale
graph generation method and a self-adaptive graph convolution method. First, we
propose a multiscale graph generation method for point clouds. This approach
transforms point clouds into a structured multiscale graph form that supports
multiscale analysis of point clouds in the scale space and can obtain the
dimensional features of point cloud data at different scales, thus making it
easier to obtain the best point cloud features. Because traditional
convolutional neural networks are not applicable to graph data with irregular
vertex neighborhoods, this paper presents an sef-adaptive graph convolution
kernel that uses the Chebyshev polynomial to fit an irregular convolution
filter based on the theory of optimal approximation. In this paper, we adopt
max pooling to synthesize the features of different scale maps and generate the
point cloud features. In experiments conducted on three widely used public
datasets, the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art
models, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

consider how to avoid jamming attacks, but ignore that the communication
waveform or frequency action may be obtained by the jammers. Although existing
anti-jamming methods can guarantee temporary communication effects, the
long-term performance of these anti-jamming methods may be depressed when
intelligent jammers are capable of learning from historical communication
activities. Aiming at this issue, a hidden anti-jamming method based on the
idea of reducing the jammer's sense probability is proposed. Firstly, the
sensing probability of the jammer is obtained by calculating the correlation
between the actions of the jammer and the user. Later, a deep reinforcement
learning framework is designed, which aims at not only maximizing the
communication throughput but also minimizing the action's correlation between
the jammer and the user. Finally, a hidden anti-jamming algorithm is proposed,
which links the instantaneous return with the communication quality of users
and the correlation between users and jammer. The simulation result shows that
the proposed algorithm not only avoids being sensed by the jammer but also
improves its anti-jamming performance compared to the current algorithm that
only considers jamming avoidance.

are often motivated by mathematical convenience, for the sake of exactly
identifying the target of inference. We adopt the view that it is preferable to
present bounds under justifiable assumptions than to pursue exact
identification under dubious ones. To that end, we demonstrate how a broad
class of modeling assumptions involving discrete variables, including common
measurement error and conditional independence assumptions, can be expressed as
linear constraints on the parameters of the model. We then use linear
programming techniques to produce sharp bounds for factual and counterfactual

a speed of 28,000 km/h, collisions in these orbits can generate fragments and

This could pose a planetary challenge, because the phenomenon could escalate to
the point of hindering future space operations and damaging satellite

structures predicted by density functional theory are the easiest polymorphs to
synthesize. Ternary nitride materials, with many possible metastable
polymorphs, provide a rich materials space to study what influences
thermodynamic stability and polymorph synthesizability. For example, ZnZrN2 is
theoretically predicted at zero Kelvin to have an unusual layered ""wurtsalt""
ground state crystal structure with compelling optoelectronic properties, but
it is unknown whether this structure can be realized experimentally under
practical synthesis conditions. Here, we use combinatorial sputtering to
synthesize hundreds of ZnxZr1-xNy thin film samples, and find metastable
rocksalt-derived or boron-nitride-derived structures rather than the predicted
wurtsalt structure. Using a statistical polymorph sampler approach, it is
demonstrated that although rocksalt is the least stable polymorph at zero
Kelvin, it becomes the most stable polymorph at high effective temperatures
similar to those achieved using this sputter deposition method, and thus
corroborates experimental results. Additional calculations show that this
destabilization of the wurtsalt polymorph is due to configurational entropic
and enthalpic effects, and that vibrational contributions are negligible.
Specifically, rocksalt- and boron-nitride-derived structures become the most
stable polymorphs in the presence of disorder because of higher tolerances to
cation cross-substitution and off-stoichiometry than the wurtsalt structure.
This understanding of the role of disorder tolerance in the synthesis of
competing polymorphs can enable more accurate predictions of synthesizable
crystal structures and their achievable material properties.

study, we employ short SMF-28 fibers having ~1310 nm zero GVD wavelength and
C-band pump (1552.52 nm) to generate C-band photon pairs. The measured pair
generation rate and coincidence-to-accidental ratios are comparable to those

adequate photon-pair generation rates regardless of its dispersion properties

source sentences, and is used in many online scenarios. The previous wait-k
policy is concise and achieved good results in ST. However, wait-k policy faces
two weaknesses: low training speed caused by the recalculation of hidden states
and lack of future source information to guide training. For the low training
speed, we propose an incremental Transformer with an average embedding layer
(AEL) to accelerate the speed of calculation of the hidden states during
training. For future-guided training, we propose a conventional Transformer as
the teacher of the incremental Transformer, and try to invisibly embed some
future information in the model through knowledge distillation. We conducted
experiments on Chinese-English and German-English simultaneous translation
tasks and compared with the wait-k policy to evaluate the proposed method. Our
method can effectively increase the training speed by about 28 times on average
at different k and implicitly embed some predictive abilities in the model,
achieving better translation quality than wait-k baseline.

over long-term stability. Since this places software maintainability at risk,
technical debt requires early attention to avoid paying for accumulated
interest. Most of the existing work focuses on detecting technical debt using
code comments, known as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). However, there are
many cases where technical debt instances are not explicitly acknowledged but
deeply hidden in the code. In this paper, we propose a framework that caters
for the absence of SATD comments in code. Our Self-Admitted Technical Debt
Identification and Description (SATDID) framework determines if technical debt
should be self-admitted for an input code fragment. If that is the case, SATDID
will automatically generate the appropriate descriptive SATD comment that can
be attached with the code. While our approach is applicable in principle to any
type of code fragments, we focus in this study on technical debt hidden in
conditional statements, one of the most TD-carrying parts of code. We explore
and evaluate different implementations of SATDID. The evaluation results
demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our framework over multiple
benchmarks. Comparing with the results from the benchmarks, our approach
provides at least 21.35%, 59.36%, 31.78%, and 583.33% improvements in terms of

from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches, to efficiently deal with
the problem of the undesired equilibria that precludes smooth vectors fields on
$SO(3)$ from achieving global stability. The key idea consists in constructing
a suitable potential function on $SO(3)\times \mathbb{R}$ involving an
auxiliary scalar variable, with flow and jump dynamics, which keeps the state
away from the undesired critical points while, at the same time, guarantees a
decrease of the potential function over the flows and jumps. Based on this new
hybrid mechanism, a hybrid feedback control scheme for the attitude tracking
problem on $SO(3)$, endowed with global asymptotic stability and semi-global
exponential stability guarantees, is proposed. This control scheme is further
improved through a smoothing mechanism that removes the discontinuities in the
input torque. The third hybrid control scheme, proposed in this paper, removes
the requirement of the angular velocity measurements, while preserving the
strong stability guarantees of the first hybrid control scheme. This approach
has also been applied to the tracking problem on $SE(3)$ to illustrate its
advantages with respect to the existing synergistic hybrid approaches. Finally,
some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the
proposed hybrid controllers.

large-scale wireless networks, in which transmitters need to send a sequence of
information packets, which are generated as independent Bernoulli processes, to
their intended receivers over a shared spectrum. Due to interference, the rate
of packet depletion at any given node is entangled with both the spatial
configurations, which determine the path loss, and temporal dynamics, which
influence the active states, of the other transmitters, resulting in the queues
to interact with each other in both space and time over the entire network. To
that end, variants in the packet update frequency affect not just the
inter-arrival time but also the departure process, and the impact of such
phenomena on the AoI is not well understood. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework to characterize the AoI performance in the aforementioned
setting. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for both the peak and
average AoI under two different transmission protocols, namely the FCFS and the
LCFS-PR. Based on the theoretical outcomes, we find that: i) networks operating
under LCFS-PR are able to attain smaller values of peak and average AoI than
that under FCFS, whereas the gain is more pronounced when the infrastructure is
densely deployed, ii) in sparsely deployed networks, ALOHA with a universally
designed channel access probability is not instrumental in reducing the AoI,
thus calling for more advanced channel access approaches, and iii) when the
infrastructure is densely rolled out, there exists a non-trivial ALOHA channel
access probability that minimizes the peak and average AoI under both FCFS and
LCFS-PR.

challenging and have shown low accuracy in the literature. Two major factors in
system performance are the classification algorithm and the quality of
available data. This paper presents a comparative study of classification
performance for both SS and SI paradigms. Our results show that classification
algorithms for SS models display large variance in performance. Therefore,
distinct classification algorithms per subject may be required. SI models
display lower variance in performance but should only be used if a relatively
large sample size is available. For SI models, LDA and CART had the highest
accuracy for small and moderate sample size, respectively, whereas we
hypothesize that SVM would be superior to the other classifiers if large
training sample-size was available. Additionally, one should choose the design
approach considering the users. While the SS design sound more promising for a
specific subject, an SI approach can be more convenient for mentally or

to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an initial ""seed,""
S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to propose new self supervision.
These are either added directly (a form of structured self-training) or

than their surrounding disks, show a significant color-magnitude trend, and
have colors that do not correlate with environment metrics. On the other hand,
the disks associated with our cluster S0s become significantly bluer with
increasing cluster-centric radius, but show no evidence for a color-magnitude
relation. The disk color-radius relation is mainly driven by galaxies in the
cluster core at $0\leq R/ R_{200}<0.5$. No significant difference is found for
the disk colors of backsplash and infalling galaxies in the projected phase
space. Beyond $R_{200}$, the disk colors do not change with the local galaxy
density, indicating that the colors of double-component galaxies are not
affected by pre-processing. A significant color-density relation is observed

features equally without feature selection flexibility. While using ANNs for
image denoising in real-world applications with unknown noise distributions,
particularly structured noise with learnable patterns, modeling informative
features can substantially boost the performance. Channel attention methods in
real image denoising tasks exploit dependencies between the feature channels,
hence being a frequency component filtering mechanism. Existing channel
attention modules typically use global statics as descriptors to learn the
inter-channel correlations. This method deems inefficient at learning
representative coefficients for re-scaling the channels in frequency level.
This paper proposes a novel Sub-band Pyramid Attention (SPA) based on wavelet
sub-band pyramid to recalibrate the frequency components of the extracted
features in a more fine-grained fashion. We equip the SPA blocks on a network

localization method is prone to spatial semantic errors, i.e., predicting
multiple dots within a same person or collapsing multiple dots in a cluttered
region. We propose a topological approach targeting these semantic errors. We
introduce a topological constraint that teaches the model to reason about the
spatial arrangement of dots. To enforce this constraint, we define a
persistence loss based on the theory of persistent homology. The loss compares
the topographic landscape of the likelihood map and the topology of the ground

outperforms previous localization methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the

it still remains unclear when global forecasting models can outperform the
univariate benchmarks, especially along the dimensions of the
homogeneity/heterogeneity of series, the complexity of patterns in the series,
the complexity of forecasting models, and the lengths/number of series. Our
study attempts to address this problem through investigating the effect from
these factors, by simulating a number of datasets that have controllable time
series characteristics. Specifically, we simulate time series from simple data
generating processes (DGP), such as Auto Regressive (AR) and Seasonal AR, to
complex DGPs, such as Chaotic Logistic Map, Self-Exciting Threshold
Auto-Regressive, and Mackey-Glass Equations. The data heterogeneity is
introduced by mixing time series generated from several DGPs into a single

different scenarios. We perform experiments on these datasets using global
forecasting models including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Feed-Forward
Neural Networks, Pooled Regression (PR) models and Light Gradient Boosting

univariate forecasting techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that when

inherent in hybrid energy systems consisting of energy sources and storage

this problem is unique in that it requires the presence of an appreciable
overshoot to satisfy the foregoing constraints. The problem was previously
studied in the context of stable linear systems. A combined integral and
feedforward control, that requires minimal knowledge of the plant model, was
shown to make the system amenable to meeting such constraints. This paper
extends that work to nonlinear systems and proves the effectiveness of the same
compensation structure under added conditions. Broadly, it is shown that the
integral constraint is satisfied when this compensation structure is applied to
nonlinear systems with stable open-loop step response and a positive DC gain.
However, stability of the resulting closed-loop system mandates bounds on the

  This work investigates the mechanisms that underlie transitions to turbulence
in a three-dimensional domain in which the variation of flow quantities in the
out-of-plane direction is much weaker than any in-plane variation. This is
achieved using a model for the quasi-two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow
in a duct with moving lateral walls and an orthogonal magnetic field. In this
environment, conventional subcritical routes to turbulence, which are highly
three-dimensional, are prohibited. To elucidate the remaining mechanisms
involved in quasi-two-dimensional turbulent transitions, the magnetic field
strength and degree of antisymmetry in the base flow are varied, the latter via
the relative motion of the lateral duct walls. Introduction of any amount of
antisymmetry to the base flow drives the critical Reynolds number infinite, as
the TS instabilities take on opposite signs of rotation, and destructively
interfere. However, an increasing magnetic field strength limits interaction
between the instabilities, permitting finite critical Reynolds numbers. The
transient growth only mildly depends on the base flow, with negligible
differences for friction parameters $H \gtrsim 30$. Direct numerical
simulations, initiated with random noise, indicate that for $H \leq 1$,
supercritical exponential growth leads to saturation, but not turbulence. For
higher $3 \leq H \leq 10$, a turbulent transition occurs, and is maintained at
$H=10$. For $H \geq 30$, the turbulent transition still occurs, but is short
lived, as the turbulent state quickly collapses. In addition, for $H \geq 3$,
an inertial subrange is identified, with the perturbation energy exhibiting a
$-5/3$ power law dependence on wave number.

interpretation and in the use of forecast systems and their development.
Probabilistic scores (scoring rules) provide statistical measures to assess the
quality of probabilistic forecasts. Often, many probabilistic forecast systems
are available while evaluations of their performance are not standardized, with
different scoring rules being used to measure different aspects of forecast
performance. Even when the discussion is restricted to strictly proper scoring
rules, there remains considerable variability between them; indeed strictly
proper scoring rules need not rank competing forecast systems in the same order
when none of these systems are perfect. The locality property is explored to
further distinguish scoring rules. The nonlocal strictly proper scoring rules
considered are shown to have a property that can produce ""unfortunate""
evaluations. Particularly the fact that Continuous Rank Probability Score
prefers the outcome close to the median of the forecast distribution regardless
the probability mass assigned to the value at/near the median raises concern to
its use. The only local strictly proper scoring rules, the logarithmic score,
has direct interpretations in terms of probabilities and bits of information.
The nonlocal strictly proper scoring rules, on the other hand, lack meaningful
direct interpretation for decision support. The logarithmic score is also shown
to be invariant under smooth transformation of the forecast variable, while the
nonlocal strictly proper scoring rules considered may, however, change their
preferences due to the transformation. It is therefore suggested that the
logarithmic score always be included in the evaluation of probabilistic
forecasts.

machine learning models, by developing a novel ML framework -- small-group
learning (SGL). In our framework, a group of learners (ML models) with
different model architectures collaboratively help each other to learn by
leveraging their complementary advantages. Specifically, each learner uses its
intermediately trained model to generate a pseudo-labeled dataset and re-trains
its model using pseudo-labeled datasets generated by other learners. SGL is
formulated as a multi-level optimization framework consisting of three learning
stages: each learner trains a model independently and uses this model to
perform pseudo-labeling; each learner trains another model using datasets
pseudo-labeled by other learners; learners improve their architectures by
minimizing validation losses. An efficient algorithm is developed to solve the
multi-level optimization problem. We apply SGL for neural architecture search.
Results on CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

spatially to form cities. In a world of diminishing transport costs, however,
the advantage of physical proximity is fading, and the role of cities in the
economy may be declining. To provide insights into the long-run evolution of
cities, we analyzed Japan's census data over the 1970--2015 period. We found
that fewer and larger cities thrived at the national scale, suggesting an
eventual mono-centric economy with a single megacity; simultaneously, each
larger city flattened out at the local scale, suggesting an eventual extinction
of cities. We interpret this multi-scale phenomenon as an instance of pattern
formation by self-organization, which is widely studied in mathematics and
biology. However, cities' dynamics are distinct from mathematical or biological
mechanisms because they are governed by economic interactions mediated by
transport costs between locations. Our results call for the synthesis of
knowledge in mathematics, biology, and economics to open the door for a general
pattern formation theory that is applicable to socioeconomic phenomena.

of waves with up-ward and down-ward frequency chirping across the full range of

appropriate initialisation for the system, full-scale modelling is implemented
using the bump-on-tail (BOT) code. In addition to investigating the evolution
of chirping waves with deepening potentials in a single resonance, we choose
specific pitch-angle ranges in which higher resonances can have a relatively
considerable contribution to the wave-particle interaction. Hence, the model is
also solved in a double-resonance scenario where we report on the significant

be challenging, especially when the two coding systems are significantly
different. The US experienced such a transition in 2015. Objective: This
research aims to introduce entropic measures to help users prepare for the
migration to a new medical coding system by identifying and focusing
preparation initiatives on clinical concepts with more likelihood of transition
challenges. Methods: Two entropic measures of coding complexity are introduced.
The first measure is a function of the variation in the alphabets of new codes.
The second measure is based on the possible number of valid representations of
an old code. Results: A demonstration of how to implement the proposed
techniques is carried out using the 2015 mappings between ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM/PCS. The significance of the resulting entropic measures is discussed
in the context of clinical concepts that were likely to pose challenges
regarding documentation, coding errors, and longitudinal data comparisons.
Conclusion: The proposed entropic techniques are suitable to assess the
complexity between any two medical coding systems where mappings or crosswalks
exist. The more the entropy, the more likelihood of transition challenges.
Users can utilize the suggested techniques as a guide to prioritize training
efforts to improve documentation and increase the chances of accurate coding,
code validity, and longitudinal data comparisons.

electron-nuclear (hyperfine) spin coupling and transfer. In this work we show
that, for systems of electronic spin $S\geq1$ possessing an intrinsic

on lab-frame cross relaxation may be utilised to improve DNP efficiency and
yield, whilst operating at moderate fields. We analytically review existing

transfer to the nuclear ensemble by up to an order of magnitude over existing

to leverage the semantic information of categories for improving multi-label

take semantic information as type of complements for visual representation
without further exploitation. In this paper, we present an innovative path
towards the solution of the multi-label image classification which considers it
as a dictionary learning task. A novel end-to-end model named Deep Semantic

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with label embeddings. The DSDL provides a
simple but elegant way to exploit and reconcile the label, semantic and visual

Moreover, inspired by iterative optimization of traditional dictionary
learning, we further devise a novel training strategy named Alternately
Parameters Update Strategy (APUS) for optimizing DSDL, which alternately
optimizes the representation coefficients and the semantic dictionary in
forward and backward propagation. Extensive experimental results on three
popular benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves promising performances

sAmpling (SABRA), a robust VRD framework that alleviates the influence of false

SABRA adopts Balanced Negative Proposal Sampling (BNPS) strategy for mini-batch
sampling. BNPS divides proposals into 5 well defined sub-classes and generates
a balanced training distribution according to the inverse frequency. BNPS gives
an easier optimization landscape and significantly reduces the number of false

proposals with high spatial ambiguity, we improve the spatial modeling ability

consider a disk structure in which the midplane turbulence viscosity is
increasing with radius in protoplanetary disks as in the outer region of a dead
zone. We perform 1D diffusion-advection simulations of pebbles that include
back-reaction (the inertia) to radial drift and vertical/radial diffusion of
pebbles for a given pebble-to-gas mass flux. We report a new mechanism, the
""no-drift"" runaway pile-up, leading to a runaway accumulation of pebbles in
disks, thus favoring the formation of planetesimals by streaming and/or
gravitational instabilities. This occurs when pebbles drifting in from the
outer disk and entering a dead zone experience a decrease in vertical
turbulence. The scale height of the pebble subdisk then decreases, and for
small enough values of the turbulence in the dead zone and high values of the
pebble to gas flux ratio, the back-reaction of pebbles on gas leads to a
significant decrease in their drift velocity and thus their progressive
accumulation. This occurs when the ratio of the flux of pebbles to that of the
gas is large enough so that the effect dominates over any Kelvin-Helmholtz
shear instability. This process is independent of the existence of a pressure
bump.

shortcomings of center loss and solved all of them by proposing a dual distance
center loss (DDCL). Especially we solve the shortcoming that center loss must

us with a new perspective to examine the center loss. In addition, we verify
the inconsistency between the proposed DDCL and softmax loss in the feature
space, which makes the center loss no longer be limited by the softmax loss in
the feature space after removing the softmax loss. To be specifically, we add
the Pearson distance on the basis of the Euclidean distance to the same center,
which makes all features of the same class be confined to the intersection of a
hypersphere and a hypercube in the feature space. The proposed Pearson distance
strengthens the intra-class compactness of the center loss and enhances the
generalization ability of center loss. Moreover, by designing a Euclidean
distance threshold between all center pairs, which not only strengthens the
inter-class separability of center loss, but also makes the center loss (or

stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk has been
considered as one of the plausible candidates of GRB central engines. In this
paper, we work on a sample including 146 long GRBs with significant jet break
features in the multi-band afterglows. The jet opening angles can be then
obtained by the jet break time. By asumming GRB jets powered by
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism in the BH hyperaccretion system, we analyze the
distributions of the long GRB luminosities and durations in the samples, and
constrain the accretion rates for the different BH spins. As the results, we
find that the BZ mechanism is so powerful making it possible to interpret the
long GRB prompt emissions within the reasonably accretion rates.

infrastructures, such as smart grids, nuclear plants, water systems,

However, the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks targeting them raises a
growing security concern in the domain. In particular, memory-safety attacks,
that exploit memory-safety vulnerabilities, constitute a major attack vector
against real-time control devices in CPS. Traditional IT countermeasures
against such attacks have limitations when applied to the CPS context: they
typically incur in high runtime overheads; which conflicts with real-time
constraints in CPS and they often abort the program when an attack is detected,
thus harming availability of the system, which in turn can potentially result
in damage to the physical world. In this work, we propose to enforce a
full-stack memory-safety (covering user-space and kernel-space attack surfaces)
based on secure compiling of PLCs to detect memory-safety attacks in CPS.
Furthermore, to ensure availability, we enforce a resilient mitigation
technique that bypasses illegal memory access instructions at runtime by
dynamically instrumenting low-level code. We empirically measure the

sensitivity, diffraction of the laser light has to be adequately considered.
There are two kinds of diffraction loss: leakage loss outside the mirror and
higher-order mode loss. These effects are treated differently inside and
outside of the Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity. We estimated them under the conditions
that the FP cavity has a relatively high finesse and the higher-order modes do
not resonate. As a result, we found that the effects can be represented as a
reduction of the effective finesse of the cavity with regard to quantum noise.
This result is useful for optimization of the design of DECIGO. This method is

constructing a pixel-by-pixel color mapping model, which only depends on one

between image datasets. In principle, this style transformation can be well
solved by the deep learning-based methods due to its complicated network
structure, whereas, its complicated structure results in the low computational
efficiency and artifacts in the style transformation, which has restricted the
practical application. Here, we use distillation learning to reduce the
complexity of deep learning methods and a fast and robust network called
StainNet to learn the color mapping between the source image and target image.
StainNet can learn the color mapping relationship from a whole dataset and
adjust the color value in a pixel-to-pixel manner. The pixel-to-pixel manner
restricts the network size and avoids artifacts in the style transformation.
The results on the cytopathology and histopathology datasets show that StainNet

studied in 2D, but a 3D theory is still lacking. Motivated by recent
experiments, we develop a scaling theory for the metal-insulator transitions in
the strong-magnetic-field quantum limit of a 3D system. By using a
renormalization-group calculation to treat electron-electron interactions,
electron-phonon interactions, and disorder on the same footing, we obtain the
critical exponent that characterizes the scaling relations of the resistivity
to temperature and magnetic field. By comparing the critical exponent with
those in a recent experiment [F. Tang et al., Nature (London) 569, 537 (2019)],
we conclude that the insulating ground state was not only a charge-density wave
driven by electron-phonon interactions but also coexisting with strong
electron-electron interactions and backscattering disorder. We also propose a
current-scaling experiment for further verification. Our theory will be helpful
for exploring the emergent territory of 3D metal-insulator transitions under
strong magnetic fields.

anisotropies due to both the electromagnetic force and gravitational
interaction. In this paper, we investigate how the PMFs affect the CMB
anisotropies on smaller scales than the mean-free-path of the CMB photons. We
solve the baryon Euler equation with Lorentz force due to the PMFs, and we show
that the vector-type perturbations from the PMFs induce the CMB anisotropies
below the Silk scale as $\ell>3000$. Based on our calculations, we put a
constraint on the PMFs from the combined CMB temperature anisotropies obtained
by Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT). We have found that the
highly-resolved temperature anisotropies of the SPT 2017 bandpowers at $\ell
\lesssim 8000$ favor the PMF model with a small scale-dependence. As a result,
the Planck and SPT's joint-analysis puts a constraint on the PMF spectral index
as $n_B<-1.14$ at 95% confidence level (C.L.), and this is more stringent
compared with the Planck-only constraint $n_B<-0.28$. We show that the PMF
strength normalized on the co-moving 1 Mpc scale is also tightly constrained as
$B_{1\mathrm{Mpc}}<1.5$ nG with Planck and SPT at 95% C.L., while
$B_{1\mathrm{Mpc}}<3.2$ nG only with the Planck data at 95% C.L. We also

semantic segmentation, which aims to segment the unlabeled real data using
labeled synthetic data. The main problem of UDA for semantic segmentation
relies on reducing the domain gap between the real image and synthetic image.
To solve this problem, we focused on separating information in an image into
content and style. Here, only the content has cues for semantic segmentation,
and the style makes the domain gap. Thus, precise separation of content and
style in an image leads to effect as supervision of real data even when
learning with synthetic data. To make the best of this effect, we propose a
zero-style loss. Even though we perfectly extract content for semantic
segmentation in the real domain, another main challenge, the class imbalance
problem, still exists in UDA for semantic segmentation. We address this problem
by transferring the contents of tail classes from synthetic to real domain.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation on the major two UDA
settings.

essential technique for enhancing throughput in future cellular networks. This
method requires global channel state information (CSI) at the processing unit
that designs the joint precoder. To this end, a large amount of CSI must be
shared between the RRHs and that unit. This paper proposes two contributions.
The first is a new upper bound on the rate loss, which implies a lower bound on
the achievable rate, obtained by a cluster of RRHs that employ joint
zero-forcing (ZF) with incomplete CSI. The second contribution, which follows
insights from the bound, is a new CSI sharing scheme that drastically reduces
the large overhead associated with acquiring global CSI for joint transmission.
In a nutshell, each RRH applies a local precoding matrix that creates
low-dimensional effective channels that can be quantized more accurately with
fewer bits, thereby reducing the overhead of sharing CSI. In addition to the
CSI sharing-overhead, this scheme reduces the data rate that must be delivered
to each RRH in the cluster.

before any transaction has taken place, as an immediate reaction to the arrival
of a large (i.e., ""block"") buy or sell order in the market: e.g., traders in
the market know that a block buy order will push the price up, and so they
immediately adjust their quote-prices upwards. Most major financial markets now
involve many ""robot traders"", autonomous adaptive software agents, rather than
humans. This paper explores how to give such trader-agents a reliable
anticipatory sensitivity to block orders, such that markets populated entirely
by robot traders also show market-impact effects. In a 2019 publication Church
& Cliff presented initial results from a simple deterministic robot trader,
ISHV, which exhibits this market impact effect via monitoring a metric of
imbalance between supply and demand in the market. The novel contributions of
our paper are: (a) we critique the methods used by Church & Cliff, revealing
them to be weak, and argue that a more robust measure of imbalance is required;
(b) we argue for the use of multi-level order-flow imbalance (MLOFI: Xu et al.,
2019) as a better basis for imbalance-sensitive robot trader-agents; and (c) we
demonstrate the use of the more robust MLOFI measure in extending ISHV, and
also the well-known AA and ZIP trading-agent algorithms (which have both been
previously shown to consistently outperform human traders). We demonstrate that
the new imbalance-sensitive trader-agents introduced here do exhibit market
impact effects, and hence are better-suited to operating in markets where
impact is a factor of concern or interest, but do not suffer the weaknesses of
the methods used by Church & Cliff. The source-code for our work reported here

functionals of both models are denoted by $E_{\varepsilon,\delta}$, where
$\varepsilon$ represent the coherence length (in the Ginzburg-Landau model) or
the core-radius size (in the core-radius approach) and $\delta$ denotes the

$E_{\varepsilon,\delta}$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and
$\delta=\delta_{\varepsilon}\to 0$ in the $|\log\varepsilon|$ scaling regime,
showing that the $\Gamma$-limit consists in the energy cost of finitely many
vortex-like point singularities of integer degree. After introducing the scale
parameter (upon extraction of subsequences) $$
\lambda=\min\Bigl\{1,\lim_{\varepsilon\to0} {|\log

plasticity is a major challenge of materials science.During the last two
decades such a theory has been developed for the time evolution of a system of
parallel edge dislocations. The evolution equations were derived by a
systematic coarse-graining of the equations of motion of the individual
dislocations and later retrieved from a functional of the dislocation densities
and the stress potential by applying the standard formalism of phase field
theories. It is, however, a long standing issue if a similar procedure can be
established for curved dislocation systems. An important prerequisite for such
a theory has recently been established through a density-based kinematic theory
of moving curves. In this paper, an approach is presented for a systematic
derivation of the dynamics of systems of curved dislocations in a single slip
situation. In order to reduce the complexity of the problem a dipole like
approximation for the orientation dependent density variables is applied. This
leads to a closed set of kinematic evolution equations of total dislocation
density, the GND densities, and the so-called curvature density. The analogy of
the resulting equations with the edge dislocation model allows one to
generalize the phase field formalism and to obtain a closed set of dynamic
evolution equations.

Here, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network for Distribution Analysis

automatically by 27 775 patches of tumor vessels and cell nuclei decomposed

conditionally generate images of intratumoral QDs distribution under the
constraint of given tumor vessels and cell nuclei channels with the same
spatial resolution (pixels-to-pixels), minimal loss (mean squared error, MSE =
1.871) and excellent reliability (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.94).
Quantitative analysis of QDs extravasation distance (ICC = 0.95) and subarea
distribution (ICC = 0.99) is allowed on the generated images without knowing
the real QDs distribution. We believe this deep generative model may provide
opportunities to investigate how influencing factors affect NPs distribution in
individual tumors and guide nanomedicine optimization for molecular imaging and

segmentation has shown great progress by domain-invariant feature learning or
image appearance translation. Adapted feature learning usually cannot detect
domain shifts at the pixel level and is not able to achieve good results in
dense semantic segmentation tasks. Image appearance translation, e.g. CycleGAN,
translates images into different styles with good appearance, despite its
population, its semantic consistency is hardly to maintain and results in poor
cross-modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose intra- and
cross-modality semantic consistency (ICMSC) for UDA and our key insight is that
the segmentation of synthesised images in different styles should be
consistent. Specifically, our model consists of an image translation module and
a domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a
standard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module contains two domain-specific
segmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) forces
the reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same way as the
original input image, while the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC)
encourages the synthesized images after translation to be segmented exactly the
same as before translation. Comprehensive experimental results on
cross-modality hip joint bone segmentation show the effectiveness of our
proposed method, which achieves an average DICE of 81.61% on the acetabulum and
88.16% on the proximal femur, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It
is worth to note that without UDA, a model trained on CT for hip joint bone
segmentation is non-transferable to MRI and has almost zero-DICE segmentation.

instance that avoids one pattern, it is observed that other patterns emerge.
For example, repetition emerges when avoiding arithmetic progression (Van der
Waerden numbers), while reflection emerges when avoiding monochromatic
solutions of $a+b=c$ (Schur numbers). We exploit observed patterns when
coloring a grid while avoiding monochromatic rectangles. Like many problems in
Ramsey Theory, this problem has a rapidly growing search space that makes
computer search difficult. Steinbach et al. obtained a solution of an 18 by 18
grid with 4 colors by enforcing a rotation symmetry. However, that symmetry is
not suitable for 5 colors.
  In this article, we will encode this problem into propositional logic and
enforce so-called internal symmetries, which preserves satisfiability, to guide
SAT-solving. We first observe patterns with 2 and 3 colors, among which the
""shift pattern"" can be easily generalized and efficiently encoded. Using this
pattern, we obtain a new solution of the 18 by 18 grid that is non-isomorphic
to the known solution. We further analyze the pattern and obtain necessary
conditions to further trim down the search space. We conclude with our attempts
on finding a 5-coloring of a 26 by 26 grid, as well as further open problems on

an optical vortex to vector fields with high efficiency and be utilized to
precisely measure the topological charge (both absolute value and sign) of an

versatile tool to generate, manipulate and detect the spin-orbital state of
single photons, PIP can also work in single-photon regime for quantum

Controlled-Not gate on the generated 28 two-qubit states, achieving the state

classified the presence of 3 code smells (Long Method, God Class, and Feature

generated and evaluated to determine which machine learning algorithms had the
best performance in detecting each of the aforementioned code smells. Good
performances were obtained for God Class detection (ROC=0.896 for Naive Bayes)

Feature Envy (ROC=0.570 for Random Forrest). Obtained results suggest that
crowdsmelling is a feasible approach for the detection of code smells, but
further validation experiments are required to cover more code smells and to

Josephson effect exists without the proximity effect. The theory takes into
account restrictions imposed by the charge conservation law and the
incommensurability of the superconducting gap with the Andreev level energy
spacing. This resulted in revisions of some conclusions of previous works. In
the one-dimensional case the Josephson phase of the ground state of the
ballistic SNS sandwich is not necessarily zero but may have any value from 0 to
$\pi$. If this value is $\pi$ this is a $\pi$ junction, which was well known
before. The suppression of the supercurrent at temperatures on the order or
higher than the Andreev level energy spacing, which was predicted in previous
investigations, does not take place in the one-dimensional case.
  At zero temperature the ballistic SNS sandwich of any dimensionality is not a
weak link. This leads to unusual properties: the absence of the Josephson
plasma mode localized at the normal layer and the Meisner effect with the same
London penetration depth in the normal and the superconducting layers.

ML models/algorithms. Central to this drive is the appeal of engineering a
computational system that both discovers and deploys high-performance solutions
to arbitrary ML problems with minimal human interaction. Beyond this, an even
loftier goal is the pursuit of autonomy, which describes the capability of the
system to independently adjust an ML solution over a lifetime of changing
contexts. However, these ambitions are unlikely to be achieved in a robust
manner without the broader synthesis of various mechanisms and theoretical
frameworks, which, at the present time, remain scattered across numerous
research threads. Accordingly, this review seeks to motivate a more expansive
perspective on what constitutes an automated/autonomous ML system, alongside
consideration of how best to consolidate those elements. In doing so, we survey
developments in the following research areas: hyperparameter optimisation,
multi-component models, neural architecture search, automated feature
engineering, meta-learning, multi-level ensembling, dynamic adaptation,
multi-objective evaluation, resource constraints, flexible user involvement,
and the principles of generalisation. We also develop a conceptual framework
throughout the review, augmented by each topic, to illustrate one possible way
of fusing high-level mechanisms into an autonomous ML system. Ultimately, we
conclude that the notion of architectural integration deserves more discussion,
without which the field of automated ML risks stifling both its technical
advantages and general uptake.

  doping","20 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Metasurfaces based on subwavelength resonators enable novel ways to
manipulate the flow of light at optical interfaces. In pursuit of
multifunctional or reconfigurable metadevices, efficient tuning of macroscopic
performance with little structural/material variation remains a challenge.
Here, we put forward the concept of non-Hermitian doping in metasurfaces,
showing that an ordinary retroreflector can be switched to asymmetric one by
introducing absorptive defects in local regions. The asymmetric absorption
performance begins with zero at the Hermitian state, gradually increases under
non-Hermitian doping, and reaches the maximum of unity at the exceptional
point. This effect is experimentally demonstrated at microwave frequencies via
the observation of asymmetric near-field distribution and far-field scattering
properties and from a planar metasurface. Furthermore, while importing local
gain constituents in conventional retroreflector, it can be tuned to an
extremely asymmetric one-side amplifier, extending unidirectional amplification
from one-dimensional waveguide to two-dimensional scattering systems. The
proposed methodology provides an alternative pathway for engineering
electromagnetic metadevices and systems with small perturbations. Introduction

tools can be used. However, such tools to a large degree hard-code how the

of many attacks. To counter this problem, we propose the novel concept of
flexible obfuscators, which implement protections in terms of data structures
and APIs already present in the application to be protected. The protections
are hence tailored to the application in which they are deployed, making them
less learnable and less distinguishable. In our research, we concretized the
flexible protection concept for opaque predicates. We designed an interface to
enable the reuse of existing data structures and APIs in injected opaque
predicates, we analyzed their resilience and stealth, we implemented a
proof-of-concept flexible obfuscator, and we evaluated it on a number of
real-world use cases. This paper presents an in-depth motivation for our work,
the design of the interface, an in-depth security analysis, and a feasibility
report based on our experimental evaluation. The findings are that flexible
opaque predicates indeed provide strong resilience and improved stealth, but
also that their deployment is costly, and that they should hence be used
sparsely to protect only the most security-sensitive code fragments that do not
dominate performance. Flexible obfuscation therefor delivers an expensive but
also more durable new weapon in the ever ongoing software protection arms race.

(where constraints are arbitrary non-negative functions), Romero, Wrochna, and
\v{Z}ivn\'y [SODA'21] showed that the Sherali-Adams LP relaxation gives a

to general-valued CSPs, which include ""crisp"" (or ""strict"") constraints that
have to be satisfied by every feasible assignment. The only condition on the
crisp constraints is that their domain contains an element which is at least as

possibly for fractionally-treewidth-fragile classes. While this is standard for
problems satisfying a certain monotonicity condition on crisp constraints, we

finished immediately and thus ignoring the price slippage as part of the
trading cost. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical reinforced
stock trading system for portfolio management (HRPM). Concretely, we decompose
the trading process into a hierarchy of portfolio management over trade
execution and train the corresponding policies. The high-level policy gives
portfolio weights at a lower frequency to maximize the long term profit and
invokes the low-level policy to sell or buy the corresponding shares within a
short time window at a higher frequency to minimize the trading cost. We train
two levels of policies via pre-training scheme and iterative training scheme
for data efficiency. Extensive experimental results in the U.S. market and the
China market demonstrate that HRPM achieves significant improvement against
many state-of-the-art approaches.

of the Magellanic Stellar History. With only one exception, the studied objects
resulted to be genuine stellar aggregates. We conclude on their physical
reality once their observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) were statistically
decontaminated by the presence of field stars, and the resulting cleaned CMDs
for stars with assigned membership probabilities higher than 50\% were compared
with synthetic CMDs generated for thousand combinations of ages, distances,
metallicities, star cluster mass and binary fractions. The parameter of the
best-matched synthetic CMDs obtained from a likelihood approach were adopted as
the star cluster astrophysical properties. The present star cluster sample
spans a wide range of distances, from those star clusters located in front of
the LMC, to those along the onset of the Magellanic Bridge, up to those behind
the SMC. Their ages reveal different formation episodes that took place along
the galaxy formation and others as a consequence of the galaxy interactions.
From their estimated metallicities and ages, we speculate with the possibility
that relatively metal-deficient gaseous flows have existed between these
galaxies during nearly the last one Gyr (log(age /yr) $\approx$ 9.0), that made
possible the formation of young star clusters in the galaxy peripheries.
Despide the L/SMC interactions, the studied star clusters are similar or more
massive than their counterparts in the Milky Way, which suggests that tidal
effects are relatively more important in our Galaxy.

Here, by reducing the coupling between the topological surface states (TSS) and
the bulk carriers we controllably tune the LMR behavior in Pt1-xAuxLuSb into
distinct plateaus in Hall resistance, which we show arise from a quantum Hall
phase. This allowed us to reveal how smearing of the Landau levels, which
otherwise give rise to a quantum Hall phase, results in an LMR behavior due to
strong interaction between the TSS with a positive g-factor and the bulk
carriers. We establish that controlling the coupling strength between the

changes in their magnetotransport behavior. In addition, our work outlines a
strategy to reveal macroscopic physical observables of TSS in compounds with a

However, forecasting accuracy is hindered by limited CME observations in

at the Earth forecasted by three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations based on interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations. In this
system, CMEs are approximated as spheromaks with various initial speeds. Ten
MHD simulations with different CME initial speed are tested, and the density
distributions derived from each simulation run are compared with IPS data
observed by the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya
University. The CME arrival time of the simulation run that most closely agrees
with the IPS data is selected as the forecasted time. We then validate the
accuracy of this forecast using 12 halo CME events. The average absolute
arrival-time error of the IPS-based MHD forecast is approximately 5.0 h, which
is one of the most accurate predictions that ever been validated, whereas that
of MHD simulations without IPS data, in which the initial CME speed is derived
from white-light coronagraph images, is approximately 6.7 h. This suggests that
the assimilation of IPS data into MHD simulations can improve the accuracy of
CME arrival-time forecasts. The average predicted arrival times are earlier
than the actual arrival times. These early predictions may be due to
overestimation of the magnetic field included in the spheromak and/or
underestimation of the drag force from the background solar wind, the latter of
which could be related to underestimation of CME size or background solar wind
density.

we propose a simple, energy-conserving model describing this situation. It
consists of a 2D point-vortex flow coupled to localized 3D perturbations
(ergophages), such that ergophages can gain energy by altering vortex-vortex
distances through an induced divergent velocity field, thus decreasing
point-vortex energy. We investigate the model in three distinct stages of
evolution: (i) The linear regime, where the ergophage amplitude grows or decays
exponentially on average, with a randomly fluctuating instantaneous growth
rate. The growth rate has a small auto-correlation time, and follows a
probability distribution featuring a power-law tail with exponent between -2
and -5/3 (up to a cut-off), depending on the point-vortex base flow.
Consequently, the logarithmic ergophage amplitude performs a free L\'evy
flight. (ii) The passive-nonlinear regime of the model, where the 2D flow
evolves independently of the ergophage amplitudes, which saturate by non-linear

which a proposition is replaced by one stating the opposite, as by the addition
of ""not"" or another negation cue. Treating negation in an adequate way is
required for cognitive reasoning, which aims at modeling the human ability to
draw meaningful conclusions despite incomplete and inconsistent knowledge. One
task of cognitive reasoning is answering questions given by sentences in
natural language. There are tools based on discourse representation theory to
convert sentences automatically into a formal logic representation, and
additional knowledge can be added using the predicate names in the formula and
knowledge databases. However, the knowledge in logic databases in practice
always is incomplete. Hence, forward reasoning of automated reasoning systems
alone does not suffice to derive answers to questions because, instead of
complete proofs, often only partial positive knowledge can be derived, while
negative knowledge is used only during the reasoning process. In consequence,
we aim at eliminating syntactic negation, strictly speaking, the negated event
or property. In this paper, we describe an effective procedure to determine the
negated event or property in order to replace it by its inverse. This lays the
basis of cognitive reasoning, employing both logic and machine learning for
general question answering. We evaluate our procedure by several benchmarks and
demonstrate its practical usefulness in our cognitive reasoning system.

Different from indoor scenes, where the room space is delineated by clear
boundaries and separations (e.g., walls and furniture), an outdoor environment
is spacious and unbounded (thinking of a campus). Therefore, unlike for indoor
scenes where the scanning effort is mainly devoted to the discovery of boundary
surfaces, scanning an open and unbounded area requires actively delimiting the
extent of scanning region and dynamically planning a traverse path within that
region. Thus, for outdoor scenes, we formulate the planning of an
energy-efficient autonomous scanning through a discrete-continuous optimization
of robot scanning paths. The discrete optimization computes a topological map,
through solving an online traveling sales problem (Online TSP), which
determines the scanning goals and paths on-the-fly. The dynamic goals are
determined as a collection of visit sites with high reward of
visibility-to-unknown. A visit graph is constructed via connecting the visit
sites with edges weighted by traversing cost. This topological map evolves as
the robot scans via deleting outdated sites that are either visited or become
rewardless and inserting newly discovered ones. The continuous part optimizes
the traverse paths geometrically between two neighboring visit sites via
maximizing the information gain of scanning along the paths. The discrete and
continuous processes alternate until the traverse cost of the current graph
exceeds the remaining energy capacity of the robot. Our approach is evaluated
with both synthetic and field tests, demonstrating its effectiveness and
advantages over alternatives. The project is at

propitious implementations of quantum computing on near-term devices, offering
classical machine learning support to quantum scale solution spaces. However,
numerous studies have demonstrated that the rate at which this space grows in
qubit number could preclude learning in deep quantum circuits, a phenomenon
known as barren plateaus. In this work, we implicate random entanglement as the
source of barren plateaus and characterize them in terms of many-body
entanglement dynamics, detailing their formation as a function of system size,
circuit depth, and circuit connectivity. Using this comprehension of
entanglement, we propose and demonstrate a number of barren plateau
ameliorating techniques, including: initial partitioning of cost function and
non-cost function registers, meta-learning of low-entanglement circuit
initializations, selective inter-register interaction, entanglement
regularization, the addition of Langevin noise, and rotation into preferred
cost function eigenbases. We find that entanglement limiting, both automatic
and engineered, is a hallmark of high-accuracy training, and emphasize that as
learning is an iterative organization process while barren plateaus are a
consequence of randomization, they are not necessarily unavoidable or
inescapable. Our work forms both a theoretical characterization and a practical
toolbox; first defining barren plateaus in terms of random entanglement and
then employing this expertise to strategically combat them.

the gauge-dependent paramagnetic current density appears as the additional

reinterpret and clarify Diener's formulation based on a maximin variational

resonators. We obtain analytical results for the effective susceptibilities,
noise spectra, final mean phonon numbers, and cooling rates of these mechanical

Particularly, we analyze a two-mechanical-resonator case and find that by
appropriately engineering either the laser power or the feedback, a flexible
switch between symmetric and asymmetric ground-state cooling can be achieved.
This could be used for preparing symmetric quantum states in mechanical
systems. We also simulate the cooling performance of a coupled

simultaneously cooled to their quantum ground states in the unresolved-sideband

parameters $\theta$ of a model that is assumed to have given rise to the

distribution, representing uncertainty about $\theta$ after seeing the dataset.
Bayesian inference is a prime example of such a procedure, but one can also
construct other learning procedures that return distributional output. This
paper studies conditions for a learning procedure to be considered calibrated,
in the sense that the true data-generating parameters are plausible as samples
from its distributional output. A learning procedure whose inferences and
predictions are systematically over- or under-confident will fail to be
calibrated. On the other hand, a learning procedure that is calibrated need not
be statistically efficient. A hypothesis-testing framework is developed in
order to assess, using simulation, whether a learning procedure is calibrated.
Several vignettes are presented to illustrate different aspects of the
framework.

for transient and variable objects, covering a wide wavelength range from 350
to 2000 nm. SOXS is equipped with a calibration unit that will be used to
remove the instrument signatures and to provide wavelength calibration to the
data. The calibration unit will employ seven calibration lamps: a
quartz-tungsten-halogen and a deuterium lamp for the flat-field correction, a
ThAr lamp and four pencil-style rare-gas lamps for the wavelength calibration.
The light from the calibration lamps is injected into the spectrograph
mimicking the f/11 input beam of the NTT, by using an integrating sphere and a
custom doublet. The oversized illumination patch covers the length of the
spectrograph slit homogeneously, with $< 1\%$ variation. The optics also
supports the second mode of the unit, the star-simulator mode that emulates a
point source by utilizing a pinhole mask. Switching between the direct
illumination and pinhole modes is performed by a linear stage. A safety
interlock switches off the main power when the lamp box cover is removed,
preventing accidental UV exposure to the service personnel. All power supplies
and control modules are located in an electronic rack at a distance from the
telescope platform. In this presentation we describe the optical, mechanical,
and electrical designs of the SOXS calibration unit, and report the status of

approaches to estimate neural uncertainties are often hybrid, combining
parametric models with explicit or implicit (dropout-based) ensembling. We take
another pathway and propose a novel approach to uncertainty quantification for
regression tasks, Wasserstein dropout, that is purely non-parametric.
Technically, it captures aleatoric uncertainty by means of dropout-based
sub-network distributions. This is accomplished by a new objective which
minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the label distribution and the model
distribution. An extensive empirical analysis shows that Wasserstein dropout
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, on vanilla test data as well as under

formulate the problem at hand as a multiple-hypothesis test that, besides the

epidemics have become increasingly important, and combining information of
country-specific datasets can now reveal unknown spreading patterns. The

the distance calculation, distance correction, inference algorithm, and local
optimization steps. There are many phylogenetic tools out there, however most
implement only some of these steps and serve only one single purpose, such as
one type of algorithm. Another problem with these is that they are often hard
to use and integrate, since each of them has its own API. This project resulted
a library that implements the four steps of the workflow, and is highly
performant, extensible, reusable, and portable, while providing common APIs and

to stop and resume the workflow whenever the user desires, and it was built to
be continuously extended and not just serve a single purpose. The time
benchmarks conducted on this library show that its implementations of the

offering a wide simultaneous spectral coverage from U- to H-band, built by an
international consortium for the 3.6-m ESO New Technology Telescope at the La
Silla Observatory, in the Southern part of the Chilean Atacama Desert. The
consortium is focussed on a clear scientific goal: the spectrograph will
observe all kind of transient and variable sources discovered by different
surveys with a highly flexible schedule, updated daily, based on the Target of
Opportunity concept. It will provide a key spectroscopic partner to any kind of
imaging survey, becoming one of the premier transient follow-up instruments in
the Southern hemisphere. SOXS will study a mixture of transients encompassing
all distance scales and branches of astronomy, including fast alerts (such as
gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves), mid-term alerts (such as supernovae
and X-ray transients), and fixed-time events (such as the close-by passage of a
minor planet or exoplanets). It will also have the scope to observe active
galactic nuclei and blazars, tidal disruption events, fast radio bursts, and
more. Besides of the consortium programs on guaranteed time, the instrument is
offered to the ESO community for any kind of astrophysical target. The project
has passed the Final Design Review and is currently in manufacturing and
integration phase. This paper describes the development status of the project.

a quantum description of the interaction between the system of interest and the

Uncertainty relations are a general term for relations that provide constraints
on them, and actively studied. However, the true error-disturbance bound for
position measurements is not known yet. Here we concretely construct linear
position measurements with minimum error-disturbance in each minimum
uncertainty state. We focus on an error-disturbance relation (EDR), called the
Branciard-Ozawa EDR, for position measurements. It is based on a quantum
root-mean-square (q-rms) error and a q-rms disturbance. We show the theorem
that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear position
measurement to achieve its lower bound in a minimum uncertainty state, and
explicitly give exactly solvable linear position measurements achieving its
lower bound in the state. We then give probability distributions and states
after the measurement when using them. It is expected to construct measurements
with minimum error-disturbance in a broader class of states in the future,
which will lead to a new understanding of quantum limits, including uncertainty
relations.

last years have ground-truth labels intended for different computer vision
tasks, suggesting that performance in automated chest-xray interpretation might
improve by using a method that can exploit diverse types of annotations. This
work presents a Deep Learning method based on the late fusion of different
convolutional architectures, that allows training with heterogeneous data with
a simple implementation, and evaluates its performance on independent test
data. We focused on obtaining a clinically useful tool that could be
successfully integrated into a hospital workflow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based
on expert opinion, we selected four target chest x-ray findings, namely lung
opacities, fractures, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. For each finding we
defined the most adequate type of ground-truth label, and built four training
datasets combining images from public chest x-ray datasets and our
institutional archive. We trained four different Deep Learning architectures
and combined their outputs with a late fusion strategy, obtaining a unified
tool. Performance was measured on two test datasets: an external
openly-available dataset, and a retrospective institutional dataset, to
estimate performance on local population. RESULTS: The external and local test
sets had 4376 and 1064 images, respectively, for which the model showed an area
under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of 0.75 (95%CI: 0.74-0.76)
and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.86-0.89) in the detection of abnormal chest x-rays. For the
local population, a sensitivity of 86% (95%CI: 84-90), and a specificity of 88%
(95%CI: 86-90) were obtained, with no significant differences between
demographic subgroups. We present examples of heatmaps to show the accomplished
level of interpretability, examining true and false positives.

the analysis of Brownian dynamics both in theory and experiment despite the
applicability of general cases with definite mass. Considering mass explicitly
in the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation and Langevin dynamics
simulations, we investigate how inertia can change the dynamics and energetics
of the Brownian gyrator. In the Langevin model, the inertia reduces the
nonequilibrium effects by diminishing the declination of the probability
density function and the mean of a specific angular momentum, $j_\theta$, as a
measure of rotation. Another unique feature of the Langevin description is that
rotation is maximized at a particular anisotropy while the stability of the
rotation is minimized at a particular anisotropy or mass. Our results suggest
that the Langevin dynamics description of the Brownian gyrator is intrinsically
different from that with Brownian dynamics. In addition, $j_\theta$ is proven
to be essential and convenient for estimating stochastic energetics such as
heat currents and entropy production even in the underdamped regime.

terms of Radar Cross Section (RCS) and Bit Error Rate (BER). It is shown that
the BER is mainly determined by the tag Radar Cross Section (RCS) once that a
standard reading scenario is considered and a fixed size of the tag is chosen.
It is shown that the arrangement of the resonators in the chipless tag plays a
crucial role in determining the cross-polar RCS of the tag. The RCS of the tag
is computed theoretically by using array theory where each resonator is treated
as a separate scatterer completely characterized by a specific reflection
coefficient. Several resonators arrangements (periodic and non-periodic) are
compared, keeping the physical area of the tag fixed. Theoretical and
experimental analysis demonstrate that the periodic configuration guarantees
the maximum achievable RCS thus providing a global lower BER of the chipless
RFID communication system. We believe that the BER is the more meaningful and
fair figure of merit for comparing the performance of different tags than
bit/cm2 or bit/Hz since the increase of encoded information of the tag is
useful only if it can be correctly decoded.

equilibrium orientation of the magnetization to embed logical
functionalities[9-12]. Despite the realization of several proofs of concepts of
such nanomagnetic logic[13-15], it is still unclear what the advantages are
compared to the widespread CMOS designs, due to their need for clocking[16, 17]

is not guaranteed. In fact, it seems increasingly evident that ""beyond CMOS""
technology will require a fundamental rethinking of our computing paradigm[20].
In this respect, a type of terminal-agnostic logic was suggested[21], where a
given gate is able to ""self-organize"" into its correct logical states,
regardless of whether the signal is applied to the traditional input terminals,

balanced logic gates, that employ stray-field coupled nanomagnetic islands to
perform terminal-agnostic logic. We illustrate their capabilities by
implementing reversible Boolean circuitry to solve a two-bit factorization

we expect these systems to improve significantly over those suggested in

algorithm able to generate approximate policies for large Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes. The online nature of this method supports
scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. The lack of an explicit
representation however hinders interpretability. In this work, we propose a
methodology based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) for analyzing POMCP
policies by inspecting their traces, namely sequences of
belief-action-observation triplets generated by the algorithm. The proposed
method explores local properties of policy behavior to identify unexpected
decisions. We propose an iterative process of trace analysis consisting of
three main steps, i) the definition of a question by means of a parametric
logical formula describing (probabilistic) relationships between beliefs and
actions, ii) the generation of an answer by computing the parameters of the
logical formula that maximize the number of satisfied clauses (solving a
MAX-SMT problem), iii) the analysis of the generated logical formula and the
related decision boundaries for identifying unexpected decisions made by POMCP
with respect to the original question. We evaluate our approach on Tiger, a
standard benchmark for POMDPs, and a real-world problem related to mobile robot
navigation. Results show that the approach can exploit human knowledge on the
domain, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying
unexpected decisions. An improvement of the Area Under Curve up to 47\% has

present study, the natural oscillation of a sessile drop on flat surfaces with
free contact lines (FCL) is investigated through numerical and theoretical
analysis. The FCL condition represents a limit of contact line mobility, i.e.
the contact angle remains constant when the contact line moves. In the
numerical simulation, the interfaces are captured by the volume-of-fluid method
and the contact angle at the boundary is specified using the height-function
method. The oscillation frequencies for sessile drops with FCL are mainly
controlled by the contact angle and the Bond number and a parametric study is
carried out to characterize their effects on the frequencies for the first and
high-order modes. Particular attention is paid to the frequency of the first
mode, since it is usually the dominant mode. An inviscid theoretical model for
the first mode is developed. The model yields an explicit expression for the
first-mode frequency as a function of the contact angle and the Bond number,
with all parameters involved fully determined by the equilibrium drop theory
and the simulation. The predicted frequencies for a wide range of contact
angles agree very well with the simulation results for small Bond numbers. The
frequencies for both the first and high-order modes decrease with the contact
angle and increase with the Bond number. For the high-order modes, the
frequencies for different modes generally scale with the Rayleigh frequencies.
The scaling relation performs better for small Bond numbers and large contact
angles. A simple model is proposed to predict the frequencies of high-order
modes for large contact angles and a good agreement with the simulation results
is observed.

to simplify the convergence analysis of some of these variants by getting rid
of such a distinction between steps, and to improve existing rates by ensuring
a sizable decrease of the objective at each iteration. In order to do this, we
define the Short Step Chain (SSC) procedure, which skips gradient computations
in consecutive short steps until proper stopping conditions are satisfied. This
technique allows us to give a unified analysis and converge rates in the
general smooth non convex setting, as well as a linear convergence rate under a
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. While this setting has been widely studied
for proximal gradient type methods, to our knowledge, it has not been analyzed
before for the Frank Wolfe variants under study. An angle condition, ensuring
that the directions selected by the methods have the steepest slope possible up
to a constant, is used to carry out our analysis. We prove that this condition
is satisfied on polytopes by the away step Frank-Wolfe (AFW), the pairwise
Frank-Wolfe (PFW), and the Frank-Wolfe method with in face directions (FDFW).

spatial variables in this PDE (as opposed to the dependent, possibly also
data-driven, state variables). This leads to an alternative description of the
dynamics, local in these emergent coordinates, thus facilitating an alternative
modeling path for complex coupled-agent systems. We illustrate this approach on
a system where each agent is a limit cycle oscillator (a so-called
Stuart-Landau oscillator); the agents are heterogeneous (they each have a
different intrinsic frequency $\omega$) and are coupled through the ensemble
average of their respective variables. After fast initial transients, we show
that the collective dynamics on a slow manifold can be approximated through a
learned model based on local ""spatial"" partial derivatives in the emergent
coordinates. The model is then used for prediction in time, as well as to
capture collective bifurcations when system parameters vary. The proposed
approach thus integrates the automatic, data-driven extraction of emergent

hopping models, where particles or excitations move through a system which has
randomized couplings. This includes, e.g., spin glasses [5], coupled optical
waveguides [6], or NV center arrays [7]. They are also key to understand

mechanism is provided by the dipole-dipole interaction. Rydberg systems [9] are
therefore a natural candidate to study random hopping models. Here, we
experimentally study a three-dimensional many-body Rydberg system with random

find good agreement with an effective spin model. We also find spectroscopic
signatures of a localization-delocalization transition. Our results pave the
way to study transport processes and localization phenomena in random hopping

typically use relatively insufficient data augmentation. This shortage makes
their performance under expectation. Therefore, we contribute a pipeline, named
transformation flow, to bridge the gap between single and multi-modality data
augmentation with transformation reversing and replaying. In addition,
considering occlusions, a point in different modalities may be occupied by
different objects, making augmentations such as cut and paste non-trivial for
multi-modality detection. We further present Multi-mOdality Cut and pAste

present is too small and violates the observational constraints. However, the
problem is solved provided there is a reheating phase with a non-zero e-fold
number. During reheating, the energy density of the magnetic field is seen to
evolve as $(a^3H)^{-2}$ and, after that, as $a^{-4}$ up to the present epoch
(here $a$ is the scale factor and $H$ the Hubble parameter). It is found that
this reheating phase -- characterized by a certain e-fold number, a constant

renders the magnetogenesis model compatible with the observational constraints.
The model provides, in turn, a viable way of constraining the reheating

in a variety of empirical situations in engineering and natural systems such as
phototaxis, chemotaxis or gravitaxis. When motion is also affected by the
presence of external borders resulting from natural barriers or experimental
apparatuses, modelling biased random movement in confinement becomes necessary.
To study these scenarios, confined BLRW models have been employed but so far
only through computational techniques due to the lack of an analytic framework.
Here, we lay the groundwork for such an analytical approach by deriving the
Green's functions, or propagators, for the confined BLRW in arbitrary
dimensions and arbitrary boundary conditions. By using these propagators we
construct explicitly the time dependent first-passage probability in one
dimension for reflecting and periodic domains, while in higher dimensions we
are able to find its generating function. The latter is used to find the mean
first-passage passage time for a $d$-dimensional box, $d$-dimensional torus or
a combination of both. We show the appearance of surprising characteristics
such as the presence of saddles in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
propagator with reflecting boundaries, bimodal features in the first-passage
probability in periodic domains and the minimisation of the mean first-return
time for a bias of intermediate strength in rectangular domains. Furthermore,
we quantify how in a multi-target environment with the presence of a bias
shorter mean first-passage times can be achieved by placing fewer targets close
to boundaries in contrast to many targets away from them.

contextual information. While estimating the exact gaze direction is difficult

obtained by tracking the position and orientation of the head. Since the
relation between head pose and gaze direction is not one-to-one, this paper
proposes a formulation based on probabilistic models to create salient regions

is small when the model has high confidence on the prediction, which is
directly learned from the data. We use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to
implement the framework, comparing the performance with different regression

evaluate these frameworks by studying the tradeoff between spatial resolution
and accuracy of the probability map using naturalistic recordings collected
with the UTDrive platform. We observe that the GPR method produces the best
result creating accurate predictions with localized salient regions. For

K-corrected absolute magnitude reaches Mg=-21.5 mag. Its photometric and
spectroscopic evolution includes features of both slow and of fast evolving
SLSN I, thus favoring a continuum distribution between the two SLSN-I
subclasses. In particular, similarly to other SLSNe I, the multi-band light
curves of SN 2017gci show two rebrightenings at about 103 and 142 days after
the maximum light. Interestingly, this broadly agrees with a broad emission
feature emerging around 6520 A after 51 days from the maximum light, which is
followed by a sharp knee in the light curve. If we interpret this feature as
Halpha, this could support the fact that the bumps are the signature of late
interactions of the ejecta with a (hydrogen rich) circumstellar material. Then
we fitted magnetar and CSM-interaction powered synthetic light curves onto the
bolometric one of SN 2017gci. In the magnetar case, the fit suggests a polar
magnetic field Bp = 6 x 1e14 G, an initial period of the magnetar Pinitial=2.8
ms, an ejecta mass Mejecta=9 Msun and an ejecta opacity k = 0.08 cm g^{-1} . A
CSM interaction scenario would imply a CSM mass of 5 Msun and an ejecta mass of
12 Msun. Finally, the nebular spectrum of phase 187 days was modeled, deriving
a mass of 10 Msun for the ejecta. Our models suggest that either a magnetar or
CSM interaction might be the power sources for SN 2017gci and that its
progenitor was a massive (40 Msun) star.

generated class group $G$. The elasticity $\rho(H)$ is the maximal number of
atoms in any re-factorization of a product of $k$ atoms. The elasticities are
the same as those of a combinatorial monoid of zero-sum sequences $B(G_0)$,
where $G_0\subseteq G$ are the classes with height one primes. We characterize
when finite elasticity holds for any Krull Domain with finitely generated class
group. Our results are valid for the more general class of Transfer Krull
Monoids (over a subset $G_0$ of a finitely generated abelian group $G$). We
show there is a minimal $s\leq (d+1)m$, where $d$ is the torsion free rank and
$m$ is the torsion exponent, such that $\rho_s(H)<\infty$ implies
$\rho_k(H)<\infty$ for all $k\geq 1$. This ensures $\rho(H)<\infty$ if and only
if $\rho_{(d+1)m}(H)<\infty$. Our characterization is in terms of a simple
combinatorial obstruction to infinite elasticity: there existing a subset
$G_0^\diamond\subseteq G_0$ and bound $N$ such that there are no nontrivial
zero-sum sequences with terms from $G_0^\diamond$, and every minimal zero-sum
sequence has at most $N$ terms from $G_0\setminus G_0^\diamond$. We give an
explicit description of $G_0^\diamond$ in terms of the Convex Geometry of $G_0$
modulo the torsion subgroup $G_T\leq G$, and show finite elasticity is
equivalent to there being no positive linear combination of the elements of
this explicitly defined subset equal to $0$ modulo $G_T$. We use our results to
show finite elasticity implies the set of distances $\Delta(H)$, the catenary
degree $\mathsf c(H)$ (for Krull Monoids) and a weakened tame degree (for Krull
Monoids) are all also finite, and that the Structure Theorem for Unions holds.
Our results for factorization in Transfer Krull Monoids are accomplished by
developing an extensive theory in Convex Geometry generalizing positive bases.

Instead, this information should be suitably extracted from the raw image data.
Motivated by this, we present a principled model to extract network topologies
from images that is scalable and efficient. We map this goal into solving a
routing optimization problem where the solution is a network that minimizes an
energy function which can be interpreted in terms of an operational and
infrastructural cost. Our method relies on recent results from optimal
transport theory and is a principled alternative to standard image-processing
techniques that are based on heuristics. We test our model on real images of
the retinal vascular system, slime mold and river networks and compare with
routines combining image-processing techniques. Results are tested in terms of
a similarity measure related to the amount of information preserved in the
extraction. We find that our model finds networks from retina vascular network
images that are more similar to hand-labeled ones, while also giving high
performance in extracting networks from images of rivers and slime mold for
which there is no ground truth available. While there is no unique method that
fits all the images the best, our approach performs consistently across

coloring that has been widely studied in recent years after its introduction by
Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in 2015. As the analogue of the chromatic polynomial
$P(G,m)$, the DP color function of a graph $G$, denoted $P_{DP}(G,m)$, counts
the minimum number of DP-colorings over all possible $m$-fold covers. It is
known that, unlike the list color function $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, for any $g \geq 3$
there exists a graph $G$ with girth $g$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) < P(G,m)$ when
$m$ is sufficiently large. Thus, two fundamental open questions regarding the
DP color function are: (i) for which $G$ does there exist an $N \in \mathbb{N}$
such that $P_{DP}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \geq N$, (ii) Given a graph $G$
does there always exist an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and a polynomial $p(m)$ such that
$P_{DP}(G,m) = p(m)$ whenever $m \geq N$?
  In this paper we give exact formulas for the DP color function of a Theta
graph based on the parity of its path lengths. This gives an explicit answer,
including the formulas for the polynomials that are not the chromatic
polynomial, to both the questions above for Theta graphs. We extend this result
to Generalized Theta graphs by characterizing the exact parity condition that
ensures the DP color function eventually equals the chromatic polynomial. To
answer the second question for Generalized Theta graphs, we confirm it for the
larger class of graphs with a feedback vertex set of size one.

significantly. Traditional long-term planning studies that most utility
companies perform based on discrete power levels such as peak or average values
cannot reflect system dynamics and often fail to accurately predict system
reliability deficiencies. As a result, long-term future continuous profiles
such as the 8760 hourly profiles are required to enable time-series based
long-term planning studies. However, unlike short-term profiles used for
operation studies, generating long-term continuous profiles that can reflect
both historical time-varying characteristics and future expected power
magnitude is very challenging. Current methods such as average profiling have
major drawbacks. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes a completely
novel approach to generate such profiles for multiple generation types. A
multi-level profile synthesis process is proposed to capture time-varying
characteristics at different time levels. The proposed approach was evaluated
based on a public dataset and demonstrated great performance and application
value for generating long-term continuous multi-type generation profiles.

heuristics developed with decades of research to solve large-scale MIP
instances encountered in practice. Machine learning offers to automatically
construct better heuristics from data by exploiting shared structure among
instances in the data. This paper applies learning to the two key sub-tasks of
a MIP solver, generating a high-quality joint variable assignment, and bounding
the gap in objective value between that assignment and an optimal one. Our
approach constructs two corresponding neural network-based components, Neural
Diving and Neural Branching, to use in a base MIP solver such as SCIP. Neural
Diving learns a deep neural network to generate multiple partial assignments
for its integer variables, and the resulting smaller MIPs for un-assigned
variables are solved with SCIP to construct high quality joint assignments.
Neural Branching learns a deep neural network to make variable selection
decisions in branch-and-bound to bound the objective value gap with a small
tree. This is done by imitating a new variant of Full Strong Branching we
propose that scales to large instances using GPUs. We evaluate our approach on
six diverse real-world datasets, including two Google production datasets and
MIPLIB, by training separate neural networks on each. Most instances in all the
datasets combined have $10^3-10^6$ variables and constraints after presolve,
which is significantly larger than previous learning approaches. Comparing
solvers with respect to primal-dual gap averaged over a held-out set of
instances, the learning-augmented SCIP is 2x to 10x better on all datasets
except one on which it is $10^5$x better, at large time limits. To the best of
our knowledge, ours is the first learning approach to demonstrate such large
improvements over SCIP on both large-scale real-world application datasets and
MIPLIB.

for optimizing the circuit design jointly with the weights have been proposed,

evolutionary strategy that addresses the trade-off between finding appropriate

transverse field Ising Hamiltonian and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin model.
Despite the shortcomings of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware,
we find only a minor slowdown on actual quantum machines compared to

mole fraction was set to be between 0.1-100% and the ambient pressure was set
to be between 0.5-140 kPa. The localized Stern-Volmer coefficient $B_{\rm
local}$ once increases and then decreases as the oxygen mole fraction
increases. The value of $B_{\rm local}$ depends on both ambient pressure and
oxygen mole fraction, but the effect of this parameter can be characterized as
a function of the partial pressure of oxygen. The value of $B_{\rm local}$ of
AA-PSP and PHFIPM-PSP, which are low-pressure type and relatively low-pressure
type PSP, have a peak at the relatively low partial pressure of oxygen, and
$B_{\rm local}$ of PC-PSP, which are atmospheric pressure type PSP, has a peak
at the relatively high partial pressure of oxygen. The peak of the intensity
change with respect to pressure fluctuation proportional to the ambient
pressure $S_{\mathcal{PR}}$ appears at the lower partial pressure of oxygen

quite low at the high partial pressure of oxygen even if $B_{\rm local}$ is

30 years of figures and tables from each track of the IEEE Visualization
conference series (Vis, SciVis, InfoVis, VAST). VIS30K's comprehensive coverage
of the scientific literature in visualization not only reflects the progress of
the field but also enables researchers to study the evolution of the
state-of-the-art and to find relevant work based on graphical content. We
describe the dataset and our semi-automatic collection process, which couples
convolutional neural networks (CNN) with curation. Extracting figures and
tables semi-automatically allows us to verify that no images are overlooked or
extracted erroneously. To improve quality further, we engaged in a peer-search
process for high-quality figures from early IEEE Visualization papers. With the
resulting data, we also contribute VISImageNavigator (VIN,
visimagenavigator.github.io), a web-based tool that facilitates searching and
exploring VIS30K by author names, paper keywords, title and abstract, and

and political science. Arce M. and Sandler (2005) analyzed counter-terrorism
using non-cooperative game theory (the players are, for example, the US and the
EU), which assumes that communication among the players is not allowed, or, if
it is allowed, then there is no mechanism to enforce any agreement the players
may make. The only solution in the non-cooperative setting would be a Nash
equilibrium because the players adopt only self-enforcing strategies. Here we
analyze counter-terrorism using cooperative game theory, because there are ways
to communicate among the players and to make binding agreements; indeed,
countries that oppose terrorism are closely connected to each other in many
aspects such as economically and in terms of international politics.

have been studied extensively. In Toral's model, $N$ players are arranged in a
circle. The players play either game $A$ or game $B$. In game $A$, a randomly
chosen player wins or loses one unit according to the toss of a fair coin. In
game $B$, which depends on parameters $p_0,p_1,p_2\in[0,1]$, a randomly chosen
player, player $x$ say, wins or loses one unit according to the toss of a
$p_m$-coin, where $m\in\{0,1,2\}$ is the number of nearest neighbors of player
$x$ who won their most recent game. In this paper, we replace game $A$ by a
spatially dependent game, which we call game $A'$, introduced by Xie et
al.~(2011). In game $A'$, two nearest neighbors are chosen at random, and one
pays one unit to the other based on the toss of a fair coin. Noting that game
$A'$ is fair, we say that the \textit{Parrondo effect} occurs if game $B$ is
losing or fair and game $C'$, determined by a random or periodic sequence of
games $A'$ and $B$, is winning. We investigate numerically the region in which
the Parrondo effect appears. We give sufficient conditions for the mean profit
in game $C'$ to converge as $N\to\infty$. Finally, we compare the Parrondo
region in the model of Xie et al.\ with that in the model of Toral.

Reconstruction of dynamic scenes with rigid motion from multi-view RGB videos
without any manual annotation. Recent work has shown that neural networks are
surprisingly effective at the task of compressing many views of a scene into a
learned function which maps from a viewing ray to an observed radiance value
via volume rendering. Unfortunately, these methods lose all their predictive
power once any object in the scene has moved. In this work, we explicitly model
rigid motion of objects in the context of neural representations of radiance
fields. We show that without any additional human specified supervision, we can
reconstruct a dynamic scene with a single rigid object in motion by
simultaneously decomposing it into its two constituent parts and encoding each
with its own neural representation. We achieve this by jointly optimizing the
parameters of two neural radiance fields and a set of rigid poses which align
the two fields at each frame. On both synthetic and real world datasets, we
demonstrate that our method can render photorealistic novel views, where
novelty is measured on both spatial and temporal axes. Our factored
representation furthermore enables animation of unseen object motion.

target domain share an identical label space, which is problematic since when
target samples are unlabeled we have no knowledge on whether the two domains
share the same label space. When this is not the case, the existing methods
fail to perform well because the additional unknown classes are also matched
with the source domain during adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the open set
domain adaptation problem under the assumption that the source and the target
label spaces only partially overlap, and the task becomes when the unknown
classes exist, how to detect the target unknown classes and avoid aligning them
with the source domain. We propose to utilize an instance-level reweighting
strategy for domain adaptation where the weights indicate the likelihood of a
sample belonging to known classes and to model the tail of the entropy
distribution with Extreme Value Theory for unknown class detection. Experiments
on conventional domain adaptation datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

the tracking conditions when parameters are in the experimentally observed
range. This demonstrates the necessity of modelling odor dispersal with full
fluid dynamics, where non-linear phenomena such as turbulence play a critical
role.

  book; typos corrected",,,,"cs.ET cs.SD eess.AS quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This chapter presents a quantum computing-based approach to study and harness
neuronal correlates of mental activity for the development of Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) systems. It introduces the notion of a logic of the mind, where
neurophysiological data are encoded as logical expressions representing mental
activity. Effective logical expressions are likely to be extensive, involving
dozens of variables. Large expressions require considerable computational power
to be processed. This is problematic for BCI applications because they require
fast reaction times to execute sequences of commands. Quantum computers hold
much promise in terms of processing speed for some problems, including those
involving logical expressions. Hence, we propose to use quantum computers to
process the logic of the mind. The chapter begins with an introduction to BCI
and the electroencephalogram, which is the neurophysiological signal that is
normally used in BCI. Then, it briefly discusses how the EEG corresponds to
mental states, followed by an introduction to the logic of the mind. After
that, there is an overview of quantum computing, focusing on the basics deemed
necessary to understand how it processes logical expressions. An example of a
BCI system is presented. In a nutshell, the system reads the EEG and builds
logical expressions, which are sent to a quantum computer to solve them. In
turn, the system converts the results into sounds by means of a bespoke
synthesiser. Essentially, the BCI here is a musical instrument controlled by
the mind of the player. Our BCI is a proof-of-concept aimed at demonstrating
how quantum computing may support the development of sophisticated BCI systems.
The remaining of the chapter is devoted to technical and practical
considerations on the limitations of current quantum computing hardware
technology and scalability of the system.

  UAV-Facilitated Wireless Networks","16 pages. 12 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Augmenting wireless networks with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly
referred to as drones, offers a promising avenue for providing reliable,
cost-effective, and on-demand wireless services to desired areas. However,
existing UAV communication and trajectory schemes are inefficient as they
assume limited drone mobility and static transmission power. Furthermore, they
tend to rely upon convex approximations to highly non-linear functions and fail
to adopt a combination of heuristic and convex methods. This paper considers a
Multi-UAV system where UAV-mounted mobile base stations serve users on the
ground. An iterative approach using block gradient descent is used to jointly
optimize user scheduling, UAV trajectories, and transmission power for
maximizing throughput over all users. Subsequently, an innovative technique for
initial trajectory predictions was developed using a K-means clustering
algorithm for partitioning users into subgroups and a genetic algorithm for
initializing shortest flight paths within clusters. Finally, convex
optimization solvers such as MATLAB's Fmincon are used for fine-tuning
parameters. Extensive simulation and optimization results demonstrate a 33.57%,
87.4%, and 53.2% increase in system throughput for the 1, 2, and 3 UAV
scenarios respectively when compared to existing trajectory and communication
design schemes. Furthermore, the K-means and genetic algorithm reveal
additional improvements in throughput by around 15%. Our results note
diminished increases in throughput for increases in UAV trajectory period as
the period approaches higher values. Further research into joint adoption of
convex and non-convex schemes as well as consideration of environment-dependent
channel models would allow for a faster and more optimal deployment of UAVs.
