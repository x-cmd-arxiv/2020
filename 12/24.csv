  Wireless Communications. arXiv:2004.12539",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Malicious jamming launched by smart jammer, which attacks legitimate
transmissions has been regarded as one of the critical security challenges in
wireless communications. Thus, this paper exploits intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) to enhance anti-jamming communication performance and mitigate
jamming interference by adjusting the surface reflecting elements at the IRS.
Aiming to enhance the communication performance against smart jammer, an
optimization problem for jointly optimizing power allocation at the base
station (BS) and reflecting beamforming at the IRS is formulated. As the
jamming model and jamming behavior are dynamic and unknown, a win or learn fast
policy hill-climbing (WoLF-PHC) learning approach is proposed to jointly
optimize the anti-jamming power allocation and reflecting beamforming strategy
without the knowledge of the jamming model. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed anti-jamming based-learning approach can efficiently improve both
the IRS-assisted system rate and transmission protection level compared with
existing solutions.

take into account the most efficient physical processes participating in
generation of harmonic electromagnetic emission via nonlinear coupling of
Langmuir waves in randomly inhomogeneous plasma of solar wind ($l+l^{'}
\rightarrow t$). We revisit the conventional mechanism of coalescence of
primarily generated and back-scattered Langmuir waves in quasihomogeneous
plasma. Additionally, we propose and investigate another mechanism that
generates the harmonic emission only in a strongly inhomogeneous plasma: the
nonlinear coupling of incident and reflected Langmuir waves inside localized
regions with enhanced plasma density (clumps), in the close vicinity of the
reflection point. Both mechanisms imply the presence of strong density
fluctuations in plasma. We use the results of a probabilistic model of
beam-plasma interaction and evaluate the efficiency of energy transfer from
Langmuir waves to harmonic emission. We infer that harmonic emissions from a
quasihomogeneous plasma are significantly more intense than found in previous
studies. The efficiency of Langmuir waves conversion into electromagnetic
harmonic emission is expected to be higher at large heliospheric distances for
the mechanism operating in quasihomogeneous plasma, and at small heliocentric
distances - for the one operating in inhomogeneous. The evaluation of emission
intensity in quasihomogeneous plasma may also be applied for type II solar
radio bursts. The radiation pattern in both cases is quadrupolar, and we show
that emission from density clumps may efficiently contribute to the visibility
of harmonic radio emission.

for the whole training process, because low precision could slows down the
convergence rate. One evidence is that most works for low precision training
keep an fp32 copy of the model during training, which in turn imposes memory

Training. It is able to save both total training energy cost and memory usage
at the same time. We use model of the same precision for both forward and

the progress of training, APT allocates layer-wise precision dynamically so
that the model learns quicker for longer time. APT provides an application

To address this challenge, we first introduce mathematically optimal
preconditioners called block complex Schur decomposition (BCSD), block real
Schur decomposition (BRSD), and block Jordan form (BJF), motivated by
block-circulant preconditioners and Jordan form solution techniques for IRK. We
then derive an efficient, near-optimal singly-diagonal approximate BRSD
(SABRSD) by approximating the quasi-triangular matrix in real Schur
decomposition using an optimized upper-triangular matrix with a single diagonal
value. A desirable feature of SABRSD is that it has comparable memory
requirements and factorization (or setup) cost as singly DIRK (SDIRK). We
approximate the diagonal blocks in these preconditioning techniques using an
incomplete factorization with (near) linear complexity, such as multilevel ILU,
ILU(0), or a multigrid method with an ILU-based smoother. We apply the block
preconditioners in right-preconditioned GMRES to solve the advection-diffusion
equation in 3D using finite element and finite difference methods. We show that

found to be long tailed in size and energy, suggesting critical dynamics. Even
more recently, the intermittent plastic response was found to be generic for
micro- and nano-sized systems independently of their crystallographic symmetry.
These rather remarkable discoveries are reviewed in this paper in the
perspective of the recent studies performed in our group. We discuss the
physical origin and the scaling properties of plastic fluctuations and address
the nature of their dependence on crystalline symmetry, system size, and
disorder content. A particular emphasis is placed on the associated emergent
behaviors, including the formation of dislocation structures, and on our
ability to temper plastic fluctuations by alloying. We also discuss the
""smaller is wilder"" size effect that culminates in a paradoxical crack-free
brittle behavior of very small, initially dislocation free crystals. We show
that the implied transition between different rheological behaviors is
regulated by the ratio of length scales $R=L/l$, where $L$ is the system size
and $l$ is the internal length. We link this new size effect with other related
phenomena like size dependence of strength (""smaller is stronger"") and the size
induced switch between different hardening mechanisms. One of the technological
challenges in nanoscience is to tame the intermittency of plastic flow. We show
that this task can be accomplished by generating tailored quenched disorder
which allows one to control micro- and nano-scale forming and opens new
perspectives in micro-metallurgy and structural engineering of ultra-small
load-carrying elements. These results could not be achieved by conventional
methods that do not explicitly consider the stochastic nature of collective
dislocation dynamics.

months, embracing the perihelion passage in 2018 December with phase angles
ranging from {\alpha}=18.1 to 46.4 deg. The polarimetric response PQ obtained
resembles what was previously found in comet C/1975 V1 (West). This suggests
46P/Wirtanen belongs to a group of comets with high maximum positive
polarization. We conducted BVRI photometry of 46P and found either neutral or
blue colour of its dust which is in good accordance with measurements of C/1975
V1 (West). While aperture-average polarimetry of 46P/Wirtanen reveals a nearly
zero polarization PQ at the lowest phase angle {\alpha} = 18.1 deg,
simultaneous imaging polarimetry suggests that the negative polarization (PQ<0)
arises in a region of within 5000 km of the nucleus, where the negative
polarization could be as strong as PQ=-(1.44 +/- 0.15) percent. This
observation suggests the existence of the circumnucleus halo and that the coma
is populated by at least two types of dust particles. One of those reveals a
low positive polarization at side scattering and high negative polarization
near backscattering. Both polarimetric features are simultaneously produced by
weakly absorbing Mg-rich silicate particles. Another type of dust produces
solely positive polarization that could be attributed to carbonaceous
particles. This composition of 46P/Wirtanen coma appears to be similar with
what was previously found in comet C/1975 V1 (West).

while bringing interesting ideas to solve the tracking problem. This progress
is mainly due to the use of learned deep features obtained by training deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on large image databases. But since CNNs
were originally developed for image classification, appearance modeling
provided by their deep layers might be not enough discriminative for the
tracking task. In fact,such features represent high-level information, that is
more related to object category than to a specific instance of the object.
Motivated by this observation, and by the fact that discriminative correlation
filters(DCFs) may provide a complimentary low-level information, we presenta
novel tracking algorithm taking advantage of both approaches. We formulate the
tracking task as a two-stage procedure. First, we exploit the generalization
ability of deep features to coarsely estimate target translation, while
ensuring invariance to appearance change. Then, we capitalize on the
discriminative power of correlation filters to precisely localize the tracked
object. Furthermore, we designed an update control mechanism to learn
appearance change while avoiding model drift. We evaluated the proposed tracker
on object tracking benchmarks. Experimental results show the robustness of our
algorithm, which performs favorably against CNN and DCF-based trackers. Code is

magnetization in magnetic Weyl semimetals. The anomaly produces an imbalance in
left- and right-handed chirality carriers when non-orthogonal electric and
magnetic fields are applied. Such imbalance generates a spin density which
exerts a torque on the magnetization, the strength of which can be controlled
by the intensity of the applied electric field. We show how this results in an
electric control of the chirality of domain walls, as well as in an improvement
of the domain wall dynamics, by delaying the onset of the Walker breakdown. The
measurement of the electric field mediated changes in the domain wall chirality
would constitute a direct proof of the axial anomaly. Additionally, we show how
quantum fluctuations of electronic Fermi arc states bound to the domain wall
naturally induce an effective magnetic anisotropy, allowing for high domain
wall velocities even if the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetic Weyl semimetal
is small.

distribution of the gas velocity dispersion across the images of galaxies: (i)
the distributions of 909 galaxies show a radial symmetry with or without the
sigma enhancement at the center (R distribution) and (ii) distributions with a
band of enhanced sigma along the minor axis in the images of 159 galaxies with
or without the sigma enhancement at the center (B distribution) The sigma
distribution across the images of 78 galaxies cannot be reliable classified. We
select 806 galaxies with the best defined characteristics (this sample includes
687 galaxies with R distribution and 119 galaxies with B distribution) and
compare the properties of galaxies with R and B distributions. We find that the
median value of the gas velocity dispersion sigma_m in galaxies with B
distribution is higher by around 5 km/s, on average, than that of galaxies with
R distribution. The optical radius R_25 of galaxies with B distribution is
lower by around 0.1 dex, on average, than that of galaxies with similar masses
with R distribution. Thus the properties of a galaxy are related to the type of
distribution of the gas velocity dispersion across its image. This suggests
that the presence of the band of the enhanced gas velocity dispersion can be an
indicator of a specific evolution (or a specific stage in the evolution) of a
galaxy.

participants in an electricity market cleared by employing the full AC Optimal
Power Flow (ACOPF) problem formulation. Traditionally, the independent system
operators (ISOs) leveraged DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) problem formulation to
settle the electricity market. The main quest of this work is to find what
would be the challenges and opportunities if ISOs leverage the full ACOPF as
the market-clearing Problem (MCP)? This paper presents tractable mathematical
programming with equilibrium constraints for the convexified AC market-clearing
problem. Market participants maximize their profit via strategic bidding while
considering the reactive power dispatch of generation units. The equilibrium
constraints are procured by presenting the dual form of the relaxed ACOPF
problem. The strategic bidding problem with ACOPF-based MCP improves the
exactness of the location marginal prices (LMPs) and profit of market
participants compared to the one with DCOPF. It is shown that the strategic
bidding problem with DCOFP-based MCP is unable to model the limitations of
reactive power support. The presented results display cases where the proposed
strategic bidding method renders $52.3\%$ more profit for the Generation
Company (GENCO) than the DCOPF-based MCP model. The proposed strategic bidding
framework also addresses the challenges in coupling real and reactive power
dispatch of generation constraints, ramping constraints, demand response
implications with curtailable and time shiftable loads, and AC line flow
constraints. Therefore, the presented method will help market participants
leverage the more accurate ACOPF model in the strategic bidding problem.

raises questions as to the universal applicability of Landau Fermi liquid
theory. The coherence temperature $T_{FL}$ for normal metals is usually taken
to be the temperature below which $T^2$ is observed in the resistivity. Below
this temperature, a Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles is expected.
However, metallic ruthenates in the Ruddlesden-Popper family, frequently show
non-Drude low-energy optical conductivity and unusual $\omega/T$ scaling,
despite the frequent observation of $T^2$ dc resistivity. Herein we report
time-domain THz spectroscopy measurements of several different high-quality
metallic ruthenate thin films and show that the optical conductivity can be
interpreted in more conventional terms. In all materials, the conductivity has
a two-Drude peak lineshape at low temperature and a crossover to a one-Drude
peak lineshape at higher temperatures. The two-component low-temperature
conductivity is indicative of two well-separated current relaxation rates for
different conduction channels. We discuss three particular possibilities for
the separation of rates: (a) Strongly energy-dependent inelastic scattering;
(b) an almost-conserved pseudomomentum operator that overlaps with the current,
giving rise to the narrower Drude peak; (c) the presence of multiple conduction
channels that undergoes a crossover to stronger interband scattering at higher
temperatures. None of these scenarios require the existence of exotic
quasiparticles. The results may give insight into the possible significance of
Hund's coupling in determining interband coupling in these materials. Our
results also show a route towards understanding the violation of Matthiessen's
rule in this class of materials and deviations from the ""Gurzhi"" scaling

Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrates that random shuffling amplifies differential
privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies
substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is
contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has lead to significant interest in
the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19; EFMRTT19].
  We show that random shuffling of $n$ data records that are input to
$\varepsilon_0$-differentially private local randomizers results in an
$(O((1-e^{-\varepsilon_0})\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_0}\log(1/\delta)}{n}}),
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm. This significantly improves over
previous work and achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in
$\varepsilon_0$. Our result is based on a new approach that is simpler than
previous work and extends to approximate differential privacy with nearly the
same guarantees. Importantly, our work also yields an algorithm for deriving
tighter bounds on the resulting $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ as well as R\'enyi
differential privacy guarantees. We show numerically that our algorithm gets to
within a small constant factor of the optimal bound. As a direct corollary of
our analysis we derive a simple and nearly optimal algorithm for frequency

However, the diffusion scaling limit requires stringent assumptions on the

imaging (MRI) technique, which may potentially replace or effectively
complement both x-ray mammography and contrast-enhanced MR mammography. To
further improve specificity of DWI in the breast, stronger and faster diffusion
weighting is advantageous. With the target application in mind, the gradient
coil is designed on an irregularly shaped semi-open current-carrying surface.
Due to the coil former closely fitting the non-spherical target region,
non-linear encoding fields become particularly advantageous for achieving
locally exceptionally high gradient strengths. As the breast tissue has a
predominantly isotropic cellular microstructure, the direction of the
diffusion-weighting gradient may be allowed to vary within the target volume.
However, due to the quadratic dependency of the b-factor on the gradient
strength, variation of the gradient magnitude needs to be carefully controlled.
  To achieve the above design goals the corresponding multi-objective
optimization problem is reformulated as a constrained optimization, allowing
for flexible and precise control of the coil properties. A novel constraint is
proposed limiting the gradient magnitude variation within every slice while
allowing for variations both the direction of the gradient within the slice and
the magnitude across the slices. The above innovations enable the design of a
unilateral coil for diffusion weighting in the female breast with the local
gradient strengths exceeding 1~T/m with highly homogeneous diffusion weighting

canonical data segmentation problem which aims at detecting and localising
multiple change points in the mean of univariate time series. We provide an
overview of popular methodologies on their computational complexity and
theoretical properties. In particular, our theoretical discussion focuses on
the separation rate relating to which change points are detectable by a given

that the latter viewpoint provides the most general setting for investigating
the optimality of data segmentation algorithms.

and dynamics across many orders of spatiotemporal scales is a great challenge
that has not been investigated systematically by deep neural networks (DNNs).
Herein, we develop a framework based on operator regression, the so-called deep
operator network (DeepONet), with the long term objective to simplify
multiscale modeling by avoiding the fragile and time-consuming ""hand-shaking""
interface algorithms for stitching together heterogeneous descriptions of
multiscale phenomena. To this end, as a first step, we investigate if a
DeepONet can learn the dynamics of different scale regimes, one at the
deterministic macroscale and the other at the stochastic microscale regime with
inherent thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we test the effectiveness and
accuracy of DeepONet in predicting multirate bubble growth dynamics, which is
described by a Rayleigh-Plesset (R-P) equation at the macroscale and modeled as
a stochastic nucleation and cavitation process at the microscale by dissipative
particle dynamics (DPD). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that
DeepONets can be employed to unify the macroscale and microscale models of the
multirate bubble growth problem, hence providing new insight into the role of
operator regression via DNNs in tackling realistic multiscale problems and in
simplifying modeling with heterogeneous descriptions.

collapse of a moderate initial filamentary perturbation with an additional
central ellipsoidal enhancement (a core) considering a uniform, and a
stratified background, the latter representing flattened clouds. Both
simulations maintain the filamentary structure during the collapse, developing
a hierarchical accretion flow from the cloud to the plane; from there to the
filament, and from the filament to the core. The flow changes direction
smoothly at every step of the hierarchy, with no density divergence nor a shock
developing at the filament's axis during the studied prestellar evolution. The
flow drives accretion onto the central core and drains material from the
filament, slowing down the growth of the latter. As a consequence, the ratio of
the central density of the core to the filament density increases in time,
diverging at the time of singularity formation in the core. The stratified
simulation produces the best match for observed Plummer-like radial column
density profiles of filaments, while the uniform simulation does not produce a
flat central density profile. This result supports recent suggestions that MCs
may be preferentially flattened structures. We examine the possibility that the
filamentary flow might approach a quasi-stationary regime in which the radial
accretion onto the filament is balanced by the longitudinal accretion onto the
core. A simple argument suggests that such a stationary state may be an
attractor for the system. Our simulations, do not attain this stationary stage,

into three separate classes. However, manual segmentation of 3-dimensional
structures is time-consuming and tedious, motivating the development of
automated methods. Here, we tailor a model adapted to the spinal cord tumor
segmentation task. Data were obtained from 343 patients using
gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans with cervical,
thoracic, and/or lumbar coverage. The dataset includes the three most common
intramedullary spinal cord tumor types: astrocytomas, ependymomas, and
hemangioblastomas. The proposed approach is a cascaded architecture with
U-Net-based models that segments tumors in a two-stage process: locate and
label. The model first finds the spinal cord and generates bounding box
coordinates. The images are cropped according to this output, leading to a
reduced field of view, which mitigates class imbalance. The tumor is then
segmented. The segmentation of the tumor, cavity, and edema (as a single class)
reached 76.7 $\pm$ 1.5% of Dice score and the segmentation of tumors alone
reached 61.8 $\pm$ 4.0% Dice score. The true positive detection rate was above
87% for tumor, edema, and cavity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first fully automatic deep learning model for spinal cord tumor segmentation.

five massive protostars at 6 and 22.2 GHz. The aim of the study was to compare
their current fluxes and positions with previous observations to search for
evidence of variability. Most of the observed sources present the morphologies
of a thermal core, hosting the protostar and exhibiting no proper motion, and
associated non-thermal radio lobes that are characterised by proper motions and
located away from the thermal core. Some of the protostars drive jets whose
lobes have dissimilar displacement vectors, implying precession of the jets or
the presence of multiple jet drivers. The jets of the protostars were found to
have proper motions that lie in the range 170$ \leq v \leq $650 kms$^{-1}$, and
precessions of periods 40$\leq p \leq$50 years and angles 2$\leq \alpha
\leq$10$^\circ$, assuming that their velocities $v=$500 kms$^{-1}$. The core of
one of the sources, S255 NIRS 3, which was in outburst at the time of our
observations, showed a significant change in flux compared to the other
sources. Its spectral index decreased during the outburst, consistent with the
model of an expanding gas bubble. Modelling the emission of the outburst as
that of a new non-thermal lobe that is emerging from a thermal core whose
emission enshrouds that of the lobe also has the potential to account for the
increase in flux and a decrease in the spectral index of the source's outburst.

  multiplexing","9 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1088/2040-8986/abef22",,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Complex vector modes have become topical of late due to their fascinating
properties and the many applications they have found across a broad variety of
research fields. Even though such modes can be generated in a wide variety of
ways, digital holography stands out as one of the most flexible and versatile.
Along this line, Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs) have gain popularity in
recent time due to their high refresh rates, which allows the generation of
vector modes at kHz rates. Nonetheless, most techniques are limited either by
the diversity of vector modes that can be generated or by the speed at which
they can be switched. Here we propose a technique based on the concept of
random encoding, which allows the generation of arbitrary vector beams at
speeds limited only by the refresh rate of the DMD. Our technique will be of
great relevance in research fields such as optical communications, laser
material processing and optical manipulation, amongst others.

Camera (DECam) and Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)
data. The DES Deep Fields comprise 11 fields (10 DES supernova fields plus
COSMOS), with a total area of $\sim30~$ square degrees in $ugriz$ bands and
reaching a maximum $i$-band depth of 26.75 (AB, $10\sigma$, 2 arcsec). We
present a catalogue for the DES 3-year cosmology analysis of those four fields
with full 8-band coverage, totalling $5.88~$ sq. deg. after masking. Numbering
$2.8~$million objects ($1.6~$million post masking), our catalogue is drawn from
images coadded to consistent depths of $r=25.7, i=25, z=24.3$ mag. We use a new
model-fitting code, built upon established methods, to deblend sources and
ensure consistent colours across the $u$-band to $Ks$-band wavelength range. We
further detail the tight control we maintain over the point-spread function
modelling required for the model fitting, astrometry and consistency of
photometry between the four fields. The catalogue allows us to perform a
careful star-galaxy separation and produces excellent photometric redshift
performance (${\rm NMAD} = 0.023$ at $i<23$). The Deep-Fields catalogue will be
made available as part of the cosmology data products release, following the
completion of the DES 3-year weak lensing and galaxy clustering cosmology work.

directly sample the selection and photometric biases of the Dark Energy
Survey's (DES) Year 3 (Y3) dataset. We systematically inject onto the
single-epoch images of a random 20% subset of the DES footprint an ensemble of
nearly 30 million realistic galaxy models derived from DES Deep Field
observations. These augmented images are analyzed in parallel with the original
data to automatically inherit measurement systematics that are often too
difficult to capture with traditional generative models. The resulting object
catalog is a Monte Carlo sampling of the DES transfer function and is used as a
powerful diagnostic and calibration tool for a variety of DES Y3 science,
particularly for the calibration of the photometric redshifts of distant
""source"" galaxies and magnification biases of nearer ""lens"" galaxies. The
recovered Balrog injections are shown to closely match the photometric property
distributions of the Y3 GOLD catalog, particularly in color, and capture the
number density fluctuations from observing conditions of the real data within
1% for a typical galaxy sample. We find that Y3 colors are extremely well
calibrated, typically within ~1-8 millimagnitudes, but for a small subset of
objects we detect significant magnitude biases correlated with large
overestimates of the injected object size due to proximity effects and
blending. We discuss approaches to extend the current methodology to capture
more aspects of the transfer function and reach full coverage of the survey
footprint for future analyses.

redshift and photometric redshift estimates, with differences on the inferred
mean redshift to be below $|\Delta z|=0.01$ in most of the bins. We also test a

found necessary to use for some of our samples. Our typical uncertainties on

rise to superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in 5d and 4d, respectively. In
this paper, we study canonical hypersurface singularities whose resolutions
contain residual terminal singularities and/or 3-cycles. We focus on a certain
class of `trinion' singularities which exhibit these properties. In Type IIB,
they give rise to 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs that we call $D_p^b(G)$-trinions,
which are marginal gaugings of three SCFTs with $G$ flavor symmetry. In order
to understand the 5d physics of these trinion singularities in M-theory, we
reduce these 4d and 5d SCFTs to 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories, thus determining
the electric and magnetic quivers (or, more generally, quiverines). In
M-theory, residual terminal singularities give rise to free sectors of massless
hypermultiplets, which often are discretely gauged. These free sectors appear
as `ugly' components of the magnetic quiver of the 5d SCFT. The 3-cycles in the
crepant resolution also give rise to free hypermultiplets, but their physics is
more subtle, and their presence renders the magnetic quiver `bad'. We propose a
way to redeem the badness of these quivers using a class $\mathcal{S}$
realization. We also discover new S-dualities between different
$D_p^b(G)$-trinions. For instance, a certain $E_8$ gauging of the $E_8$
Minahan-Nemeschansky theory is S-dual to an $E_8$-shaped Lagrangian quiver
SCFT.

the undecidability of some physical systems has been studied in recent years,

suggest that, in order to reproduce the observed circulation and wave activity

at the source level in the lower atmosphere. This is because observations
contain a broader spectrum of GWs, while parameterizations capture only a

the Hubble constant $H_0$ by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source
luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up.
This method is limited by intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and
orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow
counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing
this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of $H_0$.
In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve
and imagery modeling thus allowed to improve the $H_0$ measurement by a factor
of 3. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In
fact, though each one allows a leap in $H_0$ precision, these afterglow
counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We
combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic
population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints.
Using these models, we quantify how fast $H_0$ will be narrowed-down by
successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that,
because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the
afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of
$H_0$ in the long run.

disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate
wearing of masks. \emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always
travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on
\textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form
traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over
time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is
detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for
testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases.
Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of
the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural
way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members
with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale
agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19
dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a
detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual
cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are
modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model
in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator
is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a
quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics
and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit
in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and

where we analyze the nature of the EWPhT in both the light and the heavy DM
regions, confronting it with the amount of DM potentially residing in the
lightest inert-doublet state. Thereby, we point out a viable region where a
non-trivial two-step EWPhT can appear, without being in conflict with
direct-detection bounds, which could leave interesting imprints in
gravitational wave signatures. We propose new benchmarks with this feature as
well as update benchmarks with a strong first-order transition in the light of

as relevant collider constraints, we envisage a new region for light DM with a
small mass splitting, lifting the usual assumption of exact degeneracy of the
new non-DM scalars, such as to avoid collider bounds while providing a fair DM
abundance over a rather large DM mass range. This follows from a detailed
survey of the impact of co-annihilations on the abundance, dissecting the

amplify radio-frequency (RF) signals with numerous applications, including
radar, television and telephone satellite communications. TWT design in a
nutshell comprises of a pencil-like electron beam (e-beam) in vacuum
interacting with guiding it slow-wave structure (SWS). In our studies here the
e-beam is represented by one-dimensional electron flow and SWS is represented
by a transmission line (TL). The interaction between the e-beam and the TL is
modeled by an analytic theory that generalizes the well-known Pierce model by
taking into account the so-called space-charge effects particularly
electron-to-electron repulsion (debunching). Many important aspects of the
analytic theory of TWTs have been already analyzed in our monograph on the
subject. The focus of the studies here is on degeneracies of the TWT dispersion
relations particularly on exceptional points of degeneracy and their
applications. The term exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) refers to the
property of the relevant matrix to have nontrivial Jordan block structure.

holding a global lock, collects requests by multiple threads for accessing a
concurrent data structure and applies their combined requests to it. Although
FC is sequential, it significantly reduces synchronization overheads and cache
invalidations and thus often provides better performance than that of lock-free
implementations. The recent emergence of non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies
increases the interest in the development of persistent concurrent objects.
These are objects that are able to recover from system failures and ensure
consistency by retaining their state in NVM and fixing it, if required, upon
recovery. Of particular interest are detectable objects that, in addition to
ensuring consistency, allow recovery code to infer if a failed operation took
effect before the crash and, if it did, obtain its response. In this work, we
present the first FC-based persistent object implementations. Specifically, we
introduce a detectable FC-based implementation of a concurrent LIFO stack, a
concurrent FIFO queue, and a double-ended queue. Our empirical evaluation
establishes that due to flat combining, the novel implementations require a
much smaller number of costly persistence instructions than competing
algorithms and are therefore able to significantly outperform them.

some approximations or computational techniques involving the distribution
function and the scattering terms. Only an attempt was devoted to opportunely
change the formulation of the free flight step but there is still a lack in the
literature regarding a both theoretical and computational analysis of corrected
Monte Carlo methods based on the free flights. In this paper we would like to
fulfill such a gap by analyzing deeper the role of the free flight step into a
Monte Carlo simulation, its physical properties and the conditions that allow
us to preserve the physical consistency of the method.

on a free function of the five independent quadratic contractions of the

restrict the Taylor coefficients of the free function with the help of the PPN

whose PPN parameters are identical to those of general relativity, and thus in
full agreement with observations. For three further families, we find that only
the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deviate, but can be brought arbitrarily
close to their general relativity values by an appropriate choice of the

with observations. The remaining theories either possess no well-defined

external control drives that vary in both space and time. We find that the

resetting in one dimension. In contrast to the usual setting where the particle
is instantaneously reset to a preferred location (say, the origin), here we
consider a finite time resetting process facilitated by an external linear
potential $V(x)=\lambda|x|~ (\lambda>0)$. When resetting occurs, the trap is
switched on and the particle experiences a force $-\partial_x V(x)$ which helps
the particle to return to the resetting location. The trap is switched off as
soon as the particle makes a first passage to the origin. Subsequently, the
particle resumes its free diffusion motion and the process keeps repeating. In
this set-up, the system attains a non-equilibrium steady state. We study the
relaxation to this steady state by analytically computing the position
distribution of the particle at all time and then analysing this distribution
using the spectral properties of the corresponding Fokker-Planck operator. As
seen for the instantaneous resetting problem, we observe a `cone spreading'
relaxation with travelling fronts such that there is an inner core region
around the resetting point that reaches the steady state, while the region
outside the core still grows ballistically with time. In addition to the
unusual relaxation phenomena, we compute the large deviation functions
associated to the corresponding probability density and find that the large
deviation functions describe a dynamical transition similar to what is seen
previously in case of instantaneous resetting. Notably, our method, based on
spectral properties, complements the existing renewal formalism and reveals the
intricate mathematical structure responsible for such relaxation phenomena. We
verify our analytical results against extensive numerical simulations.

corrresponding emission patterns, using both perturbative and exact treatments.
Our calculations show an asymmetric dynamical behavior when the emitter is

and hopping terms in the bath Hamiltonian both enriches the observed
phenomenology and increases the tunability of the interaction. Finally, we
analyze the competition between the coherent and dissipative components of the

increased variability of metallicity between $1.25-1.75 R_e$, and elevated HI

that inflow-associated gas ought to reside far from the star-forming disk. We

hadronic phase shifts that fulfills the Levinson theorem. The change in the
composition of the system from a hadron resonance gas to a quark-gluon plasma
takes place in the narrow temperature interval of $150 - 185$ MeV where the
Mott dissociation of hadrons is triggered by the dropping quark mass as a
result of the restoration of chiral symmetry. The deconfinement of quark and
gluon degrees of freedom is regulated by the Polyakov loop variable that
signals the breaking of the $Z(3)$ center symmetry of the color $SU(3)$ group
of QCD. We suggest a Polyakov-loop quark-gluon plasma model with
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ virial correction and solve the stationarity condition
of the thermodynamic potential (gap equation) for the Polyakov loop. The
resulting pressure is in excellent agreement with lattice QCD simulations up to
high temperatures.

including Schrodinger cat-like states. Such states are sensitive to decoherence
from their environment. Recently, in Ref. [1] we computed the rate of
decoherence of a piece of superposed matter that primarily only interacts
gravitationally, a dark-matter-Schrodinger-cat-state (DMSCS), within the
nonrelativistic approximation. In this work we improve this to a general
relativistic analysis. We firstly derive a single particle relativistic
Schrodinger equation for a probe particle that passes through the DMSCS; the
interaction is provided by the weak field metric of general relativity from the
source. For a static DMSCS we find a neat generalization of our previous
results. We then turn to the interesting new case of a time dependent DMSCS,
which can be provided by a coherently oscillating axion field leading to
superposed time dependent oscillations in the metric; a truly quantum-general
relativistic phenomenon. We use scattering theory to derive the decoherence
rate in all these cases. When the DMSCS is in a superposition of distinct
density profiles, we find that the decoherence rate can be appreciable. We then
consider the novel special case in which the density is not in a superposition,
but the phase of its field oscillation is; this is a property that cannot be
decohered within the nonrelativistic framework. We find that if the probe
particle and/or the DMSCS's velocity dispersion is slow, then the rate of
decoherence of the phase is exponentially suppressed. However, if both the
probe and the DMSCS's velocity dispersion are relativistic, then the phase can
decohere more rapidly. As applications, we find that diffuse galactic axions
with superposed phases are robust against decoherence, while dense boson stars
and regions near black hole horizons are not, and we discuss implications for
experiment.

Thus, it is worthwhile to revisit the simple model, the Kitaev chain, and study
the effects of weak and strong disorder on the Kitaev chain. By comparing the
role of disorder in a Kitaev chain with that in a nanowire, we find that
disorder affects both systems but in a nonuniversal manner. In general,
disorder has a much stronger effect on the nanowire than the Kitaev chain,
particularly for weak to intermediate disorder. For strong disorder, both the
Kitaev chain and nanowire manifest random featureless behavior due to universal
Anderson localization. Only the vanishing and strong disorder regimes are thus
universal, manifesting respectively topological superconductivity and Anderson
localization, but the experimentally relevant intermediate disorder regime is
nonuniversal with the details dependent on the disorder realization in the
system.

how non-axis-symmetric instabilities in galaxies (bars, spiral-arms, warps) can
lead to local exponential magnetic field growth by a radial flows beyond the
equipartition value by at least two orders of magnitude on a time-scale of a
few $100$ Myr. Our predictions show that the process can lead to galactic
outflows in barred spiral galaxies with a mass loading factor $\eta \approx
0.1$, in agreement with our numerical simulations. Moreover, our outflow
mechanism could contribute to an understanding of the large fraction of bared
spiral galaxies that show signs of galactic outflows in the CHANG-ES survey.
Extending our model shows the importance of such processes in high redshift
galaxies by assuming equipartition between magnetic energy and turbulent
energy. Simple estimates for the star formation rate (SFR) in our model
together with cross-correlated masses from the star-forming main-sequence at
redshifts $z\sim2$ allow us to estimate the outflow rate and mass loading
factors by non-axis-symmetric instabilities and a subsequent radial inflow
dynamo, giving mass loading factors of $\eta \approx 0.1$ for galaxies in the

baseline for 9248 quasars - 5 yr longer than prior studies that used only SDSS.
We fit the light curves with the damped random walk (DRW) model model - a
statistical description of their variability. We correlate the resulting DRW
model parameters: asymptotic variability amplitude SF$_{\infty}$, and
characteristic timescale $\tau$, with quasar physical properties - black hole
mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. Using simulated light curves, we
find that a longer baseline allows us to better constrain the DRW parameters.
After adding PS1 data, the variability amplitude is a stronger function of the
black hole mass, and has a weaker dependence on quasar luminosity. In addition,
the characteristic timescale $\tau$ dependence on quasar luminosity is
marginally weaker. We also make predictions for the fidelity of DRW model
parameter retrieval when light curves will be further extended with Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST) data. Finally, we show how updated DRW parameters offer an
independent method of discovering changing-look quasar candidates (CLQSOs). The
candidates are outliers in terms of differences in magnitude and scatter
between SDSS and PS1 segments. We identify 40 objects (35 newly reported) with
tenfold increase in variability timescale between SDSS and SDSS--PS1 data,

of ionised regions using the Betti numbers. These quantify the topology using
the number of components, tunnels and cavities in any given field. Based on the
results for a set of reionization simulations we find that the Betti numbers of
the ionisation field show a characteristic evolution during reionization, with
peaks in the different Betti numbers characterising different stages of the
process. The shapes of their evolutionary curves can be fitted with simple
analytical functions. We also observe that the evolution of the Betti numbers
shows a clear connection with the percolation of the ionized and neutral
regions and differs between different reionization scenarios. Through these
properties, the Betti numbers provide a more useful description of the topology
than the widely studied Euler characteristic or genus. The morphology of the
ionisation field will be imprinted on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the EoR.
We construct mock image cubes using the properties of the low-frequency element
of the future Square Kilometre Array and show that we can extract the Betti
numbers from such datasets if an observation time of 1000 h is used. Even for a
much shorter observation time of 100 h, some topological information can be
extracted for the middle and later stages of reionization. We also find that

constraints on reionization models.

telescope of the CMO SAI. The instrument is equipped with the HAWAII-2RG array.
A bad pixels classification of the ASTRONIRCAM detector is proposed. The
classification is based on histograms of the difference of consecutive
non-destructive readouts of a flat field. Bad pixels are classified into 5
groups: hot (saturated on the first readout), warm (the signal accumulation
rate is above the mean value by more than 5 standard deviations), cold (the
rate is under the mean value by more than 5 standard deviations), dead (no
signal accumulation), and inverse (having a negative signal accumulation in the
first readouts). Normal pixels of the ASTRONIRCAM detector account for 99.6% of
the total. We investigated the dependence between the amount of bad pixels and
the number of cooldown cycles of the instrument. While hot pixels remain the
same, the bad pixels of other types may migrate between groups. The number of
pixels in each group stays roughly constant. We found that the mean and
variance of the bad pixels amount in each group and the transitions between
groups do not differ noticeably between normal or slow cooldowns.

how the attachment kinetics can be augmented by edge-dependent surface
diffusion. Although there are significant uncertainties in developing an
accurate physical model of this process, it is possible to make some reasonable
estimates of surface diffusion rates and admolecule density enhancements,
derived from our basic understanding of ice-crystal growth processes. A
quantitative model suggests that edge-dependent surface diffusion could
substantially enhance terrace nucleation on narrow faceted surfaces, especially
at the onset of surface premelting. This result supports our hypothesized
mechanism for structure-dependent attachment kinetics, which readily explains
the changes in snow crystal growth morphology with temperature depicted in the
well-known Nakaya diagram. Many of the model features described here may be
amenable to further quantitative investigation using existing computational
models of the molecular structure and dynamics of the ice surface.

countable locally compact Hausdorff space, we investigate the statistical
approximation of the $L^2$-operator defined by $[Pf](x) := \mathbb{E}[ f(Y)

$P$ can be arbitrarily well approximated in operator norm by Hilbert--Schmidt
operators acting on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This fact allows to
estimate $P$ uniformly by finite-rank operators over a dense subspace even when
$P$ is not compact. In terms of modes of convergence, we thereby obtain the
superiority of kernel-based techniques over classically used parametric
projection approaches such as Galerkin methods. This also provides a novel
perspective on which limiting object the nonparametric estimate of $P$
converges to. As an application, we show that these results are particularly
important for a large family of spectral analysis techniques for Markov
transition operators. Our investigation also gives a new asymptotic perspective
on the so-called kernel conditional mean embedding, which is the theoretical
foundation of a wide variety of techniques in kernel-based nonparametric
inference.

oxide semiconductors, which are essential for realizing future oxide electronic
devices. Recently, p-type Sn2Nb2O7 and SnNb2O6 were developed; however,
enhanced hole mobility by reducing defect concentrations is required for
practical use. In this work, we investigate the correlation between the
formation of oxygen vacancy which may reduce the hole-generation efficiency and
hole mobility, and the crystal structure in Sn-Nb complex oxides. Extended
X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and Rietveld analysis of x-ray
diffraction revealed the preferential formation of oxygen vacancy at the O site
bonded to the Sn ions in both the tin niobates. Moreover, a large amount of
oxygen vacancy around the Sn ions were found in the p-type Sn2Nb2O7, thereby
indicating the effect of oxygen vacancy to the low hole-generation efficiency.
The dependence of the formation of oxygen vacancy on the crystal structure can
be elucidated from the Sn-O bond strength that is evaluated based on the bond
valence sum and Debye temperature. The differences in the bond strengths of the
two Sn-Nb complex oxides are correlated through the steric hindrance of Sn2+
with asymmetric electron density distribution. This suggests the importance of
the material design with a focus on the local structure around the Sn ions to
prevent the formation of oxygen vacancy in p-type Sn2+ oxides.

CO emission associated with the HzRG and derive a molecular gas mass of

a previously detected off-source CO emitting region (companion #1), and detect
three new potential companions. The molecular gas mass of each companion is
comparable to that of the HzRG. Companion #1 is aligned with the axis of the
radio jet and has stellar emission detected by Spitzer. Thus this source might
be a normal star-forming galaxy or alternatively a result of jet-induced star
formation. The newly found CO sources do not have counterparts in any other

three-dimensional ferromagnet in the ABC stacking honeycomb lattice, motivated
by the recent inelastic neutron scattering study of CrI$_3$. We show that the
magnon band structure and Chern numbers of the magnon branches are
significantly affected by the interlayer coupling $J_c$, which moreover has a
qualitatively different effect in the ABC stacking compared to the AA stacking
adopted by other authors. The nontrivial Chern number of the lowest magnon band
is stabilized by the next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in
each honeycomb layer, resulting in the hopping term similar to that in the
electronic Haldane model for graphene. However, we also find several gapless
Weyl points, separating the non-equivalent Chern insulating phases, tuned by
the ratio of the interlayer coupling $J_c$ and the third-neighbour Heisenberg
interaction $J_3$. We further show that the topological character of magnon
bands results in non-zero thermal Hall conductivity, whose sign and magnitude
depend on $J_c$ and the intra-layer couplings. Since the interlayer coupling
strength $J_c$ can be easily tuned by applying pressure to the quasi-2D
material such as CrI$_3$, this provides a potential route to tuning the magnon
thermal Hall effect in an experiment.

internal properties of nearby stars. Often, this characterization is achieved
by fitting stellar evolution models to asteroseismic observations. The star
under investigation is then assumed to have the properties of the best-fitting
model, such as its age. However, the models do not fit the observations
perfectly. This is due to incorrect or missing physics in stellar evolution
calculations, resulting in predicted stellar structures that are discrepant
with reality. Through an inverse analysis of the asteroseismic data, it is
possible to go further than fitting stellar models, and instead infer details
about the actual internal structure of the star at some locations in its
interior. Comparing theoretical and observed stellar structures then enables
the determination of the locations where the stellar models have discrepant
structure, and illuminates a path for improvements to our understanding of
stellar evolution. In this invited review, we describe the methods of
asteroseismic inversions, and outline the progress that is being made towards
measuring the interiors of stars.

energetic X-ray pulsar PSR J0537-6910 using data from the second and third
observing runs of LIGO and Virgo. The search is enabled by a contemporaneous
timing ephemeris obtained using NICER data. The NICER ephemeris has also been
extended through 2020 October and includes three new glitches. PSR J0537-6910
has the largest spin-down luminosity of any pulsar and is highly active with
regards to glitches. Analyses of its long-term and inter-glitch braking indices
provided intriguing evidence that its spin-down energy budget may include
gravitational-wave emission from a time-varying mass quadrupole moment. Its 62
Hz rotation frequency also puts its possible gravitational-wave emission in the
most sensitive band of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Motivated by these considerations,
we search for gravitational-wave emission at both once and twice the rotation
frequency. We find no signal, however, and report our upper limits. Assuming a
rigidly rotating triaxial star, our constraints reach below the
gravitational-wave spin-down limit for this star for the first time by more
than a factor of two and limit gravitational waves from the $l=m=2$ mode to
account for less than 14% of the spin-down energy budget. The fiducial
equatorial ellipticity is limited to less than about 3e-5, which is the third
best constraint for any young pulsar.

  proximity tracing applications",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Digital proximity tracing (DPT) for Sars-CoV-2 pandemic mitigation is a
complex intervention with the primary goal to notify app users about possible
risk exposures to infected persons. Policymakers and DPT operators need to know
whether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance)
and whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation
(also in comparison to and beyond established mitigation measures, particularly
manual contact tracing). Thereby, performance and effectiveness are not to be
confused. Not only are there conceptual differences but also diverse data
requirements. This article describes differences between performance and
effectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification
system for DPT evaluation. We discuss key aspects for critical assessments of
whether the integration of additional data measurements into DPT apps - beyond
what is required to fulfill its primary notification role - may facilitate an
understanding of performance and effectiveness of planned and deployed DPT
apps. Therefore, the terminology and a classification matrix may offer some
guidance to DPT system operators regarding which measurements to prioritize.
DPT developers and operators may also make conscious decisions to integrate
measures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this introduces a
secondary purpose to DPT that is not part of the original DPT design.
Ultimately, the integration of further information for epidemic monitoring into
DPT involves a trade-off between data granularity and linkage on the one hand,
and privacy on the other. Decision-makers should be aware of the trade-off and
take it into account when planning and developing DPT notification and
monitoring systems or intending to assess the added value of DPT relative to
existing contact tracing systems.

conditions is crucial for developing high-fidelity simulations of chemically
reacting flows in liquid-fueled combustion systems. The study of vapor-liquid
equilibrium (VLE) curves also forms an integral part of the design and modeling
of the control processes in chemical and oil-gas industries. The main objective
of this study was to develop data-driven models to predict VLE of Type III
binary mixtures involving long-chained n-alkanes and nitrogen. Two data-driven
models have been proposed in this study, each of which was competent in
estimating VLE for the binary systems of C10/N2 and C12/N2, at pressures
ranging up to 50-60 MPa. Both the models showed better performance (less
average absolute percentage error) in predicting equilibrium pressure of the
binary mixtures as compared to the VLE modeled using Peng-Robinson equation of
state (PR-EOS). The data-driven models were also able to correctly trace the
change in curvature of the vapor phase composition, close to the mixture
critical point, at high pressures and temperatures-a feature of the
n-alkane/nitrogen system VLE which the PR-EOS model fails to capture.

viscosity for values of the alpha viscosity parameter larger than 1.e-4 . At
lower viscosities previous studies, based on 2D simulations have shown that
migration can be very chaotic and often characterized by phases of fast
migration. The reason is that in low-viscosity discs vortices appear due to the
Rossby-wave instability at the edges of the gap opened by the planet. Migration
is then determined by vortex-planet interactions. Our aim is to study migration
in low viscosity 3D discs. We performed numerical simulations using 2D
(including self-gravity) and 3D codes. After selecting disc masses for which
self-gravity is not important, 3D simulations without self-gravity can be
safely used. In our nominal simulation only numerical viscosity is present. We
then performed simulations with prescribed viscosity to assess the threshold
below which the new migration processes appear. We show that for alpha
viscosity <= 1.e-5 two migration modes are possible which differ from classical
Type-II migration, in the sense that they are not proportional to the disc's
viscosity. The first occurs when the gap opened by the planet is not very deep.
This occurs in 3D simulations and/or when a big vortex forms at the outer edge
of the planetary gap, diffusing material into the gap. We call this type of
migration ""vortex-driven migration"". This migration is very slow and cannot
continue indefinitely, because eventually the vortex dissolves. The second
migration mode occurs when the gap is deep so that the planet's eccentricity
grows to a value ~0.2 due to inefficient eccentricity damping by corotation
resonances. This second, faster migration mode appears to be typical of 2D
models in discs with slower damping of temperature's perturbations.

  Detection: Peculiar Observations and New Insights","extensive revision",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  It is common practice of the outlier mining community to repurpose
classification datasets toward evaluating various detection models. To that
end, often a binary classification dataset is used, where samples from one of
the classes is designated as the inlier samples, and the other class is
substantially down-sampled to create the ground-truth outlier samples.
Graph-level outlier detection (GLOD) is rarely studied but has many potentially
influential real-world applications. In this study, we identify an intriguing
issue with repurposing graph classification datasets for GLOD. We find that
ROC-AUC performance of the models changes significantly (flips from high to
very low, even worse than random) depending on which class is down-sampled.
Interestingly, ROC-AUCs on these two variants approximately sum to 1 and their
performance gap is amplified with increasing propagations for a certain family
of propagation based outlier detection models. We carefully study the graph
embedding space produced by propagation based models and find two driving
factors: (1) disparity between within-class densities which is amplified by
propagation, and (2)overlapping support (mixing of embeddings) across classes.
We also study other graph embedding methods and downstream outlier detectors,
and find that the intriguing performance flip issue still widely exists but
which version of the downsample achieves higher performance may vary.
Thoughtful analysis over comprehensive results further deeper our understanding
of the established issue.

spin-orbit scattering, magnetic-impurity scattering, and Zeeman splitting
induced by both the magnetic insulator and a supplemental applied field. Within
this framework we explore prospects for engineering topological
superconductivity in a nanowire proximate to the bilayer. We find that a
magnetic-insulator-induced Zeeman splitting, mediated through the
superconductor alone, cannot induce a topological phase since the destruction
of superconductivity (i.e., Clogston limit) preempts the required regime in
which the nanowire's Zeeman energy exceeds the induced pairing strength.
However, this Zeeman splitting does reduce the critical applied field needed to
access the topological phase transition, with fields antiparallel to the
magnetization of the magnetic insulator having an optimal effect. Finally, we
show that magnetic-impurity scattering degrades the topological phase, and
spin-orbit scattering, if present in the superconductor, pushes the Clogston
limit to higher fields yet simultaneously increases the critical applied field
strength.

Paradoxically, less research has addressed privacy protection, compared to

Learning (AL) presents itself as a feasible solution that focuses on data
deemed useful for model training. Building upon the recent advances in risk
analysis for ER, which can provide a more refined estimate on label
misprediction risk than the simpler classifier outputs, we propose a novel AL
approach of risk sampling for ER. Risk sampling leverages misprediction risk
estimation for active instance selection. Based on the core-set
characterization for AL, we theoretically derive an optimization model which
aims to minimize core-set loss with non-uniform Lipschitz continuity. Since the
defined weighted K-medoids problem is NP-hard, we then present an efficient
heuristic algorithm. Finally, we empirically verify the efficacy of the
proposed approach on real data by a comparative study. Our extensive
experiments have shown that it outperforms the existing alternatives by
considerable margins. Using ER as a test case, we demonstrate that risk
sampling is a promising approach potentially applicable to other challenging
classification tasks.

different model parameters could generate a variety of emergent adaptive and
maladaptive behaviours that are relevant to developmental and clinical
psychology: the ability to be resilient in the face of obstacles through
imaginary projections, the emergence of social approach and joint attention
behaviours, the ability to take advantage of false beliefs attributed to
others, the emergence of avoidance behaviours as observed in social anxiety
disorders, the presence of restricted interests as observed in autism spectrum

technique of abstract interpretation, in which an approximate execution model
is used to determine if an unfinished program will eventually satisfy a goal
specification. Here we learn an approximate execution model implemented as a
modular neural network. By constructing compositional program representations
that implicitly encode the interpretation semantics of the underlying
programming language, we can represent partial programs using a flexible
combination of concrete execution state and learned neural representations,
using the learned approximate semantics when concrete semantics are not known
(in unfinished parts of the program). We show that these hybrid neuro-symbolic
representations enable execution-guided synthesizers to use more powerful
language constructs, such as loops and higher-order functions, and can be used
to synthesize programs more accurately for a given search budget than pure

$(\mathbb{S}^n_+,g), \, n \geq 5$, which consists of finding conformal metrics

involving the critical Sobolev exponent: \begin{equation*} (\mathcal{P}) \quad

  This problem has a variational structure but the related Euler-Lagrange
functional $J_K$ lacks compactness. Indeed it admits \emph{critical points at
infinity}, which are \emph{limits} of non compact orbits of the (negative)
gradient flow. Through the construction of an appropriate \emph{pseudogradient}
in the \emph{neighborhood at infinity}, we characterize these \emph{critical

contribution to the difference of topology between the level sets of $J_K$,
hence extending the full Morse theoretical approach to this \emph{non compact
variational problem}. Such an approach is used to prove, under various pinching
conditions, some existence results for $(\mathcal{P})$ on half spheres of

waves, quasi-monochromatic signals that last for many years, or transient
continuous waves, signals whose frequency evolution follows a power law and
last for $\mathcal{O}$(hours-months). We show that primordial black hole
binaries in our galaxy may produce detectable gravitational waves for different
mass functions and formation mechanisms. In order to detect these inspirals, we
adapt methods originally designed to search for gravitational waves from
asymmetrically rotating neutron stars. The first method, the Frequency-Hough,
exploits the continuous, quasi-monochromatic nature of inspiraling black holes
that are sufficiently light and far apart such that their orbital frequencies
can be approximated as linear with a small spin-up. The second method, the
Generalized Frequency-Hough, drops the assumption of linearity and allows the
signal frequency to follow a power-law evolution. We explore the parameter
space to which each method is sensitive, derive a theoretical sensitivity
estimate, determine optimal search parameters and calculate the computational
cost of all-sky and directed searches. We forecast limits on the abundance of
primordial black holes within our galaxy, showing that we can constrain the
fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes compose, $f_{\rm PBH}$, to
be $f_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 1$ for chirp masses between $[4\times

information from the brightfield images to generate virtually-stained images,
which can be used in subsequent downstream quantitative analyses of cell
structures. Specifically, we train a cGAN to virtually stain lipid droplets,
cytoplasm, and nuclei using brightfield images of human stem-cell-derived fat
cells (adipocytes), which are of particular interest for nanomedicine and
vaccine development. Subsequently, we use these virtually-stained images to
extract quantitative measures about these cell structures. Generating
virtually-stained fluorescence images is less invasive, less expensive, and
more reproducible than standard chemical staining; furthermore, it frees up the
fluorescence microscopy channels for other analytical probes, thus increasing
the amount of information that can be extracted from each cell.

first formalise the concept of label consistency, determine a sufficient

that reduces label inconsistency caused by objects' movements from one node's
limited FoV to another. Second, we develop a distributed multi-object fusion
algorithm that fuses local multi-object state estimates instead of local
multi-object densities. This algorithm: i) requires significantly less
processing time than multi-object density fusion methods; ii) achieves better
tracking accuracy by considering Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) tracking
errors over several scans rather than a single scan; iii) is agnostic to local
multi-object tracking techniques, and only requires each node to provide a set
of estimated tracks. Thus, it is not necessary to assume that the nodes
maintain multi-object densities, and hence the fusion outcomes do not modify
local multi-object densities. Numerical experiments demonstrate our proposed

use increased the demand on vision based object detection algorithms for aerial
images. Object detection process is inherently a challenging task as a generic
computer vision problem, however, since the use of object detection algorithms
on UAVs (or on drones) is relatively a new area, it remains as a more
challenging problem to detect objects in aerial images. There are several
reasons for that including: (i) the lack of large drone datasets including
large object variance, (ii) the large orientation and scale variance in drone
images when compared to the ground images, and (iii) the difference in texture
and shape features between the ground and the aerial images. Deep learning
based object detection algorithms can be classified under two main categories:
(a) single-stage detectors and (b) multi-stage detectors. Both single-stage and
multi-stage solutions have their advantages and disadvantages over each other.
However, a technique to combine the good sides of each of those solutions could
yield even a stronger solution than each of those solutions individually. In
this paper, we propose an ensemble network, SyNet, that combines a multi-stage
method with a single-stage one with the motivation of decreasing the high false

atmospheric properties of exoplanets. To provide the basis for the
interpretation of observational results and for predictive studies to guide
future observations, sophisticated analysis tools are required. Our goal is to
develop a radiative transfer tool that contains all the relevant continuum
polarization mechanisms for the comprehensive analysis of the polarized flux
resulting from the scattering in the atmosphere of, on the surface of, and in
the local planetary environment (e.g., planetary rings, exomoons) of
extra-solar planets. Furthermore, our goal is to avoid common simplifications
such as locally plane-parallel planetary atmospheres, the missing cross-talk
between latitudinal and longitudinal regions, or the assumption of either a
point-like star or plane-parallel illumination. As a platform for the newly
developed numerical algorithms, we use the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code POLARIS. The code is extended and optimized for the radiative transfer in
exoplanetary atmospheres. We investigate the reflected flux and its degree of
polarization for different phase angles for a homogeneous cloud-free atmosphere
and an inhomogeneous cloudy atmosphere. To take advantage of the 3D radiative
transfer and to demonstrate the potential of the code, the impact of an
additional circumplanetary ring on the reflected polarized flux is studied. The
presence of a circumplanetary ring consisting of small water-ice particles has
a noticeable impact on the reflected polarized radiation. In particular, the
reflected flux strongly increases at larger phase angles if the planetary orbit
is seen edge-on because the considered particles tend to scatter forwards. In
contrast, the degree of polarization decreases at these phase angles.

of magnitude. We compare the observed CCH/HC$_{5}$N ratios with hot-core model

best reproduced by models when the gas temperature is $\sim 85$ K, which is
higher than in L1527, a low-mass WCCC source ($\sim 35$ K). These results
suggest that carbon-chain molecules detected around the MYSOs exist at least
partially in higher temperature regions than those in low-mass WCCC sources.

between hadronic nuclear matter to quark matter exists in supranuclear matter
equations of state. Such a feature can be probed via gravitational-wave signals
from binary neutron star inspirals that contain information of the induced
tides. The dynamical part of the tides is caused by the resonance of pulsation
modes of stars, which causes a shift in the gravitational-wave phase. In this
paper, we investigate the dynamical tides of the interfacial mode ($i$-mode) of
spherical degree $l=2$, a non-radial mode caused by an interface associated
with a quark-hadron phase transition inside a hybrid star. In particular, we
focus on hybrid stars with a crystalline quark matter core and a fluid hadronic
envelope. We find that the resonant frequency of such $i$-modes typically
ranges from 300Hz to 1500Hz, and the frequency increases as the shear modulus
of the quark core increases. We next estimate the detectability of such a mode
with existing and future gravitational-wave events from the inspiral waveform
with a Fisher analysis. We find that GW170817 and GW190425 have the potential
to detect the $i$-mode if the quark-hadron phase transition occurs at
sufficiently low pressure and the shear modulus of the quark matter phase is
large enough. We also find that the third-generation gravitational-wave
detectors can further probe the $i$-mode with intermediate transition pressure.
This finding opens a new, interesting direction for probing the existence of
quark core inside a neutron star.

nonvolatile memories or neuromorphic computing. V3O5, a compound of the
vanadium oxide Magn\'eli series, is one of the rare materials to exhibit an
insulator-metal transition (IMT) above room temperature (Tc ~ 415 K). Here we
demonstrate both static dc resistive switching (RS) and fast oscillatory
spiking regimes in V3O5 devices at room temperature (120 K below the phase
transition temperature) by applying an electric field. We use operando optical
imaging to track a reflectivity change during the RS and find that a
percolating high temperature metallic phase filament is formed. This
demonstrates that the electrically induced RS triggers the phase transition.
Furthermore, we optically capture the spiking oscillations that we link to the
negative differential resistance regime and find the filament forms and
dissolves via a periodic spatio-temporal instability that we describe by
numerical simulations.

different approaches, by arguing that ultimately, charge quantization is not an

geometric signatures in the correlations of the supercurrent. We illustrate
these findings at the example Josephson junction arrays in the superinductor

Their use is, however, severely hampered by their computation cost. This issue
can be overcome by an algorithm called Game of Thieves (GoT). Thanks to this
new algorithm, we can compute the importance of all elements in a network (i.e.
vertices and edges), compared to the total number of vertices. This calculation
is done not in a quadratic time, as when we use the classical methods, but in
polylogarithmic time. Starting from this we present our results on the

with fixed-time convergence is achieved by using real time measurements of the

it defines the energy production and the cycle time that lead to the lifetime
of massive stars, and it is an important tool for the determination of the age
of globular clusters. One of the largest uncertainties in the CNO chain of
reactions comes from the uncertainty in the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction
rate. This uncertainty arises predominantly from the uncertainty in the
lifetime of the sub-threshold state in $^{15}$O at $E_{x}$ = 6792 keV. Previous
measurements of this state's lifetime are significantly discrepant. Here, we
report on a new lifetime measurement of this state, as well as the excited
states in $^{15}$O at $E_{x}$ = 5181 keV and $E_{x}$ = 6172 keV, via the
$^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction at proton energies of $E_{p} = 1020$ keV
and $E_{p} = 1570$ keV. The lifetimes have been determined with the
Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method (DSAM) with three separate, nitrogen-implanted
targets with Mo, Ta, and W backing. We obtained lifetimes from the weighted
average of the three measurements, allowing us to account for systematic
differences between the backing materials. For the 6792 keV state, we obtained
a $\tau = 0.6 \pm 0.4$ fs. To provide cross-validation of our method, we
measured the known lifetimes of the states at 5181 keV and 6172 keV to be $\tau

of the reachable state space of a system subject to disturbances and controlled
by policies obtained with the modified reward. Our analysis shows that the
modified policies do produce much smaller reachable meshes. This shows that
agents trained with the fractal dimension reward transfer their desirable
quality of having a more compact state space to a setting with external

due to high computational cost, larger data volumes and the difficulty of
achieving consistency in the spatio-temporal domain. In practice, these
challenges are often coupled with the lack of example pairs, which inhibits the
application of supervised learning strategies. To address these challenges, we
propose an efficient adversarial video enhancement framework that learns
directly from unpaired video examples. In particular, our framework introduces
new recurrent cells that consist of interleaved local and global modules for
implicit integration of spatial and temporal information. The proposed design
allows our recurrent cells to efficiently propagate spatio-temporal information
across frames and reduces the need for high complexity networks. Our setting
enables learning from unpaired videos in a cyclic adversarial manner, where the
proposed recurrent units are employed in all architectures. Efficient training
is accomplished by introducing one single discriminator that learns the joint
distribution of source and target domain simultaneously. The enhancement
results demonstrate clear superiority of the proposed video enhancer over the
state-of-the-art methods, in all terms of visual quality, quantitative metrics,
and inference speed. Notably, our video enhancer is capable of enhancing over
35 frames per second of FullHD video (1080x1920).

Employing persistent homology with a flat filtration provides for alternative

the finite periodic approach is valid for any natural number $n$ and allows one
to determine analytical expressions for scattering amplitudes and dispersion
relations. It was shown, for frequencies below $\omega_{p}$ and large
metallic-layer thickness, that under the common assumption that fields inside
conductors move along the so-called ""true"" angle that defines the orientation
of the constant-phase planes, anomalous results appear with an apparent parity
effect. This issue is addressed here and it is shown that those results are due
to the lack of unitarity and the underlying phenomena of absorption and loss of
energy. Two compatible approaches are presented here to solve the lack of
unitarity and to account for the absorption phenomenon. We show that by keeping
the complex angles, the principle of flux conservation is fully satisfied,

to improve the formalism when the real angle assumption is made. We show that
by taking into account the induced currents and the requirement of flux

At present,
most of the practical applications of machine learning use classic models based
on big data to solve the problem of small data sets. However, the deep neural
network model has complex structure, huge model parameters, and training
requires more advanced equipment, which brings certain difficulties to the
application. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of union convolution,
designing a light deep network model union-net with a shallow network structure
and adapting to small data sets. This model combines convolutional network
units with different combinations of the same input to form a union module.
Each union module is equivalent to a convolutional layer. The serial input and
output between the 3 modules constitute a ""3-layer"" neural network. The output
of each union module is fused and added as the input of the last convolutional
layer to form a complex network with a 4-layer network structure. It solves the
problem that the deep network model network is too deep and the transmission
path is too long, which causes the loss of the underlying information
transmission. Because the model has fewer model parameters and fewer channels,
it can better adapt to small data sets. It solves the problem that the deep
network model is prone to overfitting in training small data sets. Use the
public data sets cifar10 and 17flowers to conduct multi-classification
experiments. Experiments show that the Union-net model can perform well in
classification of large data sets and small data sets. It has high practical

during all rounds. In each round, our approach plays a base algorithm to keep
the candidate regret bounds of all remaining base algorithms balanced, and
eliminates algorithms that violate their candidate bound. We prove that the
total regret of this approach is bounded by the best valid candidate regret
bound times a multiplicative factor. This factor is reasonably small in several
applications, including linear bandits and MDPs with nested function classes,
linear bandits with unknown misspecification, and LinUCB applied to linear
bandits with different confidence parameters. We further show that, under a
suitable gap-assumption, this factor only scales with the number of base
algorithms and not their complexity when the number of rounds is large enough.
Finally, unlike recent efforts in model selection for linear stochastic

attracted considerable interest in the ""extreme mechanics"" community.
Nevertheless, key aspects of this notable phenomenon remain elusive.
Specifically -- what is the origin of the compressive stress underlying the

how does the shape evolve from a critical, near-threshold regime to a
fully-developed pattern of parallel wrinkles that permeate most of the sheet?

transverse compression is a boundary effect, which originates from the relative
extension of the clamped edges with respect to the transversely-contracted,
compression-free bulk of the sheet, and draw analogy between this edge-induced
compression and Moffatt vortices in viscous, cavity-driven flow. Next we
address the instability of the planar state and show that it gives rise to a
buckling pattern, localized near the clamped edges, which evolves -- upon
increasing the tensile load -- to wrinkles that invade the uncompressed portion
of the sheet. Crucially, we show that the key aspects of the process -- from
the formation of transversely-compressed zones, to the consequent instability
of the planar state and the emergence of a wrinkle pattern -- can be understood
within a Hookean framework, where the only origin of nonlinear response is
geometric, rather than a non-Hookean stress-strain relation.

interaction of axisymmetric internal gravity waves in a resonant cavity,
supported by theoretical considerations. Contrary to plane waves in Cartesian
coordinates, for which self-interacting terms are null in a linear
stratifiation, the non-linear self-interaction of an internal wave mode in
axisymmetric geometry is found to be efficient at producing super-harmonics,
i.e. waves whose frequencies are integer multiples of the excitation frequency.
Due to the range of frequencies tested in our experiments, the first harmonic
frequency is below the cut-off imposed by the stratification so the lowest
harmonic created can always propagate. The study shows that the super-harmonic
wave field is a sum of standing waves satisfying both the dispersion relation
for internal waves and the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity walls,
while conserving the axisymmetry.

significantly improve the viability of neural methods for systematically

photoacoustic simulation, in this paper, we propose a straightforward
simulation approach based on superposed Wave (s-Wave). Specifically, we treat
the initial pressure distribution as a set of single pixels. Then by
pre-obtaining a standard sensor data from single pixel, we can easily use loop
and multiplication operators to change phase and amplitude of sensor data for
given pixels. We use three different 2D samples and two 3D samples to test the
time cost. The result of our proposed s-Wave method shows much less time
consumption compared with k-wave. Especially in a sparse configuration in 3D,
s-Wave is more than 2000 times faster than k-Wave, whiling getting nearly same

Hookean, rectangular-shaped sheet, when the longitudinal tensile load induces
transverse compression that far exceeds the stability threshold of a purely
planar deformation. At this ""far from threshold"" parameter regime, which has
been the subject of the celebrated Cerda-Mahadevan (CM) model, the wrinkle
pattern expands throughout the length of the sheet and the characteristic
wavelength of undulations is much smaller than its width. Employing Surface
Evolver simulations over a range of sheet thicknesses and tensile loads we
elucidate the theoretical underpinnings of the far-from-threshold framework in
this set-up. We show that the evolution of wrinkles comes in tandem with
collapse of transverse compressive stress, rather than vanishing transverse
strain, such that the stress field approaches asymptotically a compression-free
limit, describable by tension field theory. We compute the compression-free
stress field by simulating a Hookean sheet that has finite stretching modulus
but no bending rigidity, and show that this singular limit encapsulates the
geometrical nonlinearity underlying the amplitude-wavelength ratio of wrinkle
patterns in physical, highly bendable sheets, even though the actual strains
may be so small that the local mechanics is perfectly Hookean. Finally, we
revisit the balance of bending and stretching energies that gives rise to a
favorable wrinkle wavelength, and study the consequent dependence of the
wavelength on the tensile load as well as the thickness and length of the
sheet.

phonon modes softened markedly. A_1g mode frequency monotonically decreased as
temperature increased. Its damping rate remained virtually unchanged. As
expected, E_g decreased uniformly as temperatures rose. At temperatures above

We provide a general theoretical additive framework for designing mixed

leverage low precision computation of the implicit solver while retaining high

role of the B-field in the dynamical evolution of the NGC 6334 hub-filament

850$\mu$m towards NGC 6334 obtained with the JCMT/POL-2. We study the
distribution and dispersion of the polarized intensity ($PI$), the polarization
fraction ($PF$), and the B-field angle ($\theta_{B}$). We derive the power
spectrum of the intensity and $\theta_{B}$ along the ridge crest. Our analyses
show a complex B-field structure when observed over the whole region ($\sim10$
pc), however, at smaller scales ($\sim1$ pc), $\theta_{B}$ varies coherently
along the filaments. The observed power spectrum of $\theta_{B}$ can be well
represented with a power law function with a slope $-1.33\pm0.23$, which is
$\sim20\%$ shallower than that of $I$. This result is compatible with the
properties of simulated filaments and may indicate the processes at play in the
formation of filaments. $\theta_{B}$ rotates from being mostly perpendicular to
the filament crests to mostly parallel as they merge with the hubs. This
variation of $\theta_{B}$ may be tracing local velocity flows of matter
in-falling onto the hubs. Our analysis suggests a variation of the energy
balance along the crests of these filaments, from magnetically
critical/supercritical at their far ends to magnetically subcritical near the
hubs. We detect an increase of $PF$ towards the high-column density star
cluster-forming hubs that may result from the increase of grain alignment
efficiency due to stellar radiation from the newborn stars.

Python toolkit that implements four different NMA models in addition to popular
and novel metrics to benchmark and measure properties from these models.
Furthermore, the toolkit is available as a public Python package and is easily
extensible for the development or implementation of additional NMA models. The
inclusion of the ENCoM model (Elastic Network Contact Model) developed in our
group within NRGTEN is noteworthy, owing to its account for the specific
chemical nature of atomic interactions. This makes possible some unique
predictions of the effect of mutations, such as on stability (via changes in
vibrational entropy differences), on the transition probability between
different conformational states or on the flexibility profile of the whole
macromolecule/complex (to study allostery and signalling). In addition, all NMA
models can be used to generate conformational ensembles from a starting
structure to aid in protein-protein, protein-ligand or other docking studies
among applications. NRGTEN is freely available via a public Python package
which can be easily installed on any modern machine and includes a detailed

processing and analysis. It aims to separate mixed pixels into the component
materials and their corresponding abundances. Early solutions to spectral
unmixing are performed independently on each pixel. Nowadays, investigating
proper priors into the unmixing problem has been popular as it can
significantly enhance the unmixing performance. However, it is non-trivial to
handcraft a powerful regularizer, and complex regularizers may introduce extra
difficulties in solving optimization problems in which they are involved. To
address this issue, we present a plug-and-play (PnP) priors framework for
hyperspectral unmixing. More specifically, we use the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the optimization problem into two
iterative subproblems. One is a regular optimization problem depending on the
forward model, and the other is a proximity operator related to the prior model
and can be regarded as an image denoising problem. Our framework is flexible
and extendable which allows a wide range of denoisers to replace prior models
and avoids handcrafting regularizers. Experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real airborne data illustrate the superiority of the proposed strategy
compared with other state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.

Modeling correlated Wishart matrices is difficult since the joint density

paper, we propose an Expectation-Maximization composite likelihood-based

used for the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog (Eisenhardt et al., 2020), bringing
the total to six times as many exposures spanning over sixteen times as large a
time baseline as the AllWISE catalog. The other major change from the CatWISE
Preliminary Catalog is that the detection list for the CatWISE2020 Catalog was
generated using ${\it crowdsource}$ (Schlafly et al. 2019), while the CatWISE
Preliminary Catalog used the detection software used for AllWISE. These two
factors result in roughly twice as many sources in the CatWISE2020 Catalog. The
scatter with respect to ${\it Spitzer}$ photometry at faint magnitudes in the
COSMOS field, which is out of the Galactic plane and at low ecliptic latitude
(corresponding to lower WISE coverage depth) is similar to that for the CatWISE
Preliminary Catalog. The 90% completeness depth for the CatWISE2020 Catalog is
at W1=17.7 mag and W2=17.5 mag, 1.7 mag deeper than in the CatWISE Preliminary
Catalog. From comparison to ${\it Gaia}$, CatWISE2020 motions are accurate at
the 20 mas yr$^{-1}$ level for W1$\sim$15 mag sources, and at the $\sim100$ mas
yr$^{-1}$ level for W1$\sim$17 mag sources. This level of precision represents
a 12$\times$ improvement over AllWISE. The CatWISE catalogs are available in
the WISE/NEOWISE Enhanced and Contributed Products area of the NASA/IPAC

applications such as fraud detection, fake account and review detection, user's

Various methods such as pairwise Markov Random Fields (pMRF) and graph neural
networks were developed for semi-supervised node classification. pMRF is more
efficient than graph neural networks. However, existing pMRF-based methods are
less accurate than graph neural networks, due to a key limitation that they
assume a heuristics-based constant edge potential for all edges. In this work,
we aim to address the key limitation of existing pMRF-based methods. In
particular, we propose to learn edge potentials for pMRF. Our evaluation
results on various types of graph datasets show that our optimized pMRF-based
method consistently outperforms existing graph neural networks in terms of both
accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight that previous work may have
underestimated the power of pMRF for semi-supervised node classification.

different thicknesses were prepared. The influence of film thickness on
structure, electrical and optical properties was studied. The XRD patterns were
utilized to determine the structural parameters (lattice strain and crystallite
size) of ITO with different thicknesses. It is observed that the average
crystallite size increases as the film thickness increases, but the lattice
strain decreases. SEM shows that as the film thickness increases, the grain
size of ITO increases and improves. The electrical properties of ITO films with
different thicknesses were measured by the standard four-point probe method. It
can be seen that as the thickness of the ITO film increases from 75 nm to 325
nm, the resistivity decreases from 29x10^-4 Ohm/cm to 1.65x10^-4 Ohm/cm. This
means that ITO films with lower electrical properties will be more suitable for
high-efficiency CdTe solar cells. Three optical layer models (adhesive layer of
the substrate/B-spline layer of ITO film/surface roughness layer) are used to
calculate the film thickness with high-precision ellipsometry. In the higher
T(lambda) and R(lambda) absorption regions, the absorption coefficient is
determined to calculate the optical energy gap, which increases from 3.56 eV to
3.69 eV. Finally, the effects of ITO layers of various thicknesses on the
performance of CdS/CdTe solar cells are also studied. When the thickness of the
ITO window layer is 325 nm, Voc = 0.82 V, Jsc = 17 mA/cm2, and FF = 57.4%, the

learning to learn a latent space where features are close for similar data

tremendous success for pretraining both image and point cloud feature

include pairs where one of the two modalities has been disturbed and/or the two

DRL powered intelligent devices. While substantial efforts have been devoted to
compressing other deep learning models, existing works barely touch the surface
of compressing DRL. In this work, we first identify that there exists an
optimal model size of DRL that can maximize both the test scores and

the first neural architecture search (NAS) applied to DRL to automatically

fail in searching for the optimal agents, due to its resulting high variance in
DRL training stability, and then develop a novel distillation mechanism to

stabilize the searching process and improve the searched agents' optimality.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies consistently validate our findings

tasks, i.e., the legal case retrieval task and the legal case entailment task.
Task 1 (the retrieval task) aims to automatically identify supporting cases
from the case law corpus given a new case, and Task 2 (the entailment task) to
identify specific paragraphs that entail the decision of a new case in a
relevant case. In both tasks, we employed the neural models for semantic
understanding and the traditional retrieval models for exact matching. As a
result, our team (TLIR) ranked 2nd among all of the teams in Task 1 and 3rd
among teams in Task 2. Experimental results suggest that combing models of
semantic understanding and exact matching benefits the legal case retrieval

neural networks on adversarial examples, among which provable defense methods
have been demonstrated to be effective to train neural networks that are
certifiably robust to the attacker. However, most of these provable defense
methods treat all examples equally during training process, which ignore the
inconsistent constraint of certified robustness between correctly classified
(natural) and misclassified examples. In this paper, we explore this
inconsistency caused by misclassified examples and add a novel consistency
regularization term to make better use of the misclassified examples.
Specifically, we identified that the certified robustness of network can be
significantly improved if the constraint of certified robustness on
misclassified examples and correctly classified examples is consistent.
Motivated by this discovery, we design a new defense regularization term called
Misclassification Aware Adversarial Regularization (MAAR), which constrains the
output probability distributions of all examples in the certified region of the
misclassified example. Experimental results show that our proposed MAAR
achieves the best certified robustness and comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10 and

the invariance of the dimension. In contrast with almost everybody else,
Lebesgue worked with cubes rather than with simplices. His methods were
developed by Hurewicz and Lusternik-Schnirelmann and then forgotten. In the

  After this, we present a new approach to Lebesgue and Lusternik-Schnirelmann
theorems which is both conceptual and elementary. It is based on adaptation of
Serre's definition of products of singular cubical cochains to discrete

approach also clarifies the cubical versions of Sperner lemma of Kuhn and Ky
Fan. In particular, Ky Fan's lemma can be understood as a natural strengthening
of Lebesgue or Kuhn's results under a transversality assumption.

measures the worst-case error of the quantum simulation, while practical
simulation concerns the error with respect to a given initial vector at hand.
We demonstrate that under suitable assumptions of the Hamiltonian and the

increases using Trotter type methods. In this sense, our result outperforms all
previous error bounds in the quantum simulation literature. Our result extends

surface-emitting laser integrated with multiple transverse coupled cavities

features high modulation performance because of the accumulated strong coupling
of the slow-light feedback from the surrounding lateral TCCs into the VCSEL
cavity. Photon-photon resonance (PPR) is predicted to occur at ultra-high
frequencies exceeding 145 GHz due to the optical feedback from short TCCs,
which achieves 3-dB MBW reaching 170 GHz. The study is based on the modeling of
the VCSEL dynamics under multiple transverse slow-light feedback from the

MBW enhancement under weaker coupling of slow-light into the VCSEL cavity. We
also characterize the noise properties of the promising MTCC-VCSEL in the

applied to 1.55um-InGaAsP laser that exhibits multimode hopping in its solitary

to the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem that is secure against a large set
of contingencies. The original ACOPF problem which represents the system
without contingency constraints, is convexified by applying the second-order
cone relaxation method. The contingencies are filtered to distinguish those
that will be treated with preventive actions from those that will be left for
corrective actions. The selected contingencies for preventive action are
included in the set of security constraints. Benders decomposition is employed
to decompose the convexified Security-Constrained ACOPF problem into a master
problem and several security check sub-problems. Sub-problems are evaluated in
a parallel computing process with enhanced computational efficiency. AGC within
each sub-problem is modeled by a set of proposed valid constraints, so the
procured solution is the physical response of each generation unit during a
contingency. Benders optimality cuts are generated for the sub-problems having
mismatches and the cuts are passed to the master problem to encounter the
security-constraints. The accuracy of the relaxation results is verified using
the presented tightness measure. The effectiveness of the presented valid AGC
constraints and scalability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in
several case studies.

demand for intelligent edge devices featuring on-site learning, while the
practical realization of such systems remains a challenge due to the limited
resources available at the edge and the required massive training costs for
state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs. As reducing precision is one of the most
effective knobs for boosting training time/energy efficiency, there has been a
growing interest in low-precision DNN training. In this paper, we explore from
an orthogonal direction: how to fractionally squeeze out more training cost
savings from the most redundant bit level, progressively along the training
trajectory and dynamically per input. Specifically, we propose FracTrain that
integrates (i) progressive fractional quantization which gradually increases
the precision of activations, weights, and gradients that will not reach the
precision of SOTA static quantized DNN training until the final training stage,
and (ii) dynamic fractional quantization which assigns precisions to both the
activations and gradients of each layer in an input-adaptive manner, for only
""fractionally"" updating layer parameters. Extensive simulations and ablation
studies (six models, four datasets, and three training settings including
standard, adaptation, and fine-tuning) validate the effectiveness of FracTrain
in reducing computational cost and hardware-quantified energy/latency of DNN
training while achieving a comparable or better (-0.12%~+1.87%) accuracy. For
example, when training ResNet-74 on CIFAR-10, FracTrain achieves 77.6% and
53.5% computational cost and training latency savings, respectively, compared
with the best SOTA baseline, while achieving a comparable (-0.07%) accuracy.

Cosmic Rays (CRs) interacting with its surface (disk component) and with its
photon field (spatially extended inverse-Compton component, IC). The latter
component is maximum close to the Sun and it is above the background even at
large angular distances, extending over the whole sky. First detected with
EGRET, it is studied now with Fermi-LAT with high statistical significance.
  Observations of the IC component allow us to obtain information on CR
electrons and positrons close to the Sun and in the heliosphere for the various
periods of solar activity and polarity. They allow to learn about CR
interactions and propagation close to stars, in the heliosphere and on the
solar surface, and to understand the Sun itself, its environment, and its

advances in model calculations and constraints from precise CR measurements are

the Sun and also from single stars. The code is publicly available and it is
extensively used by the scientific community to analyze Fermi-LAT data. It has
been used by the Fermi-LAT collaboration to produce the solar models released

control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also
propose a learning method to adjust it named ""sensitivity adjustment learning
(SAL)"". The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its
inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information
transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or
expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate
information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs
are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics
in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in
error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We
demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial
weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square)
sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov
exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP
through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an
RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and
the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the
weight matrix before learning, SAL's continuous nonlinear learning nature
prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant
improvement in learning performance.

efficiency have become crucial for successful deployment of technologies.
Hashing is one of the most effective approaches to deal with computational
limitations that come with big data. One natural way for formulating this
problem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary
codes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes
intractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have
been proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and
still attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods
is resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high
quality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary
variables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the
computational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is
unnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral
hashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead
of solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to
the data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the
binary codes from this solution. This trick reduces both the memory and
computational complexity at the same time. We apply two optimization
techniques, namely projected gradient and optimization on manifold, to obtain
the solution. Using comprehensive experiments on four public datasets, we show
that the proposed efficient spectral hashing (ESH) algorithm achieves highly
competitive retrieval performance compared with state of the art at low
complexity.

that had no legal basis. The effects of these measures are still unclear. Thus,
in this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the
COVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal
aggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns
as networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for
analyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with
the network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are
six main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of
Japan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays
prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after
the SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays
during the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE. It was also found that travel
patterns might have started to change from March 2020, when most schools were
closed, and that the mobility patterns after the SOE returned to those prior to
the SOE. Interestingly, we found that after the lifting of the SOE, travel
patterns remained similar to those during the SOE for a few days, suggesting
the possibility that self-restraint continued after the lifting of the SOE.
Moreover, in the case of the Nagoya metropolitan area, we found that people

different-sized ions and water similar to different electrical energies for
different-charged ions. Water and ions with interstitial voids in this
molecular mean field theory have their physical volumes as they do in molecular
dynamics simulations. The PBik formula derived from Fermi distributions of ions
and water in arbitrary shape and volume reduces to the Bikerman-Freise formula
derived from the lattice model of equal-sized ions. The DC curves predicted by
the Gouy-Chapman formula are U-shaped (for point-like ions with zero volume and
very dilute solutions). The curves change from U shape to camel shape
(Bactrian) and then to bell shape (for finite size ions) as the volume fraction
of ions and water changes from zero to medium value then to large value. The
transition is characterized by critical and inflection voltages in terms of the
particle volume fraction. These voltages determine steric and electrical
energies that describe the space/charge competition and saturation properties
of ions and water packed in the condensed layer of EDLs under high field
conditions. Steric energy is as important as electrical energy in these
conditions. PBik computes symmetric DC curves from delicately balanced steric
interactions of asymmetric-size ions and water like the experimental data of
KPF6 in aqueous solution. It computes asymmetric curves and captures delicately
balanced steric or electrical interactions of ions having different volumes or
charges in ionic liquids.

approximation for profiles of fundamental QDs and droplets with non-zero
vorticity. The dynamical equations for parameters of QDs are obtained. Fixed
points of these equations determine the parameters of stationary QDs. The
period of small oscillations of QDs near the stationary state is estimated. It
is obtained that periodic modulations of the strength of quantum fluctuations
can actuate different processes, including resonance oscillations of the QD
parameters, an emission of waves and a splitting of QDs into smaller droplets.

propose an effective cross-lingual UD parsing framework for transferring parser
from only one source monolingual treebank to any other target languages without

different languages, we introduce two language modeling tasks into dependency
parsing as multi-tasking. Assuming only unlabeled data from target languages
plus the source treebank can be exploited together, we adopt a self-training
strategy for further performance improvement in terms of our multi-task

approaching the parser performance which is trained in its own target treebank.

Two new proofs are presented for the classical Welch bound when $n = d+1$. For
large values of $n$, volumetric estimates are applied for obtaining fine

vehicle navigation. Since GPS signals from satellites cannot be received inside
a highway tunnel, map-aided localization is essential. However, the environment
around the tunnel is composed mostly of an elliptical wall. Thereby, the unique
feature points for map matching are few unlike the case outdoors. As a result,
it is a very difficult condition to perform vehicle navigation in the tunnel
with existing map-aided localization. In this paper, we propose tunnel
facility-based precise vehicle localization in highway tunnels using 3D LIDAR.
For vehicle localization in a highway tunnel, a point landmark map that stores
the center points of tunnel facilities and a probability distribution map that
stores the probability distributions of the lane markings are used. Point
landmark-based localization is possible regardless of the number of feature
points, if only representative points of an object can be extracted. Therefore,
it is a suitable localization method for highway tunnels where the feature
points are few. The tunnel facility points were extracted using 3D LIDAR.
Position estimation is conducted using an EKF-based navigation filter. The
proposed localization algorithm is verified through experiments using actual
highway driving data. The experimental results verify that the tunnel
facility-based vehicle localization yields precise results in real time.

applications such as live video streaming of network gaming. Providing an
adequate quality of experience to these applications is of paramount importance
for a network provider. The offered services are often regulated by tight
Service Level Agreements that needs to be continuously monitored. Since the
first step to guarantee a metric is to measure it, delay measurement becomes a
fundamental operation for a network provider. In many cases, the operator needs
to measure the delay on all network links. We refer to the collection of all
link delays as the Link Delay Vector (LDV). Typical solutions to collect the
LDV impose a substantial overhead on the network. In this paper, we propose a
solution to measure the LDV in real-time with a low-overhead approach. In
particular, we inject some flows into the network and infer the LDV based on
the delay of those flows. To this end, the monitoring flows and their paths
should be selected minimizing the network monitoring overhead. In this respect,
the challenging issue is to select a proper combination of flows such that by
knowing their delay it is possible to solve a set of a linear equation and
obtain a unique LDV. We first propose a mathematical formulation to select the
optimal combination of flows, in form of ILP problem. Then we develop a
heuristic algorithm to overcome the high computational complexity of existing
ILP solvers. As a further step, we propose a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve
the above-mentioned equations and infer the LDV. The challenging part of this
step is the volatility of link delays. The proposed solution is evaluated over
real-world emulated network topologies using the Mininet network emulator.
Emulation results show the accuracy of the proposed solution with a negligible
networking overhead in a real-time manner.

parties in different contexts which are often not transparent. In order to
unveil such usages, we propose an approach which focuses on the effects of data
sharing in impactful real-life situations. Focus is put on visual content
because of its strong influence in shaping online user profiles. The approach
relies on three components: (1) a set of visual objects with associated
situation impact ratings obtained by crowdsourcing, (2) a corresponding set of
object detectors for mining users' photos and (3) a ground truth dataset made
of 500 visual user profiles which are manually rated per situation. These

aggregates object ratings and object detections at user level and an attention
mechanism which boosts highly-rated objects to prevent them from being
overwhelmed by low-rated ones. Performance is evaluated per situation by
measuring the correlation between the automatic ranking of profile ratings and
a manual ground truth. Results indicate that LERVUP is effective since a strong

of transition metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ obtained by mechanical exfoliation
on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate is studied over a wide range of temperatures and
excitation powers. It is shown that the dynamics is nonexponential and, for
times $t$ exceeding $\sim$50 ps after the excitation pulse, is described by a
dependence of the form $1/(t+t_0)$. Photoluminescence decay is accelerated with
a decrease in temperature, as well as with a decrease in the energy of emitting
states. It is shown that the observed dynamics cannot be described by a
bimolecular recombination process, such as exciton--exciton annihilation. A
model that describes the nonexponential photoluminescence dynamics by taking
into account the spread of radiative recombination times of localized exciton
states in a random potential gives good agreement with experimental data.

quantum technologies, particularly in the rising field of magnetomechanics. In
most of the theoretical proposals and experiments, solid geometries such as
spheres are considered for the levitator. Here we demonstrate that replacing
them by superconducting rings brings two important advantages: Firstly, the
forces acting on the ring remain comparable to those expected for solid
objects, while the mass of the superconductor is greatly reduced. In turn, this
reduction increases the achievable trap frequency. Secondly, the flux trapped
in the ring by in-field cooling yields an additional degree of control for the
system. We construct a general theoretical framework with which we obtain
analytical formulations for a superconducting ring levitating in an
anti-Helmholtz quadrupole field and a dipole field, for both zero-field and
in-field cooling. The positions and the trapping frequencies of the levitated
rings are analytically found as a function of the parameters of the system and
the field applied during the cooling process. Unlike what is commonly observed
in bulk superconductors, lateral and rotational stability are not granted for
this idealized geometry. We therefore discuss the requirements for simple
superconducting structures to achieve stability in all degrees of freedom.

$r$, we say that $\mathcal{R}$ is an r-bounded family if, for any rectangle in
$\mathcal{R}$, the aspect ratio of the longer side over the shorter side is at
most $r$. Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel asked if it is possible to bound the
transversal number $\tau(\mathcal{R})$ with a linear function of the
independence number $\nu(\mathcal{R})$. Ahlswede and Karapetyan claimed a
positive answer for the particular case of $r$-bounded families, but without
providing proof. Chudnovsky et al. confirmed the result proving the bound $\tau
\leq (14 + 2r^2) \nu$. This note aims at giving a simple proof of $\tau \leq
2(r+1)(\nu-1) + 1$, slightly improving the previous results. As a consequence
of this new approach, we also deduce a constant factor bound for the ratio
$\frac{\chi}{\omega}$ in the case of $r$-bounded family.

$SU(2)$ gauging of three $D_3(SU(2))$ Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories. We begin
by observing that the Schur indices of these two theories are related by an
algebraic transformation that is surprisingly reminiscent of index
transformations describing spontaneous symmetry breaking on the Higgs branch.
However, this transformation breaks half the supersymmetry of the SYM theory as
well as its full $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)_F$ flavor symmetry. Moreover, it does
so in an interesting way when viewed through the lens of the corresponding 2D
vertex operator algebras (VOAs): affine currents of the small $\mathcal{N}=4$
super-Virasoro algebra at $c=-9$ get mapped to the $\mathcal{A}(6)$ stress
tensor and some of its conformal descendants, while the extra supersymmetry
currents on the $\mathcal{N}=4$ side get mapped to higher-dimensional fermionic
currents and their descendants on the $\mathcal{A}(6)$ side. We prove these
relations are facets of an exact graded vector space isomorphism (GVSI) between
these two VOAs. This GVSI respects the $U(1)_r$ charge of the parent 4D
theories. We briefly sketch how more general $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$

generalizations of our example. We conclude by showing that, in this class of

builds a flexible hierarchical search space, including the inner search space

cell-sharing strategy to save memory, and considerably accelerate the search

a single GTX1080Ti GPU, it takes only about 1 hour for searching for denoising

super-resolution structure on the DIV2K dataset. Experiments show that the

Next, we highlight the shortcomings of several proposed performance measures

how the AoII addresses these shortcomings and captures more meaningfully the

also error-optimal for the adopted information source model. Concurrently, the

received much interest lately. Although some solutions give really good results
in a controlled environment (no occlusion), recognition in the presence of
partial facial occlusion remains a challenging task. To handle occlusions,
solutions based on the reconstruction of the occluded part of the face have
been proposed. These solutions are mainly based on the texture or the geometry
of the face. However, the similarity of the face movement between different
persons doing the same expression seems to be a real asset for the
reconstruction. In this paper we exploit this asset and propose a new solution
based on an auto-encoder with skip connections to reconstruct the occluded part
of the face in the optical flow domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first proposition to directly reconstruct the movement for facial
expression recognition. We validated our approach in the controlled dataset CK+

proposed method reduce significantly the gap, in terms of recognition accuracy,
between occluded and non-occluded situations. We also compare our approach with
existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to lay the basis of a
reproducible and fair comparison in the future, we also propose a new

and the temperature anisotropy that may characterize space plasmas. The
derivation is based on the correlation among the kinetic energies of particles
with velocities described by anisotropic kappa distributions. The correlation
coefficient depends on the effective dimensionality of the velocity
distribution function, having its shape determined by the temperature
anisotropies caused by the ambient magnetic field; on the other hand, the
effective dimensionality is directly dependent on the polytropic index. This
analysis leads to the connection between the correlation coefficient, effective
dimensionality of velocity space, and the polytropic index, with the ratio of
temperature anisotropy. Moreover, a data and statistical analysis is performed
to test the application of the theoretically developed model, in the solar wind
proton plasma near 1 AU. The derived theoretical relationship is in good
agreement with observations, showing that the lowest and classical value of the
adiabatic polytropic index occurs in the isotropic case, while higher indices
characterize anisotropic plasmas. Finally, possible extensions of the theory
considering (i) non-adiabatic polytropic behavior, and (ii) more general
distributions, are further discussed.

users to lend and borrow crypto-assets. These applications feature complex,
highly parametric incentive mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This
complexity makes the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to
predict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could potentially lead to
emergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning about lending pools is made even harder
by the lack of executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand
how users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to inspect their
implementations, where the incentive mechanisms are intertwined with low-level
implementation details. Further, the variety of existing implementations makes
it difficult to distill the common aspects of lending pools. We systematize the
existing knowledge about lending pools, leveraging a new formal model of
interactions with users, which reflects the archetypal features of mainstream
implementations. This enables us to prove some general properties of lending
pools, such as the correct handling of funds, and to precisely describe
vulnerabilities and attacks. We also discuss the role of lending pools in the
broader context of decentralized finance.

We report our analysis of its TESS data, where we modeled the BY Draconis type
quasi-periodic rotational modulation by starspots simultaneously to the flaring
activity and planetary transits. We measured a flare occurrence rate of 6.35
flares per day for flares with amplitudes in the range of $0.06\% < f_{\rm max}
< 1.5\%$ of the star flux. We employed a Bayesian MCMC analysis to model the
five transits of AU Mic b, improving the constraints on the planetary
parameters. The planet radius of $4.07\pm0.17$~R$_{\oplus}$ and a mean density
of $1.4\pm0.4$~g~cm$^{-3}$ confirms that it is a Neptune-size moderately
inflated planet. While a single feature possibly due to a second planet was
previously reported in the former TESS data, we report the detection of two
additional transit-like events in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This
represents substantial evidence for a second planet (AU Mic c) in the system.
We analyzed its three transits and obtained an orbital period of
$18.859019\pm0.000016$~d and a planetary radius of $3.24\pm0.16$~R$_{\oplus}$,
which defines it as a warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the
range of 2.2~M$_{\oplus}$~$< M_{\rm c} < $25.0~M$_{\oplus}$. The two planets in
the system are in near 9:4 mean-motion resonance. We show that this
configuration is dynamically stable and should produce transit-timing
variations (TTV). Our non-detection of significant TTV in AU Mic b suggests an
upper limit for the mass of AU Mic c of $<7$~M$_{\oplus}$, indicating that this
planet is also likely to be inflated. As a young multi-planet system with at
least two transiting planets, AU Mic becomes a key system for the study of
atmospheres of infant planets and of planet-planet and planet-disk dynamics at
the early stages of planetary evolution.

`evolutionary' approach. By comparing the distributions of various parameters
of synthetic pulsars detectable by the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey, the
Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey, and two Swinburne Multibeam surveys
with those of the real pulsars detected by the same surveys, we find that a
good and physically realistic model can be obtained by using a uniform
distribution of the braking index in the range of 2.5 to 3.0, a uniform
distribution of the cosine of the angle between the spin and the magnetic axis
in the range of 0 to 1, a log-normal birth distribution of the surface magnetic
field with the mean and the standard deviation as 12.85 and 0.55 respectively
while keeping the distributions of other parameters unchanged from the ones
most commonly used in the literature. We have also replaced the universal
'death-line' by a `death-condition' specific to each individual pulsar. We find
that our model is better than the most popular model. With our improved model,
we predict that an all-sky pulsar survey with phase-I SKA-MID will detect about
nine thousand normal pulsars in the Galactic field. Among these pulsars, a
considerable number will produce continuous gravitational waves in the
operational range of the future ground-based gravitational waves detectors like
LIGO A$+$, and in certain cases, the spin-down limit of the gravitational wave
strains will be well below the detection sensitivity limit. We also provide a
fit for the present-day distributions of the spin periods and 1400 MHz
luminosities of the whole normal pulsar population in the Galactic field (which
are potentially observable) and those can be used in future population studies
under the snapshot approach.

procedure by receiving timely user feedback to update the recommendation
policy. Therefore, they are widely used in real application scenarios. Previous
interactive recommendation methods primarily focus on learning users'
personalized preferences on the relevance properties of an item set. However,
the investigation of users' personalized preferences on the diversity
properties of an item set is usually ignored. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Linear Modular Dispersion Bandit (LMDB) framework, which is an
online learning setting for optimizing a combination of modular functions and
dispersion functions. Specifically, LMDB employs modular functions to model the
relevance properties of each item, and dispersion functions to describe the
diversity properties of an item set. Moreover, we also develop a learning
algorithm, called Linear Modular Dispersion Hybrid (LMDH) to solve the LMDB
problem and derive a gap-free bound on its n-step regret. Extensive experiments
on real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
LMDB framework in balancing the recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Yang-Mills theory defined on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, in which center symmetry
is recovered even for small compactification radii. We show, by means of a
finite size scaling analysis, that the reconfinement phase transition is
first-order, like the usual $SU(3)$ thermal phase transition. We then
investigate two different physical phenomena, which are known to characterize
the standard confinement/deconfinement phase transition, namely the
condensation of thermal magnetic monopoles and the change in the localization
properties of the eigenmodes of the Dirac operator. Regarding the latter, we
show that the mobility edge signalling the Anderson-like transition in the
Dirac spectrum vanishes as one enters the reconfined phase, as it happens in
the standard confined phase. Thermal monopoles, instead, show a peculiar
behavior: their density decreases going through reconfinement, at odds with the
standard thermal theory; nonetheless, they condense at reconfinement, like at
the usual confinement transition. The coincidence of monopole condensation and
Dirac mode delocalization, even in a framework different from that of the
standard confinement transition, suggests the existence of a strict link
between them.

These are typically formulated to address ill-posed inverse problems
encountered in signal and image processing. The objective function is
traditionally defined by adding a regularization function to a data fit term,
which is subsequently minimized by using iterative optimization algorithms.
Recently, several works have proposed to replace the operator related to the
regularization by a more sophisticated denoiser. These approaches, known as
plug-and-play (PnP) methods, have shown excellent performance. Although it has
been noticed that, under some Lipschitz properties on the denoisers, the
convergence of the resulting algorithm is guaranteed, little is known about
characterizing the asymptotically delivered solution. In the current article,
we propose to address this limitation. More specifically, instead of employing
a functional regularization, we perform an operator regularization, where a
maximally monotone operator (MMO) is learned in a supervised manner. This
formulation is flexible as it allows the solution to be characterized through a
broad range of variational inequalities, and it includes convex regularizations
as special cases. From an algorithmic standpoint, the proposed approach
consists in replacing the resolvent of the MMO by a neural network (NN). We
present a universal approximation theorem proving that nonexpansive NNs are
suitable models for the resolvent of a wide class of MMOs. The proposed

  interaction predictions",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) refer to processes triggered by the
administration of two or more drugs leading to side effects beyond those
observed when drugs are administered by themselves. Due to the massive number
of possible drug pairs, it is nearly impossible to experimentally test all
combinations and discover previously unobserved side effects. Therefore,
machine learning based methods are being used to address this issue.
  Methods: We propose a Siamese self-attention multi-modal neural network for
DDI prediction that integrates multiple drug similarity measures that have been
derived from a comparison of drug characteristics including drug targets,
pathways and gene expression profiles.
  Results: Our proposed DDI prediction model provides multiple advantages: 1)
It is trained end-to-end, overcoming limitations of models composed of multiple
separate steps, 2) it offers model explainability via an Attention mechanism
for identifying salient input features and 3) it achieves similar or better
prediction performance (AUPR scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) compared to
state-of-the-art DDI models when tested on various benchmark datasets. Novel
DDI predictions are further validated using independent data resources.
  Conclusions: We find that a Siamese multi-modal neural network is able to
accurately predict DDIs and that an Attention mechanism, typically used in the
Natural Language Processing domain, can be beneficially applied to aid in DDI
model explainability.

Furthermore, a general theory mainly based on the Feynman path integration

exhibits outstanding image generations, and allows for amortized inference
using an image encoder. The main idea in IntroVAE is to train a VAE
adversarially, using the VAE encoder to discriminate between generated and real
data samples. However, the original IntroVAE loss function relied on a
particular hinge-loss formulation that is very hard to stabilize in practice,
and its theoretical convergence analysis ignored important terms in the loss.
In this work, we take a step towards better understanding of the IntroVAE
model, its practical implementation, and its applications. We propose the
Soft-IntroVAE, a modified IntroVAE that replaces the hinge-loss terms with a
smooth exponential loss on generated samples. This change significantly
improves training stability, and also enables theoretical analysis of the
complete algorithm. Interestingly, we show that the IntroVAE converges to a
distribution that minimizes a sum of KL distance from the data distribution and
an entropy term. We discuss the implications of this result, and demonstrate
that it induces competitive image generation and reconstruction. Finally, we
describe two applications of Soft-IntroVAE to unsupervised image translation

small subsets of the available data. This precludes both optimal calibration
and quantification of uncertainties. Traditional Bayesian calibration methods
that allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive for climate models;
they are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For
example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require $O(10^5)$
model runs and are sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them
infeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model
calibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only $O(10^2)$ model
runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of
three stages: (i) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman
inversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data
statistics; (ii) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with
Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for
training; (iii) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior
distributions by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC. We demonstrate the
feasibility and computational efficiency of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES)
approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized general circulation
model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from synthetic data
generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions
of the parameters that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a
fraction of the computational cost usually required to obtain them. Sampling
from this approximate posterior allows the generation of climate predictions
with quantified parametric uncertainties.

for solving complex combinatorial optimisation problem via policy networks and
have demonstrated promising performance. Existing works have focused on solving
(vehicle) routing problems as they have a nice balance between non-triviality
and difficulty. State-of-the-art approaches learn a policy using reinforcement
learning, and the learnt policy acts as a pseudo solver. These approaches have
demonstrated good performance in some cases, but given the large search space
typical combinatorial/routing problem, they can converge too quickly to poor
policy. To prevent this, in this paper, we propose an approach name entropy
regularised reinforcement learning (ERRL) that supports exploration by
providing more stochastic policies, which tends to improve optimisation.
Empirically, the low variance ERRL offers RL training fast and stable. We also
introduce a combination of local search operators during test time, which
significantly improves solution and complement ERRL. We qualitatively
demonstrate that for vehicle routing problems, a policy with higher entropy can
make the optimisation landscape smooth which makes it easier to optimise. The
quantitative evaluation shows that the performance of the model is comparable
with the state-of-the-art variants. In our evaluation, we experimentally
illustrate that the model produces state-of-the-art performance on variants of
Vehicle Routing problems such as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP),
Multiple Routing with Fixed Fleet Problems (MRPFF) and Travelling Salesman
problem.

of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) action are described in details and several
examples are explicitly computed (including nonabelian Chern-Simons theory,
where the HJ action turns out to be the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action).
Perturbative quantization, limited in this note to finite-dimensional targets,
is performed in the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism in the
bulk and of the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism at the endpoints. As
a sanity check of the method, it is proved that the semiclassical contribution
of the physical part of the evolution operator is still given by the HJ action.
Several examples are computed explicitly. In particular, it is shown that the
toy model for nonabelian Chern-Simons theory and the toy model for 7D
Chern-Simons theory with nonlinear Hitchin polarization do not have quantum
corrections in the physical part (the extension of these results to the actual
cases is discussed in the companion paper [arXiv:2012.13983]). Background

the normalization factor as a thermodynamic variable. We show that there is a
first-order small/large black hole phase transition which is analogous to the
liquid/gas phase transition in fluids. We introduce a new picture of the
equation of state and then we calculate the corresponding critical quantities.
Moreover, we obtain the critical exponents and show that they are the same
values as the van der Waals system. Finally, we study the photon sphere and the
shadow observed by a distant observer and investigate how the shadow radius may
be affected by the variation of black hole parameters. We also investigate the
relations between shadow radius and phase transitions and calculate the
critical shadow radius where the black hole undergoes a second-order phase

distribution functions predicted in the leading twist model of nuclear

a hypernova explosion embedded in a massive CSM. This finding indicates that
very massive stars with initial masses larger than $40\ M_\odot$, which
supposedly produce highly energetic SNe, occasionally eject their hydrogen-rich

DLCS is the hybrid dynamical system that is the discrete-time counterpart of
the well-known Linear Complementarity System (LCS). We derive sufficient
conditions for Lyapunov stability of a DLCS when using a quadratic Lyapunov
function that depends only on the state variables and a quadratic Lyapunov
function that depends both on the state and the algebraic variables. The
sufficient conditions require checking the feasibility of a copositive program
over nonconvex cones. Our results only assume that the LCP is solvable and do
not require the solutions to be unique. We devise a novel, exact cutting plane
algorithm for the verification of stability and the computation of the Lyapunov
functions. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first exact
approach for stability verification of DLCS. A number of numerical examples are
presented to illustrate the approach. Though our main object of study in this
paper is the DLCS, the proposed algorithm can be readily applied to the
stability verification of LCS. In this context, we show the equivalence between
the stability of a LCS and the DLCS, resulting from a time-stepping procedure
applied to the LCS for all sufficiently small time steps.

$1/e$-strategy for the problem of best choice. $N$ candidates for a job arrive
at times independently uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$. The interviewer knows
how each candidate ranks relative to all others seen so far, and must
immediately appoint or reject each candidate as they arrive. The aim is to
choose the best overall. The $1/e$ strategy is to follow the rule: `Do nothing
until time $1/e$, then appoint the first candidate thereafter who is best so
far (if any).'
  The question, first discussed with Larry Shepp in 1983, was to know whether
the $1/e$-strategy is optimal if one has `no information about the total number
of options'. Quite what this might mean is open to various interpretations, but
we shall take the proportional-increment process formulation of \cite{BY}. Such
processes are shown to have a very rigid structure, being time-changed {\em
pure birth processes}, and this allows some precise distributional
calculations, from which we deduce that the $1/e$-strategy is in fact not
optimal.

dependences on the two line-of-sight (LOS) directions pointing to each pair of
objects, which are degenerate with each other in the conventional analysis
under the small-angle or plane-parallel (PP) approximation, are unambiguously
decomposed. By means of this, we, for the first time, compute the wide-angle
auto and cross correlations between intrinsic ellipticities, number densities
and velocities of galaxies, and compare them with the PP-limit results. For the
ellipticity-ellipticity and density-ellipticity correlations, we find more than
$10\%$ deviation from the PP-limit results if the opening angle between two LOS
directions exceeds $30^\circ - 50^\circ$. It is also shown that even if the
PP-limit result is strictly zero, the non-vanishing correlation is obtained
over the various scales, arising purely from the curved-sky effects. Our
results indicate the importance of the data analysis not relying on the PP

to deal with some of the intricacies of contemporary (network) data. A key
aspect is how the data, represented as graph signals, depend on the topology of
the graph. Widely-used approaches assume that the observed signals can be
viewed as outputs of graph filters (i.e., polynomials of a matrix
representation of the graph) whose inputs have a particular structure. Diffused
graph signals, which correspond to an originally sparse (node-localized) signal
percolated through the graph via filtering, fall into this class. In that
context, this paper deals with the problem of jointly identifying graph filters
and separating their (sparse) input signals from a mixture of diffused graph
signals, thus generalizing to the graph signal processing framework the
classical blind demixing (blind source separation) of temporal and spatial
signals. We first consider the scenario where the supporting graphs are
different across the signals, providing a theorem for demixing feasibility
along with probabilistic bounds on successful recovery. Additionally, an
analysis of the degenerate problem of demixing with a single graph is also
presented. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world graphs
empirically illustrating the main theoretical findings close the paper.

Digital Twins (gDTs) of industrial facilities, so that the benefits provide
even more value compared to the initial investment to generate these models.
Our previous work achieved the current state-of-the-art class segmentation
performance (75% average accuracy per point and average AUC 90% in the CLOI
dataset classes) as presented in (Agapaki and Brilakis 2020) and directly
produces labelled point clusters of the most important to model objects (CLOI
classes) from laser scanned industrial data. CLOI stands for C-shapes,
L-shapes, O-shapes, I-shapes and their combinations. However, the problem of
automated segmentation of individual instances that can then be used to fit
geometric shapes remains unsolved. We argue that the use of instance
segmentation algorithms has the theoretical potential to provide the output
needed for the generation of gDTs. We solve instance segmentation in this paper
through (a) using a CLOI-Instance graph connectivity algorithm that segments
the point clusters of an object class into instances and (b) boundary
segmentation of points that improves step (a). Our method was tested on the
CLOI benchmark dataset (Agapaki et al. 2019) and segmented instances with
76.25% average precision and 70% average recall per point among all classes.
This proved that it is the first to automatically segment industrial point
cloud shapes with no prior knowledge other than the class point label and is
the bedrock for efficient gDT generation in cluttered industrial point clouds.

the standard media such as electrons and photons as CMB, we consider the medium
with invisible axions. The amount of GRB delays in different media are
calculated in details utilizing a novel technique in QFT by using the hitherto
known or estimated densities of particles in the space without introducing any
arbitrary parameter. Previously, the GRB delays have been interpreted as a sign
of Lorentz invariance violation by modifying the dispersion relation of Special
Relativity, which relates the energy, the momentum and the mass of a particle,
based on different mechanisms ii), such as a stringy spacetime foam, coming
from a quantum gravity effect and using an adjustable parameter. Obviously, all
the above-mentioned mechanisms i) and ii) are induced (seeming) Lorentz
invariance violations but not an intrinsic (genuine) one. The amount of GRB
delay due to the two aforementioned interpretations can be distinguished by
observing the time of arrival of light with different frequencies. Namely,
dispersion of light i) predicts that the higher energy GRB arrive the Earth
earlier, while in the other interpretations ii), they arrive later. We notice
that the needed amount for delay due to the dispersion of light shall have the
potential power to shed additional light on the microstructure of interstellar
media with respect to the densities of constituent particles and the origins of
their sources. Finally, we indicate the ways to detect the intrinsic Lorentz
invariance violation and to interpret them theoretically.

  Fleet When Providing Power to a Fleet of Battery Electric Vehicles","2 tables, 17 pages, 15 figures",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sales of new petrol and diesel passenger vehicles may not be permitted in the
United Kingdom (UK) post-2030. Should this happen, it is likely that vehicles
presently powered by hydrocarbons will be progressively replaced by Battery
Electric Vehicles (BEVs). This paper describes the use of mathematical
modelling, drawing on real time records of the UK electricity grid, to
investigate the likely performance of the grid when supplying power to a fleet
of up to 35 million BEVs. The model highlights the importance of understanding
how the grid will cope when powering a BEV fleet under conditions similar to
those experienced during an extended wind lull during the 3rd week of January
2017. Allowing a two-way flow of electricity between the BEVs and the grid,
known as the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) configuration, turns out to be of key
importance in minimising the need for additional gas turbine generation or
energy storage during wind lulls. This study has shown that with the use of
V2G, it should be possible to provide power to about 15 million BEVs with the
gas turbine capacity currently available. Without V2G, it is likely that the
current capacity of the gas turbines and associated gas infrastructure might be
overwhelmed by even a relatively small BEV fleet. Since it is anticipated that
80% of BEV owners will be able to park the vehicles at their residences,
widespread V2G will enable both the powering of residences when supply from the
grid is constrained and the charging of BEVs when supply is in excess. The
model shows that this configuration will maintain a constant load on the grid
and avoid the use of either expensive alternative storage or hydrogen obtained
by reforming methane. There should be no insuperable problem in providing power
to the 20% of BEV owners who do not have parking at their residences; their
power could come directly from the grid.

of localized energy dissipation or magnetic reconnection. As such, a number of
methods have been proposed for detecting nulls in both simulation data and in
situ spacecraft data from Earth's magnetosphere. The same methods can be
applied to detect stagnation points in flow fields. In this paper we describe a
systematic comparison of different methods for finding magnetic nulls. The
Poincare index method, the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE) method, and the
trilinear method are considered. We define a magnetic field containing fourteen
magnetic nulls whose positions and types are known to arbitrary precision.
Furthermore, we applied the selected techniques in order to find and classify
those nulls. Two situations are considered: one in which the magnetic field is
discretized on a rectangular grid, and the second in which the magnetic field
is discretized along synthetic `spacecraft trajectories' within the domain. At
present, FOTE and trilinear are the most reliable methods for finding nulls in
the spacecraft data and in numerical simulations on Cartesian grids,
respectively. The Poincare index method is suitable for simulations on both
tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. The proposed magnetic field configuration
can be used for grading and benchmarking the new and existing tools for finding
magnetic nulls and flow stagnation points.

communication. A UAV identified as an aerial base station communicates with a
ground base station over an RF channel. The communication units have dynamics
based on the logistic map. The map is chaotic in the appropriate parameter
space. Its states are non-periodic, broadband, and noise-like in the frequency
domain. They are useful for spreading information during transmission, making
it difficult for an eavesdropper to recover the modulated message since state
prediction is ultimately impossible. To retrieve it, we propose a variable
feedback controller. It asymptotically stabilizes the error dynamics when the
information source is off. During transmission, the controller synchronizes the
units such that the error contains signatures of the information signal.
Therefore, the information signal is retrievable by a suitable detection
mechanism. Security depends on the confidentiality of the map, the variable
feedback controller, including its scale factor and bounded feedback gain, and
the designer`s choice of invertible function for use in the scrambling and
descrambling process. Also, the method is less prone to jamming attacks and
multipath effects as the broadband spectrum can be used to randomly select RF
channels. It uses only a few simple algorithms, including a correlation
summation and a detection mechanism. The algorithms collect subsamples of the
received signal sequences and averages over each subsample length. The method
requires minimal programming efforts and low hardware resource utilization. It
is energy-efficient, which is a vital consideration for any UAV security model.
Moreover, we realize a prototype of the communication system on
field-programmable gate arrays. We presented a digital design of the secure
communication system involving the transmission of bitstreams between the ABS
and GBS.
