extensively studied at hadron colliders and provide high-accuracy tests of the
Standard Model. A good understanding of these processes is of paramount
importance for precision Higgs physics, as well as for searches for new
physics. In particular, associated production of $\gamma$, $W$ or $Z$ bosons
with light-flavor and heavy-flavor jets is a powerful tool for testing
perturbative QCD calculations, Monte Carlo event generators, and can also
constrain the parametrizations used to describe the parton content of the
proton. Furthermore, events with a $W$ or $Z$ boson produced with two
well-separated jets can be used to distinguish between electroweak and strong
production mechanisms, and to set limits on contributions of physics beyond the
Standard Model. This review summarises the historical theoretical developments
and the state-of-the-art in the modeling of vector-boson-plus-jet physics,
while focusing on experimental results by LHC collaborations in Run-1 and
Run-2, and including comparisons with recent measurements at the Tevatron.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2019, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases reached the highest number
in the US since 1992. Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content
propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay
and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for
antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine
messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have
considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags),
and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of
photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are
not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components
(e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we
propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual
information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to
help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal
antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can
generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble
method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To
evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset
that consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between
January 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the
final network achieves above 97% testing accuracy and outperforms other
relevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine
messages posted daily. The implementation code is available at
https://github.com/wzhings/antivaccine_detection.

transversely trapped in the arms of the cavity along $x$-axis and $y$-axis. The
interaction of intra-cavity optical mode excites momentum side modes in
Bose-Einstein Condensates, which then mimic as two atomic mirrors coupled
through cavity field. We show that the probe field photons transition through
the atomic mirrors yields to two coupled electromagnetically induced
transparency windows, which only exist when both atomic states are coupled with
the cavity. Further, the strength of these novel electromagnetically induced
transparencies gets increased with an increase in atom-cavity coupling.
Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of Fano resonances and dynamics of
fast and slow light. We illustrate that the Fano line shapes and dynamics of
slow light can be enhanced by strengthening the interaction between atomic

nonlinear optics of complex systems but also provide a platform to test

limits the subthreshold swing (SS) and therefore the minimum power consumption
of 3D and 2D field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we investigated a novel
graphene (Gr)-enabled cold electron injection where the Gr acts as the Dirac
source to provide the cold electrons with a localized electron density
distribution and a short thermal tail at room temperature. These cold electrons
correspond to an electronic cooling effect with the effective electron
temperature of ~145 K in the monolayer MoS2, which enable the transport factor
lowering and thus the steep-slope switching (across for 3 decades with a
minimum SS of 29 mV/decade at room temperature) for a monolayer MoS2 FET.
Especially, a record-high sub-60-mV/decade current density (over 1

anomaly detection for discrete event logs. While most earlier work focused on
applying unsupervised learning upon engineered features, most recent work has
started to resolve this challenge by applying deep learning methodology to
abstraction of discrete event entries. Inspired by natural language processing,
LSTM-based anomaly detection models were proposed. They try to predict upcoming
events, and raise an anomaly alert when a prediction fails to meet a certain
criterion. However, such a predict-next-event methodology has a fundamental
limitation: event predictions may not be able to fully exploit the distinctive
characteristics of sequences. This limitation leads to high false positives
(FPs) and high false negatives (FNs). It is also critical to examine the
structure of sequences and the bi-directional causality among individual
events. To this end, we propose a new methodology: Recomposing event sequences
as anomaly detection. We propose DabLog, a Deep Autoencoder-Based anomaly
detection method for discrete event Logs. The fundamental difference is that,
rather than predicting upcoming events, our approach determines whether a
sequence is normal or abnormal by analyzing (encoding) and reconstructing
(decoding) the given sequence. Our evaluation results show that our new
methodology can significantly reduce the numbers of FPs and FNs, hence
achieving a higher $F_1$ score.

(identified, e.g., via conditional independence tests or a domain expert). Our
goal is to recover the directions of all causal or ancestral relations in $G$,
via a minimum cost set of interventions. It is known that constructing an exact
minimum cost intervention set for an arbitrary graph $G$ is NP-hard. We further
argue that, conditioned on the hardness of approximate graph coloring, no
polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than
$\Theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of observed variables in $G$. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a bi-criteria approximation goal that
lets us recover the directions of all but $\epsilon n^2$ edges in $G$, for some
specified error parameter $\epsilon > 0$. Under this relaxed goal, we give
polynomial time algorithms that achieve intervention cost within a small

are bounded from above by $N^s$. Then, a general construction based on a

two coding schemes for BEC and BMS channels, based on a second column-splitting

upcoming sufficiently large LXe detectors should be able to detect both these
types of events due to neutrinos from reasonably close by SN bursts. We also
note that since the total CC induced ER and NR signals receive contributions
predominantly from $\nu_e$CC interactions while the CE$\nu$NS contribution
comes from NC interactions of {\emph all the six species of neutrinos},
identification of the $\nu_e$CC and CE$\nu$NS origin events may offer the
possibility of extracting useful information about the distribution of the
total SN explosion energy going into different neutrino flavors.

ballistic printing (e.g., ink jet and aerosol jet printing, laser-induced

additive pattering by microcontact printing is performed with solid elastomeric
stamps suffering from ink depletion after a few stamp-substrate contacts. The
throughput limitations of additive state-of-the-art patterning thus arising may
be overcome by capillary stamping - parallel additive substrate patterning
without ink depletion by mesoporous silica stamps, which enable ink supply
through the mesopores anytime during stamping. Thus, either arrays of
substrate-bound nanoparticles or colloidal nanodispersions of detached
nanoparticles are accessible. We processed three types of model inks: 1) drug
solutions, 2) solutions containing metallopolymers and block copolymers as well
as 3) nanodiamond suspensions representing colloidal nanoparticle inks. Thus,
we obtained aqueous colloidal nanodispersions of stamped drug nanoparticles,
regularly arranged ceramic nanoparticles by post-stamping pyrolysis of stamped
metallopolymeric precursor nanoparticles and regularly arranged nanodiamond
nanoaggregates. Capillary stamping may overcome the throughput limitations of

of short dwell time to user interest using large scale user behavior logs from
a mobile news application. This analysis was conducted on a vector space based
on users click histories and then users and articles were mapped in the same
space. The users with short dwell time are concentrated on a specific position
in this space; thus, the length of dwell time is related to their interest.
Moreover, we also analyze the characteristics of short dwell time browsing by
excluding these browses from their click histories. Surprisingly, excluding

dimension change with the abnormalities such as in disease like cancer. The
optical imaging of thin slices of tissue using transmission microscopy can
produce an intensity distribution pattern proportional to its refractive index
which represents the mass density distribution pattern of the tissues. The
fractal dimension of tissue is calculated by analyzing this mass density
distribution and is known to increase with the progression of carcinogenesis.
This paper explores the viability of using this quantitative approach of
fractal dimension analysis to create a standardized accurate cancer diagnosis
test and staging which reduces the issues plaguing current testing methods. A
commonality for most of the deadliest cancers is their lethality due to the
difficulty in properly diagnosing them in the early stages or accurate late
staging. This difficulty can arise from the physical location of the organ
causing them to be hard to access and the lack of noticeable symptoms until the
late stages when there is almost no hope of treatment. To study some of these
deadly cancers, commercially available paraffin embedded tissue microarray
(TMA) samples containing multiple cores of different cases and stages of
Pancreatic, Breast, Colon, and Prostate cancer are analyzed. The fractal
dimension of different TMA samples is able to correctly differentiate between
the different stages of each cancer, raising the possibility of a standardized
system being created to increase diagnosis accuracy in the future.

learn an accurate global model when a bounded number of clients are malicious.
The key idea of existing Byzantine-robust federated learning methods is that
the service provider performs statistical analysis among the clients' local
model updates and removes suspicious ones, before aggregating them to update
the global model. However, malicious clients can still corrupt the global
models in these methods via sending carefully crafted local model updates to
the service provider. The fundamental reason is that there is no root of trust
in existing federated learning methods.
  In this work, we bridge the gap via proposing FLTrust, a new federated
learning method in which the service provider itself bootstraps trust. In
particular, the service provider itself collects a clean small training dataset
(called root dataset) for the learning task and the service provider maintains
a model (called server model) based on it to bootstrap trust. In each
iteration, the service provider first assigns a trust score to each local model
update from the clients, where a local model update has a lower trust score if
its direction deviates more from the direction of the server model update.
Then, the service provider normalizes the magnitudes of the local model updates
such that they lie in the same hyper-sphere as the server model update in the
vector space. Our normalization limits the impact of malicious local model
updates with large magnitudes. Finally, the service provider computes the
average of the normalized local model updates weighted by their trust scores as
a global model update, which is used to update the global model. Our extensive
evaluations on six datasets from different domains show that our FLTrust is
secure against both existing attacks and strong adaptive attacks.

owing to its universal coupling $\alpha$ to Standard Model fields, generates a
signal that is akin to but distinct from a continuous gravitational wave. We
show that this signal could be detected with current and planned gravitational
wave interferometers. In the event of a null detection, current facilities
could constrain the coupling to be below $\alpha\sim10^{-7}$ for frequencies of
tens of Hz, corresponding to dark matter masses around the $10^{-13}$ eV mark.
Future facilities could further lower these upper limits and extend them to
smaller masses down to $10^{-18}$ eV. These limits would be the most stringent
bounds on the spin-2 Yukawa fifth force strength, parametrised by $\alpha$, in
the frequency ranges accessible by gravitational wave interferometers. The
implementation of this type of searches for gravitational wave interferometers
would therefore further our grasp of both dark matter and gravity.

recovery of non-stationary signal components with possibly cross-over
instantaneous frequency (IF) curves from a multi-component blind-source signal.
The main idea is to incorporate a chirp rate parameter with the time-scale
continuous wavelet-like transformation, by considering the quadratic phase
representation of the signal components. Hence-forth, even if two IF curves
cross, the two corresponding signal components can still be separated and
recovered, provided that their chirp rates are different. In other words,
signal components with the same IF value at any time instant could still be
recovered. To facilitate our presentation, we introduce the notion of
time-scale-chirp_rate (TSC-R) recovery transform or TSC-R recovery operator to
develop a TSC-R theory for the 3-dimensional space of time, scale, chirp rate.
Our theoretical development is based on the approximation of the non-stationary
signal components with linear chirps and applying the proposed adaptive TSC-R
transform to the multi-component blind-source signal to obtain fairly accurate
error bounds of IF estimations and signal components recovery. Several
numerical experimental results are presented to demonstrate the out-performance
of the proposed method over all existing time-frequency and time-scale
approaches in the published literature, particularly for non-stationary source
signals with crossover IFs.

intelligence, which requires a detailed understanding of real-world situations
and a strong mathematical reasoning capability. Previous neural solvers of math
word problems directly translate problem texts into equations, lacking an
explicit interpretation of the situations, and often fail to handle more
sophisticated situations. To address such limits of neural solvers, we
introduce the concept of a \emph{situation model}, which originates from
psychology studies to represent the mental states of humans in problem-solving,
and propose \emph{SMART}, which adopts attributed grammar as the representation
of situation models for algebra story problems. Specifically, we first train an
information extraction module to extract nodes, attributes, and relations from
problem texts and then generate a parse graph based on a pre-defined attributed
grammar. An iterative learning strategy is also proposed to improve the
performance of SMART further. To rigorously study this task, we carefully
curate a new dataset named \emph{ASP6.6k}. Experimental results on ASP6.6k show
that the proposed model outperforms all previous neural solvers by a large
margin while preserving much better interpretability. To test these models'
generalization capability, we also design an out-of-distribution (OOD)
evaluation, in which problems are more complex than those in the training set.
Our model exceeds state-of-the-art models by 17\% in the OOD evaluation,
demonstrating its superior generalization ability.

second order in cosmological perturbation theory. We also emphasize the
difference between observable and gauge invariant variables. Second, we argue
that the Newton (or shear-free) gauge is suitable for both the calculation of
induced GWs and the physical interpretation. We then show that, most notably,
the induced GW spectrum is invariant under a set of reasonable gauge
transformations, i.e. physically well behaved on small scales, once the source
term has become inactive. This includes the commonly used flat, constant Hubble
and synchronous gauges but excludes the comoving slicing gauge. We also show
that a particular solution of the GW equation in a dust dominated universe
while the source term is active can be gauged away by a small change of gauge.

in dynamic systems design and control. These problems correspond to determining
the optimal selection of sensors (measurements) or actuators (control nodes)

literature on SASP is indeed inveterate, the vast majority of the work focuses

exploits problem structure of the SASP. The newly designed BnB routines are

in which two neural networks, namely a teacher and a student, are coupled
together during training. The teacher network is supposed to be a trustworthy
predictor and the student tries to mimic its predictions. Usually, a student
with a lighter architecture is selected so we can achieve compression and yet
deliver high-quality results. In such a setting, distillation only happens for
final predictions whereas the student could also benefit from teacher's
supervision for internal components.
  Motivated by this, we studied the problem of distillation for intermediate
layers. Since there might not be a one-to-one alignment between student and
teacher layers, existing techniques skip some teacher layers and only distill
from a subset of them. This shortcoming directly impacts quality, so we instead
propose a combinatorial technique which relies on attention. Our model fuses
teacher-side information and takes each layer's significance into
consideration, then performs distillation between combined teacher layers and
those of the student. Using our technique, we distilled a 12-layer BERT (Devlin

superresolution can be achieved in this system for imaging two weak thermal
point sources. Using quantum estimation theory, we consider the fundamental
quantum limit of resolving the transverse separation of two strong thermal
point sources using interferometer arrays, and show that the resolution is not
limited by the longest baseline. We propose measurement techniques using linear
beam splitters and photon-number-resolving detection to achieve our bound. Our
results demonstrate that superresolution for resolving two thermal point

  Nonlocal LES Approach","20 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Filtering the passive scalar transport equation in the large-eddy simulation
(LES) of turbulent transport gives rise to the closure term corresponding to
the unresolved scalar flux. Understanding and respecting the statistical
features of subgrid-scale (SGS) flux is a crucial point in robustness and
predictability of the LES. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic nonlocal
behavior of the SGS passive scalar flux through studying its two-point
statistics obtained from the filtered direct numerical simulation (DNS) data
for passive scalar transport in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT).
Presence of long-range correlations in true SGS scalar flux urges to go beyond
the conventional local closure modeling approaches that fail to predict the
non-Gaussian statistical features of turbulent transport in passive scalars.
Here, we propose an appropriate statistical model for microscopic SGS motions
by taking into account the filtered Boltzmann transport equation (FBTE) for
passive scalar. In FBTE, we approximate the filtered equilibrium distribution
with an $\alpha$-stable Levy distribution that essentially incorporates a
power-law behavior to resemble the observed nonlocal statistics of SGS scalar
flux. Generic ensemble-averaging of such FBTE lets us formulate a continuum
level closure model for the SGS scalar flux appearing in terms of
fractional-order Laplacian that is inherently nonlocal. Through a data-driven
approach, we infer the optimal version of our SGS model using the high-fidelity
data for the two-point correlation function between the SGS scalar flux and
filtered scalar gradient, and sparse linear regression. In an \textit{a priori}
test, the optimal fractional-order model yields a promising performance in
reproducing the probability distribution function (PDF) of the SGS dissipation
of the filtered scalar variance compared to its true PDF obtained from the
filtered DNS data.

systems using a model-driven low-rank approximation. To this end, we formulate
a variational principle that seeks to minimize the distance between the time
derivative of the reduced approximation and sensitivity dynamics. The
first-order optimality condition of the variational principle leads to a system
of closed-form evolution equations for an orthonormal basis and corresponding
sensitivity coefficients. This approach allows for the computation of
sensitivities with respect to a large number of parameters in an accurate and
tractable manner by extracting correlations between different sensitivities on
the fly. The presented method requires solving forward evolution equations,
sidestepping the restrictions imposed by forward/backward workflow of adjoint
sensitivities. For example, the presented method, unlike the adjoint equation,
does not impose any I/O load and can be used in applications in which real time
sensitivities are of interest. We demonstrate the utility of the method for
three test cases: (1) computing sensitivity with respect to model parameters in
the Rossler system (2) computing sensitivity with respect to an
infinite-dimensional forcing parameter in the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and (3) computing sensitivity with respect to reaction parameters for

(PDFs) based on the mean field interactions of valence quarks in the nucleonic
interior. The main motivation for the model is to obtain a mean field
description of the valence quarks as a baseline to study the short range
quark-quark interactions that generate the high $x$ tail of PDFs. The model is
based on the separation of the valence three-quark cluster and residual system
in the nucleon. Then the nucleon structure function is calculated within the
effective light-front diagrammatic approach introducing nonperturbative
light-front valence quark and residual wave functions. Within the model a new
relation is obtained between the position, $x_p$, of the peak of $xq_V(x)$
distribution of the valence quark and the effective mass of the residual
system, $m_R$, in the form: $x_{p} \approx {1\over 4} (1-{m_R\over m_N})$ at
starting $Q^2$. This relation explains the difference in the peak positions for
d- and u- quarks through the expected difference of residual masses for valence
d- and u- quark distributions. The parameters of the model are fixed by fitting
the calculated valence quark distributions to the phenomenological PDFs. This
allowed us to estimate the overall mean field contribution in baryonic and
momentum sum rules for valence d- and u- quarks. Finally, the evaluated
parameters of the non-perturbative wave functions of valence 3q-cluster and
residual system can be used in calculation of other quantities such as nucleon
form factors, generalized partonic and transverse momentum distributions.

gravities involves a weighted sum whose evaluation, beyond quadratic order,
requires a complicated theory-dependent splitting of the Riemann tensor
components. Using the splittings of general relativity one can obtain
unambiguous formulas perturbatively valid for general higher-curvature
gravities. Within this setup, we perform a novel rewriting of the functional
which gets rid of the weighted sum. The formula is particularly neat for
general cubic and quartic theories, and we use it to explicitly evaluate the
corresponding functionals. In the case of Lovelock theories, we find that the
anomaly term can be written in terms of the exponential of a differential
operator. We also show that order-$n$ densities involving $n_R$ Riemann tensors
(combined with $n-n_R$ Ricci's) give rise to terms with up to $2n_R-2$
extrinsic curvatures. In particular, densities built from arbitrary Ricci
curvatures combined with zero or one Riemann tensors have no anomaly term in
their functionals. Finally, we apply our results for cubic gravities to the
evaluation of universal terms coming from various symmetric regions in general
dimensions. In particular, we show that the universal function characteristic
of corner regions in $d=3$ gets modified in its functional dependence on the
opening angle with respect to the Einstein gravity result.

thinking well when the right kinds of algebraic structure to consider can be

kinds of algebraic structure are studied through the theory of operads, of
algebraic theories, of properads (possibly with ""colours"" or ""sorts"") or of the
like. We understand this as use of algebra for studying a certain meta aspect
of the subject of algebra, namely, studying kinds of algebraic structure in
general (rather than structures of specific kinds themselves).
  In higher categorical contexts, more various algebraic structures can be
considered (starting in fact with operads considered with arbitrarily varying
colours) than can be covered with mere higher categorified versions of the
traditional tools. In this survey, we develop a systematic view on quite
general algebraic structures with high categorical dimensionality. We do this
by extending algebra for the meta aspect of algebra, to a higher order, or
highly meta, theory of algebra, where the theoretic order turns out to match
the categorical dimension. We will discuss some examples including a natural
generalization of the notion of topological field theory (TFT) obtained in the

  sheaves","Accepted to Transactions of the London Mathematical Society",,"10.1112/tlm3.12036",,"math.AC math.AG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When studying a graded module $M$ over the Cox ring of a smooth projective
toric variety $X$, there are two standard types of resolutions commonly used to
glean information: free resolutions of $M$ and vector bundle resolutions of its
sheafification. Each approach comes with its own challenges. There is geometric
information that free resolutions fail to encode, while vector bundle
resolutions can resist study using algebraic and combinatorial techniques.
Recently, Berkesch, Erman, and Smith introduced virtual resolutions, which
capture desirable geometric information and are also amenable to algebraic and
combinatorial study. The theory of virtual resolutions includes a notion of a
virtually Cohen--Macaulay property, though tools for assessing which modules
are virtually Cohen--Macaulay have only recently started to be developed.
  In this paper, we continue this research program in two related ways. The
first is that, when $X$ is a product of projective spaces, we produce a large
new class of virtually Cohen--Macaulay Stanley--Reisner rings, which we show to
be virtually Cohen--Macaulay via explicit constructions of appropriate virtual
resolutions reflecting the underlying combinatorial structure. The second is
that, for an arbitrary smooth projective toric variety $X$, we develop
homological tools for assessing the virtual Cohen--Macaulay property. Some of
these tools give exclusionary criteria, and others are constructive methods for
producing suitably short virtual resolutions. We also use these tools to
establish relationships among the arithmetically, geometrically, and virtually
Cohen--Macaulay properties.

along with the trajectory of the system during some period. Can we predict
whether the system will eventually synchronize? Even with a known underlying
graph structure, this is an important yet analytically intractable question in
general. In this work, we take an alternative approach to the synchronization
prediction problem by viewing it as a classification problem based on the fact
that any given system will eventually synchronize or converge to a
non-synchronizing limit cycle. By only using some basic statistics of the
underlying graphs such as edge density and diameter, our method can achieve
perfect accuracy when there is a significant difference in the topology of the
underlying graphs between the synchronizing and the non-synchronizing examples.
However, in the problem setting where these graph statistics cannot distinguish
the two classes very well (e.g., when the graphs are generated from the same
random graph model), we find that pairing a few iterations of the initial
dynamics along with the graph statistics as the input to our classification
algorithms can lead to significant improvement in accuracy; far exceeding what
is known by the classical oscillator theory. More surprisingly, we find that in
almost all such settings, dropping out the basic graph statistics and training
our algorithms with only initial dynamics achieves nearly the same accuracy. We
demonstrate our method on three models of continuous and discrete coupled
oscillators -- the Kuramoto model, Firefly Cellular Automata, and
Greenberg-Hastings model. Finally, we also propose an ""ensemble prediction""
algorithm that successfully scales our method to large graphs by training on
dynamics observed from multiple random subgraphs.

recently gained considerable attention in array processing thanks to their
capability to provide enhanced degrees of freedom in resolving uncorrelated

Converters (ADCs) has emerged as an important topic in array processing, as it
offers both a low-cost and a low-complexity implementation. In this paper, we
study the problem of DoA estimation from one-bit measurements received by an
SLA. Specifically, we first investigate the identifiability conditions for the

the case when DoAs are estimated from infinite-bit unquantized measurements.
Towards determining the performance limits of DoA estimation from one-bit

Specifically, we consider additional integration of line and plane features,
which are ubiquitous and more structurally salient in civilian environments,
into the SLAM to ensure feature sufficiency and localization robustness. More
importantly, we incorporate general prior map information into the SLAM to
restrain its drift and improve the accuracy. To avoid rigorous association
between prior information and local observations, we parameterize the prior
knowledge as low dimensional structural priors defined as relative
distances/angles between different geometric primitives. The localization is
formulated as a graph-based optimization problem that contains
sliding-window-based variables and factors, including IMU, heterogeneous
features, and structure priors. We also derive the analytical expressions of
Jacobians of different factors to avoid the automatic differentiation overhead.
To further alleviate the computation burden of incorporating structural prior
factors, a selection mechanism is adopted based on the so-called information
gain to incorporate only the most effective structure priors in the graph
optimization. Finally, the proposed framework is extensively tested on
synthetic data, public datasets, and, more importantly, on the real UAV flight
data obtained from a building inspection task. The results show that the
proposed scheme can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of
localization for autonomous robots in civilian applications.

use this formalism to extend the fundamental theorem of partial differential

new examples of non-Krull valuations that merit further study in their own
right.

combines the cross-correlation functions from multiple epochs, to place
temperature and contrast limits on the accessible exoplanet population for the
first time. We find that planets approximately Saturn-size and larger within
$\sim$0.2 AU of a Sun-like star are likely to be detectable with current
instrumentation in the $L$-band, a significant expansion compared with the
previously-studied population. Cooler ($ \rm T_{eq} \leq 1000$ K) exoplanets
are more detectable than suggested by their photometric contrast alone as a
result of chemical changes which increase spectroscopic contrast. The $L$-band
CH$_4$ spectrum of cooler exoplanets enables robust constraints on the
atmospheric C/O ratio at $\rm T_{eq} \sim 900K$, which have proven difficult to
obtain for hot Jupiters. These results suggest that the multi-epoch approach to
HRCCS can detect and characterize exoplanet atmospheres throughout the inner
regions of Sun-like systems with existing high-resolution spectrographs. We
find that many epochs of modest signal-to-noise ($\rm S/N_{epoch} \sim 1500$)
yield the clearest detections and constraints on C/O, emphasizing the need for
high-precision near-infrared telluric correction with short integration times.

clustering generative adversarial network is then developed to synthesize one
modality conditioning on the other modality, which can compensate missing
samples and align the visual and tactile modalities naturally by adversarial
learning. To the end, two pseudo-label based KL-divergence losses are employed
to update the corresponding modality-specific encoders. Extensive comparative

applied to real users to train dialogue agents from scratch because of the high

train on, have been considered as an affordable substitute for real users.
However, this random sampling method ignores the law of human learning, making
the learned dialogue policy inefficient and unstable. We propose a novel
framework, Automatic Curriculum Learning-based Deep Q-Network (ACL-DQN), which
replaces the traditional random sampling method with a teacher policy model to
realize the dialogue policy for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher
model arranges a meaningful ordered curriculum and automatically adjusts it by
monitoring the learning progress of the dialogue agent and the over-repetition
penalty without any requirement of prior knowledge. The learning progress of
the dialogue agent reflects the relationship between the dialogue agent's
ability and the sampled goals' difficulty for sample efficiency. The
over-repetition penalty guarantees the sampled diversity. Experiments show that
the ACL-DQN significantly improves the effectiveness and stability of dialogue
tasks with a statistically significant margin. Furthermore, the framework can
be further improved by equipping with different curriculum schedules, which
demonstrates that the framework has strong generalizability.

computational overhead incurred by the integer L-shaped method while generating
classical Benders cuts from a continuous relaxation of an integer programming

two-stage stochastic optimization with a scheduling second-stage problem, and
the first comparison of LBBD with the integer \mbox{L-shaped} method. The

designs such as a single wheel or wheelset, but the results may not be

trade off accuracy over complexity, a bogie model can be the optimum selection.
Furthermore, only a real time model can replicate its physical counterpart in
the time domain. Developing such a model requires broad expertise and
appropriate software and hardware. A few published works are available which
deal with real time modeling. However, the influence of the control system has
not been included in those works. To address these issues, a real-time scaled
bogie test rig including the control system is essential. Therefore, a 1:4
scaled bogie roller rig is developed to study the adhesion between wheel and
roller contact. To compare the performances obtained from the scaled bogie test
rig and to expand the test applications, a numerical simulation model of that
scaled bogie test rig is developed using Gensys multibody software. This model
is the complete model of the test rig which delivers more precise results. To
exactly represent the physical counterpart system in the time domain, a
real-time scaled bogie test rig (RT SBTR) is developed after four consecutive

such end, the computational time improved from 4 times slower than real time to
2 times faster than real time. Finally, the real time scaled bogie model is

usages are considered as normal body cells. We transform them into normal-usage
signatures. Then, artificial detectors are randomly generated by generating
artificial deviations from these usages with the objective of being different
from the normal usage signatures. The generated detectors have the ability to
detect risky uses of APIs exactly as the immune system detects foreign cells of
the organism. Moreover, for the detection purpose, only the artificial
detectors are necessary, without the need to disclose the code used to generate
them. Our approach was evaluated on the misuses dataset of three APIs as well
as on known misuses from a state of the art APIs misuses benchmarking dataset.
APIMMUNE was also compared to four state-of-the-art API misuse detection tools.
The results show that APIMMUNE has good detection accuracy and performance, and

recently developed collapsing stellar models [{\it Astrophys. Space Sci.}

massive star under regular initial conditions is analyzed in terms of the
formation of black holes. To study the evolution of an anisotropic star
undergoing gravitational collapse, it is assumed that the dissipation process
happens in the form of radial heat-flux. The interior space-time is described
by static metric matched at the boundary with Vaidya metric that describes the
exterior to the radiating star. The initial static configuration is described
by the relativistic solution obtained by Paul and Deb [{\it Astrophys. Space

gravitational collapse of a massive star is studied. The relativistic causal
heat transport equation of the Maxwell-Cattaneo equation is utilized to show
the dependence of anisotropy on the temperature profile of the collapsing

recent years. In this architectural style, small and loosely coupled modules
are deployed and scaled independently to compose cloud-native applications.
Carrier-grade service providers are migrating their legacy applications to a
microservice based architecture running on Kubernetes which is an open source
platform for orchestrating containerized microservice based applications.
However, in this migration, service availability remains a concern. Service
availability is measured as the percentage of time the service is provisioned.
High Availability (HA) is achieved when the service is available at least
99.999% of the time. In this paper, we identify possible architectures for
deploying stateful microservice based applications with Kubernetes and evaluate
Kubernetes from the perspective of availability it provides for its managed
applications. The results of our experiments show that the repair actions of
Kubernetes cannot satisfy HA requirements, and in some cases cannot guarantee
service recovery. Therefore, we propose an HA State Controller which integrates
with Kubernetes and allows for application state replication and automatic
service redirection to the healthy microservice instances by enabling service
recovery in addition to the repair actions of Kubernetes. Based on experiments
we evaluate our solution and compare the different architectures from the
perspective of availability and scaling overhead. The results of our
investigations show that our solution can improve the recovery time of stateful
microservice based applications by 50%.

stochasticity is also known as the aleatoric uncertainty and is closely related
to the notion of risk. In this work, we make the first attempt to study
risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning under the average reward setting
with the variance risk criteria. In particular, we focus on a
variance-constrained policy optimization problem where the goal is to find a
policy that maximizes the expected value of the long-run average reward,
subject to a constraint that the long-run variance of the average reward is
upper bounded by a threshold. Utilizing Lagrangian and Fenchel dualities, we
transform the original problem into an unconstrained saddle-point policy
optimization problem, and propose an actor-critic algorithm that iteratively
and efficiently updates the policy, the Lagrange multiplier, and the Fenchel
dual variable. When both the value and policy functions are represented by
multi-layer overparameterized neural networks, we prove that our actor-critic
algorithm generates a sequence of policies that finds a globally optimal policy

physical properties of perovskite materials. Therefore, tuning physical
properties, one of the most important goals in condensed matter research, may
be accomplished by controlling octahedral rotation (OR). In this study, it is
demonstrated that OR can be driven by an electric field in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.
Rotated octahedra in the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ are restored to the
unrotated bulk structure upon dosing the surface with K. Theoretical
investigation shows that OR in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ originates from the surface
electric field, which can be tuned via the screening effect of the overlaid K
layer. This work establishes not only that variation in the OR angle can be
induced by an electric field, but also provides a way to control OR, which is
an important step towards in situ control of the physical properties of
perovskite oxides.

world as we knew in 2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic
epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its
high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important
to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and
be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an
important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of
medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in
a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation
of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can
assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis,
severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients.
In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state,
challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for
diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity
assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by
elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic
epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging
modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed.
SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are
then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19
lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and;
Diagnosis/classification models. Finally, open problems and opportunities are
presented in detail.

a global social welfare maximization problem. Next, we design the online

DPoS, each tenant is incentivized to make its own decision based on its true
preferences without disclosing any private information to the mobile virtual

to show that DPoS has the optimal competitive ratio when the cost function of

of its Type-I outbursts in 2016, 2018, and 2020. The pulsar was faint during
these observations as compared to earlier observations with other
observatories. At the lowest luminosity of 2.5$\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in
0.5--30 keV energy range, $\approx$41.3 s pulsations were clearly detected in
the X-ray light curves. This finding establishes the first firm detection of
pulsations in EXO 2030+375 at an extremely low mass accretion rate to date. The
shape of the pulse profiles is complex due to the presence of several narrow
dips. Though pulsations were detected up to $\sim$80 keV when the source was
brighter, pulsations were limited up to $\sim$25 keV during the third AstroSat
observation at lowest source luminosity. A search for quasi-periodic
oscillations in 2$\times$10$^{-4}$ Hz to 10 Hz yielded a negative result.
Spectral analysis of the AstroSat data showed that the spectrum of the pulsar
was steep with a power-law index of $\sim$2. The values of photon-indices at
observed low luminosities follow the known pattern in sub-critical regime of
the pulsar.

applied to lung nodule classification. However, these methods offer 2D
attention or limited 3D attention to low-resolution feature maps. Moreover,
they still depend on a convenient local filter such as convolution as full 3D
attention is expensive to compute and requires a big dataset, which might not
be available.
  Methods: We propose to use 3D Axial-Attention, which requires a fraction of
the computing power of a regular Non-Local network (i.e., self-attention).
Unlike a regular Non-Local network, the 3D Axial-Attention network applies the
attention operation to each axis separately. Additionally, we solve the
invariant position problem of the Non-Local network by proposing to add 3D
positional encoding to shared embeddings.
  Results: We validated the proposed method on 442 benign nodules and 406
malignant nodules, extracted from the public LIDC-IDRI dataset by following a
rigorous experimental setup using only nodules annotated by at least three
radiologists. Our results show that the 3D Axial-Attention model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all evaluation metrics, including AUC and
Accuracy.
  Conclusions: The proposed model provides full 3D attention, whereby every
element (i.e., pixel) in the 3D volume space attends to every other element in
the nodule effectively. Thus, the 3D Axial-Attention network can be used in all
layers without the need for local filters. The experimental results show the
importance of full 3D attention for classifying lung nodules.

arbitrary type of errors by training the text generation model in a

injecting the targeted errors to the references. In experiments, we focus on
two error types, repeated and dropped tokens in model-generated text. The

magnetic strength is inferred to be (3.6-4.7) kG. Thanks to the sampling with a
cadence of 15 seconds, a new component near the peak time with a very steep
decay is detected in the $R$-band light curve, followed by the two-component
flare template given by Davenport et al. (2014). An effective temperature of
$5340\pm40$ K is measured by a blackbody shape fitting to the spectrum at the
shallower phase during the flare. The filling factors of the flare are
estimated to be $\sim$30\% and 19\% at the peak time and at 54 min after the

representation of a population of brain networks also regarded as an average
connectome. CBTs are powerful tools for creating representative maps of brain
connectivity in typical and atypical populations. Particularly, estimating a
well-centered and representative CBT for populations of multi-view brain
networks (MVBN) is more challenging since these networks sit on complex
manifolds and there is no easy way to fuse different heterogeneous network
views. This problem remains unexplored with the exception of a few recent works
rooted in the assumption that the relationship between connectomes are mostly
linear. However, such an assumption fails to capture complex patterns and
non-linear variation across individuals. Besides, existing methods are simply
composed of sequential MVBN processing blocks without any feedback mechanism,
leading to error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose Deep Graph
Normalizer (DGN), the first geometric deep learning (GDL) architecture for
normalizing a population of MVBNs by integrating them into a single
connectional brain template. Our end-to-end DGN learns how to fuse multi-view
brain networks while capturing non-linear patterns across subjects and
preserving brain graph topological properties by capitalizing on graph
convolutional neural networks. We also introduce a randomized weighted loss
function which also acts as a regularizer to minimize the distance between the
population of MVBNs and the estimated CBT, thereby enforcing its centeredness.
We demonstrate that DGN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on estimating CBTs on both small-scale and large-scale connectomic
datasets in terms of both representativeness and discriminability (i.e.,
identifying distinctive connectivities fingerprinting each brain network

They are characterized by a moderately magnetized white dwarf accreting matter

rise to a detectable $X$-ray emission. VZ Sex is an interesting $X$-ray source
whose nature needs a robust confirmation. Here, we used archive $XMM$-Newton
observation to assign the source to the intermediate polar class. We applied
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method to detect any relevant periodic feature in
the $0.1$--$10$ keV light curve and performed a spectral fitting of the $X$-ray
spectrum in order to get information on the on-going accretion mechanism. By
inspecting the periodogram, we detected a clear periodic feature at $\simeq
20.3$ minutes that we interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf. We
additionally found the typical side bands expected as the consequence of the
beat between the spin and the orbital period of $\simeq 3.581$ hours. The
source is characterized by a unabsorbed flux of $\simeq 2.98\times 10^{-12}$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity {of $\simeq 7

intermediate polar class. Furthermore, with the estimated WD spin, the ratio
$P_{spin}/P_{orb}$ is $\simeq 0.09$, i.e. consistent with that expected for a
typical IP system above the period gap. In addition, the estimated intrinsic

The first part of the thesis is opened with concrete definitions of general
quantum source models and their compression, and each subsequent chapter
addresses the compression of a specific source model as a special case of the
initially defined general models. First, we find the optimal compression rate
of a general mixed state source which includes as special cases all the
previously studied models such as Schumacher's pure and ensemble sources and
other mixed state ensemble models. For an interpolation between the visible and
blind Schumacher's ensemble model, we find the optimal compression rate region
for the entanglement and quantum rates. Later, we study the classical-quantum
variation of the celebrated Slepian-Wolf problem and the ensemble model of
quantum state redistribution for which we find the optimal compression rate
considering per-copy fidelity and single-letter achievable and converse bounds
matching up to continuity of functions which appear in the corresponding
bounds.
  The second part of the thesis revolves around information theoretical
perspective of quantum thermodynamics. We start with a resource theory point of
view of a quantum system with multiple non-commuting charges. Subsequently, we
apply this resource theory framework to study a traditional thermodynamics
setup with multiple non-commuting conserved quantities consisting of a main
system, a thermal bath and batteries to store various conserved quantities of
the system. We state the laws of the thermodynamics for this system, and show
that a purely quantum effect happens in some transformations of the system,
that is, some transformations are feasible only if there are quantum
correlations between the final state of the system and the thermal bath.

A certain physically motivated geometry of metric potential has been chosen and
codependency of the metric potentials outlines the formation of the model. The
exterior spacetime is assumed as described by the exterior Schwarzschild
solution. The smooth matching of the interior to the exterior Schwarzschild
spacetime metric across the boundary and the condition that radial pressure is
zero across the boundary lead us to determine the model parameters. Physical

mass-radius (M-R) relationship that shows the maximum mass admissible for
observed pulsars for a given surface density has also been investigated.

caching contents closer to users. However, cache nodes may belong to different
entities and behave selfishly to maximize their own benefits, which often lead
to performance degradation for the overall network. While there has been
extensive literature on allocating contents to caches to maximize the social
welfare, the analysis of selfish caching behaviors remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, we model the selfish behaviors of cache nodes as selfish caching
games on arbitrary directed graphs with heterogeneous content popularity. We
study the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in selfish
caching games, and analyze its efficiency in terms of social welfare. We show
that a PSNE does not always exist in arbitrary-topology caching networks.
However, if the network does not have a mixed request loop, i.e., a directed
loop in which each edge is traversed by at least one content request, we show
that a PSNE always exists and can be found in polynomial time. Furthermore, we
can avoid mixed request loops by properly choosing request forwarding paths. We
then show that the efficiency of Nash equilibria, captured by the price of
anarchy (PoA), can be arbitrarily poor if we allow arbitrary content request
patterns, and adding extra cache nodes can make the PoA worse, i.e., cache
paradox happens. However, when cache nodes have homogeneous request patterns,
we show that the PoA is bounded even allowing arbitrary topologies. We further
analyze the selfish caching games for cache nodes with limited computational
capabilities, and show that an approximate PSNE exists with bounded PoA in
certain cases of interest. Simulation results show that increasing the cache
capacity in the network improves the efficiency of Nash equilibria, while
adding extra cache nodes can degrade the efficiency of Nash equilibria.

We introduce a notion of the sorted embedding property (SEP), analogous to the
embedding property for profinite groups. We show that any sorted profinite
group has a universal SEP-cover. Our proof gives an alternative proof for the
existence of a universal embedding cover of a profinite group. Also our proof
works for any full subcategory of the sorted profinite groups, which is closed
under taking finite quotients, fibre product, and inverse limit.
  We also introduce a weaker notion of finitely sorted embedding property
(FSEP), and it turns out to be equivalent to SEP. The advantage of FSEP is to
be able to be axiomatized in the first order language of sorted complete
systems. Using this, we show that any sorted profinite group having SEP has the
sorted complete system whose theory is $\omega$-stable under the assumption
that the set of sorts is countable. In this case, as a byproduct, we get the
uniqueness of a universal SEP-cover of a sorted profinite group, which
generalizes the uniqueness of an embedding cover of a profinite group.

for many decades, and recently Brualdi and Cao initiated the study of a
saturation problem for 0-1 matrices. We say that 0-1 matrix $A$ is saturating
for the forbidden 0-1 matrix $P$ if $A$ avoids $P$ but changing any zero to a
one in $A$ creates a copy of $P$. Define $sat(n, P)$ to be the minimum possible
number of ones in an $n \times n$ 0-1 matrix that is saturating for $P$. Fulek
and Keszegh proved that for every 0-1 matrix $P$, either $sat(n, P) = O(1)$ or
$sat(n, P) = \Theta(n)$. They found two 0-1 matrices $P$ for which $sat(n, P) =
O(1)$, as well as infinite families of 0-1 matrices $P$ for which $sat(n, P) =
\Theta(n)$. Their results imply that $sat(n, P) = \Theta(n)$ for almost all $k
\times k$ 0-1 matrices $P$.
  Fulek and Keszegh conjectured that there are many more 0-1 matrices $P$ such
that $sat(n, P) = O(1)$ besides the ones they found, and they asked for a
characterization of all permutation matrices $P$ such that $sat(n, P) = O(1)$.
We affirm their conjecture by proving that almost all $k \times k$ permutation
matrices $P$ have $sat(n, P) = O(1)$. We also make progress on the
characterization problem, since our proof of the main result exhibits a family
of permutation matrices with bounded saturation functions.

By converting the conventional usage of the matrices for defining the Lax

carried out on the space of real positive dependent variables, without
regarding them to be written by subtraction-free rational functions of
independent variables but nevertheless with the conserved quantities which can
be tropicalized. We prove that, in this setup an equation of an analogue of the
`carrier' of the box-ball system for assuring its periodic boundary condition
always has a unique solution. As a result, any states in our systems admit a
commuting family of time evolutions associated with any rectangular shaped
tableaux, in contrast to the case of corresponding generalized periodic
box-ball systems where some states did not admit some of such time evolutions.

find that the jet geometry transitions from a semi-parabolic shape into a
conical/hyperbolic shape at a distance of $\approx10^5$ gravitational radii. We
constrain the frequency-dependent position of the core, from which we locate
the jet base. The jet collimation profile in the parabolic region is in good
agreement with the steady axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic solution for
the outermost poloidal magnetic field line anchored to the black hole event
horizon on the equatorial plane, similar to the nearby radio galaxies M87 and
NGC 6251. The velocity field derived from the asymmetry in brightness between
the jet and counterjet shows gradual acceleration up to the bulk Lorentz factor
of $\Gamma \sim 3$ in the region where the jet collimation occurs, confirming
the presence of the jet acceleration and collimation zone. These results
suggest that the jets are collimated by the pressure of the surrounding medium
and accelerated by converting Poynting flux to kinetic energy flux. We discover
limb-brightening of the jet in a limited distance range where the angular
resolution of our data is sufficient to resolve the jet transverse structure.
This indicates that either the jet has a stratified velocity field of
fast-inner and slow-outer layers or the particle acceleration process is more
efficient in the outer layer due to the interaction with the surroundings on
pc-scales.

time-dependent self-propulsion speed undergoing both translational and
rotational diffusion. Usually, for modeling the motion of active particles, the
self-propulsion speed is assumed to be constant as in the famous model of
active Brownian motion. This assumption is far from what may happen in reality.
Here, we generalize active Brownian motion by considering stochastic
self-propulsion speed $v(t)$. In particular, we assume that $v(t)$ is a
two-state process with $v=0$ (passive state) and $v=s$ (active state). The
transition between the two states is also modeled using the random telegraph
process. It is expected that the presented two-state model where we call it
active-passive Brownian particle has the characteristics of both pure active-
and pure passive-Brownian particle. The analytical results for the first two
moments of displacement and the effective diffusion coefficient confirm this
expectation. We also show that a run-and-tumble particle (such as a motile
bacterium) can be mapped to our model so that their diffusivities at large
scales are equal.

problem can be formulated as the joint distribution modeling of the target and
of the group related variables. The usual parameter estimation strategy for
this joint model is a two-step approach starting by learning the group variable
(clustering step) and then plugging in its estimator for fitting the regression

particular biased regression estimates) since it does not make use of the

laser pulse incident upon a Nano-Micro array (NMA) with substrate incorporated.
This scheme is able to realize effectively electron acceleration and colliding

with high conversion efficiency. At laser intensity of I_0 = 8 times 10^{23}
W/cm^2, ~27% of the laser energy is transferred successfully into the
{\gamma}-rays, and ~0.7% of the laser energy into the positrons. As a
consequence, ultra-short (~440 as) and ultra-brilliant (~10^{24} photons s^{-1}

We found a sub-linear scaling of laser-to-photon conversion efficiency
(proportional to I_0^{0.75}) and a super-linear scaling of laser-to-positron
conversion efficiency (proportional to I_0^{2.5}) with the laser intensity.
Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show that particle ({\gamma}
photon and positron) generation can be manipulated by laser-focusing position,

NMAs are obtained, indicating that microwire array has the advantage over

positron annihilation effect in high-energy-density (HED) environment is

We present a new randomized distributed vertex coloring algorithm for the

and where the nodes of $G$ operate in synchronous communication rounds in which
they can exchange $O(\log n)$-bit messages over all the edges of $G$. For
graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$, we show that the $(\Delta+1)$-list

was only known for the significantly more powerful LOCAL model, where in each
round, neighboring nodes can exchange messages of arbitrary size. The best
previous $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the CONGEST model had a running
time of $O(\log\Delta + \log^6\log n)$ rounds. As a function of $n$ alone, the
best previous algorithm therefore had a round complexity of $O(\log n)$, which
is a bound that can also be achieved by a na\""{i}ve folklore algorithm. For

to distract the classifier in the learning process to force it to focus not

approach by embedding it into the learning process of a convolutional neural
network for the analysis and classification of two well-known datasets, namely

dissertation explores some advantageous synergies between machine learning,
cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, this thesis focuses on
vision and images. The human visual system has been widely studied from both
behavioural and neuroscientific points of view, as vision is the dominant sense
of most people. In turn, machine vision has also been an active area of
research, currently dominated by the use of artificial neural networks. This
work focuses on learning representations that are more aligned with visual
perception and the biological vision. For that purpose, I have studied tools
and aspects from cognitive science and computational neuroscience, and
attempted to incorporate them into machine learning models of vision.
  A central subject of this dissertation is data augmentation, a commonly used
technique for training artificial neural networks to augment the size of data
sets through transformations of the images. Although often overlooked, data
augmentation implements transformations that are perceptually plausible, since
they correspond to the transformations we see in our visual world -- changes in
viewpoint or illumination, for instance. Furthermore, neuroscientists have
found that the brain invariantly represents objects under these
transformations. Throughout this dissertation, I use these insights to analyse
data augmentation as a particularly useful inductive bias, a more effective
regularisation method for artificial neural networks, and as the framework to
analyse and improve the invariance of vision models to perceptually plausible
transformations. Overall, this work aims to shed more light on the properties
of data augmentation and demonstrate the potential of interdisciplinary
research.

at generalizing deep learning to arbitrary non-regular domains. Most of the
existing GCNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the
representation of a node is recursively obtained by aggregating its neighboring
node representations using averaging or sorting operations. However, these
operations are either ill-posed or weak to be discriminant or increase the
number of training parameters and thereby the computational complexity and the
risk of overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel GCN framework that
achieves spatial graph convolution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). The latter makes it possible to design, via implicit kernel
representations, convolutional graph filters in a high dimensional and more
discriminating space without increasing the number of training parameters. The
particularity of our GCN model also resides in its ability to achieve
convolutions without explicitly realigning nodes in the receptive fields of the
learned graph filters with those of the input graphs, thereby making
convolutions permutation agnostic and well defined. Experiments conducted on
the challenging task of skeleton-based action recognition show the superiority
of the proposed method against different baselines as well as the related work.

the local curvature of the loss function. For instance, using a small learning
rate does not guarantee stable optimization because the optimization trajectory
has a tendency to steer towards regions of the loss surface with increasing
local curvature. We ask whether this tendency is connected to the widely
observed phenomenon that the choice of the learning rate strongly influences
generalization. We first show that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) implicitly
penalizes the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), a measure of the
local curvature, from the start of training. We argue it is an implicit
regularizer in SGD by showing that explicitly penalizing the trace of the FIM
can significantly improve generalization. We highlight that poor final
generalization coincides with the trace of the FIM attaining a large value
early in training, to which we refer as catastrophic Fisher explosion. Finally,
to gain insight into the regularization effect of penalizing the trace of the
FIM, we show that it limits memorization by reducing the learning speed of
examples with noisy labels more than that of the examples with clean labels.

events which result in nano to microscale structural alterations in

disease remain undetectable by conventional microscopy due to the
diffraction-limited resolution of ~200nm. With cancer being an epidemic
worldwide, early and accurate detection methods are always in demand. In this
sense, we developed a finer focusing mesoscopic physics-based partial wave
spectroscopy (PWS) imaging and quantification technique, which can probe the
precise scattering volume in cells/tissue to detect such structural
alterations. Therefore, we employ the highly sensitive PWS technique to
quantify the nanoscale refractive index fluctuations using commercially
available paraffin embedded tissue microarrays (TMA) samples with the goal of
the standardized early and accurate detection of stages of different cancers.
Recently the use of scientific TMA samples has gained research interest in
diagnosing different diseases and drug-effect in treatment since they are
commercially easily accessible. In this work, deadly cancer such as pancreatic,
prostate, breast, and colon cancer TMAs containing multiple cores of different
stages for each cancer are analyzed using the PWS technique and the degree of
disorder strength Ld was quantified. The finer focusing PWS results show that
an increase in the disorder strength with the increase in the stage of each

Due to insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate,
efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. As
chest radiography, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and CT computed tomography (CT),
is a possible way for screening COVID-19, developing an automatic image
classification tool is immensely helpful for detecting the patients with
COVID-19. To date, researchers have proposed several different screening
methods; however, none of them could achieve a reliable and highly sensitive
performance yet. The main drawbacks of current methods are the lack of having
enough training data, low generalization performance, and a high rate of
false-positive detection. To tackle such limitations, this study firstly builds
a large-size publicly available CT-scan dataset, consisting of more than 13k
CT-images of more than 1000 individuals, in which 8k images are taken from 500
patients infected with COVID-19. Secondly, we propose a deep learning model for
screening COVID-19 using our proposed CT dataset and report the baseline
results. Finally, we extend the proposed CT model for screening COVID-19 from
CXR images using a transfer learning approach. The experimental results show
that the proposed CT and CXR methods achieve the AUC scores of 0.886 and 0.984

secure systems against microarchitectural attacks, programmers need to reason
about and program against these microarchitectural side-effects. However, we
cannot -- and should not -- expect programmers to manually tailor programs for
specific processors and their security guarantees. Instead, we could rely on
compilers (and the secure compilation community), as they can play a prominent
role in bridging this gap: compilers should target specific processors
microarchitectural security guarantees and they should leverage these
guarantees to produce secure code. To achieve this, we outline the idea of
Contract-Aware Secure COmpilation (CASCO) where compilers are parametric with
respect to a hardware/software security-contract, an abstraction capturing a
processor's security guarantees. That is, compilers will automatically leverage
the guarantees formalized in the contract to ensure that program-level security

shed new light on the microscopic understanding of the cluster states. We aim
to address a possible source of the attraction in the cluster states of
$^8\mathrm{Be}$ in view of the pion exchange. Namely, we investigate whether
the two-pion-exchange interaction acts as a dominant attraction in the
$\alpha+\alpha$ system as predicted by a previous work. We describe
theoretically the cluster structure of $^8\mathrm{Be}$ by the Brink model, for
which the effective interaction is designed from the realistic nuclear force
derived through the chiral effective field theory. The two-body matrix elements
of the chiral interaction with the local-Gaussian bases are formulated within
the approximation of the spin-isospin saturation forming an $\alpha$ particle.
Introducing a global prefactor to the chiral interaction phenomenologically,
the ground and low-lying excited states of $^8\mathrm{Be}$, the scattering
phase shift of the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ system as well, are satisfactorily
depicted. The attraction in the cluster states is found to be stemming from the
two-pion-exchange contributions dominantly, along with nonnegligible
short-range terms. The present work can be the foundation towards constructing
realistic cluster models, by which the cluster states will be revealed

miniaturized robots are susceptible to Sybil attackers, who can fabricate
myriads of fictitious robots. Such detrimental attacks can overturn the
fundamental trust assumption in robotic collaboration and thus impede
widespread deployments of robotic networks in many collaborative tasks.
Existing solutions rely on bulky multi-antenna systems to passively obtain
fine-grained physical layer signatures, making them unaffordable to
miniaturized robots. To overcome this limitation, we present ScatterID, a
lightweight system that attaches featherlight and batteryless backscatter tags
to single-antenna robots for Sybil attack mitigation. Instead of passively
""observing"" signatures, ScatterID actively ""manipulates"" multipath propagation
by exploiting backscatter tags to intentionally create rich multipath
signatures obtainable to single-antenna robots. Particularly, these signatures
are used to carefully construct similarity vectors to thwart advanced Sybil
attackers, who further trigger power-scaling and colluding attacks to generate
dissimilar signatures. Then, a customized random forest model is developed to
accurately infer the identity legitimacy of each robot. We implement ScatterID
on the iRobot Create platform and evaluate it under various Sybil attacks in
real-world environments. The experimental results show that ScatterID achieves
a high AUROC of 0.987 and obtains an overall accuracy of 95.4% under basic and
advanced Sybil attacks. Specifically, it can successfully detect 96.1% of fake

better results in generating test suites with \Sapienz while avoiding

\Sapienz. Method: We conducted a fitness landscape analysis of \Sapienz to
analytically understand the search problem, which allowed us to make informed

of \Sapienz, we observed a lack of diversity of the evolved test suites and a
stagnation of the search after 25 generations. \SapienzDiv realizes mechanisms
that preserve the diversity of the test suites being evolved. The evaluation
showed that \SapienzDiv achieves better or at least similar test results than
\Sapienz concerning coverage and the number of revealed faults. However,
\SapienzDiv typically produces longer test sequences and requires more
execution time than \Sapienz. Conclusions: The understanding of the search
problem obtained by the fitness landscape analysis helped us to find a more
suitable configuration of \Sapienz without trial-and-error experiments. By
promoting diversity of test suites during the search, improved or at least
similar test results in terms of faults and coverage can be achieved.

M_{\mathrm{pl}}$, then only inside $95\%$ CL region after $f$ exceeds the

very similar due to the simple form of the coupling function we use and the

irregular shapes, unclear boundaries, and different skin colors. Our proposed
approach helps in improving the accuracy of skin lesion segmentation. Firstly,

related to translation invariance which further improves the generalization
capacity of the model. Secondly, we have leveraged the properties of deep
residual units along with the convolutional layers. At last, instead of using
only cross-entropy or Dice-loss, we have combined the two-loss functions to
optimize the training metrics which helps in converging the loss more quickly

forwardstepping is that the order of the reference dynamics is typically

and the reference dynamics and the nonlinear system are governed by a
differential/dynamic-cascaded structure. The order invariance or increment of
the specified reference dynamics with respect to the nonlinear system and their

the time evolution of these orbits sweep out world-sheet like geometrical

fields, e.g., drug discovery and genomics. In this survey, we conduct a
comprehensive review of the neural network interpretability research. We first
clarify the definition of interpretability as it has been used in many
different contexts. Then we elaborate on the importance of interpretability and
propose a novel taxonomy organized along three dimensions: type of engagement
(passive vs. active interpretation approaches), the type of explanation, and
the focus (from local to global interpretability). This taxonomy provides a
meaningful 3D view of distribution of papers from the relevant literature as
two of the dimensions are not simply categorical but allow ordinal
subcategories. Finally, we summarize the existing interpretability evaluation
methods and suggest possible research directions inspired by our new taxonomy.

for suitable rank-1 lattices were developed during the last decades. On the one
hand, there exist constructions that are based on minimizing some error
functional. On the other hand, there is the possibility to construct rank-1
lattices whose corresponding cubature rule exactly integrates all elements
within a space of multivariate trigonometric polynomials.
  In this paper, we focus on the second approach, i.e., the exactness of rank-1
lattice rules. The main contribution is the analysis of a probabilistic version
of an already known algorithm that realizes a CBC construction of such rank-1
lattices. It turns out that the computational effort of the known deterministic
algorithm can be considerably improved in average by means of a simple
randomization. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of the computational costs
with respect to a certain failure probability, which then leads to the
development of a probabilistic CBC algorithm. In particular, the presented
approach will be highly beneficial for the construction of so-called
reconstructing rank-1 lattices, that are practically relevant for function
approximation. Subsequent to the rigorous analysis of the presented CBC
algorithms, we present an algorithm that determines reconstructing rank-1
lattices of reasonable lattice sizes with high probability. We provide
estimates on the resulting lattice sizes and bounds on the occurring failure
probability. Furthermore, we discuss the computational complexity of the
presented algorithm.
  Various numerical tests illustrate the efficiency of the presented
algorithms. Among others, we demonstrate how to exploit the efficiency of our
algorithm even for the construction of exactly integrating rank-1 lattices,
provided that a certain property of the treated space of trigonometric
polynomials is known.

as $\mathrm{mDu}=|\sigma|/e(R/\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the screening
length of the electrolyte carrying the $c$ dependence ($\lambda\sim c^{-1/2}$).
Scaling means that the device function (selectivity) is a smooth and (in this
case) monotonic function of mDu. The original Dukhin number defined as
$\mathrm{Du}=|\sigma|/eRc$ ($c^{-1}$ dependence) was introduced to indicate
whether the surface or the volume conduction is dominant in the pore. The
modified version satisfies scaling and characterizes selectivity in the
intermediate regime, where both surface and bulk conductions are present and
the pore is neither perfectly selective, nor perfectly non-selective. Our
modeling study using the Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo method and the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory provides the radial flux profiles from which the
radial selectivity profile can be computed. These profiles show in which region
of the nanopore the surface or the volume conduction dominates for a given
combination of the variables $\sigma$, $R$, and $c$. We show that the
inflection point of the scaling curve may be used to characterize the
transition point between the surface and volume conductions.

that cannot be translated without using context information (e.g., texts in
other speech bubbles, gender of speakers, etc.). Second, for training the
model, we propose the approach to automatic corpus construction from pairs of

quantification is a vital task in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) era. This paper combines hybrid quantum-classical computation and
quasi-probability decomposition to propose two variational quantum algorithms,
called Variational Entanglement Detection (VED) and Variational Logarithmic
Negativity Estimation (VLNE), for detecting and quantifying entanglement on
near-term quantum devices, respectively. VED makes use of the positive map
criterion and works as follows. Firstly, it decomposes a positive map into a
combination of quantum operations implementable on near-term quantum devices.
It then variationally estimates the minimal eigenvalue of the final state,
obtained by executing these implementable operations on the target state and
averaging the output states. Deterministic and probabilistic methods are
proposed to compute the average. At last, it asserts that the target state is
entangled if the optimized minimal eigenvalue is negative. VLNE builds upon a
linear decomposition of the transpose map into Pauli terms and the recently
proposed trace distance estimation algorithm. It variationally estimates the
well-known logarithmic negativity entanglement measure and could be applied to
quantify entanglement on near-term quantum devices. Experimental and numerical
results on the Bell state, isotropic states, and Breuer states show the
validity of the proposed entanglement detection and quantification methods.

colleagues proposed the concept of Panarchy, which presented social-ecological
systems as an interacting set of adaptive cycles, each of which is produced by
the dynamic tensions between novelty and efficiency at multiple scales.
Initially introduced as a conceptual framework and set of metaphors, panarchy
has gained the attention of scholars across many disciplines and its ideas
continue to inspire further conceptual developments. Almost twenty years after
this concept was introduced we review how it has been used, tested, extended
and revised. We do this by combining qualitative methods and machine learning.
Document analysis was used to code panarchy features that are commonly used in
the scientific literature (N = 42), a qualitative analysis that was
complemented with topic modeling of 2177 documents. We find that the adaptive
cycle is the feature of panarchy that has attracted the most attention.
Challenges remain in empirically grounding the metaphor, but recent theoretical
and empirical work offers some avenues for future research.

giant planets embedded in planetesimal disks, coupled with a compositional
model of the protoplanetary disk where volatiles are inherited from the
molecular cloud and refractories are calibrated against extrasolar and Solar
System data. We find that the C/O ratio provides limited insight on the
formation pathways of giant planets that undergo large-scale migration. This
limitation can be overcome thanks to nitrogen and sulphur. Jointly using the
C/N, N/O and C/O ratios breaks any degeneracy in the formation and migration
tracks of giant planets. The use of elemental ratios normalized to the
respective stellar ratios supplies additional information on the nature of
giant planets, thanks to the relative volatility of O, C and N in disks. When
the planetary metallicity is dominated by the accretion of solids C/N* $>$ C/O*
$>$ N/O* (* denoting this normalized scale), otherwise N/O* $>$ C/O* $>$ C/N*.

revealed several puzzling facts: The concentration of ammonia is variable down
to pressures of tens of bars, and is strongly dependent on latitude. While most
latitudes exhibit a low abundance, the Equatorial Zone of Jupiter has an
abundance of ammonia that is high and nearly uniform with depth. In parallel,
the Equatorial Zone is peculiar for its absence of lightning, which is
otherwise prevalent most everywhere else on the planet. We show that a model
accounting for the presence of small-scale convection and water storms
originating in Jupiter's deep atmosphere accounts for the observations. Where
strong thunderstorms are observed on the planet, we estimate that the formation
of ammonia-rich hail ('mushballs') and subsequent downdrafts can deplete
efficiency the upper atmosphere of its ammonia and transport it efficiently to
the deeper levels. In the Equatorial Zone, the absence of thunderstorms shows
that this process is not occurring, implying that small-scale convection can
maintain a near-homogeneity of this region. A simple model satisfying mass and
energy balance accounts for the main features of Juno's MWR observations and
successfully reproduces the inverse correlation seen between ammonia abundance
and the lightning rate as function of latitude. We predict that in regions
where ammonia is depleted, water should also be depleted to great depths. The
fact that condensates are not well mixed by convection until far deeper than
their condensation level has consequences for our understanding of Jupiter's
deep interior and of giant-planet atmospheres in general.

general independent of UDA purely involve a single domain, thus might not be

of reducing feature redundancy for improving UDA in a bi-level way. For the
first level, we try to ensure compact domain-specific features with a
transferable decorrelated normalization module, which preserves specific domain
information whilst easing the side effect of feature redundancy on the sequel
domain-invariance. In the second level, domain-invariant feature redundancy
caused by domain-shared representation is further mitigated via an alternative

easily plugged into any BN-based backbone neural networks. Specifically, simply

a superluminal polarization-current distribution accelerates can be used to
transmit a broadband signal that is reproduced in a comprehensible form at a
chosen target distance and angle. The requirement for this exact correspondence
between broadcast and received signals is that each moving point in the
polarization-current distribution approaches the target at the speed of light
at all times during its transit along the antenna. This results in a one-to-one
correspondence between the time at which each point on the moving polarization
current enters the antenna and the time at which {\it all} of the radiation
emitted by this particular point during its transit through the antenna arrives
simultaneously at the target. This has the effect of reproducing the desired
time dependence of the original broadcast signal. For other observer/detector
positions, the time dependence of the signal is scrambled, due to the
non-trivial relationship between emission (retarded) time and reception time.
This technique represents a contrast to conventional radio transmission
methods; in most examples of the latter, signals are broadcast with little or
no directivity, selectivity of reception being achieved through the use of
narrow frequency bands. In place of this, the current paper uses a spread of
frequencies to transmit information to a particular location; the signal is
weaker and has a scrambled time dependence elsewhere. We point out the possible
relevance of this mechanism to 5G neighbourhood networks. This work also
constitutes a ground-based astrophysics experiment that gives strong clues

additional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly
compliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft
such that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more
vulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the
mission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the
survivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off
solutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise
measures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris
impacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the
authors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary
design solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the
survivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design. In
this way, a more integrated design can be achieved. The present work focuses on
the improvement of the multi-objective optimisation framework by including
constraints. The paper shows the application of the constrained optimisation to
two relevant examples: the optimisation of a tank assembly and the optimisation
of a typical satellite configuration.

relationship between the normalized dust surface potential and the dusty plasma

the relationship depends evidently on the three parameters in the non-Maxwell

increase of the potential, such dependence will weaken soon. The dust surface
potential is negative and increases monotonously with increase of the dust

distribution, it is generally greater than that in the same plasma with the
kappa-distribution and the Maxwellian distribution.

systems of different nature. Dispersed ""inclusions"", described by the phase
field distribution, are usually three dimensional objects. When describing
elastic fracture evolution, elements of the dispersed phase are effectively 2d
objects. An example of the model which governs evolution of effectively 1d
dispersed inclusions is phase field model for electric breakdown in solids.
Phase field model is defined by appropriate free energy functional, which
depends on phase field and its derivatives. In this work we show that
codimension of the dispersed ""inclusion"" significantly restrict the functional
dependency of system energy on the derivatives of the problem state variables.
It is shown that free energy of any phase field model suitable to describe
codimension 2 diffuse objects necessary depends on higher order derivatives of
the phase field or need an additional smoothness of the solution - it should
have first derivatives integrable with a power greater then two. To support
theoretical discussion, some numerical experiments are presented.

  3D Object Estimation","9 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural network (CNN) based architectures, such as Mask R-CNN,
constitute the state of the art in object detection and segmentation. Recently,
these methods have been extended for model-based segmentation where the network
outputs the parameters of a geometric model (e.g. an ellipse) directly. This
work considers objects whose three-dimensional models can be represented as
ellipsoids. We present a variant of Mask R-CNN for estimating the parameters of
ellipsoidal objects by segmenting each object and accurately regressing the
parameters of projection ellipses. We show that model regression is sensitive
to the underlying occlusion scenario and that prediction quality for each
object needs to be characterized individually for accurate 3D object
estimation. We present a novel ellipse regression loss which can learn the
offset parameters with their uncertainties and quantify the overall geometric
quality of detection for each ellipse. These values, in turn, allow us to fuse
multi-view detections to obtain 3D ellipsoid parameters in a principled
fashion. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets quantitatively
demonstrate the high accuracy of our proposed method in estimating 3D objects
under heavy occlusions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
