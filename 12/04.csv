degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations (DCMAE) on singular spaces. First,
we study the Dirichlet problem for DCMAE on singular Stein spaces, showing a
general continuity result. A consequence of our results is that
K\""ahler-Einstein potentials are continuous at isolated singularities. Next, we
establish the global continuity of solutions to DCMAE when the reference class
belongs to the real N\'eron-Severi group. This yields in particular the
continuity of K\""ahler-Einstein potentials on any irreducible Calabi-Yau
variety.

controlling the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, NPI efficacy varies
enormously between and within countries, mainly because of population and
behavioural heterogeneity. In this work, we adapted a multi-group SEIRA model
to study the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 in Chile, representing
geographically separated regions of the country by different groups. We use
national mobilization statistics to estimate the connectivity between regions
and data from governmental repositories to obtain COVID-19 spreading and death
rates in each region. We then assessed the effectiveness of different NPIs by
studying the temporal evolution of the reproduction number Rt. Analyzing
data-driven and model-based estimates of Rt, we found a strong coupling of
different regions, highlighting the necessity of organized and coordinated
actions to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated different
scenarios to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 in the most densely populated
regions, finding that the early lifting of restriction probably will lead to
novel outbreaks.

based on decoupling the input-output dynamics of the system, followed by the
deployment of a bank of SRGs for each decoupled channel. We present two
formulations of DRG: DRG-tf, which is based on system decoupling using transfer
functions, and DRG-ss, which is built on state feedback decoupling. A detailed
set-theoretic analysis of DRG, which highlights its main characteristics, is
presented. We also show a quantitative comparison between DRG and the VRG to
illustrate the computational advantages of DRG. The robustness of this approach

continuous random variables, but modeling count data via copulas has recently
become popular in the statistics literature. Spearman's rho is an appropriate
and effective tool to measure the degree of dependence between two random
variables. In this paper, we derived the population version of Spearman's rho
correlation via copulas when both random variables are discrete. The
closed-form expressions of the Spearman correlation are obtained for some
copulas of simple structure such as Archimedean copulas with different marginal
distributions. We derive the upper bound and the lower bound of the Spearman's
rho for Bernoulli random variables. Then, the proposed Spearman's rho
correlations are compared with their corresponding Kendall's tau values. We
characterize the functional relationship between these two measures of
dependence in some special cases. An extensive simulation study is conducted to
demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results. Finally, we propose a
bivariate copula regression model to analyze the count data of a \emph{cervical

monitoring diverse systems across space and time. Examples of their widespread
applications include: precision agriculture, surveillance, ecosystem and

sensor devices at fixed locations, wherein each individual sensor obtains
measurements that are subsequently fused and processed at a central processing

primarily on employing parametric models for signal attenuation from target to
device. In this paper, we adopt a nonparametric approach that only assumes that
the signal is nonincreasing as function of the distance between the sensor and
the target. We propose a simple tuning parameter free estimator for the target
location, namely, the simple score estimator (SSCE). We show that the SSCE is
$\sqrt{n}$ consistent and has a Gaussian limit distribution which can be used
to construct asymptotic confidence regions for the location of the target. We
study the performance of the SSCE through extensive simulations, and finally
demonstrate an application to target detection in a video surveillance data

classical relationship between field values and wavenumbers brought about by
quantum diffusion near the end of inflation. This shows that cosmic microwave

a solution closely related to electrostatics, and a solution can be computed by

by itself, the acceleration measured in this way is a good quality indicator of
the Gaia astrometric solution. Methods. The effect of the acceleration is
obtained as a part of the general expansion of the vector field of proper
motions in Vector Spherical Harmonics (VSH). Various versions of the VSH fit
and various subsets of the sources are tried and compared to get the most
consistent result and a realistic estimate of its uncertainty. Additional tests
with the Gaia astrometric solution are used to get a better idea on possible
systematic errors in the estimate.
  Results. Our best estimate of the acceleration based on Gaia EDR3 is $(2.32
\pm 0.16) \times 10^{-10}$ m s${}^{-2}$ (or $7.33 \pm 0.51$ km s$^{-1}$
Myr${}^{-1}$) towards $\alpha = 269.1^\circ \pm 5.4^\circ$, $\delta =
-31.6^\circ \pm 4.1^\circ$, corresponding to a proper motion amplitude of $5.05
\pm 0.35$ $\mu$as yr${}^{-1}$. This is in good agreement with the acceleration
expected from current models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We expect
that future Gaia data releases will provide estimates of the acceleration with
uncertainties substantially below 0.1 $\mu$as yr${}^{-1}$.

interactions between infected nodes decrease the quality of LPTV and Pearson.
GMLA is the most resistant to harmful effects of the self-interactions, which
is especially visible for medium and high level of stochasticity of the
process, when spreading rate is below 0.5. The reason for this may be the fact
that GMLA uses only the nearest observers, which are much less likely affected
by the interactions between infected nodes, because these contacts become
important as the epidemics develops and the number of infected agents

However, the universal claim according to which a new quantum logic is

challenged. In the present essay we critically discuss this claim by showing
that classical logic can be rehabilitated in a quantum context by taking into
account Bohmian mechanics. It will be argued, indeed, that such a theoretical

becoming increasingly popular modalities to perform robust activity analysis.
Applications range from action recognition to quantifying movement quality for
health applications. While marker-less motion capture has made great progress,
in critical applications such as healthcare, marker-based systems, especially
active markers, are still considered gold-standard. However, there are several
practical challenges in both modalities such as visibility, tracking errors,
and simply the need to keep marker setup convenient wherein movements are
recorded with a reduced marker-set. This implies that certain joint locations
will not even be marked-up, making downstream analysis of full body movement
challenging. To address this gap, we first pose the problem of reconstructing
the unmarked joint data as an ill-posed linear inverse problem. We recover
missing joints for a given action by projecting it onto the manifold of human
actions, this is achieved by optimizing the latent space representation of a
deep autoencoder. Experiments on both mocap and Kinect datasets clearly
demonstrate that the proposed method performs very well in recovering semantics
of the actions and dynamics of missing joints. We will release all the code and

(ProtoTree), an intrinsically interpretable deep learning method for

decision trees, and thus results in a globally interpretable model by design.
Additionally, ProtoTree can locally explain a single prediction by outlining a
decision path through the tree. Each node in our binary tree contains a
trainable prototypical part. The presence or absence of this learned prototype
in an image determines the routing through a node. Decision making is therefore
similar to human reasoning: Does the bird have a red throat? And an elongated
beak? Then it's a hummingbird! We tune the accuracy-interpretability trade-off
using ensemble methods, pruning and binarizing. We apply pruning without
sacrificing accuracy, resulting in a small tree with only 8 learned prototypes
along a path to classify a bird from 200 species. An ensemble of 5 ProtoTrees
achieves competitive accuracy on the CUB-200- 2011 and Stanford Cars data sets.

for all possible combinations of semiconducting TMDCs: MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$,
WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. The band alignment between these materials is found to
play a crucial in enhancing the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ($ZT$) and power
factor far beyond those of pristine TMDCs. In particular, we show that the
room-temperature $ZT$ value of $n$-type WS$_2$ with WSe$_2$ triangular
inclusions, is five times larger than the pristine WS$_2$ monolayer. $p$-type
MoSe$_2$ with WSe$_2$ inclusions is also shown to have a room-temperature $ZT$

power factor values calculated here, are the highest reported amongst gapped 2D

of the Sun from the \G\ Early Data Release 3. We characterise the catalogue
through comparisons to the full data release, external catalogues, and
simulations. We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with
this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use.
  The selection of objects within 100\,pc from the full catalogue used selected
training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and
solution quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric
solution is reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric
data, quality flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated
distance posterior probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock
catalogues to define priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero
probability of being within 100\,pc is included in the catalogue.
  We have produced a catalogue of \NFINAL\ objects that we estimate contains at
least 92\% of stars of stellar type M9 within 100\,pc of the Sun. We estimate
that 9\% of the stars in this catalogue probably lie outside 100\,pc, but when
the distance probability function is used, a correct treatment of this
contamination is possible. We produced luminosity functions with a high
signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. We
examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white dwarf population, and
wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all three samples. We
detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters, and halo
objects, in which we identified 12 members of \G\ Enceladus. We present the
first direct parallaxes of five objects in multiple systems within 10\,pc of
the Sun.

pandemic in which many Heath National Systems were not able to satisfy the
demand of ventilators, sanitary individual protection equipments or different
human resources. Our tool is based in two main principles: (1) Part of the
stock of equipments at a unit that is not needed (in near future) could be
shared to other units; and (2) extra stock to be shared among the units in a
region can be efficiently distributed taking into account the demand of the
units. The decisions are taken with the aim of minimizing certain measures of
the non-covered demand in a region where a given network structured set of
units is given. The mathematical programming models that we provide are
stochastic and multiperiod and we provide different robust objective functions.
Since the proposed models are computationally hard to solve, we provide a
divide-et-conquer math-heuristic approach. We report the results of applying
our approach to the data of the COVID-19 case in different regions of Spain,
highlighting some interesting conclusions of our analysis, such as the great

together fiducial cells in a homogeneous and isotropic universe has been
recently developed in the context of loop quantum cosmology. The key technical
ingredient was an SU(1, 1) group and Lie algebra structure of the physical
observables as well as the use of Perelomov coherent states for SU(1, 1). It
was shown that the coarse graining operation is completely captured by changing
group representations. Based on this result, it was subsequently shown that one
can extract an explicit renormalisation group flow of the loop quantum
cosmology Hamiltonian operator in a simple model with dust-clock. In this
paper, we continue this line of investigation and derive a coherent state path
integral formulation of this quantum theory and extract an explicit expression
for the renormalisation-scale dependent classical Hamiltonian entering the path
integral for a coarse grained description at that scale. We find corrections to
the non-renormalised Hamiltonian that are qualitatively similar to those
previously investigated via canonical quantisation. In particular, they are
again most sensitive to small quantum numbers, showing that the large quantum
number (spin) description captured by so called ""effective equations"" in loop
quantum cosmology does not reproduce the physics of many small quantum numbers
(spins). Our results have direct impact on path integral quantisation in loop
quantum gravity, showing that the usually taken large spin limit should be
expected not to capture (without renormalisation, as mostly done) the physics
of many small spins that is usually assumed to be present in physically
reasonable quantum states.

on accurate estimates of the locations of sources in the Gaia data stream. This
is ultimately performed by point spread function (PSF) fitting, which in turn
requires an accurate reconstruction of the PSF. Gaia Early Data Release 3
(EDR3) will, for the first time, use a PSF calibration that models several of
the strongest dependences, leading to signficantly reduced systematic errors.
Aims: We describe the PSF model and calibration pipeline implemented for Gaia
EDR3, including an analysis of the calibration results over the 34 months of
data. We include a discussion of the limitations of the current pipeline and
directions for future releases. This will be of use both to users of Gaia data
and as a reference for other precision astrometry missions. Methods: We develop
models of the 1D line spread function (LSF) and 2D PSF profiles based on a
linear combination of basis components. We fit the models to selected primary
sources in independent time ranges, using simple parameterisations for the
colour and other dependences. Variation in time is smoothed by merging the
independent calibrations in a square root information filter, with resets at
certain mission events that induce a discontinuous change in the PSF. Results:
The PSF calibration shows strong time and colour dependences that accurately
reproduce the varying state of the Gaia astrometric instrument. Analysis of the
residuals reveals both the performance and the limitations of the current
models and calibration pipeline, and indicates the directions for future
development. Conclusions: The PSF modelling and calibration carried out for
Gaia EDR3 represents a major step forwards in the data processing and will lead
to reduced systematic errors in the core mission data products. Further
significant improvements are expected in the future data releases.

unconcentrated component of the EPIC/pn background - supposedly related to
cosmic rays interacting with the telescope. We find that the out-field of view
region of the pn detector is actually exposed to the sky. After cleaning from
the sky contamination, the unconcentrated background does not show significant
spatial variations and its time behaviour is anti-correlated with the solar
cycle. We find a very tight, linear correlation between unconcentrated
backgrounds detected in the EPIC/pn and MOS2 cameras: this permits the correct
evaluation of the pn unconcentrated background of each exposure on the basis of
MOS2 data, avoiding the use (as usual) of the contaminated pn regions. We find
a tight, linear correlation between the pn unconcentrated background and the
proton flux in the 630-970 MeV energy band measured by SOHO/EPHIN. Through this
relationship we quantify the contribution of cosmic ray interactions to the pn
unconcentrated background and we find a second source which contributes to the
pn unconcentrated background for a significant fraction (30%-70%), that does
not vary with time and is roughly isotropic. Hard X-ray photons of the CXB
satisfy all the known properties of this new component. Our findings provide an

brain tumor is facing to the imbalanced data problem where the number of pixels
belonging to the background class (non tumor pixel) is much larger than the
number of pixels belonging to the foreground class (tumor pixel). To address
this problem, we propose a multi-task network which is formed as a cascaded
structure. Our model consists of two targets, i.e., (i) effectively
differentiate the brain tumor regions and (ii) estimate the brain tumor mask.
The first objective is performed by our proposed contextual brain tumor
detection network, which plays a role of an attention gate and focuses on the
region around brain tumor only while ignoring the far neighbor background which
is less correlated to the tumor. The second objective is built upon a 3D atrous
residual network and under an encode-decode network in order to effectively
segment both large and small objects (brain tumor). Our 3D atrous residual
network is designed with a skip connection to enables the gradient from the
deep layers to be directly propagated to shallow layers, thus, features of
different depths are preserved and used for refining each other. In order to
incorporate larger contextual information from volume MRI data, our network
utilizes the 3D atrous convolution with various kernel sizes, which enlarges
the receptive field of filters. Our proposed network has been evaluated on
various datasets including BRATS2015, BRATS2017 and BRATS2018 datasets with
both validation set and testing set. Our performance has been benchmarked by
both region-based metrics and surface-based metrics. We also have conducted

Distribution estimation is one of the most fundamental estimation problems,
which is widely studied in both non-private and private settings. In the local
model, private mechanisms with provably optimal sample complexity are known.
However, they are optimal only in the worst-case sense; their sample complexity
is proportional to the size of the entire universe, which could be huge in
practice. In this paper, we consider sparse or approximately sparse (e.g.\
highly skewed) distribution, and show that the number of samples needed could
be significantly reduced. This problem has been studied recently

distributions and the high privacy regime. We propose new privatization
mechanisms based on compressive sensing. Our methods work for approximately
sparse distributions and medium privacy, and have optimal sample and

directly and reliably determine the associated low-energy constant. While the
numerical computations of the correlation function for this process are
underway with lattice QCD, the connection to the physical amplitude, and hence
this short-distance contribution, is missing. A complete framework that enables
this complex matching is developed in this paper. The complications arising
from Euclidean and finite-volume nature of the corresponding correlation
function are fully resolved, and the value of the formalism is demonstrated
through a simple example. The result of this work, therefore, fills the gap

due to their expected fast response dynamics in the terahertz frequency regime.
Reading from and writing information into these materials is not easily
achievable using magnetic fields, due to weak high-order magneto-optical
signals and robustness of the magnetic structure against external magnetic
fields. Polarized electromagnetic radiation is a promising alternative for
probing their response, however, when ideal antiferromagnetic symmetry is
present, this response vanishes. Hence, in this work we combine
first-principles simulations with measurements of the polar magneto-optical
Kerr effect under external magnetic fields, to study magneto-optical response
of antiferromagnetic M$_2$As (M=Cr, Mn, and Fe). We devise a computational
scheme to compute the magnetic susceptibility from total-energy changes using
constraints on magnetic-moment tilting. Our predictions of the spectral
dependence of polar magneto-optical Kerr rotation and ellipticity allow us to
attribute these effects to breaking of the magnetic symmetry. We show that
tilting affects the exchange interaction, while the spin-orbit interaction
remains unaffected as the tilting angle changes. Our work provides
understanding of the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect on a band structure
level and underscores the importance of the magnetic susceptibility when
searching for materials with large magneto-optical response.

in order to confront novel and unknown cases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The
2006 Great Recession and then the 2019 pandemic have a lot to share in terms of
unemployment rate, consumption expenditures, and interest rates set by Federal
Reserve. In addition to quantitative historical data, it is also interesting to
compare the contents of Federal Reserve statements for the period of these two
crises and find out whether Federal Reserve cares about similar concerns or
there are some other issues that demand separate and unique monetary policies.
This paper conducts an analysis to explore the Federal Reserve concerns as
expressed in their statements for the period of 2005 to 2020. The concern
analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and a
trend analysis of concern is also presented. We observe that there are some
similarities between the Federal Reserve statements issued during the Great
Recession with those issued for the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic.

  Occlusion","Accepted by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analyzing complex scenes with Deep Neural Networks is a challenging task,
particularly when images contain multiple objects that partially occlude each
other. Existing approaches to image analysis mostly process objects
independently and do not take into account the relative occlusion of nearby
objects. In this paper, we propose a deep network for multi-object instance
segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box
supervision only. Our work builds on Compositional Networks, which learn a
generative model of neural feature activations to locate occluders and to
classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend their generative
model to include multiple objects and introduce a framework for efficient
inference in challenging occlusion scenarios. In particular, we obtain
feed-forward predictions of the object classes and their instance and occluder
segmentations. We introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that locates
erroneous segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to correct them. The
improved segmentation masks are, in turn, integrated into the network in a
top-down manner to improve the image classification. Our experiments on the
KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our model at multi-object instance segmentation
under occlusion. Code is publically available at

action recognition where the labels are composed out of simpler components such

also provides a structure that can be exploited. To do so, we develop and test
a novel Structured Attention Fusion (SAF) self-attention mechanism to combine
information from object detections, which capture the time-series structure of
an action, with visual cues that capture contextual information. We show that
our approach recognizes novel verb-noun compositions more effectively than
current state of the art systems, and it generalizes to unseen action
categories quite efficiently from only a few labeled examples. We validate our

observations with the Australian Telescope Compact Array over 18 consecutive
days in April 2017. We detect radio emission from Proxima Centauri for most of
the observing sessions, which spanned $\sim$1.6 orbital periods of the planet
Proxima b. The radio emission is stronger at the low-frequency band, centered
around 1.6 GHz, and is consistent with the expected electron-cyclotron
frequency for the known star's magnetic field intensity of about 600 Gauss. The
1.6 GHz light curve shows an emission pattern that is consistent with the
orbital period of the planet Proxima b around the star Proxima, with its maxima
of emission happening near the quadratures. We also observed two short-duration
(a few minutes) flares and a long-duration (about three days) burst whose peaks
happened close to the quadratures. We find that the frequency, large degree of
circular polarization, change of the sign of circular polarization, and
intensity of the observed radio emission are all consistent with expectations
from electron cyclotron-maser emission arising from sub-Alfv\'enic star-planet
interaction. We interpret our radio observations as signatures of interaction
between the planet Proxima b and its host star Proxima. We advocate for
monitoring other dwarf stars with planets to eventually reveal periodic radio
emission due to star-planet interaction, thus opening a new avenue for
exoplanet hunting and the study of a new field of exoplanet-star plasma
interaction.

properties: (i) they are the same, to lowest order in spin, as the metrics of
stellar objects; (ii) they are independent of mass, when expressed in geometric
units; and (iii) they are described by the Kerr metric. In this paper, we
quantify the upper bounds on potential black-hole metric deviations imposed by
observations of black-hole shadows and of binary black-hole inspirals in order
to explore the current experimental limits on possible violations of the last
two predictions. We find that both types of experiments provide correlated
constraints on deviation parameters that are primarily in the tt-components of
the spacetimes, when expressed in areal coordinates. We conclude that,
currently, there is no evidence for a deviations from the Kerr metric across
the 8 orders of magnitudes in masses and 16 orders in curvatures spanned by the
two types of black holes. Moreover, because of the particular masses of black
holes in the current sample of gravitational-wave sources, the correlations
imposed by the two experiments are aligned and of similar magnitudes when
expressed in terms of the far field, post-Newtonian predictions of the metrics.
If a future coalescing black-hole binary with two low-mass (e.g., ~3 Msun)
components is discovered, the degeneracy between the deviation parameters can
be broken by combining the inspiral constraints with those from the black-hole
shadow measurements.

some noise is allowed (natural or due to eavesdropping) has not been proved

automatically generate a story-like description for a sequence of images. The
descriptions generated by previous visual storytelling approaches lack
coherence because they use word-level sequence generation methods and do not
adequately consider sentence-level dependencies. To tackle this problem, we
propose a novel hierarchical visual storytelling framework which separately
models sentence-level and word-level semantics. We use the transformer-based
BERT to obtain embeddings for sentences and words. We then employ a
hierarchical LSTM network: the bottom LSTM receives as input the sentence
vector representation from BERT, to learn the dependencies between the
sentences corresponding to images, and the top LSTM is responsible for
generating the corresponding word vector representations, taking input from the
bottom LSTM. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms most
closely related baselines under automatic evaluation metrics BLEU and CIDEr,

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with dependent choice and the axiom of determinacy
AD. On the other hand, using the full axiom of choice, one can construct
problems which are discontinuous, but not effectively so. Hence, the exact
situation at the bottom of the Weihrauch lattice sensitively depends on the
axiomatic setting that we choose. We prove our result using a variant of Wadge
games for mathematical problems. While the existence of a winning strategy for
player II characterizes continuity of the problem (as already shown by Nobrega

effective discontinuity of the problem. By Weihrauch determinacy we understand
the condition that every problem is either continuous or effectively

broad spectrum of applications, ranging from neuroscience to power-grids, to
mention a few. Such systems synchronize because of the complex set of coupling
they exhibit, the latter being modeled by complex networks. The dynamical
behavior of the system and the topology of the underlying network are strongly
intertwined, raising the question of the optimal architecture that makes
synchronization robust. The Master Stability Function (MSF) has been proposed
and extensively studied as a generic framework to tackle synchronization
problems. Using this method, it has been shown that for a class of models,
synchronization in strongly directed networks is robust to external
perturbations. In this paper, our approach is to transform the non-autonomous
system of coupled oscillators into an autonomous one, showing that previous
results are model-independent. Recent findings indicate that many real-world
networks are strongly directed, being potential candidates for optimal
synchronization. Inspired by the fact that highly directed networks are also
strongly non-normal, in this work, we address the matter of non-normality by
pointing out that standard techniques, such as the MSF, may fail in predicting
the stability of synchronized behavior. These results lead to a trade-off
between non-normality and directedness that should be properly considered when
designing an optimal network, enhancing the robustness of synchronization.

  Industry",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supply chain integration remains an elusive goal for the construction and
engineering industry. The high degree of fragmentation and the reliance on
third-party financial institutions has pushed the physical and financial supply
chains apart. The paper demonstrates how blockchain-based crypto assets (crypto
currencies and crypto tokens) can address this limitation when used for
conditioning the flow of funds based on the flow of products. The paper
contrasts the integration between cash and product flows in supply chains that
rely on fiat currencies and crypto assets for their payment settlement. Two
facets of crypto asset-enabled integration, atomicity and granularity, are
further introduced. The thesis is validated in the context of construction
progress payments. The as-built data captured by unmanned aerial and ground
vehicles was passed to an autonomous smart contract-based method that utilizes
crypto-currencies and crypto tokens for payment settlement; the resulting
payment datasets, written to the Ethereum blockchain, were analyzed in terms of
their integration of product and cash flow. The work is concluded with a
discussion of findings and their implications for the industry.

urban environments is predicting the future behaviour of nearby pedestrians,
especially at points of crossing. Predicting behaviour depends on many social
and environmental factors, particularly interactions between road users.
Capturing such interactions requires a global view of the scene and dynamics of
the road users in three-dimensional space. This information, however, is
missing from the current pedestrian behaviour benchmark datasets. Motivated by
these challenges, we propose 1) a novel graph-based model for predicting
pedestrian crossing action. Our method models pedestrians' interactions with
nearby road users through clustering and relative importance weighting of
interactions using features obtained from the bird's-eye-view. 2) We introduce
a new dataset that provides 3D bounding box and pedestrian behavioural
annotations for the existing nuScenes dataset. On the new data, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving on various metrics by more
than 15% in comparison to existing methods. The dataset is available at

grows. An indicative example is the single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), an
emerging DNA sequencing technology with promising capabilities but significant
computational challenges due to the large-scaled generated data. Regarding the
classification process for scRNA-seq data, an appropriate method is the k
Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier since it is usually utilized for large-scale
prediction tasks due to its simplicity, minimal parameterization, and
model-free nature. However, the ultra-high dimensionality that characterizes
scRNA-seq impose a computational bottleneck, while prediction power can be
affected by the ""Curse of Dimensionality"". In this work, we proposed the
utilization of approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms for the task of
kNN classification in scRNA-seq data focusing on a particular methodology
tailored for high dimensional data. We argue that even relaxed approximate
solutions will not affect the prediction performance significantly. The
experimental results confirm the original assumption by offering the potential
for broader applicability.

$m\rightarrow\infty$. That is, given a degree $n$ polynomial $p(z)$ not
vanishing at the origin and an error tolerance $\epsilon > 0$, Jin proves that
there exists an $m$ such that $\frac{L_m}{\rho_{min}} > 1-\epsilon$, where
$\rho_{min} := \min_{\rho:p(\rho) = 0} \left|\rho\right|$. In this paper we
derive a formula that yields such an $m$, thereby constructively proving Jin's
theorem. In fact, we prove the stronger theorem that this convergence is
uniform in a sense, its rate depending only on $n$ and a few other parameters.
We also give experimental results that suggest an optimal m of (asymptotically)
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^d}\right)$ for some $d \ll 2$. A proof of these

million deaths, high morbidities, and economic distress worldwide. There is an
urgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases
like the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising
strategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due
to several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results
compared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore
computational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated
graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.
Although we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is
generic and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered
heterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases,
genes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem.
Specifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural
network (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered
graph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for
a disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as
Dexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different
pharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out
of these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is
evaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the

inadvertently cause operational issues at the distribution level. We propose a
coordination architecture in which an aggregator and distribution operator
coordinate to avoid distribution network constraint violations, while
preserving private information. The aggregator controls thermostatic loads to
provide frequency regulation, while the distribution operator overrides the
aggregator's control actions when necessary to ensure safe network operation.
Using this architecture, we propose two control strategies, which differ in
terms of measurement and communication requirements, as well as model
complexity and scalability. The first uses an aggregate model and blocking
controller, while the second uses individual load models and a mode-count
controller. Both outperform a benchmark strategy in terms of tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, the second strategy performs better than the first, with only
0.10% average RMS error (compared to 0.70%). The second is also able to
maintain safe operation of the distribution network while overriding less than
1% of the aggregator's control actions (compared to approximately 15% by the
first strategy). However, the second strategy has significantly more
measurement, communication, and computational requirements, and therefore would
be more complex and expensive to implement than the first strategy.

emitter, a transmitter, and an adversary. The transmitter is equipped with a
deep neural network (DNN) classifier for detecting the ongoing transmissions
from the background emitter and transmits a signal if the spectrum is idle.
Concurrently, the adversary trains its own DNN classifier as the surrogate
model by observing the spectrum to detect the ongoing transmissions of the
background emitter and generate adversarial attacks to fool the transmitter
into misclassifying the channel as idle. This surrogate model may differ from
the transmitter's classifier significantly because the adversary and the
transmitter experience different channels from the background emitter and
therefore their classifiers are trained with different distributions of inputs.
This system model may represent a setting where the background emitter is a
primary user, the transmitter is a secondary user, and the adversary is trying
to fool the secondary user to transmit even though the channel is occupied by
the primary user. We consider different topologies to investigate how different
surrogate models that are trained by the adversary (depending on the
differences in channel effects experienced by the adversary) affect the
performance of the adversarial attack. The simulation results show that the
surrogate models that are trained with different distributions of
channel-induced inputs severely limit the attack performance and indicate that
the transferability of adversarial attacks is neither readily available nor
straightforward to achieve since surrogate models for wireless applications may
significantly differ from the target model depending on channel effects.

groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions

pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the pro-vaccine group
is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic

more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. People
who have the worst personal pandemic experience are more likely to hold the
anti-vaccine opinion. Next, by conducting counterfactual analyses, we find that
the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and

bedside caregivers. This practice is subjective, inconsistent, slow, and
discontinuous. To develop a reliable medical interpretation, several automated
approaches have been proposed to enhance the current practice. These approaches
are unimodal and focus mainly on assessing neonatal procedural (acute) pain. As
pain is a multimodal emotion that is often expressed through multiple
modalities, the multimodal assessment of pain is necessary especially in case
of postoperative (acute prolonged) pain. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis
is more stable over time and has been proven to be highly effective at
minimizing misclassification errors. In this paper, we present a novel
multimodal spatio-temporal approach that integrates visual and vocal signals
and uses them for assessing neonatal postoperative pain. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. We compare the performance of the multimodal and unimodal
postoperative pain assessment, and measure the impact of temporal information
integration. The experimental results, on a real-world dataset, show that the
proposed multimodal spatio-temporal approach achieves the highest AUC (0.87)
and accuracy (79%), which are on average 6.67% and 6.33% higher than unimodal
approaches. The results also show that the integration of temporal information
markedly improves the performance as compared to the non-temporal approach as
it captures changes in the pain dynamic. These results demonstrate that the
proposed approach can be used as a viable alternative to manual assessment,
which would tread a path toward fully automated pain monitoring in clinical

This works well with room temperature materials and humans and robots at human

To thoroughly investigate this perceptual ambiguity, we designed a
psychophysical experiment in which a participant discriminates between two
materials given ambiguous initial conditions. We conducted a study with 32
human participants and a robot. Humans and the robot confused the materials. We
also found that robots can overcome this ambiguity using two temperature
sensors with different temperatures prior to contact. We support this
conclusion based on a mathematical proof using a heat transfer model and
empirical results in which a robot achieved 100% accuracy compared to 5% human
accuracy. Our results also indicate that robots can use subtle cues to
distinguish thermally ambiguous materials with a single temperature sensor.
Overall, our work provides insights into challenging conditions for material

overcome these challenges to outperform humans.

agent behavior, their value is limited when deriving decision-making policies
which satisfy certain types of asymptotic behavior in general system models. In
particular, we are interested in specifying constraints on the steady-state
behavior of an agent, which captures the proportion of time an agent spends in
each state as it interacts for an indefinite period of time with its
environment. This is sometimes called the average or expected behavior of the
agent and the associated planning problem is faced with significant challenges
unless strong restrictions are imposed on the underlying model in terms of the
connectivity of its graph structure. In this paper, we explore this
steady-state planning problem that consists of deriving a decision-making
policy for an agent such that constraints on its steady-state behavior are
satisfied. A linear programming solution for the general case of multichain
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is proposed and we prove that optimal
solutions to the proposed programs yield stationary policies with rigorous

when successful, a reconstruction of the elementary rule ($t=1$) from $t>1$

describe an alternative network-like method, based on constraint projections,
where this is possible. From a single data item this method perfectly
reconstructs not just the automaton rule but also the states in the time steps

only be large enough that it and the $t-1$ states it evolves into contain all
possible automaton input patterns. We demonstrate the method on 1D binary
cellular automata that take inputs from $n$ adjacent cells. The unknown rules
in our experiments are not restricted to simple rules derived from a few linear
functions on the inputs (as in Game of Life), but include all $2^{2^n}$

algorithms for accelerating or improving training deep neural networks (DNNs).
In deep learning practice, the momentum is usually weighted by a
well-calibrated constant. However, tuning hyperparameters for momentum can be a
significant computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel
\emph{adaptive momentum} for improving DNNs training; this adaptive momentum,
with no momentum related hyperparameter required, is motivated by the nonlinear
conjugate gradient (NCG) method. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with this
new adaptive momentum eliminates the need for the momentum hyperparameter
calibration, allows a significantly larger learning rate, accelerates DNN
training, and improves final accuracy and robustness of the trained DNNs. For
instance, SGD with this adaptive momentum reduces classification errors for
training ResNet110 for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 from $5.25\%$ to $4.64\%$ and
$23.75\%$ to $20.03\%$, respectively. Furthermore, SGD with the new adaptive

simultaneously and thus provide vital evidence needed to conserve their
populations and biodiversity at large. Using a novel Bayesian hierarchical
binomial-lognormal hurdle modelling approach within the INLA-SPDE framework, we
combined and analysed acoustic and bottom trawl survey data for herring, sprat
and northeast Atlantic mackerel in the North Sea. These models were implemented
using INLA-SPDE techniques. By accounting for gear-specific efficiencies across
surveys in addition to increased spatial coverage, we gained larger statistical
power with greatly minimised uncertainties in estimation. Our statistical

problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when
applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be
particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of
interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the
effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments
expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the

an imprint on large-scale structure that can be measured to constrain their

$M_\nu$ constraints are severely limited by parameter degeneracies. Hahn et
al.(2020) demonstrated that the bispectrum, the next higher-order statistic,
can break these degeneracies and dramatically improve constraints on $M_\nu$
and other cosmological parameters. In this paper, we present the constraining
power of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum, $B_0^g$. We construct the Molino
suite of 75,000 mock galaxy catalogs from the Quijote $N$-body simulations
using the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, which provides a galaxy
bias framework well-suited for simulation-based approaches. Using these mocks,
we present Fisher matrix forecasts for $\{\Omega_m,\Omega_b,h,n_s,\sigma_8,
M_\nu\}$ and quantify, for the first time, the total information content of
$B_0^g$ down to nonlinear scales. For $k_{\rm max}=0.5h/Mpc$, $B_0^g$ improves
constraints on $\Omega_m,\Omega_b,h,n_s,\sigma_8$, and $M_\nu$ by 2.8, 3.1,
3.8, 4.2, 4.2, and $4.6\times$ over the power spectrum, after marginalizing
over HOD parameters. Even with priors from $Planck$, $B_0^g$ improves all of
the cosmological constraints by $\gtrsim2\times$. In fact, for $P_\ell^g$ and
$B_0^g$ out to $k_{\rm max}=0.5h/Mpc$ with $Planck$ priors, we achieve a
$1\sigma$ $M_\nu$ constraint of 0.048 eV, which is tighter than the current
best cosmological constraint. While effects such as survey geometry and
assembly bias will have an impact, these constraints are derived for
$(1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$, a substantially smaller volume than upcoming surveys.
Therefore, we conclude that the galaxy bispectrum will significantly improve
cosmological constraints for upcoming galaxy surveys -- especially for $M_\nu$.

orientation, which in turn influences the galaxies therein. However, the
process by which dark matter haloes acquire angular momentum is not fully
understood; in particular, it is unclear whether angular momentum growth is
stochastic. To address this question, we extend the genetic modification
technique to allow control over the angular momentum of any region in the
initial conditions. Using this technique to produce a sequence of modified
simulations, we can then investigate whether changes to the angular momentum of
a specified region in the evolved universe can be accurately predicted from
changes in the initial conditions alone. We find that the angular momentum in
regions with modified initial conditions can be predicted between 2 and 4 times
more accurately than expected from applying tidal torque theory. This result is
masked when analysing the angular momentum of haloes, because particles in the
outskirts of haloes dominate the angular momentum budget. We conclude that the
angular momentum of Lagrangian patches is highly predictable from the initial
conditions, with apparent chaotic behaviour being driven by stochastic changes
to the arbitrary boundary defining the halo.

molecular clouds trigger filament formation. Since several different mechanisms
have been proposed for filament formation, the formation mechanism of the
observed star-forming filaments requires clarification. In the present study,
we perform a series of isothermal magnetohydrodynamics simulations of filament
formation. We focus on the influences of shock velocity and turbulence on the
formation mechanism and identified three different mechanisms for the filament
formation. The results indicate that when the shock is fast, at shock velocity
v_sh = 7 km/s, the gas flows driven by the curved shock wave create filaments
irrespective of the presence of turbulence and self-gravity. However, at a slow
shock velocity v_sh = 2.5 km/s, the compressive flow component involved in the
initial turbulence induces filament formation. When both the shock velocities
and turbulence are low, the self-gravity in the shock-compressed sheet becomes
important for filament formation. Moreover, we analyzed the line-mass
distribution of the filaments and showed that strong shock waves can naturally
create high-line-mass filaments such as those observed in the massive
star-forming regions in a short time. We conclude that the dominant filament
formation mode changes with the velocity of the shock wave triggering the
filament formation.

Taichi can accurately model collisional effects, such as dynamical friction and

binary black holes through the late inspiral, merger and ringdown remains a
challenging problem. The lack of analytic solutions for the precession dynamics
of generic double-spin systems, and the high dimensionality of the problem,
obfuscate the incorporation of strong-field spin-precession information into
semi-analytic waveform models used in gravitational-wave data analysis.
Previously, an effective precession spin, $\chi_p$, was introduced to reduce
the number of spin degrees of freedom. Here, we show that $\chi_p$ alone does
not accurately reproduce higher-order multipolar modes, in particular the ones
that carry strong imprints due to precession such as the $(2,1)$-mode. To
improve the higher-mode content, and in particular to facilitate an accurate
incorporation of precession effects in the strong-field regime into waveform
models, we introduce a new dimensional reduction through an effective
precession spin vector, $\vec{\chi}_\perp$, which takes into account precessing
spin information from both black holes. We show that this adapted effective
precession spin (i) mimics the precession dynamics of the fully precessing
configuration remarkably well, (ii) captures the signature features of
precession in higher-order modes, and (iii) reproduces the final state of the
remnant black hole with high accuracy for the overwhelming majority of
configurations. We demonstrate the efficacy of this two-dimensional precession
spin in the strong-field regime, paving the path for meaningful calibration of
the precessing sector of semi-analytic waveform models with a faithful
representation of higher-order modes through merger and the remnant black hole
spin.

  $\mathbf{AC}^0$","Full version of ITCS 2021 paper, 42 pages",,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  H\r{a}stad showed that any De Morgan formula (composed of AND, OR and NOT
gates) shrinks by a factor of $O(p^{2})$ under a random restriction that leaves
each variable alive independently with probability $p$ [SICOMP, 1998]. Using
this result, he gave an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound
for the Andreev function, which, up to lower order improvements, remains the
state-of-the-art lower bound for any explicit function. In this work, we extend
the shrinkage result of H\r{a}stad to hold under a far wider family of random
restrictions and their generalization -- random projections. Based on our
shrinkage results, we obtain an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower
bound for an explicit function computed in $\mathbf{AC}^0$. This improves upon
the best known formula size lower bounds for $\mathbf{AC}^0$, that were only
quadratic prior to our work. In addition, we prove that the KRW conjecture
[Karchmer et al., Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995] holds for inner
functions for which the unweighted quantum adversary bound is tight. In
particular, this holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound. Our
random projections are tailor-made to the function's structure so that the
function maintains structure even under projection -- using such projections is
necessary, as standard random restrictions simplify $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits.
In contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor
under our random projections, allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound. Our
proof techniques build on the proof of H\r{a}stad for the simpler case of
balanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost of
slightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of $p$-random
restrictions, our proof can be used as an exposition of H\r{a}stad's result.

(2019) established the precise dependencies on $\varepsilon>0$ and $d\in

\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ is the \emph{spread} of the point set, defined as the ratio
between the maximum and minimum distance between a pair of points. They also
constructed spanners of lightness $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ in

  In this work, we show that for every finite set of points in the plane and

inversion induced by pressure in the non-magnetic analogs AECd2As2 (AE = Ca,
Sr, Ba) as studied with density functional theory calculations. Under ambient
pressure we find these compounds are narrow band gap semiconductors, in
agreement with experiment. The size of the band gap is dictated by both the
increasing ionicity across the AE series which tends to increase the band gap,
as well as the larger nearest neighbor Cd-As distance from increasing atomic
size which can decrease the band gap because the conduction band edge is an
anti-bonding state derived mostly from Cd 5s orbitals. The combination of these
two competing effects results in a non-monotonic change of the band gap size
across the AE series with SrCd2As2 having the smallest band gap among the three
compounds. The application of negative pressure reduces this band gap and
causes the band inversion between the Cd 5s and As 4p orbitals along the

of the Dirac points is then confirmed by finding the closed Fermi arcs on the

we elucidate the properties of the anyonic logarithmic negativity by computing
it for a toy density matrix of a pair of anyons within various categories. We

  We show that the classic Double Coverage algorithm has competitive ratio
$2^k-1$ on HSTs, matching a recent lower bound for deterministic algorithms.
For bounded depth HSTs, the competitive ratio turns out to be much better and
we obtain tight bounds. When the depth is $d\ll k$, these bounds are
approximately $k^d/d!$. By standard embedding results, we obtain a randomized
algorithm for arbitrary $n$-point metrics with (polynomial) competitive ratio
$O(k^c\Delta^{1/c}\log_{\Delta} n)$, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio and
$c\ge 1$ is an arbitrary positive integer constant. The only previous known
bound was $O(2^k\log n)$. For general (weighted) tree metrics, we prove the
competitive ratio of Double Coverage to be $\Theta(k^d)$ for any fixed depth
$d$, but unlike on HSTs it is not bounded by $2^k-1$.
  We obtain our results by a dual fitting analysis where the dual solution is
constructed step-by-step backwards in time. Unlike the forward-time approach
typical of online primal-dual analyses, this allows us to combine information
from the past and the future when assigning dual variables. We believe this
method can be useful also for other problems. Using this technique, we also

is on the behaviour of the solutions near spacelike infinity, which is
appropriately represented as a cylinder. Earlier studies of the wave equation
on a Schwarzschild background have revealed important details about the
regularity of the corresponding solutions. It was found that, on the cylinder,
the solutions generically develop logarithmic singularities at infinitely many
orders. Moreover, these singularities also `spread' to future null infinity.
However, by imposing certain regularity conditions on the initial data, the
lowest-order singularities can be removed. Here we are interested in a
generalisation of these results to a rotating black hole background and study
the influence of the rotation rate on the properties of the solutions. To this
aim, we first construct a conformal compactification of the Kerr solution which
yields a suitable representation of the cylinder at spatial infinity. Besides
analytical investigations on the cylinder, we numerically solve the wave
equation with a fully pseudospectral method, which allows us to obtain highly
accurate numerical solutions. This is crucial for a detailed analysis of the
regularity of the solutions. In the Schwarzschild case, the numerical problem
could effectively be reduced to solving $(1+1)$-dimensional equations. Here we
present a code that can perform the full $2+1$ evolution as required for
axisymmetric waves on a Kerr background.

burst-suppression EEG is a manifestation of two alternating brain states
associated with consumption (during a burst) and production (during a

infer latent states characterizing alternating brain states and underlying ATP
kinetics from instantaneous power of multichannel EEG using a switching

lower altitudes in Titan's atmosphere. Herein, we use a radiative transfer

40.49^{\circ} \pm 0.56^{\circ}$ for the most luminous one percent ($M_r \sim
-23.57$). Galaxies from the blue sequence show no statistically significant
tendency for their axes to align with larger-scale structure, regardless of
galaxy luminosity. Galaxies in higher-density regions do not show a
statistically significant difference in mean alignment angle from galaxies in
lower-density regions; this holds true for the faint blue, luminous blue, faint

edge-cloud system). WedgeChain consists of a logging layer and a data indexing
layer. In this study, we encounter two challenges: (1) edge nodes are untrusted
and potentially malicious, and (2) edge-cloud coordination is expensive.
WedgeChain tackles these challenges by the following proposals: (1) Lazy
(asynchronous) certification: where data is committed at the untrusted edge and
then lazily certified at the cloud node. This lazy certification method takes
advantage of the observation that an untrusted edge node is unlikely to act
maliciously if it knows it will be detected (and punished) eventually. Our lazy
certification method guarantees that malicious acts (i.e., lying) are
eventually detected. (2) Data-free certification: our lazy certification method
only needs to send digests of data to the cloud, instead of sending all data to
the cloud, which enables saving network and cloud resources and reduce costs.
(3) LSMerkle: we extend a trusted index (mLSM) to enable indexing data at the
edge while utilizing lazy and data-free certification.

While deep neural networks perform semantic segmentation well, their success
rely on pixel level supervision which is expensive and time-consuming. Further,
training using data from one domain may not generalize well to data from a new
domain due to a domain gap between data distributions in the different domains.
This domain gap is particularly evident in aerial images where visual
appearance depends on the type of environment imaged, season, weather, and time
of day when the environment is imaged. Subsequently, this distribution gap
leads to severe accuracy loss when using a pretrained segmentation model to
analyze new data with different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a
novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework to address domain shift in the
context of aerial semantic image segmentation. To this end, we solve the
problem of domain shift by learn the soft label distribution difference between
the source and target domains. Further, we also apply entropy minimization on
the target domain to produce high-confident prediction rather than using
high-confident prediction by pseudo-labeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our domain adaptation framework using the challenge image segmentation

because it increases the charge carrier concentration for a given Fermi level,
which typically enhances charge conductivity while preserving the Seebeck
coefficient. However, this advantage hinges on the assumption that interband
scattering of carriers is weak or insignificant. With first-principles
treatment of electron-phonon scattering in
CaMg$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$-CaZn$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$ Zintl system and full Heusler
Sr$_{2}$SbAu, we demonstrate that the benefit of band convergence can be
intrinsically negated by interband scattering depending on the manner in which
bands converge. In the Zintl alloy, band convergence does not improve weighted
mobility or the density-of-states effective mass. We trace the underlying
reason to the fact that the bands converge at one k-point, which induces strong
interband scattering of both the deformation-potential and the polar-optical
kinds. The case contrasts with band convergence at distant k-points (as in the
full Heusler), which better preserves the single-band scattering behavior
thereby successfully leading to improved performance. Therefore, we suggest
that band convergence as thermoelectric design principle is best suited to
cases in which it occurs at distant k-points.

separating planets that have lost their primordial atmospheres (super-Earths),
and the ones that retain them (mini-Neptunes). Here, we report evidences for
another distinct population at smaller sizes. By focussing on planets orbiting
around GK-dwarfs inward of 16 days, and correcting for observational
completeness, we find that the number of super-Earths peak around 1.4 Earth
radii and disappear shortly below this size. Instead, a new population of
planets (sub-Earths) appear to dominate at sizes below ~ 1 Earth radius, with
an occurrence that rises with decreasing size. This pattern is also observed in
ultra-short-period planets.
  The end of super-Earths supports earlier claims that super-Earths and
mini-Neptunes, planets that likely form in gaseous proto-planetary disks, have
a narrow mass distribution. The sub-Earths, in contrast, can be described by a
power-law mass distribution and may be explained by the theory of terrestrial
planet formation. We therefore speculate that they are formed well after the
gaseous disks have dissipated. The extension of these sub-Earths towards longer
orbital periods, currently invisible, may be the true terrestrial analogues.
This strongly motivates new searches.

final fate of massive stars, which are in contrast to commonly used parametric
prescriptions. In this work, we explore the implications of these results to
the formation of coalescing black-hole (BH) - neutron-star (NS) binaries, such
as the candidate event GW190426_152155 reported in GWTC-2. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of natal kicks and the NS's radius on the synthesis of
such systems and potential electromagnetic counterparts linked to them.
Synthetic models based on detailed core-collapse simulations result in an
increased merger detection rate of BH-NS systems ($\sim 2.3$ yr$^{-1}$), 5 to
10 times larger than the predictions of ""standard"" parametric prescriptions.
This is primarily due to the formation of low-mass BH via direct collapse, and
hence no natal kicks, favored by the detailed simulations. The fraction of
observed systems that will produce an electromagnetic counterpart, with the
detailed supernova engine, ranges from $2$-$25$%, depending on uncertainties in
the NS equation of state. Notably, in most merging systems with electromagnetic
counterparts, the NS is the first-born compact object, as long as the NS's
radius is $\lesssim 12\,\mathrm{km}$. Furthermore, core-collapse models that
predict the formation of low-mass BHs with negligible natal kicks increase the
detection rate of GW190426_152155-like events to $\sim 0.6 \, $yr$^{-1}$; with
an associated probability of electromagnetic counterpart $\leq 10$% for all
supernova engines. However, increasing the production of direct-collapse
low-mass BHs also increases the synthesis of binary BHs, over-predicting their
measured local merger density rate. In all cases, models based on detailed
core-collapse simulation predict a ratio of BH-NSs to binary BHs merger rate
density that is at least twice as high as other prescriptions.

observation that the trigger behavior depends on a few ghost neurons that
activate on trigger pattern and exhibit abnormally higher relative attribution
for wrong decisions when activated. Further, these trigger neurons are also
active on normal inputs of the target class. Thus, we use counterfactual
attributions to localize these ghost neurons from clean inputs and then
incrementally excite them to observe changes in the model's accuracy. We use
this information for Trojan detection by using a deep set encoder that enables
invariance to the number of model classes, architecture, etc. Our approach is
implemented in the TrinityAI tool that exploits the synergies between
trustworthiness, resilience, and interpretability challenges in deep learning.
We evaluate our approach on benchmarks with high diversity in model
architectures, triggers, etc. We show consistent gains (+10%) over

adversarial attacks, which in turn requires strong assumptions on the nature of
the Trojan attack.

her consumption habit. Increasing $\alpha$, increases the degree of
addictiveness of habit formation, with $\alpha=0$ (respectively, $\alpha=1$)
corresponding to non-addictive (respectively, completely addictive) model. We
derive the optimal consumption policies explicitly in terms of the solution of
a nonlinear free-boundary problem, which we analyze in detail. Impatient
individuals (or, equivalently, those with more addictive habits) always consume
above the minimum rate; thus, they eventually attain the minimum
wealth-to-habit ratio. Patient individuals (or, equivalently, those with less
addictive habits) consume at the minimum rate if their wealth-to-habit ratio is
below a threshold, and above it otherwise. By consuming patiently, these
individuals maintain a wealth-to-habit ratio that is greater than the minimum
acceptable level. Additionally, we prove that the optimal consumption path is
hump-shaped if the initial wealth-to-habit ratio is either: (1) larger than a
high threshold; or (2) below a low threshold and the agent is more risk seeking
(that is, less risk averse). Thus, we provide a simple explanation for the

binary system AR Scorpii using archival data taken in 2016-2020. It has been
known that the X-ray emission is dominated by the optically thin thermal plasma
emission, and its flux level varies significantly over the orbital phase. The
X-ray emission also contains a component that modulates with the beat frequency
between the white dwarf's spin frequency and orbital frequency. In this new
analysis, the 2020 data taken by NICER shows that the X-ray emission is
modulating with the spin frequency as well as the beat frequency, indicating
that part of the X-ray emission is coming from the white dwarf's magnetosphere.
It is found that the signal of the spin frequency appears only at a specific
orbital phase, while the beat signal appears over the orbital phase. We
interpret the X-ray emission modulating with the spin frequency and the beat
frequency as a result of the synchrotron emission from electrons with a smaller
and larger pitch angle, respectively. In a long-term evolution, the beat pulse
profile averaged over the orbital phase changed from a single-peak structure in
2016/2018 to a double-peak structure in 2020. The observed X-ray flux levels
measured in 2016/2017 are higher than those measured in 2018/2020. The plasma
temperature and amplitude of the orbital waveform might vary with time too.
These results indicate that the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii evolves on a
timescale of years. This long-term evolution would be explained by a
super-orbital modulation related to, for example, a precession of the white
dwarf, or a fluctuation of the system related to activity of the companion

  calibration to estimate their metallicity","Accepted by ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/abd183",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We performed the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic survey of field
RR Lyraes (RRLs). We secured $\approx$6,300 high resolution (HR, R$\sim$35,000)
spectra for 143 RRLs (111 fundamental, RRab; 32 first overtone, RRc). The
atmospheric parameters were estimated by using the traditional approach and the
iron abundances were measured by using an LTE line analysis. The resulting iron
distribution shows a well defined metal-rich tail approaching solar iron
abundance. This suggests that field RRLs experienced a complex chemical
enrichment in the early halo formation. We used these data to develop a new
calibration of the $\Delta$S method. This diagnostic, based on the equivalent
widths of CaII K and three Balmer (H$_{\delta,\gamma,\beta}$) lines, traces the
metallicity of RRLs. For the first time the new empirical calibration: i)
includes spectra collected over the entire pulsation cycle; ii) includes RRc
variables; iii) relies on spectroscopic calibrators covering more than three
dex in iron abundance; iv) provides independent calibrations based on
one/two/three Balmer lines. The new calibrations were applied to both
SEGUE-SDSS and degraded HR spectra totalling 6,451 low resolution (LR,
R$\sim$2,000) spectra for 5,001 RRLs (3,439 RRab, 1,562 RRc). This resulted in
an iron distribution with a median of -1.55$\pm$0.01 and $\sigma$=0.51 dex, in
good agreement with literature values. We also found that RRc are 0.10 dex more
metal-poor than RRab variables, and have a distribution with a smoother
metal-poor tail. This finding supports theoretical prescriptions suggesting a
steady decrease in the RRc number when moving from metal-poor to metal-rich
stellar environments.

stellar population properties of these galaxies, we use kernel density
estimates to build multivariate input parameter distributions to obtain
realistic simulations. We create simulated sets of spectra of varying degrees
of complexity (identified by the number of parameters), and derive SED fitting
results and evidences for pairs of nested models, including the correct model
as well as more simplistic ones, using the BAGPIPES codebase with nested
sampling algorithm MultiNest. We then ask the question: is it true - as
expected in Bayesian model comparison frameworks - that the correct model has
larger evidence?}
  Our results indicate that the ratio of evidences (the Bayes factor) is able
to identify the correct underlying model in the vast majority of cases. The
quality of the results improves primarily as a function of the total S/N in the
SED. We also compare the Bayes factors obtained using the evidence to those
obtained via the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio (SDDR), an analytic approximation
which can be calculated using samples from regular Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods. We show that the SDDR ratio can satisfactorily replace a full evidence
calculation provided that the sampling density is sufficient.

chemically primitive stars. Simulations suggest that these systems formed
within extended dark matter halos and experienced early galaxy mergers and
supernova feedback. However, the signatures of these events would lie outside
their core regions (>2 half-light radii), which are spectroscopically unstudied
due to the sparseness of their distant stars. Here we identify members of the
Tucana II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy in its outer region (up to 9 half-light

chemically primitive than previously found. These distant stars are extremely
metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-3.02; less than ~1/1000th of the solar iron abundance),
affirming Tucana II as the most metal-poor known galaxy. We observationally
establish, for the first time, an extended dark matter halo surrounding an
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy out to one kiloparsec, with a total mass of >$10^7$

II suggests that it may have undergone strong bursty feedback or been the
product of an early galactic merger. We demonstrate that spatially extended

performance with a simple design (e.g., dramatically improving previous best
reported mask AP of 21.1% in Hsu et al. (2019) to 31.6% on the COCO dataset).
Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance
segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new
loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask
annotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate
term that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth
box and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that
proximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category
label. Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield
surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For
example, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3x
training schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1%
of the fully supervised counterpart). Our excellent experiment results on COCO

gap between weakly and fully supervised instance segmentation.

unity quantum cluster algebras and prove that they are polynomial identity
algebras. Inside each such algebra we construct a (large) canonical central
subalgebra, which can be viewed as a far reaching generalization of the central
subalgebras of big quantum groups constructed by De Concini, Kac and Procesi

isomorphic to the underlying classical cluster algebra of geometric type. When
the root of unity quantum cluster algebra is free over its central subalgebra,
we prove that the discriminant of the pair is a product of powers of the frozen
variables times an integer. An extension of this result is also proved for the
discriminants of all subalgebras generated by the cluster variables of nerves
in the exchange graph. These results can be used for the effective computation
of discriminants. As an application we prove an explicit formula for the

a key role in the production of nonthermal particles associated with explosive
phenomena in space physics and astrophysics. Experiments at high-energy-density
facilities are starting to probe the microphysics of reconnection at high
Lundquist numbers and large system sizes. We have performed particle-in-cell

laser-driven reconnection experiments. We study particle acceleration in large
system sizes that may be produced soon with the most energetic laser drivers
available, such as at the National Ignition Facility. In these conditions, we
show the possibility of reaching the multi-plasmoid regime, where plasmoid
acceleration becomes dominant. Our results show the transition from \textit{X}
point to plasmoid-dominated acceleration associated with the merging and
contraction of plasmoids that further extend the maximum energy of the
power-law tail of the particle distribution for electrons. We also find for the
first time a system-size-dependent emergence of nonthermal ion acceleration in
driven reconnection, where the magnetization of ions at sufficiently large
sizes allows them to be contained by the magnetic field and energized by direct
\textit{X} point acceleration. For feasible experimental conditions, electrons
and ions can attain energies of $\epsilon_{max,e} / k_{B} T_{e} > 100$ and
$\epsilon_{max,i} / k_{B} T_{i} > 1000$. Using PIC simulations with binary
Monte Carlo Coulomb collisions we study the impact of collisionality on
plasmoid formation and particle acceleration. The implications of these results
for understanding the role reconnection plays in accelerating particles in

  Method: 18 participants in various stages of clinical training across two

and accuracy were compared among different registration methods (hand gesture,

  Results: Mean aggregate manual registration times were 27.7, 24.3, and 72.8

respectively; mean automatic registration time was 5.3s (ANOVA p<0.0001). No

  Conclusions: Manual registration times decreased significantly with updated

tens of lunar- to Mars-size protoplanets at time t<200 Myr after the
protoplanetary gas disk dispersal (t_0). The solar system giant planets rapidly
formed during the protoplanetary disk stage and, after t_0, radially migrated
by interacting with outer disk planetesimals. An early (t<100 Myr) dynamical
instability is thought to have occurred with Jupiter having gravitational
encounters with a planetary-size body, jumping inward by ~0.2-0.5 au, and
landing on its current, mildly eccentric orbit. Here we investigate how the
giant planet instability affected formation of the terrestrial planets. We
study several instability cases that were previously shown to match many solar
system constraints. We find that resonances with the giant planets help to
remove solids available for accretion near ~1.5 au, thus stalling the growth of
Mars. It does not matter, however, whether the giant planets are placed on
their current orbits at t_0 or whether they realistically evolve in one of our
instability models; the results are practically the same. The tight orbital
spacing of Venus and Earth is difficult to reproduce in our simulations,
including cases where bodies grow from a narrow annulus at 0.7-1 au, because
protoplanets tend to radially spread during accretion. The best results are
obtained in the narrow-annulus model when protoplanets emerging from the
dispersing gas nebula are assumed to have (at least) the Mars mass. This
suggests efficient accretion of the terrestrial protoplanets during the first
~10 Myr of the solar system.

galaxy evolution, saturating within $\sim0.01~$Gyr and thus potentially acting
as seeds for large-scale dynamos. However, unambiguous observational
confirmation of the fluctuation dynamo action in a galactic environment is
still missing. This is because, in spiral galaxies, it is difficult to
differentiate between small-scale magnetic fields generated by a fluctuation
dynamo and those due to the tangling of the large-scale field. We propose that
observations of magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies would directly probe the
fluctuation dynamo action. This is motivated by the fact that in ellipticals,
due to their lack of significant rotation, the conventional large-scale dynamo
is absent and the fluctuation dynamo is responsible for controlling the
magnetic field strength and structure. By considering turbulence injected by
Type Ia supernova explosions and possible magnetic field amplification by
cooling flows, we estimate expected magnetic field strengths of $0.2~-~1
\,\mu{\rm G}$ in quiescent elliptical galaxies. We use a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation to estimate the distribution and redshift evolution of field
strengths, tentatively finding a decrease in magnetic field strength with
decreasing redshift. We analyse a sample of radio sources that exhibit the
Laing-Garrington (LG) effect (radio polarization asymmetry in jets) and infer
magnetic field strengths between $0.14~-~1.33 \,\mu{\rm G}$ for a uniform
thermal electron density and between $1.36~-~6.21\,\mu{\rm G}$ for the thermal
electron density following the King profile. We examine observational
techniques for measuring the magnetic field saturation state in elliptical
galaxies, focusing on Faraday RM grids, the LG effect, synchrotron emission,
and gravitational lensing, finding appealing prospects for future empirical
analysis.

fidelity resistant to variations in a specific direction. When employing more

part of the main belt, just at the outer edge of the 3J:1A mean-motion
resonance. We obtained the list of the family members with 317 asteroids and
estimated that it was formed by the catastrophic disruption of a parent body
that was between 34 and 41 km in diameter. Based on the V-shape method, age of
the Karma family is estimated to be about 137 Myr. A detailed dynamical map of
the region combined with numerical simulations allowed us to reconstruct the
long-term dynamical evolution of the family, and to identify the mechanisms
responsible for this evolution. The numerical simulations successfully
reproduced the main features in the orbital distribution of the family members
but also showed that some regions of the Karma family could be missing. A more
detailed analysis revealed that these regions likely consist of very dark
objects, fainter than absolute magnitude H = 17, that have not yet been
detected. Based on the obtained results, we concluded that magnitude-frequency
distribution of family members up to H = 16 mag is neither affected by
dynamical erosion nor observational incompleteness and therefore represents the
result of collisional grinding of the original family population. Finally, we
found that the Karma family have been supplying some asteroids to the
near-Earth region via the 3J:1A resonance. Currently, there should about 10
family members larger than 1 km in diameter, orbiting in the near-Earth space.

observed system processes form the vertex set and directed edges are used to
represent non-zero transfer functions. Recovering the exact underlying graph
structure of such a networked dynamic system, given only observational data, is
a challenging task. Under relatively mild well-posedness assumptions on the
network dynamics, there are state-of-the-art methods which can guarantee the
absence of false positives. However, in this article we prove that under the
same well-posedness assumptions, there are instances of networks for which any
method is susceptible to inferring false negative edges or false positive
edges. Borrowing a terminology from the theory of graphical models, we say
those systems are unfaithful to their networks. We formalize a variant of
faithfulness for dynamic systems, called Granger-faithfulness, and for a large
class of dynamic networks, we show that Granger-unfaithful systems constitute a
Lebesgue zero-measure set. For the same class of networks, under the
Granger-faithfulness assumption, we provide an algorithm that reconstructs the
network topology with guarantees for no false positive and no false negative
edges in its output. We augment the topology reconstruction algorithm with
orientation rules for some of the inferred edges, and we prove the rules are
consistent under the Granger-faithfulness assumption.

power, but today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices face
significant engineering challenges in scalability. The set of quantum circuits
that can be reliably run on NISQ devices is limited by their noisy operations
and low qubit counts.
  This paper introduces CutQC, a scalable hybrid computing approach that
combines classical computers and quantum computers to enable evaluation of
quantum circuits that cannot be run on classical or quantum computers alone.
CutQC cuts large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits, allowing them to be
executed on smaller quantum devices. Classical postprocessing can then
reconstruct the output of the original circuit. This approach offers
significant runtime speedup compared with the only viable current
alternative--purely classical simulations--and demonstrates evaluation of
quantum circuits that are larger than the limit of QC or classical simulation.
Furthermore, in real-system runs, CutQC achieves much higher quantum circuit
evaluation fidelity using small prototype quantum computers than the
state-of-the-art large NISQ devices achieve. Overall, this hybrid approach
allows users to leverage classical and quantum computing resources to evaluate
quantum programs far beyond the reach of either one alone.

applications across several areas in mathematics and computer science. For a
Boolean function $f$ that takes values in {-1,1} let $r(f)$ denote its Fourier
rank. For each positive threshold $t$, Chang's lemma provides a lower bound on
$wt(f):=\Pr[f(x)=-1]$ in terms of the dimension of the span of its characters
with Fourier coefficients of magnitude at least $1/t$. We examine the tightness
of Chang's lemma w.r.t. the following three natural settings of the threshold:
  - the Fourier sparsity of $f$, denoted $k(f)$,
  - the Fourier max-supp-entropy of $f$, denoted $k'(f)$, defined to be $\max
\{1/|\hat{f}(S)| : \hat{f}(S) \neq 0\}$,
  - the Fourier max-rank-entropy of $f$, denoted $k''(f)$, defined to be the
minimum $t$ such that characters whose Fourier coefficients are at least $1/t$
in absolute value span a space of dimension $r(f)$.
  We prove new lower bounds on $wt(f)$ in terms of these measures. One of our
lower bounds subsumes and refines the previously best known upper bound on
$r(f)$ in terms of $k(f)$ by Sanyal (ToC, 2019). Another lower bound is based
on our improvement of a bound by Chattopadhyay, Hatami, Lovett and Tal (ITCS,
2019) on the sum of the absolute values of the level-$1$ Fourier coefficients.
We also show that Chang's lemma for the these choices of the threshold is
asymptotically outperformed by our bounds for most settings of the parameters
involved.
  Next, we show that our bounds are tight for a wide range of the parameters
involved, by constructing functions (which are modifications of the Addressing
function) witnessing their tightness. Finally we construct Boolean functions
$f$ for which
  - our lower bounds asymptotically match $wt(f)$, and
  - for any choice of the threshold $t$, the lower bound obtained from Chang's
lemma is asymptotically smaller than $wt(f)$.

control the concepts that an image caption should focus on, using an additional

encoder that uses the guiding text together with global and object-level image
features to derive early-fusion representations used to generate the guided

of fitting well when guided with automatic object labels, we find that guided

out-of-domain images and guiding texts. Our human-evaluation results indicate

multiple stationary targets in an unknown, bounded environment. The quadrotors
search for targets along a spatial grid overlaid on the environment while
performing a random walk on this grid modeled by a discrete-time discrete-state
(DTDS) Markov chain. The quadrotors can transmit their estimates of the target
locations to other quadrotors that occupy their current location on the grid;
thus, their communication network is time-varying and not necessarily

uncertainties in the quadrotors' measurements of the targets, we formulate the

polarizations modes and four oscillation in the Palatini-GBD theory.
Concretely, they are the two transverse tensor ($+$) and ($\times$) standard

arbitrary closed curve on the boundary of a 3-manifold is in NP. We emphasize
that the manifold and the curve are both inputs to the problem. Moreover, our
algorithm also works if the curve is given as a compressed word. Previously,
such an algorithm was known for simple (non-compressed) curves, and, in very
limited cases, for curves with self-intersections. Furthermore, our algorithm
is fixed-parameter tractable in the complexity of the input 3-manifold.
  As part of our proof, we obtain new polynomial-time algorithms for compressed
curves on surfaces, which we believe are of independent interest. We provide a
polynomial-time algorithm which, given an orientable surface and a compressed
loop on the surface, computes a canonical form for the loop as a compressed
word. In particular, contractibility of compressed curves on surfaces can be
decided in polynomial time; prior published work considered only constant genus
surfaces. More generally, we solve the following normal subgroup membership
problem in polynomial time: given an arbitrary orientable surface, a compressed
closed curve $\gamma$, and a collection of disjoint normal curves $\Delta$,
there is a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if $\gamma$ lies in the normal
subgroup generated by components of $\Delta$ in the fundamental group of the
surface after attaching the curves to a basepoint.

introduced for modeling of the transition scores to alleviate the uncertain

gravitational scattering amplitudes mediated by virtual gravitons can be

radius. This phase captures collisions with energies satisfying $\sqrt{s}\gg
\gamma M_{Pl}$ (with $\gamma \sim M_{Pl}/M_{BH}$) near the horizon. We call
this the black hole eikonal phase, in contrast to its flat space analogue where
collisions are trans-Planckian. Hawking's geometric optics approximation
neglects gravitational interactions near the horizon, and results in thermal
occupation numbers in the Bogoliubov coefficients. We show that these
interactions are mediated by graviton exchange in $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering
near the horizon, and explicitly calculate the S-matrix non-perturbatively in
$M_{Pl}/M_{BH}$. This involves a re-summation of infinitely many ladder
diagrams near the horizon, all mediated by virtual soft gravitons. The S-matrix
turns out to be a pure phase upon this re-summation and is agnostic of
Planckian physics. Our calculation suggests that non-renormalisability of
gravity is irrelevant for a resolution of the information problem, and is
agnostic of any specific ultraviolet completion. In contrast to the flat space
eikonal limit, the black hole eikonal phase captures collisions of extremely
low energy near the horizon.

radius $R$ enables a classification of many-particle systems in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space according to the degree to which large-scale density
fluctuations are suppressed, resulting in a demarcation between hyperuniform
and nonhyperuniform phyla. To better characterize density fluctuations, we
carry out an extensive study of higher-order moments, including the skewness
$\gamma_1(R)$, excess kurtosis $\gamma_2(R)$ and the corresponding probability
distribution function $P[N(R)]$ of a large family of models across the first
three space dimensions, including both hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform models.
Specifically, we derive explicit integral expressions for $\gamma_1(R)$ and
$\gamma_2(R)$ involving up to three- and four-body correlation functions,
respectively. We also derive rigorous bounds on $\gamma_1(R)$, $\gamma_2(R)$
and $P[N(R)]$. High-quality simulation data for these quantities are generated
for each model. We also ascertain the proximity of $P[N(R)]$ to the normal
distribution via a novel Gaussian distance metric $l_2(R)$. Among all models,
the convergence to a central limit theorem (CLT) is generally fastest for the
disordered hyperuniform processes. The convergence to a CLT is slower for
standard nonhyperuniform models, and slowest for the antihyperuniform model
studied here. We prove that one-dimensional hyperuniform systems of class I or
any $d$-dimensional lattice cannot obey a CLT. Remarkably, we discovered that
the gamma distribution provides a good approximation to $P[N(R)]$ for all
models that obey a CLT, enabling us to estimate the large-$R$ scalings of
$\gamma_1(R)$, $\gamma_2(R)$ and $l_2(R)$. For any $d$-dimensional model that
""decorrelates"" or ""correlates"" with $d$, we elucidate why $P[N(R)]$
increasingly moves toward or away from Gaussian-like behavior, respectively.

or group of galaxies. Their optical contents, such as optical richness, are
crucial for understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and large-scale
structures in modern astronomy and cosmology. The determination of optical
richness can be challenging. We propose a self-supervised approach for
estimating optical richness from multi-band optical images. The method uses the
data properties of the multi-band optical images for pre-training, which
enables learning feature representations from a large but unlabeled dataset. We
apply the proposed method to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The result shows our
estimate of optical richness lowers the mean absolute error and intrinsic
scatter by 11.84% and 20.78%, respectively, while reducing the need for labeled
training data by up to 60%. We believe the proposed method will benefit
astronomy and cosmology, where a large number of unlabeled multi-band images
are available, but acquiring image labels is costly.

restricted on Ising machines, ME is required for mapping from the logical Ising
model to a physical Ising model, which corresponds to a specific Ising machine.
Herein we discuss the guiding principle of ME design to achieve a high
performance in Ising machines. We derive the proposed ME based on a theoretical

compared with two existing types of MEs for different benchmarking problems.
Simulated annealing shows that the proposed ME outperforms existing MEs for all

logical Ising model has a large standard deviation. This study validates the
guiding principle of using statistical mechanics for ME to realize fast and

induces variability in style characteristics within each domain. The proposed

provides an attractive approach to design phase II tissue-agnostic trials by
allowing information borrowing across multiple disease types. In this article,
we elucidate two intrinsic and inevitable issues that may limit the use of BHM
to tissue-agnostic trials: sensitivity to the prior specification of the
shrinkage parameter and the competing ""interest"" among disease types in
increasing power and controlling type I error. To address these issues, we
propose the optimal BHM (OBHM) approach. With OBHM, we first specify a flexible
utility function to quantify the tradeoff between type I error and power across
disease type based on the study objectives, and then we select the prior of the
shrinkage parameter to optimize the utility function of clinical and regulatory
interest. OBMH effectively balances type I and II errors, addresses the
sensitivity of the prior selection, and reduces the ""unwarranted"" subjectivity
in the prior selection. Simulation study shows that the resulting OBHM and its
extensions, clustered OBHM (COBHM) and adaptive OBHM (AOBHM), have desirable
operating characteristics, outperforming some existing methods with better
balanced power and type I error control. Our method provides a systematic,
rigorous way to apply BHM and solve the common problem of blindingly using a
non-informative inverse-gamma prior (with a large variance) or priors
arbitrarily chosen that may lead to pathological statistical properties.

anatomy with intrinsic structures. Being able to reliably locate the same
anatomical structure across varying images is a fundamental task in medical
image analysis. In principle it is possible to use landmark detection or
semantic segmentation for this task, but to work well these require large
numbers of labeled data for each anatomical structure and sub-structure of
interest. A more universal approach would learn the intrinsic structure from
unlabeled images. We introduce such an approach, called Self-supervised
Anatomical eMbedding (SAM). SAM generates semantic embeddings for each image
pixel that describes its anatomical location or body part. To produce such
embeddings, we propose a pixel-level contrastive learning framework. A
coarse-to-fine strategy ensures both global and local anatomical information
are encoded. Negative sample selection strategies are designed to enhance the
embedding's discriminability. Using SAM, one can label any point of interest on
a template image and then locate the same body part in other images by simple
nearest neighbor searching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM in multiple
tasks with 2D and 3D image modalities. On a chest CT dataset with 19 landmarks,
SAM outperforms widely-used registration algorithms while only taking 0.23
seconds for inference. On two X-ray datasets, SAM, with only one labeled
template image, surpasses supervised methods trained on 50 labeled images. We
also apply SAM on whole-body follow-up lesion matching in CT and obtain an

provide efficient computational methods to compute them. The results
demonstrate that the physical and cyber attacks are coordinated and depend on

  On the one hand, the control strategies are linear in the state estimate, and
the estimate error caused by jamming attacks will induce performance

theory in the Landau gauge, a gluon mass term is generated from the restriction
of the gauge field configurations to the first Gribov region. Tissier and
Wschebor have pointed out that simply adding a gluon mass term to the usual
Faddeev-Popov action yields one-loop renormalization group improved gluon and
ghost propagators which are in good agreement with the lattice data even in the
infrared regime. In this work, we extend their analysis to several alternative
renormalization schemes and show how the renormalization scheme dependence can
be used to achieve an almost perfect matching to the lattice data for the gluon
and ghost propagators.

is: what can we learn about parameters that are relevant for policy but not
necessarily point-identified by the exogenous variation we observe? This paper
provides an answer in terms of sharp, analytic characterizations and bounds for
an important class of policy-relevant treatment effects, consisting of marginal
treatment effects and linear functionals thereof, in the latent index selection
model as formalized in Vytlacil (2002). The sharp bounds use the full content
of identified marginal distributions, and analytic derivations rely on the
theory of stochastic orders. The proposed methods also make it possible to
sharply incorporate new auxiliary assumptions on distributions into the latent
index selection framework. Empirically, I apply the methods to study the
effects of Medicaid on emergency room utilization in the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment, showing that the predictions from extrapolations based on
a distribution assumption (rank similarity) differ substantively and
consistently from existing extrapolations based on a parametric mean assumption
(linearity). This underscores the value of utilizing the model's full empirical
content in combination with auxiliary assumptions.

Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) subject to periodic modulation of the

the BEC enters the ""nonlinear regime"", in which several collective modes are
excited. By maintaining the modulation without dissipation, the kinetic energy
that contributes to the density gradient causes quasiperiodic motion and
increases monotonically. In the nonlinear regime, the dips in the density
similar to dark solitons move around in the BEC, intersecting with each other
and maintaining their shapes. On the other hand, even by turning off the
modulation, Faraday waves and the nonlinear regime appear. The kinetic energy
converges to the statistical steady state. The calculation of the modulation
with the dissipation illustrates the collapse and revival of Faraday waves.
When the dissipation is small, the appearance and collapse of the Faraday waves

replenishment and outbound dispatch decisions are subject to fixed (as well as
per-unit) transportation charges and demand is stochastic. In order to realize
scale economies associated with transportation operations both on the outbound
and inbound sides, dispatch schedules must be synchronized over time with
inventory replenishment decisions. An immediate delivery policy on the outbound
side does not make economic sense because outbound dispatch operations and
costs will benefit from a temporal shipment consolidation policy. Our
particular interest in this setting is the exact modeling and analysis of
hybrid shipment consolidation policies, in comparison to the time- and
quantity-based counterparts. Since shipment consolidation prolongs customer
waiting and inventory holding, we investigate average delay penalty per order
and average inventory per time unit as critical measures of performance of the
distribution operation, along with the annual cost. By fixing the expected
inbound replenishment and outbound dispatch frequencies, we compare these
measures among the alternative ways of operation under hybrid, time-based, and
quantity-based policies. This comparison then lends itself to an explicit
analytical comparison of average costs under these three policies, without a
need for solving the corresponding optimization problems.

cost rising. This paper investigates an efficient social distancing policy to
manage the integrated risk from economic health and public health issues for

social distancing is to restrict the community mobility, which was recently
accessible with big data analytics. This paper takes advantage of the community
mobility data to model the COVID-19 processes and infer the COVID-19 driven
economic values from major market index price, which allow us to formulate the

of the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system,
namely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM

using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Jacobian model, since SVD provides an
explicit analytic solution of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which is a key

3D factors, such as interlayer electron transfer, interlayer pairing, and
off-plane magnetic fields including those perpendicular to the most conductive
layers. We examine the systems with a large Maki parameter so that the orbital
pair-breaking effect is negligible, except for the locking of the direction of
the FFLO vector q in the field direction.It is known that the nesting effect
for the FFLO state can be strong in QLD systems in which the orbital
pair-breaking effect is suppressed by applying the mag. field parallel to the
layers. Hence, it has sometimes been suggested that the nesting effect may
hardly enhance the stability of the FFLO state for perpendicular fields. We
illustrate that, contrary to this view, the nesting effect can strongly
stabilize the FFLO state for perpendicular fields as well as for parallel
fields when tz is small so that the Fermi surfaces are open in the
kz-direction, where tz denotes the interlayer transfer energy. In particular,
the nesting effect in perpendicular fields can be strong in interlayer states.
For example, in systems with cylindrical Fermi surfaces warped by tz /= 0,
interlayer states with Dlt_k prop sin k_z exhibit mu_e Hc=1.65 Dlt_a0 for
perpendicular fields, which is much larger than typical values for parallel
fields, such as mu_e Hc=Dlt_s0 of the s-wave state and mu_e Hc = 1.28 Delta_d0
of the d-wave state in cylindrical systems with tz=0. The present result could
potentially provide a physical reason why the areas in the phase diagrams

investigation of science and engineering. At present, they have been built as
intermediate-size computers containing about fifty qubits and are weak against
noise effects. Hence, they are called noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.
In order to accomplish efficient quantum computation with using these machines,
a key issue is going to be the coherent control of individual and collective
quantum noises. In this work, we focus on a latter type and investigate
formulations of the collective quantum noises represented as quantum circuits.
To simplify our discussions and make them concrete, we analyze collective
amplitude damping processes in two-qubit systems. As verifications of our
formalisms and the quantum circuits, we demonstrate digital quantum simulations
of the collective amplitude damping by examining six different initial
conditions with varying the number of execution of an overall operation for our
quantum simulations. We observe that our results show good numerical matching
with the solution of quantum master equation for the two-qubit systems as we
increase such a number. In addition, we explain the essence of the way to
extend our formalisms to analyze the collective amplitude damping in larger
qubit systems. These results pave the way for establishing systematic
approaches to control the quantum noises and designing large-scale quantum
computers.

circumstellar disk. For decades, AA Tau exhibited photometric and spectroscopic
variability that were successfully modelled as occultations of the primary star
by circumstellar material. In 2011, AA Tau entered an extended faint state,
presumably due to enhanced levels of circumstellar dust. We use two sets of
contemporaneous optical-NIR spectra of AA Tau, obtained in December of 2008 and
2014, to directly measure the wavelength-dependent extinction associated with
the dust enhancement driving AA Tau's 2011 optical fade. Taken alone, AA Tau's
apparent optical-NIR increased extinction curve cannot be fit well with
standard extinction laws. At optical wavelengths, AA Tau's dimming event is
consistent with predictions of common extinction models for an increase of
$A_V=2$, but no such model reproduces AA Tau's color-color excess at NIR
wavelengths. We show that veiling emission accounts for the apparent anomalous
NIR extinction: after including this veiling flux, AA Tau's dimming event is
consistent with a standard $A_V=2$ extinction law across the full optical-NIR
range. We also report an increase in AA Tau's mid-IR flux since its 2011 fade,
and suggest that an increase in the height of AA Tau's inner disk is the most
likely explanation for both the IR brightening and the additional extinction
along the line of sight. In addition to informing our understanding of AA Tau,
this analysis demonstrates that caution should be exercised when inferring
extinction (and stellar parameters) from the NIR color-color excess of young
stars with measurable NIR veiling fluxes.

O2 plasma anisotropically etches graphene in the vertical direction, which
exposes graphene edges at h-BN sidewalls. Despite the O2 plasma bombardment,
the lower h-BN layer functions as an insulating layer. Thus, this method allows
us to pattern metal electrodes on h-BN over a second graphene layer. Subsequent
electron-beam lithography and evaporation fabricate metal contacts at the
graphene edges that are active down to cryogenic temperatures. This fabrication
method is demonstrated by the preparation of a graphene Hall bar with a
graphite back-gate and double bilayer-graphene Hall bar devices. The high

algorithms for large-scale multi-dimensional discrete optimization via
simulation problems with a convexity structure. The ""large-scale"" notion refers
to that the decision variable has a large number of values to choose from on
each dimension. The proposed algorithms are targeted to identify a solution
that is close to the optimal solution given any precision level with any given
probability. To achieve this target, utilizing the convexity structure, our
algorithm design does not need to scan all the choices of the decision
variable, but instead sequentially draws a subset of choices of the decision
variable and uses them to ""localize"" potentially near-optimal solutions to an
adaptively shrinking region.
  To show the power of the localization operation, we first consider
one-dimensional large-scale problems. We propose the shrinking uniform sampling
algorithm, which is proved to achieve the target with an optimal expected

we combine the idea of localization with subgradient information and propose a
framework to design stochastic cutting-plane methods and the dimension
reduction algorithm, whose expected simulation cost have a low dependence on
the scale and the dimension of the problems. The proposed algorithms do not
require prior information about the Lipschitz constant of the objective
function and the simulation costs are upper bounded by a value that is
independent of the Lipschitz constant. Finally, we propose an adaptive
algorithm to deal with the unknown noise variance case under the assumption

property that they factor through a tracial von Neumann algebra
$(\mathcal{A,\tau})$ via operators $Z\in M_n(\mathcal{A})$ whose entries
consist of positive elements from the von-Neumann algebra. These maps often
arise in the context of non-local games, especially in the synchronous case. We
establish a connection with the convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing
self-dual cones and the existence of these maps. The Choi matrix of a map of
this kind which factors through an abelian von-Neumann algebra turns out to be
a completely positive (CP) matrix.
  We fully characterize positively factorizable maps whose Choi rank is 2. We
also provide some applications of this analysis in finding doubly nonnegative
matrices which are not CPSD. A special class of these examples is found from
the concept of Unextendible Product Bases in quantum information theory.

in various downstream tasks. However, noises prevail in real-world networks,
which compromise networks to a large extent in that edges in networks propagate
noises through the whole network instead of only the node itself. While
existing methods tend to focus on preserving structural properties, the
robustness of the learned representations against noises is generally ignored.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn noise-free node
representations and eliminate noises simultaneously. Since noises are often
unknown on real graphs, we design two generators, namely a graph generator and
a noise generator, to identify normal structures and noises in an unsupervised
setting. On the one hand, the graph generator serves as a unified scheme to
incorporate any useful graph prior knowledge to generate normal structures. We
illustrate the generative process with community structures and power-law
degree distributions as examples. On the other hand, the noise generator
generates graph noises not only satisfying some fundamental properties but also
in an adaptive way. Thus, real noises with arbitrary distributions can be
handled successfully. Finally, in order to eliminate noises and obtain
noise-free node representations, two generators need to be optimized jointly,
and through maximum likelihood estimation, we equivalently convert the model
into imposing different regularization constraints on the true graph and noises
respectively. Our model is evaluated on both real-world and synthetic data. It
outperforms other strong baselines for node classification and graph
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its ability to eliminate graph noises.

Outside the W-stationary point set, continuous defor-mation of lower level sets
can be performed. However, when passing a W-stationary level, the topology of
the lower level set changes via the attachment of a w-dimensional cell. The
dimension w equals the W-index of the nondegenerate W-stationary point. The
W-index depends on both the number of negative eigenvalues of the restricted
Lagrangian's Hessian and the number of bi-active switching constraints. As a
consequence, we show the mountain pass theorem for MPSC. Additionally, we
address the question if the assumption on the nondegeneracy of W-stationary
points is too restrictive in the context of MPSC. It turns out that all
W-stationary points are generically nondegenerate. Besides, we examine the gap
between nondegeneracy andstrong stability of W-stationary points. A complete

to the improvement of quantum Fisher information. In addition, we also compare
the phase measurement precision with and without photon losses between our

our scheme, especially for the case of s=0, has the best performance via the
enhanced phase resolution and sensitivity when comparing to those previous

the standard quantum-noise limit (SQL) can always be surpassed in our our

health and social stability. At present, understanding and curbing the spread

mechanism and propose a method to quantify a rumors' influence by the speed of
new insiders. The search frequency of the rumor is used as an observation
variable of new insiders. The peak coefficient and the attenuation coefficient
are calculated for the search frequency, which conforms to the exponential

the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function showed that the decision tree
was suitable for predicting the peak coefficient, and the linear regression
model was ideal for predicting the attenuation coefficient. Our feature
analysis showed that precursor features were the most important for the
outbreak coefficient, while location information and rumor entity information
were the most important for the attenuation coefficient. Meanwhile, features
that were conducive to the outbreak were usually harmful to the continued
spread of rumors. At the same time, anxiety was a crucial rumor causing factor.
Finally, we discuss how to use deep learning technology to reduce the forecast
loss by using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

non-tangential estimates and square functions and abstract layer potentials to
replace fundamental solutions in the absence of local regularity of solutions.

theoretically prove that there is an upper bound for neural networks with
identity mappings to constrain the error caused by adversarial noises. However,
in actual computations, this kind of neural network no longer holds any upper
bound and is therefore susceptible to adversarial examples. Following similar
procedures, we explain why adversarial examples can fool other deep neural
networks with skip connections. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a new family
of deep neural networks called Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018) holds a weaker
upper bound. This weaker upper bound prevents the amount of change in the
result from being too large. Thus, Neural ODEs have natural robustness against
adversarial examples. We evaluate the performance of Neural ODEs compared with
ResNet under three white-box adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, DI2-FGSM) and one
black-box adversarial attack (Boundary Attack). Finally, we show that the

results built upon the strong globally strongly convexity or global growth

\emph{locally} strongly convex around its local minima. Concretely, our bound
under convex problems is of order $\tilde{\cO}(1/n)$. For non-convex problems
with $d$ model parameters such that $d/n$ is smaller than a threshold
independent of $n$, the order of $\tilde{\cO}(1/n)$ can be maintained if the

the bound for non-convex problem becomes $\tilde{\cO}(1/\sqrt{n})$ without such

characterization of the empirical risk's landscape. Compared with the existing
algorithmic stability based results, our bounds are dimensional insensitive and
without restrictions on the algorithm's implementation, learning rate, and the

directly applicable to many robotic tasks, e.g. robotic suturing with minimally
invasive robots, as they require a time-consuming process of designing features
from visual information. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have emerged as useful
tools for creating complex models capturing the relationship between
high-dimensional observation space and low-level action/state space.
Nonetheless, such approaches require a dataset suitable for training
appropriate DNN models. This paper presents a dataset of inserting/piercing a
needle with two arms of da Vinci Research Kit in/through soft tissues. The
dataset consists of (1) 60 successful needle insertion trials with randomised
desired exit points recorded by 6 high-resolution calibrated cameras, (2) the

accuracy of the model despite that the baseline feed-forward CNNs successfully
learns the relationship between the visual information and the next step
control actions of the robot. The dataset, as well as our baseline
implementations of RLfD, are publicly available for bench-marking at

and repeating FRB sources. Either this division is a true dichotomy of the
underlying sources, or selection effects and low activity prohibit us from
observing repeat pulses from all constituents making up the FRB source
population. We attempt to break this degeneracy through FRB population
synthesis. With that aim we extend frbpoppy, which earlier only handled one-off
FRBs, to also simulate repeaters. We next model the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity
Mapping Experiment FRB survey (CHIME/FRB). Using this implementation, we
investigate the impact of luminosity functions on the observed dispersion
measure (DM) and distance distributions of both repeating and one-off FRBs. We
show that for a single, intrinsically repeating source population with a steep
luminosity function, selection effects should shape the DM distributions of
one-off and repeating FRB sources differently. This difference is not yet
observed. We next show how the repeater fraction over time can help in
determining the repetition rate of an intrinsic source population. We simulate
this fraction for CHIME/FRB, and show that a source population comprised solely
of repeating FRBs can describe CHIME/FRB observations with the use of a flat
luminosity function. From the outcome of these two methods we thus conclude
that all FRBs originate from a single and mostly uniform population of varying
repeaters. Within this population, the luminosity function cannot be steep, and
there must be minor differences in physical or behaviour parameters that
correlate with repeat rate.

could be tuple, token, label, JSON, and so on). RPT is pre-trained for a
tuple-to-tuple model by corrupting the input tuple and then learning a model to
reconstruct the original tuple. It adopts a Transformer-based neural
translation architecture that consists of a bidirectional encoder (similar to
BERT) and a left-to-right autoregressive decoder (similar to GPT), leading to a
generalization of both BERT and GPT. The pre-trained RPT can already support
several common data preparation tasks such as data cleaning, auto-completion
and schema matching. Better still, RPT can be fine-tuned on a wide range of
data preparation tasks, such as value normalization, data transformation, data
annotation, etc. To complement RPT, we also discuss several appealing
techniques such as collaborative training and few-shot learning for entity
resolution, and few-shot learning and NLP question-answering for information
extraction. In addition, we identify a series of research opportunities to
advance the field of data preparation.

of scalar-field models pertaining to the same class with the standard $\phi^4$
field, can play in controlling the production of a specific type of breathing
bound states so-called oscillons. In the context of cosmology, the built-in
mechanism of oscillons suggests that they can affect the standard picture of
scalar ultra-light dark matter. In the present work kink scatterings are
investigated in a parametrized model of bistable system admitting the classical
$\phi^4$ field as an asymptotic limit, with focus on the formation of
long-lived low-amplitude almost harmonic oscillations of the scalar field
around a vacuum. The parametrized model is characterized by a double-well
potential with a shape-deformation parameter that changes only the steepness of
the potential walls, and hence the flatness of the hump of the potential
barrier, leaving unaffected the two degenerate minima and the barrier height.
It is found that the variation of the deformability parameter promotes several
additional vibrational modes in the kink-phonon scattering potential, leading
to suppression of the two-bounce windows in kink-antikink scatterings and the
production of oscillons. Numerical results suggest that the anharmonicity of
the potential barrier, characterized by a flat barrier hump, is the main
determinant factor for the production of oscillons in double-well systems.

specifically, we present ATUA, a model-based approach that synthesizes App
models with static analysis, integrates a dynamically-refined state abstraction
function and combines complementary testing strategies, including (1) coverage
of the model structure, (2) coverage of the App code, (3) random exploration,
and (4) coverage of dependencies identified through information retrieval. Its
model-based strategy enables ATUA to generate a small set of inputs that
exercise only the code affected by the updates. In turn, this makes common test
oracle solutions more cost-effective as they tend to involve human effort. A
large empirical evaluation, conducted with 72 App versions belonging to nine
popular Android Apps, has shown that ATUA is more effective and less effort
intensive than state-of-the-art approaches when testing App updates.

Assuming Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, Wang et al. found a
$\gtrsim 3\sigma$ tension in the data-calibrated Amati coefficients between
low- and high-redshift GRB samples. To reduce the impact of fiducial cosmology,
we use the Parameterization based on cosmic Age (PAge), an almost
model-independent framework to trace the cosmological expansion history. We
find that the low- and high-redshift tension in Amati coefficients stays almost
the same for the broad class of models covered by PAge, indicating that the
cosmological assumption is not the dominant driver of the redshift evolution of
GRB luminosity correlation. Next, we analyze the selection effect due to flux
limits in observations. We find Amati relation evolves much more significantly
across energy scales of $E_{\rm iso}$. We debias the GRB data by selectively
discarding samples to match low-$z$ and high-$z$ $E_{\rm iso}$ distributions.
After debiasing, the Amati coefficients agree well between low-$z$ and high-$z$
data groups, whereas the evidence of $E_{\rm iso}$-dependence of Amati relation
remains to be strong. Thus, the redshift evolution of GRB luminosity
correlation can be fully interpreted as a selection bias, and does not imply
cosmological evolution of GRBs.

However, in cases with conflicting evidences, the DST may give

evidences. To evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
the method is applied to 15 benchmarks datasets from UCI and KEEL. Further, it
is applied for classifying polycrystalline Nickel alloy first-stage turbine

spectrum of the flare can be fitted with a model dominated by a power-law

learning have recently attracted increasing research interests, and they are
shown to be able to generalize to various downstream applications. Yet, the
adversarial robustness of such pre-trained graph learning models remains
largely unexplored. More importantly, most existing defense techniques designed
for end-to-end graph representation learning methods require pre-specified
label definitions, and thus cannot be directly applied to the pre-training
methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised defense technique to
robustify pre-trained deep graph models, so that the perturbations on the input
graph can be successfully identified and blocked before the model is applied to
different downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a mutual
information-based measure, \textit{graph representation vulnerability (GRV)},
to quantify the robustness of graph encoders on the representation space. We
then formulate an optimization problem to learn the graph representation by
carefully balancing the trade-off between the expressive power and the
robustness (\emph{i.e.}, GRV) of the graph encoder. The discrete nature of
graph topology and the joint space of graph data make the optimization problem
intractable to solve. To handle the above difficulty and to reduce

its proximate molecular absorber at z=2.631. The [OIII] emission line of the
quasar is composed of a broad (FWHM~1600 km/s), spatially-unresolved component,
blueshifted by ~600 km/s from a narrow, spatially-resolved component (FWHM~650
km/s). The wide, blueshifted, unresolved component is consistent with the
presence of outflowing gas in the nuclear region. The narrow component can be
further decomposed into a blue and a red blob with velocity width of several
hundred km/s each, seen ~5 pkpc on opposite spatial locations from the nuclear
emission, indicating outflows over galactic scales. The presence of ionised gas
over kpc-scales is also seen from a weak CIV emission component, detected in
the trough of a saturated CIV absorption that removes the strong nuclear
emission from the quasar.
  Towards the nuclear emission, we observe absorption lines from atomic species
in various ionisation and excitation stages and confirm the presence of strong
H2 lines. The overall absorption profile is very wide, spread over ~600 km/s,
roughly matching in velocities the blue narrow [OIII] blob. From detailed
investigation of the chemical and physical conditions in the absorbing gas, we
infer densities of about nH ~ 10^4-10^5 cm^-3 in the cold (T~100 K) H2-bearing
gas, which we find to be located at ~10 kpc distances from the central UV
source.
  We conjecture that we are witnessing different manifestations of a same
AGN-driven multi-phase outflow, where approaching gas is intercepted by the
line of sight to the nucleus. We corroborate this picture by modelling the
scattering of Ly-a photons from the central source through the outflowing gas,
reproducing the peculiar Ly-a absorption-emission profile, with a damped Ly-a
absorption in which red-peaked, spatially offset and extended Ly-a emission is
seen. [abridged]

unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for

the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in-plane covalent bonding
and report single layers of the one-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskite
[C$_7$H$_{10}$N]$_3$[BiCl$_5$]Cl. Its unique 1D-2D structure enables single
layers and the formation of self-trapped excitons which show white light
emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self-trapping causes an
extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such two-dimensional
perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to
realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics.
These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring
and identifying two-dimensional materials that are no longer limited to
covalently bonded 2D sheets.

into the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion

and the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient ${v}_{\rm 2}$ of heavy-flavor mesons
are powerful observables to study the medium-related effects, such as energy
loss and collectivity, on the heavy quark propagation through the QGP
evolution. The latest measurements of the prompt and non-prompt open
heavy-flavor hadrons allow a systematic comparison of the transport behaviors
probed by charm and beauty quarks. In this work we make such an attempt
utilizing our recently developed framework. By performing a quantitative
investigation of ${{R}_{\rm AA}}$ and ${v}_{\rm 2}$, it is found that both
charm and beauty quarks are efficient probes to capture the dynamical features
of QGP, in particular the resulting mass hierarchy for the energy loss and
azimuthal anisotropy, which are well inherited by the various $D/B$-meson
species. Moreover, our calculations can describe simultaneously ${{R}_{\rm

is that object parts (slates and cylindrical parts), their relationships
(adjacency and translation symmetry), and shape substructures (T-junctions and
a symmetric group of parts) are mostly shared across object categories, even
though object geometries may look very different (e.g. chairs and cabinets).

the polar phase in the vicinity of the Mott insulating phase with even filling
factors. Solving the linearized TDGL equation, we obtain gapless spin-nematic
modes and gapful spin-wave modes in the polar phase that arise due to the
breaking of $S^2$ symmetry in spin space. Supercurrents exhibit dynamical
instabilities induced by growing collective modes. In contrast to the
second-order phase transition, the critical momentum of mass currents is finite
at the phase boundary of the first-order superfluid-Mott insulator (SF-MI)
phase transition. Furthermore, the critical momentum remains finite throughout
the metastable SF phase and approaches zero towards the phase boundary, at
which the metastable SF state disappears. We also study the stability of spin
currents motivated by recent experiments for spinor gases. The critical
momentum of spin currents is found to be zero, where a spin-nematic mode causes
the dynamical instability. We investigate the origin of the zero critical
momentum of spin currents and find it attributed to the fact that the polar
state becomes energetically unstable even in the presence of an infinitesimal

in the entire graph at a coarse level. Next, CFER utilizes the global

the screened Coulomb potential for the electrostatic field in the atom. We take
xenon as an example for the target atom and show that the scattering cross
section was overestimated by more than an order of magnitude for axions with
$\lesssim O(10)$ keV energies, like solar axions. It is also found that
inelastic scattering processes, in which the final state contains an excited or
ionized atom, can be comparable or even be dominant when the size of momentum
transfer is $\lesssim 1$ keV. For more energetic axions, on the other hand, the
total scattering cross section is found to be well approximated by a simple
expression and has little dependence on the atomic structure. As an application
of this result, we consider supernova axions, whose energy is 10-100 MeV, and
show that $O(1)$ inverse Primakoff events are expected for axions from a nearby
supernova in the future neutrino experiments, which may warrant a more detailed

interesting observable consequences, as primordial black holes, or an

model independent, analytic approach for studying the predictions of
single-field scenarios which include short phases of slow-roll violation. Our
method is based on Taylor expanding the equations for cosmological fluctuations
in a small quantity, which parameterizes the duration of the non-slow-roll
eras. The super-horizon spectrum of perturbations is described by few effective
parameters, and is characterized by a pronounced dip followed by a rapid growth
in its amplitude, as typically found in numerical and analytical studies. The
dip position $k_{\rm dip}/k_*$ and the maximal enhancement $\Pi_{\rm max}$ of
the spectrum towards small scales are found to be related by the law $k_{\rm
dip}/k_*\propto \Pi_{\rm max}^{-1/4}$, and we determine the proportionality
constant. For a single epoch of slow-roll violation we confirm previous
studies, finding that the steepest slope of the spectrum well after the dip has
spectral index $n-1\,=\,4$. On the other hand, with multiple phases of
slow-roll violation, the slope of the spectrum is generally enhanced. For
example, when two epochs of slow-roll violation take place, separated by a
phase of quasi-de Sitter expansion, we find that the spectral index can reach
the value $n-1\,=\,8$. This phenomenon indicates that the slope of the spectrum
keeps memory of the history of non-slow-roll phases occurred during inflation.

Second, we propose to incorporate the Mixup method into KCM to expand the
domains of smoothness. In both cases of KCM and the KCM adapted with the Mixup,
we provide risk analysis, respectively, under some conditions for kernels. We
show that the upper bound of the excess risk is not slower than that of the
original function class. The upper bound of the KCM with the Mixup remains
dominated by that of the KCM if the perturbation of the Mixup vanishes faster

regularizer that promotes structured solutions, inexact proximal-Newton-type
methods, or successive quadratic approximation (SQA) methods, are widely used
for their superlinear convergence in terms of iterations. However, unlike the
counter parts in smooth optimization, they suffer from lengthy running time in
solving regularized subproblems because even approximate solutions cannot be
computed easily, so their empirical time cost is not as impressive. In this
work, we first show that for partly smooth regularizers, although general
inexact solutions cannot identify the active manifold that makes the objective
function smooth, approximate solutions generated by commonly-used subproblem
solvers will identify this manifold, even with arbitrarily low solution
precision. We then utilize this property to propose an improved SQA method,
ISQA+, that switches to efficient smooth optimization methods after this
manifold is identified. We show that for a wide class of degenerate solutions,
ISQA+ possesses superlinear convergence not just only in iterations, but also
in running time because the cost per iteration is bounded. In particular, our
superlinear convergence result holds on problems satisfying a sharpness
condition more general than that in existing literature. Experiments on
real-world problems also confirm that ISQA+ greatly improves the state of the
art for regularized optimization.

better performance. Herein, we can benefit from machine learning and compose a
receiver model implementing supervised learning techniques. With this
motivation, we consider a one-to-one transmission system over a flat fast
fading wireless channel and propose a support vector machines (SVM)-based
receiver that combines the pilot-based channel estimation, data demodulation
and decoding processes in one joint operation. We follow two techniques in the
receiver design. We first design one SVM-based classifier that outputs the
class of the encoding codeword that enters the encoder at the transmitter side.
Then, we put forward a model with one SVM-based classifier per one bit in the
encoding codeword, where each classifier assigns the value of the corresponding
bit in the encoding vector. With the second technique, we simplify the receiver
design especially for longer encoding codewords. We show that the SVM-based
receiver performs very closely to the maximum likelihood decoder, which is
known to be the optimal decoding strategy when the encoding vectors at the
transmitter are equally likely. We further show that the SVM-based receiver
outperforms the conventional receivers that perform channel estimation, data
demodulation and decoding in blocks. Finally, we show that we can train the
SVM-based receiver with 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) outputs and the
SVM-based receiver can perform very closely to the conventional receivers that
take 32-bit ADC outputs as inputs.

  Generated Environments","Presented at the AAAI-21 Workshop on Reinforcement Learning in Games",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Reinforcement Learning achieves very good results in domains where
reward functions can be manually engineered. At the same time, there is growing
interest within the community in using games based on Procedurally Content
Generation (PCG) as benchmark environments since this type of environment is
perfect for studying overfitting and generalization of agents under domain
shift. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can instead extrapolate reward
functions from expert demonstrations, with good results even on
high-dimensional problems, however there are no examples of applying these
techniques to procedurally-generated environments. This is mostly due to the
number of demonstrations needed to find a good reward model. We propose a
technique based on Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning which can
significantly decrease the need for expert demonstrations in PCG games. Through
the use of an environment with a limited set of initial seed levels, plus some
modifications to stabilize training, we show that our approach, DE-AIRL, is
demonstration-efficient and still able to extrapolate reward functions which
generalize to the fully procedural domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our technique on two procedural environments, MiniGrid and DeepCrawl, for a
variety of tasks.

repertoire that is assumed to be acquired earlier and observes the effects it
can create in the environment. To form action-grounded object, effect, and
relational categories, we employ a binary bottleneck layer in a predictive,
deep encoder-decoder network that takes the image of the scene and the action
applied as input, and generates the resulting effects in the scene in pixel
coordinates. After learning, the binary latent vector represents action-driven
object categories based on the interaction experience of the robot. To distill
the knowledge represented by the neural network into rules useful for symbolic
reasoning, a decision tree is trained to reproduce its decoder function.
Probabilistic rules are extracted from the decision paths of the tree and are
represented in the Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL),

Firstly, we take a siamese encoder to extract the feature representations of
paired frames (reference frame and current frame). Then, a Center Guiding
Appearance Diffusion Module is designed to capture the inter-frame feature
(dense correspondences between reference frame and current frame), intra-frame
feature (dense correspondences in current frame), and original semantic feature
of current frame. Specifically, we establish a Center Prediction Branch to
predict the center location of the foreground object in current frame and
leverage the center point information as spatial guidance prior to enhance the
inter-frame and intra-frame feature extraction, and thus the feature
representation considerably focus on the foreground objects. Finally, we
propose a Dynamic Information Fusion Module to automatically select relatively
important features through three aforementioned different level features.

preservation in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Throughout this research work
we present a novel hybrid clustering scheme, that combines a typical gradient
clustering protocol with an evolutionary optimization method that is mainly
based on the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). The proposed scheme aims at
improved performance over large in size networks, where classical schemes in
most cases lead to non-efficient solutions. It first creates suitably balanced
multihop clusters, in which the sensors energy gets larger as coming closer to
the cluster head (CH). In the next phase of the proposed scheme a suitable
protocol based on the GSA runs to associate sets of cluster heads to specific
gateway nodes for the eventual relaying of data to the base station (BS). The
fitness function was appropriately chosen considering both the distance from
the cluster heads to the gateway nodes and the remaining energy of the gateway
nodes, and it was further optimized in order to gain more accurate results for
large instances. Extended experimental measurements demonstrate the efficiency
and scalability of the presented approach over very large WSNs, as well as its
superiority over other known clustering approaches presented in the literature.

with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The
resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a
recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state; and a
prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next
observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous
representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the
conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that
govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it
possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one
can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond
the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves
classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal
convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where
only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we
show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification
performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.

applications. By blocking unused functionality, the impact of potential
exploits can be reduced. While seccomp provides a solution for filtering
syscalls, it requires manual implementation of filter rules for each individual
application. Recent work has investigated automated approaches for detecting
and installing the necessary filter rules. However, as we show, these
approaches make assumptions that are not necessary or require overly
time-consuming analysis.
  In this paper, we propose Chestnut, an automated approach for generating
strict syscall filters for Linux userspace applications with lower requirements
and limitations. Chestnut comprises two phases, with the first phase consisting
of two static components, i.e., a compiler and a binary analyzer, that extract
the used syscalls during compilation or in an analysis of the binary. The
compiler-based approach of Chestnut is up to factor 73 faster than previous
approaches without affecting the accuracy adversely. On the binary analysis
level, we demonstrate that the requirement of position-independent binaries of
related work is not needed, enlarging the set of applications for which
Chestnut is usable. In an optional second phase, Chestnut provides a dynamic
refinement tool that allows restricting the set of allowed syscalls further. We
demonstrate that Chestnut on average blocks 302 syscalls (86.5%) via the
compiler and 288 (82.5%) using the binary-level analysis on a set of 18 widely
used applications. We found that Chestnut blocks the dangerous exec syscall in
50% and 77.7% of the tested applications using the compiler- and binary-based
approach, respectively. For the tested applications, Chestnut prevents
exploitation of more than 62% of the 175 CVEs that target the kernel via
syscalls. Finally, we perform a 6 month long-term study of a sandboxed Nginx

large-scale dipole in the arrival direction distribution of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECR). In this work, we build up an understanding of the
diffusive origin of such a dipolar behavior as well as its dependency on energy
and astrophysical source assumptions such as extragalactic magnetic field
strength and cosmic ray composition. We present a novel analytical approach for
calculating the angular distribution of CR coming from a single source and
discuss the regimes in which the steady-state dipole result is expected. We
also present a semianalytical method for calculating the evolution with energy
of the resultant dipole for an ensemble of sources. We show that a local source
allows for a strong growth of the dipole with energy over a large energy range.
The possibility of a transition from a dipolar to non-dipolar regime at the
highest energies and its implications for the source density, magnetic field
intensity, and cosmic ray composition are discussed.

Here, we construct the symmetry-adapted localized Wannier functions and the
corresponding $\textit{ab initio}$ minimal two-valley four-band effective
tight-binding models for generic twisted graphene systems with small twist
angle. Such two-valley model evades the Wannier obstruction caused by the

maximum at AA spots and its center at AB or BA spots. An extended Hubbard model
is also given and the related parameters are presented explicitly. We provide
an approach to systematically build the Wannier tight-binding model for generic

As a result, the initial orbit and spins after impact may have substantially
differed from those observed today. More precisely, the distance at periapse
may have been shorter, subsequently expanding to its current separation by
tides raised simultaneously on the two bodies. Here we provide a general 3D
model to study the tidal evolution of a binary composed of two triaxial bodies
orbiting a central star. We apply this model to the Pluto-Charon binary, and
notice some interesting constraints on the initial system. We observe that when
the eccentricity evolves to high values, the presence of the Sun prevents
Charon from escaping because of Lidov-Kozai cycles. However, for a high initial
obliquity for Pluto or a spin-orbit capture of Charon's rotation, the binary
eccentricity is damped very efficiently. As a result, the system can maintain a
moderate eccentricity throughout its evolution, even for strong tidal
dissipation on Pluto.

rate. Conventional radiography (i.e. X-ray imaging) is used for wrist fracture
detection routinely, but occasionally fracture delineation poses issues and an
additional confirmation by computed tomography (CT) is needed for diagnosis.
Recent advances in the field of Deep Learning (DL), a subfield of Artificial

using Convolutional Neural Networks. However, previous studies did not pay
close attention to the difficult cases which can only be confirmed via CT
imaging. In this study, we have developed and analyzed a state-of-the-art
DL-based pipeline for wrist (distal radius) fracture detection -- DeepWrist,
and evaluated it against one general population test set, and one challenging
test set comprising only cases requiring confirmation by CT. Our results reveal
that a typical state-of-the-art approach, such as DeepWrist, while having a
near-perfect performance on the general independent test set, has a
substantially lower performance on the challenging test set -- average
precision of 0.99 (0.99-0.99) vs 0.64 (0.46-0.83), respectively. Similarly, the
area under the ROC curve was of 0.99 (0.98-0.99) vs 0.84 (0.72-0.93),

hunt for trolls on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Trolls, poised
to disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the
absence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by
promulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the
TrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set
of Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to
troll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall
over a dataset of 1.3 million tweets. Without a final resolution of the
pandemic in sight, it is unlikely that the trolls will go away, although they
might be forced to evade automated hunting. To explore the plausibility of this
strategy, we developed and tested an adversarial machine learning mechanism
called TrollHunter-Evader. TrollHunter-Evader employs a Test Time Evasion (TTE)
approach in a combination with a Markov chain-based mechanism to recycle
originally trolling tweets. The recycled tweets were able to achieve a
remarkable 40% decrease in the TrollHunter's ability to correctly identify
trolling tweets. Because the COVID-19 infodemic could have a harmful impact on
the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide an elaborate discussion about the
implications of employing adversarial machine learning to evade Twitter troll
hunts.

availability of GPS data, mobile applications, and effective communication
technologies have led to the emergence of On-Demand Transit (ODT) systems. In
September 2018, the City of Belleville in Canada started an on-demand public
transit pilot project, where the late-night fixed-route (RT 11) was substituted
with the ODT providing a real-time ride-hailing service. We present an in-depth
analysis of the spatio-temporal demand and supply, level of service, and origin
and destination patterns of Belleville ODT users, based on the data collected
from September 2018 till May 2019. The independent and combined effects of the
demographic characteristics (population density, working-age, and median
income) on the ODT trip production and attraction levels were studied using GIS
and the K-means machine learning clustering algorithm. The results indicate
that ODT trips demand is highest for 11:00 pm-11:45 pm during the weekdays and
8:00 pm-8:30 pm during the weekends. We expect this to be the result of users
returning home from work or shopping. Results showed that 39% of the trips were
found to have a waiting time of smaller than 15 minutes, while 28% of trips had
a waiting time of 15-30 minutes. The dissemination areas with higher population
density, lower median income, or higher working-age percentages tend to have
higher ODT trip attraction levels, except for the dissemination areas that have
highly attractive places like commercial areas.

Saturn-mass planet on a tight orbit which is accompanied by a slightly more
massive planet on a nearby outer orbit. Using new space-born photometry and
ground-based follow-up transit observations and data available in literature,
we performed modeling that accounts for gravitational interactions between both
planets. Thanks to the new transit timing data for planet b, uncertainties of
orbital periods and eccentricities for both planets were reduced relative to
previously published values by a factor of 3-4. Variation in transit timing has
an amplitude of about 20 minutes and can be easily followed-up with a 1-m class
telescopes from the ground. An approximated transit ephemeris, which accounts
for gravitational interactions with an accuracy up to 5 minutes, is provided.
No signature of transits was found for planet c down to the Neptune-size
regime. No other transiting companions were found down to a size of about 2.4
Earth radii for interior orbits. We notice, however, that the regime of

to hunt for trolling narratives on Twitter during the 2020 U.S. elections.
Trolling narratives form on Twitter as alternative explanations of polarizing
events like the 2020 U.S. elections with the goal to conduct information
operations or provoke emotional response. Detecting trolling narratives thus is
an imperative step to preserve constructive discourse on Twitter and remove an
influx of misinformation. Using existing techniques, this takes time and a
wealth of data, which, in a rapidly changing election cycle with high stakes,
might not be available. To overcome this limitation, we developed
TrollHunter2020 to hunt for trolls in real-time with several dozens of trending
Twitter topics and hashtags corresponding to the candidates' debates, the
election night, and the election aftermath. TrollHunter2020 collects trending
data and utilizes a correspondence analysis to detect meaningful relationships
between the top nouns and verbs used in constructing trolling narratives while
they emerge on Twitter. Our results suggest that the TrollHunter2020 indeed
captures the emerging trolling narratives in a very early stage of an unfolding
polarizing event. We discuss the utility of TrollHunter2020 for early detection
of information operations or trolling and the implications of its use in
supporting a constrictive discourse on the platform around polarizing topics.

of how these missions' data sets can be referenced to a ground truth.
Meanwhile, stationary optical clocks show fractional instabilities below
$10^{-18}$ when averaged over an hour, and continue to be improved in terms of
precision and accuracy, uptime, and transportability. The frequency of a clock
is affected by the gravitational redshift, and thus depends on the local
geopotential; a relative frequency change of $10^{-18}$ corresponds to a geoid
height change of about $1$ cm. Here we suggest that this effect could be
further exploited for sensing large-scale temporal geopotential changes via a
network of clocks distributed at the Earth's surface. In fact, several projects
have already proposed to create an ensemble of optical clocks connected across
Europe via optical fibre links. Our hypothesis is that a clock network with
collocated GNSS receivers spread over Europe - for which the physical
infrastructure is already partly in place - would enable us to determine
temporal variations of the Earth's gravity field at time scales of days and
beyond, and thus provide a new means for validating satellite missions such as
GRACE-FO or a future gravity mission. Here, we show through simulations how
ice, hydrology and atmosphere variations over Europe could be observed with
clock comparisons in a future network that follows current design concepts in
the metrology community. We assume different scenarios for clock and GNSS
uncertainties and find that even under conservative assumptions - a clock error
of $10^{-18}$ and vertical height control error of $1.4$ mm for daily
measurements - hydrological signals at the annual time scale and atmospheric
signals down to the weekly time scale could be observed.

  estimation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fast and reliable prediction of riverine flow velocities is important in many
applications, including flood risk management. The shallow water equations
(SWEs) are commonly used for prediction of the flow velocities. However,
accurate and fast prediction with standard SWE solvers is challenging in many
cases. Traditional approaches are computationally expensive and require
high-resolution riverbed profile measurement ( bathymetry) for accurate
predictions. As a result, they are a poor fit in situations where they need to
be evaluated repetitively due, for example, to varying boundary condition (BC),
or when the bathymetry is not known with certainty. In this work, we propose a
two-stage process that tackles these issues. First, using the principal
component geostatistical approach (PCGA) we estimate the probability density
function of the bathymetry from flow velocity measurements, and then we use
multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain a fast solver of the SWEs, given
augmented realizations from the posterior bathymetry distribution and the
prescribed range of BCs. The first step allows us to predict flow velocities
without direct measurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore, the augmentation of
the distribution in the second stage allows incorporation of the additional
bathymetry information into the flow velocity prediction for improved accuracy
and generalization, even if the bathymetry changes over time. Here, we use
three solvers, referred to as PCA-DNN (principal component analysis-deep neural
network), SE (supervised encoder), and SVE (supervised variational encoder),
and validate them on a reach of the Savannah river near Augusta, GA. Our
results show that the fast solvers are capable of predicting flow velocities
with good accuracy, at a computational cost that is significantly lower than
the cost of solving the full boundary value problem with traditional methods.

self-training strategy to mitigate the noises in pseudo-labeled target domain

general method, our ELP can be easily applied to various domain adaptation
approaches and can facilitate their feature discrimination in the target

consistently improves the classification accuracy of mainstream SSDA methods by
2%~3%. Additionally, ELP also improves the performance of UDA methods as well

  arXiv:1912.03590",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the problem of retrieving a specific moment from an untrimmed
video by natural language. It is a challenging problem because a target moment
may take place in the context of other temporal moments in the untrimmed video.
Existing methods cannot tackle this challenge well since they do not fully
consider the temporal contexts between temporal moments. In this paper, we
model the temporal context between video moments by a set of predefined
two-dimensional maps under different temporal scales. For each map, one
dimension indicates the starting time of a moment and the other indicates the
duration. These 2D temporal maps can cover diverse video moments with different
lengths, while representing their adjacent contexts at different temporal
scales. Based on the 2D temporal maps, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal
Adjacent Network (MS-2D-TAN), a single-shot framework for moment localization.
It is capable of encoding the adjacent temporal contexts at each scale, while
learning discriminative features for matching video moments with referring
expressions. We evaluate the proposed MS-2D-TAN on three challenging
benchmarks, i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions, and TACoS, where our
MS-2D-TAN outperforms the state of the art.

consider for autonomous vehicles in urban areas. In this paper, we address the
problem of jointly detecting pedestrians and recognizing 32 pedestrian
attributes from a single image. These encompass visual appearance and behavior,
and also include the forecasting of road crossing, which is a main safety
concern. For this, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model relying on a
composite field framework, which achieves both goals in an efficient way. Each
field spatially locates pedestrian instances and aggregates attribute
predictions over them. This formulation naturally leverages spatial context,
making it well suited to low resolution scenarios such as autonomous driving.
By increasing the number of attributes jointly learned, we highlight an issue
related to the scales of gradients, which arises in MTL with numerous tasks. We
solve it by normalizing the gradients coming from different objective functions
when they join at the fork in the network architecture during the backward
pass, referred to as fork-normalization. Experimental validation is performed
on JAAD, a dataset providing numerous attributes for pedestrian analysis from
autonomous vehicles, and shows competitive detection and attribute recognition
results, as well as a more stable MTL training.

enhanced LISA Science Center could: support one of the parallel independent

provide an interface into the subtleties of the instrument to validate
extraordinary discoveries; train new users; and expand the research community

$\partial S=\partial S_0$ and ${\bf M}(S)\leq {\bf c}(A){\bf M}(\partial

inequality ${\bf M}(S)\leq {\bf c}(A){\bf M}(\partial S)$ is valid for any
compact algebraic, semi-algebraic, or even subanalytic set $A$. In such a set,
this linear inequality holds not only for integral currents, which have
$\boldsymbol{Z}$ coefficients, but also for normal currents having
$\boldsymbol{R}$ coefficients and generally for normal flat chains with

designs and their existence has been settled a long time ago. Yet, in
comparison with Steiner triple systems, little is known about their
automorphism groups. In particular, there is no known congruence class
representing the orders of a KTS with a number of automorphisms at least close
to the number of points. We fill this gap by proving that whenever $v \equiv
39$ (mod 72), or $v \equiv 4^e48 + 3$ (mod $4^e96$) and $e \geq 0$, there
exists a KTS on $v$ points having at least $v-3$ automorphisms.
  This is only one of the consequences of a careful investigation on the KTSs
with an automorphism group $G$ acting sharply transitively on all but three
points. Our methods are all constructive and yield KTSs which in many cases
inherit some of the automorphisms of $G$, thus increasing the total number of
symmetries.
  To obtain these results it was necessary to introduce new types of difference
families (the doubly disjoint ones) and difference matrices (the splittable
ones) which we believe are interesting by themselves.

play a matrix game against each other and update their parameters after each
round. The agents' decision-making is transparent to each other, which allows
each agent to predict how their opponent will play against them. To prevent an
infinite regress of both agents recursively predicting each other indefinitely,
each agent is required to give an opponent-independent response with some
probability at least epsilon. Transparency also allows each agent to anticipate
and shape the other agent's gradient step, i.e. to move to regions of parameter
space in which the opponent's gradient points in a direction favourable to
them. We study the resulting dynamics experimentally, using two algorithms from
previous literature (LOLA and SOS) for opponent-aware learning. We find that
the combination of mutually transparent decision-making and opponent-aware
learning robustly leads to mutual cooperation in a single-shot prisoner's
dilemma. In a game of chicken, in which both agents try to manoeuvre their
opponent towards their preferred equilibrium, converging to a mutually
beneficial outcome turns out to be much harder, and opponent-aware learning can
even lead to worst-case outcomes for both agents. This highlights the need to
develop opponent-aware learning algorithms that achieve acceptable outcomes in
social dilemmas involving an equilibrium selection problem.

oxides, a vigorous debate has been focused on the pseudogap - a partial gap
that opens over portions of the Fermi surface in the 'normal' state above the
bulk critical temperature ($T_{c}$). The pseudogap has been attributed to
precursor superconductivity, to the existence of preformed pairs, or to
competing orders such as charge-density waves. A direct determination of the
charge of carriers as a function of temperature and bias could help resolve
among these alternatives. Here, we report measurements of the shot noise of
tunneling current in high-quality

distinct regions in the bias voltage-temperature ($V-T$) space. Well outside
the superconducting gap region, the shot noise agrees quantitatively with
independent tunneling of charge-e carriers. Deep within the gap, shot noise is
greatly enhanced, reminiscent of multiple Andreev reflections. Starting above
$T_{c}$ and extending to biases much larger than the gap, there is a broad
region in which the noise substantially exceeds the expectations of
single-charge tunneling, indicating pairing of carriers. Pairs are detectable
deep into the pseudogap region of temperature and bias.

training samples. Especially in healthcare settings these samples can be very
expensive, meaning that one institution alone usually does not have enough on
its own. Merging privacy-sensitive data from different sources is usually
restricted by data security and data protection measures. This can lead to
approaches that reduce data quality by putting noise onto the variables (e.g.,
in $\epsilon$-differential privacy) or omitting certain values (e.g., for
$k$-anonymity). Other measures based on cryptographic methods can lead to very
time-consuming computations, which is especially problematic for larger
multi-omics data. We address this problem by introducing ESCAPED, which stands
for Efficient SeCure And PrivatE Dot product framework, enabling the
computation of the dot product of vectors from multiple sources on a
third-party, which later trains kernel-based machine learning algorithms, while
neither sacrificing privacy nor adding noise. We evaluated our framework on
drug resistance prediction for HIV-infected people and multi-omics
dimensionality reduction and clustering problems in precision medicine. In
terms of execution time, our framework significantly outperforms the
best-fitting existing approaches without sacrificing the performance of the
algorithm. Even though we only show the benefit for kernel-based algorithms,
our framework can open up new research opportunities for further machine
learning models that require the dot product of vectors from multiple sources.

However, at certain spatial and temporal resolutions, it is very challenging to
track, for example, job and housing mobility. In this study, we explore the
usage of a new modality of dataset, online food delivery data, to detect job
and housing mobility. By leveraging millions of meal orders from a popular
online food ordering and delivery service in Beijing, China, we are able to
detect job and housing moves at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions
than using traditional data sources. Popular moving seasons and
origins/destinations can be well identified. More importantly, we match the
detected moves to both macro- and micro-level factors so as to characterize job
and housing dynamics. Our findings suggest that commuting distance is a major
factor for job and housing mobility. We also observe that: (1) For home movers,
there is a trade-off between lower housing cost and shorter commuting distance
given the urban spatial structure; (2) For job hoppers, those who frequently
work overtime are more likely to reduce their working hours by switching jobs.
While this new modality of dataset has its limitations, we believe that
ensemble approaches would be promising, where a mash-up of multiple datasets
with different characteristic limitations can provide a more comprehensive
picture of job and housing dynamics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of
utilizing food delivery data to detect and analyze job and housing mobility,
and contributes to realizing the full potential of ensemble-based approaches.

helps financial experts make better decisions regarding whether or not to
accept a loan application, such that loans with a high probability of default
are not accepted. Apart from the noisy and highly imbalanced data challenges
faced by such credit scoring models, recent regulations such as the `right to
explanation' introduced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) have added the need for model
interpretability to ensure that algorithmic decisions are understandable and
coherent. An interesting concept that has been recently introduced is
eXplainable AI (XAI), which focuses on making black-box models more
interpretable. In this work, we present a credit scoring model that is both
accurate and interpretable. For classification, state-of-the-art performance on
the Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and Lending Club (LC) Datasets is
achieved using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. The model is then
further enhanced with a 360-degree explanation framework, which provides
different explanations (i.e. global, local feature-based and local
instance-based) that are required by different people in different situations.
Evaluation through the use of functionallygrounded, application-grounded and
human-grounded analysis show that the explanations provided are simple,
consistent as well as satisfy the six predetermined hypotheses testing for
correctness, effectiveness, easy understanding, detail sufficiency and

$\tilde{p}$, responsible for suppression of 3D-AFM, as obtained from stripe
incommensurability. The stripe model's assumption that doped holes in

  computation; Retinal model",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Here we provide evidence that the fundamental basis of nervous communication
is derived from a pressure pulse/soliton capable of computation with sufficient
temporal precision to overcome any processing errors. Signalling and computing
within the nervous system are complex and different phenomena. Action
potentials are plastic and this makes the action potential peak an
inappropriate fixed point for neural computation, but the action potential
threshold is suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, neural models timed by
spiking neurons operate below the rate necessary to overcome processing error.
Using retinal processing as our example, we demonstrate that the contemporary
theory of nerve conduction based on cable theory is inappropriate to account
for the short computational time necessary for the full functioning of the
retina and by implication the rest of the brain. Moreover, cable theory cannot
be instrumental in the propagation of the action potential because at the
activation-threshold there is insufficient charge at the activation site for
successive ion channels to be electrostatically opened. Deconstruction of the
brain neural network suggests that it is a member of a group of Quantum phase
computers of which the Turing machine is the simplest: the brain is another
based upon phase ternary computation. However, attempts to use Turing based
mechanisms cannot resolve the coding of the retina or the computation of
intelligence, as the technology of Turing based computers is fundamentally
different. We demonstrate that that coding in the brain neural network is
quantum based, where the quanta have a temporal variable and a phase-base
variable enabling phase ternary computation as previously demonstrated in the
retina.

  Classification Using Genetic Programming","2020 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)",,,,"cs.CL cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In medical fields, text classification is one of the most important tasks
that can significantly reduce human workload through structured information
digitization and intelligent decision support. Despite the popularity of
learning-based text classification techniques, it is hard for human to
understand or manually fine-tune the classification results for better
precision and recall, due to the black box nature of learning. This study
proposes a novel regular expression-based text classification method making use
of genetic programming (GP) approaches to evolve regular expressions that can
classify a given medical text inquiry with satisfactory precision and recall
while allow human to read the classifier and fine-tune accordingly if
necessary. Given a seed population of regular expressions (can be randomly
initialized or manually constructed by experts), our method evolves a
population of regular expressions according to chosen fitness function, using a
novel regular expression syntax and a series of carefully chosen reproduction
operators. Our method is evaluated with real-life medical text inquiries from
an online healthcare provider and shows promising performance. More
importantly, our method generates classifiers that can be fully understood,
checked and updated by medical doctors, which are fundamentally crucial for
medical related practices.

need for high-quality static word vectors in many NLP applications, such
vectors continue to play an important role in tasks where words need to be
modelled in the absence of linguistic context. In this paper, we explore how
the contextualised embeddings predicted by BERT can be used to produce
high-quality word vectors for such domains, in particular related to knowledge
base completion, where our focus is on capturing the semantic properties of
nouns. We find that a simple strategy of averaging the contextualised
embeddings of masked word mentions leads to vectors that outperform the static
word vectors learned by BERT, as well as those from standard word embedding
models, in property induction tasks. We notice in particular that masking
target words is critical to achieve this strong performance, as the resulting
vectors focus less on idiosyncratic properties and more on general semantic
properties. Inspired by this view, we propose a filtering strategy which is
aimed at removing the most idiosyncratic mention vectors, allowing us to obtain
further performance gains in property induction.

for computational fluid dynamics simulations of reacting flows using a
finite-rate-chemistry approach. This has motivated the use of fully connected
artificial neural networks to predict stiff chemical source terms as functions
of the thermochemical state of the combustion system. However, due to the
nonlinearities and multi-scale nature of combustion, the predicted solution
often diverges from the true solution when these deep learning models are
coupled with a computational fluid dynamics solver. This is because these
approaches minimize the error during training without guaranteeing successful
integration with ordinary differential equation solvers. In the present work, a
novel neural ordinary differential equations approach to modeling chemical
kinetics, termed as ChemNODE, is developed. In this deep learning framework,
the chemical source terms predicted by the neural networks are integrated
during training, and by computing the required derivatives, the neural network
weights are adjusted accordingly to minimize the difference between the
predicted and ground-truth solution. A proof-of-concept study is performed with
ChemNODE for homogeneous autoignition of hydrogen-air mixture over a range of
composition and thermodynamic conditions. It is shown that ChemNODE accurately
captures the correct physical behavior and reproduces the results obtained
using the full chemical kinetic mechanism at a fraction of the computational
cost.
