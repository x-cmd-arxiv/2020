we train a CNN that estimates a sharp high-SNR image by aggregating a burst of

learning the burst's exposure times in an end-to-end manner, thus balancing the

model of strategic behavior under the deferred acceptance algorithm:
manipulation through an accomplice. Here, an agent on the proposed-to side
(say, a woman) partners with an agent on the proposing side -- an accomplice --
to manipulate on her behalf (possibly at the expense of worsening his match).
We show that the optimal manipulation strategy for an accomplice comprises of
promoting exactly one woman in his true list (i.e., an inconspicuous

algorithm for computing an optimal accomplice manipulation. We also study the
conditions under which the manipulated matching is stable with respect to the

outperforms self manipulation both in terms of the frequency of occurrence as

shared among a set of agents. Each agent demands one resource and each resource
can serve a limited number of agents. An agent cares about what resource they
get as well as the externalities imposed by their mates, whom they share the
same resource with. Apparently, the strong notion of envy-freeness, where no
agent envies another for their resource or mates, cannot always be achieved and
we show that even to decide the existence of such a strongly envy-free

whether (and in what situations) a relaxed notion of envy-freeness, the Pareto
envy-freeness, can be achieved: an agent i envies another agent j only when i
envies both the resource and the mates of j. In particular, we are interested
in a dorm assignment problem, where students are to be assigned to dorms with
the same capacity and they have dichotomous preference over their dorm-mates.
We show that when the capacity of the dorms is 2, a Pareto envy-free assignment
always exists and we present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an

capacities increase to 3, in which case even Pareto envy-freeness cannot be

envy-freeness in general implies approximations of proportionality.

encompasses seven different OFDM systems. It considers the overlap-and-add
procedure performed in the transmitter of windowed OFDM systems, being jointly
formulated with the channel convolution. The intersymbol and intercarrier
interference, caused when the order of the channel impulse response is higher
than the number of CP samples, is characterized. A new equivalent channel
matrix that is useful for calculating both the received signal and the
interference power is defined and characterized. Unlike previous works, this
new channel matrix has no restrictions on the length of the channel impulse
response, which means that the study is not constrained to the particular case
of two or three data blocks interfering in the received signal. Theoretical
expressions for the powers of three different kinds of interference are
derived. These expressions allow calculating the

additional dimension for track seeding that can significantly reduce the
combinatorial challenge of track finding. We use neural networks to show that
cluster shapes can reduce significantly the rate of fake combinatorical
backgrounds while preserving a high efficiency. We demonstrate this using the
information in cluster singlets, doublets and triplets. Numerical results are

  Acquisition, Reconstruction and Performance","18 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In ultrasound nondestructive testing, a widespread approach is to take
synthetic aperture measurements from the surface of a specimen to detect and
locate defects within it. Based on these measurements, imaging is usually
performed using the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). However, SAFT
is sub-optimal in terms of resolution and requires oversampling in time domain
to obtain a fine grid for the Delay-and-Sum (DAS). On the other hand,
parametric reconstruction algorithms give better resolution, but their usage
for imaging becomes computationally expensive due to the size of the parameter
space and the large amount of measurement data in realistic 3-D scenarios. In
the literature, the remedies to this are twofold: First, the amount of
measurement data can be reduced using state of the art sub-Nyquist sampling
approaches to measure Fourier coefficients instead of time domain samples.
Second, parametric reconstruction algorithms mostly rely on matrix-vector
operations that can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the underlying
model structure. In this paper, we propose and compare different strategies to
choose the Fourier coefficients to be measured. Their asymptotic performance is
compared by numerically evaluating the Cram\'er-Rao-Bound for the
localizability of the defect coordinates. These subsampling strategies are then
combined with an $\ell_1$-minimization scheme to compute 3-D reconstructions
from the low-rate measurements. Compared to conventional DAS, this allows us to
formulate a fully physically motivated forward model. To enable this, the
projection operations of the forward model matrix are implemented matrix-free
by exploiting the underlying 2-level Toeplitz structure. Finally, we show that
high resolution reconstructions from as low as a single Fourier coefficient per
scan are possible based on simulated data as well as on measurements.

simulations of the interaction of a shock with a molecular cloud evolving due

a molecular cloud out of an initially quiescent atomic medium due to the
effects of thermal instability and gravity. The second case introduces a shock
whilst the cloud is still in the warm atomic phase, and the third scenario
introduces a shock once the molecular cloud has formed. The shocks accelerate
the global collapse of the clouds with both experiencing local gravitational
collapse prior to this. When the cloud is still atomic, the evolution is shock
dominated and structures form due to dynamical instabilities within a
radiatively cooled shell. While the transmitted shock can potentially trigger
the thermal instability, this is prevented as material is shocked multiple
times on the order of a cloud crushing time-scale. When the cloud is molecular,
the post-shock flow is directed via the pre-existing structure through
low-density regions in the inter-clump medium. The clumps are accelerated and
deformed as the flow induces clump-clump collisions and mergers that collapse
under gravity. For a limited period, both shocked cases show a mixture of
Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence-like velocity and logarithmic density power
spectra, and strongly varying density spectra. The clouds presented in this
work provide realistic conditions that will be used in future feedback studies.

technique that enables structure-aware algebra over patterns to accurately
infer the results for a given set of patterns using the results of a completely
different set of patterns that are less expensive to compute. Pattern morphing
""morphs"" (or converts) a given set of query patterns into alternative patterns,
while retaining full equivalency. It is a general technique that supports
various operations over matches of a pattern beyond just counting (e.g.,
support calculation, enumeration, etc.), making it widely applicable to various
graph mining applications like Motif Counting and Frequent Subgraph Mining.
Since pattern morphing mainly transforms query patterns before their
exploration starts, it can be easily incorporated in existing general-purpose

incorporating it in Peregrine, a recent state-of-the-art graph mining system,

preferences towards different items. In this paper, we focus on addressing
three main problems existing in the review-based methods. Firstly, these
methods suffer from the class-imbalanced problem where rating levels with lower
proportions will be ignored to some extent. Thus, their performance on
relatively rare rating levels is unsatisfactory. As the first attempt in this
field to address this problem, we propose a flexible dual-optimizer model to
gain robustness from both regression loss and classification loss. Secondly, to
address the problem caused by the insufficient contextual information
extraction ability of word embedding, we first introduce BERT into the
review-based method to improve the performance of the semantic analysis.
Thirdly, the existing methods ignore the feature information of the
time-varying user preferences. Therefore, we propose a time-varying feature
extraction module with bidirectional long short-term memory and multi-scale
convolutional neural network. Afterward, an interaction component is proposed
to further summarize the contextual information of the user-item pairs. To
verify the effectiveness of the proposed TADO, we conduct extensive experiments
on 23 benchmark datasets selected from Amazon Product Reviews. Compared with
several recently proposed state-of-the-art methods, our model obtains
significant gain over ALFM, MPCN, and ANR averagely with 20.98\%, 9.84\%, and
15.46\%, respectively. Further analysis proves the necessity of jointly using
the proposed components in TADO.

to their non-volatility, higher cell density, and scalability features. While
previous work has investigated several architectural implications of NVM for
generic applications, in this work we present DeepNVM++, a framework to
characterize, model, and analyze NVM-based caches in GPU architectures for deep
learning (DL) applications by combining technology-specific circuit-level
models and the actual memory behavior of various DL workloads. We present both
iso-capacity and iso-area performance and energy analysis for systems whose
last-level caches rely on conventional SRAM and emerging STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM
technologies. In the iso-capacity case, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to
3.8x and 4.7x energy-delay product (EDP) reduction and 2.4x and 2.8x area
reduction compared to conventional SRAM, respectively. Under iso-area
assumptions, STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM provide up to 2x and 2.3x EDP reduction and
accommodate 2.3x and 3.3x cache capacity when compared to SRAM, respectively.
We also perform a scalability analysis and show that STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM
achieve orders of magnitude EDP reduction when compared to SRAM for large cache
capacities. Our comprehensive cross-layer framework is demonstrated on
STT-/SOT-MRAM technologies and can be used for the characterization, modeling,

with self-avoiding walks. We exploit knowledge of phase transitions and
asymptotic behavior in self avoiding walks to analyze two questions of crucial
importance for Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of districting plans. First,
we examine mixing times of a popular Glauber dynamics based Markov chain and
show how the self-avoiding walk phase transitions interact with mixing time. We
examine factors new to the redistricting context that complicate the picture,
notably the population balance requirements, connectivity requirements, and the
irregular graphs used. Second, we analyze the robustness of the qualitative
properties of typical districting plans with respect to score functions and a
certain lattice-like graph, called the state-dual graph, that is used as a

us better understand the complex relationship between typical properties of

Among other things, it depends on the planned rolling stock circulation and the

using a small number of sources including free-electron laser facilities [1-3]

concept for a compact intense XUV source based on HHG that is focused to an
intensity of $2 \times 10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, with a potential increase up to
$10^{17}$ W/cm$^2$ in the future. Our approach uses tight focusing of the
near-infrared (NIR) driving laser and minimizes the XUV virtual source size by
generating harmonics several Rayleigh lengths away from the NIR focus.
Accordingly, the XUV pulses can be refocused to a small beam waist radius of
600 nm, enabling the absorption of up to four XUV photons by a single Ar atom
in a setup that fits on a modest (2 m) laser table. Our concept represents a
straightforward approach for the generation of intense XUV pulses in many

of Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method,
Bayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single
pre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e.,
super-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward
corruption models. We keep the weights of the generator model fixed, and
reconstruct the image by estimating the Bayesian maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
estimate over the input latent vector that generated the reconstructed image.
We further use variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution
over the latent vectors, from which we sample multiple solutions. We
demonstrate BRGM on three large and diverse datasets: (i) 60,000 images from
the Flick Faces High Quality dataset (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III

transition between normal and superradiant phases. We consider a disordered
version of a quench in the Rabi model, in which the system residing in the

final Hamiltonian corresponding to the critical point. The disorder is inserted
either in the total time the quench or in the quench parameter itself. We solve

adiabatic perturbation theory and the Kibble- Zurek mechanism. For the disorder
in the quench parameter, we report a monotonic increase in the adiabaticity
with the strength of the disorder. Lastly, we consider a quench where the final
Hamiltonian is chosen as the average over the disordered final Hamiltonians,

modeling. The data modeling culture (DMC) refers to practices aiming to conduct
statistical inference on one or several quantities of interest. The algorithmic
modeling culture (AMC) refers to practices defining a machine-learning (ML)
procedure that generates accurate predictions about an event of interest.
Breiman argued that statisticians should give more attention to AMC than to
DMC, because of the strengths of ML in adapting to data. While twenty years
later, DMC has lost some of its dominant role in statistics because of the
data-science revolution, we observe that this culture is still the leading
practice in the natural and social sciences. DMC is the modus operandi because
of the influence of the established scientific method, called the
hypothetico-deductive scientific method. Despite the incompatibilities of AMC
with this scientific method, among some research groups, AMC and DMC cultures
mix intensely. We argue that this mixing has formed a fertile spawning pool for
a mutated culture that we called the hybrid modeling culture (HMC) where
prediction and inference have fused into new procedures where they reinforce
one another. This article identifies key characteristics of HMC, thereby
facilitating the scientific endeavor and fueling the evolution of statistical
cultures towards better practices. By better, we mean increasingly reliable,
valid, and efficient statistical practices in analyzing causal relationships.
In combining inference and prediction, the result of HMC is that the
distinction between prediction and inference, taken to its limit, melts away.
We qualify our melting-away argument by describing three HMC practices, where
each practice captures an aspect of the scientific cycle, namely, ML for causal
inference, ML for data acquisition, and ML for theory prediction.

similar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This
has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the
neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static
framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic
quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a
positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these
problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking
firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,
currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future
bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can
solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several
parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model
of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the
reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in
physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is
more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics. (JEL

due to either an electric current density or a hypothetical magnetic charge
density. Each model leads to a different expression for the system material
hidden momentum and for the electromagnetic momentum density in the medium. We
show that the main results of the cited reference are sustained in the

source side, and the highest scoring subword's score is used to initialize the
decoder as well as the input to the attention mechanism. This method allows
learning which subwords of the input are important for generating the output.
By training the models on the same source but different target, we can compare
what subwords are important for different tasks and how they relate to each
other. We define a similarity metric, a generalized form of the Jaccard
similarity, and assign a similarity score to each pair of the three tasks that
work on the same source but may differ in target. We examine how these three
tasks are related to each other in 12 languages. Our code is publicly
available.

increasing the computational cost. This paper introduces a new lightweight
super-resolution model based on an efficient method for residual feature and
attention aggregation. In order to make an efficient use of the residual
features, these are hierarchically aggregated into feature banks for posterior
usage at the network output. In parallel, a lightweight hierarchical attention
mechanism extracts the most relevant features from the network into attention
banks for improving the final output and preventing the information loss
through the successive operations inside the network. Therefore, the processing
is split into two independent paths of computation that can be simultaneously
carried out, resulting in a highly efficient and effective model for
reconstructing fine details on high-resolution images from their low-resolution
counterparts. Our proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art performance
in several datasets, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory

oscillation of an aircraft wing under the flexural torsion flutter. The paper
introduces the novel multi-agent method for control of an aircraft wing,
assuming that the wing surface consists of controlled 'feathers' (agents).
Theoretical evaluation of the approach demonstrates its high ability to prevent
flexural-torsional vibrations of an aircraft. Our model expands the
possibilities for damping the wing oscillations, which potentially allows an
increase in aircraft speed without misgiving of flutter. The study shows that
the main limitation is the time, during which the system is able to damp
vibrations to a safe level and keep them. The relevance of this indicator is
important because of the rather fast process of increasing wing oscillations
during flutter. In this paper, we suggest a new method for controlling an
aircraft wing, with the use of which it becomes theoretically possible to
increase the maximum flight speed of an aircraft without flutter occurrence. A
mathematical model of the bending-torsional vibrations of an airplane wing with
controlled feathers on its surface is presented. Based on the Speed-Gradient
method a new control laws are synthesized.

efficiency and performance across a variety of tasks, including when faced with
high-dimensional visual observations. These methods learn to predict the
environment dynamics and expected reward from interaction and use this
predictive model to plan and perform the task. However, MBRL methods vary in
their fundamental design choices, and there is no strong consensus in the
literature on how these design decisions affect performance. In this paper, we
study a number of design decisions for the predictive model in visual MBRL
algorithms, focusing specifically on methods that use a predictive model for
planning. We find that a range of design decisions that are often considered
crucial, such as the use of latent spaces, have little effect on task
performance. A big exception to this finding is that predicting future
observations (i.e., images) leads to significant task performance improvement
compared to only predicting rewards. We also empirically find that image
prediction accuracy, somewhat surprisingly, correlates more strongly with
downstream task performance than reward prediction accuracy. We show how this
phenomenon is related to exploration and how some of the lower-scoring models
on standard benchmarks (that require exploration) will perform the same as the
best-performing models when trained on the same training data. Simultaneously,
in the absence of exploration, models that fit the data better usually perform
better on the downstream task as well, but surprisingly, these are often not
the same models that perform the best when learning and exploring from scratch.
These findings suggest that performance and exploration place important and
potentially contradictory requirements on the model.

show that CO2+ and CO+ are the major ions in the inner coma, and close to the

considering various excitation sources, we also studied the emission mechanisms
of different excited states of CO+, CO2+, N2+, and H2O+. We found that the
photon and electron impact ionization and excitation of corresponding neutrals
significantly contribute to the observed ionic emissions for radial distances
smaller than 300 km and at larger distances, solar resonance fluorescence is
the major excitation source. Our modelled ion emission intensity ratios are
consistent with the ground-based observations. Based on the modelled emission

$95\%$ of the energy in the Universe remains a great and unresolved question in
cosmology. Cold dark matter can be made of an ultralight scalar field dominated
by its mass term which interacts only gravitationally. The cosmological
constant introduced to explain the recent acceleration of the Universe
expansion can be easily replaced by a scalar field dominated by its potential.
More generally, scalar fields are ubiquitous in cosmology: inflaton, dilatons,
moduli, quintessence, fuzzy dark matter, dark fluid, etc. are some examples.
One can wonder whether all these scalar fields are independent. The dark fluid
model aims at unifying quintessence and fuzzy dark matter models with a unique
scalar field. One step futher is to unify the dark fluid model with inflation.
In the very early Universe such scalar fields are not strongly constrained by
direct observations, but Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set constraints on scalar
field models which lead to a modification on the abundance of the elements. In
this talk we will present a scalar field model unifying dark matter, dark
energy and inflation, and study constraints from Big-Bang nucleosynthesis on
primordial scalar fields.

We consider in this work the powerful discriminative latent mixture model, and
we extend it to the Bayesian framework. Modeling data as a mixture of Gaussians
in a low-dimensional discriminative subspace, a Gaussian prior distribution is
introduced over the latent group means and a family of twelve submodels are
derived considering different covariance structures. Model inference is done
with a variational EM algorithm, while the discriminative subspace is estimated
via a Fisher-step maximizing an unsupervised Fisher criterion. An empirical
Bayes procedure is proposed for the estimation of the prior hyper-parameters,
and an integrated classification likelihood criterion is derived for selecting
both the number of clusters and the submodel. The performances of the resulting
Bayesian Fisher-EM algorithm are investigated in two thorough simulated
scenarios, regarding both dimensionality as well as noise and assessing its
superiority with respect to state-of-the-art Gaussian subspace clustering
models. In addition to standard real data benchmarks, an application to single

issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based
Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN
architectures that provides a clean slate approach for Internet communication.
NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to
the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects,
Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can
access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server
communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular
content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive
communication and decouple the content from its original location. This
phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content causing different
challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date,
considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In
this paper, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms
in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first
summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to
content-based security and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and
security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two
main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each
category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g.,
Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC, etc). Finally, we present
the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges

Accepted by JCAP","JCAP 05 (2021) 069","10.1088/1475-7516/2021/05/069",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Halo occupation distribution (HOD) models describe the number of galaxies
that reside in different haloes, and are widely used in galaxy-halo connection
studies using the halo model (HM). Here, we introduce and study HOD response
functions $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ that describe the response of the HODs to
long-wavelength perturbations $\mathcal{O}$. The linear galaxy bias parameters
$b_\mathcal{O}^g$ are a weighted version of $b_\mathcal{O}^h +
R_\mathcal{O}^g$, where $b_\mathcal{O}^h$ is the halo bias, but the
contribution from $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ is routinely ignored in the literature. We
investigate the impact of this by measuring the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ in separate
universe simulations of the IllustrisTNG model for three types of
perturbations: total matter perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\delta_m$; baryon-CDM
compensated isocurvature perturbations, $\mathcal{O}=\sigma$; and potential
perturbations with local primordial non-Gaussianity, $\mathcal{O}\propto f_{\rm
NL}\phi$. Our main takeaway message is that the $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ are not
negligible in general and their size should be estimated on a case-by-case
basis. For stellar-mass selected galaxies, the responses $R_\phi^g$ and
$R_\sigma^g$ are sizeable and cannot be neglected in HM calculations of the
bias parameters $b_\phi^g$ and $b_\sigma^g$; this is relevant to constrain
inflation using galaxies. On the other hand, we do not detect a strong impact
of the HOD response $R_1^g$ on the linear galaxy bias $b_1^g$. These results
can be explained by the impact that the perturbations have on
stellar-to-total-mass relations. We also look into the impact on the bias of
the gas distribution and find similar conclusions. We show that a single extra
parameter describing the overall amplitude of $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ recovers the
measured $b_\mathcal{O}^g$ well, which indicates that $R_\mathcal{O}^g$ can be
easily added to HM/HOD studies as a new ingredient.

Text-Caption tasks. These two tasks aim at reading and understanding scene text
in images for question answering and image caption generation, respectively. In
contrast to the conventional vision-language pre-training that fails to capture
scene text and its relationship with the visual and text modalities, TAP
explicitly incorporates scene text (generated from OCR engines) in
pre-training. With three pre-training tasks, including masked language modeling
(MLM), image-text (contrastive) matching (ITM), and relative (spatial) position
prediction (RPP), TAP effectively helps the model learn a better aligned
representation among the three modalities: text word, visual object, and scene
text. Due to this aligned representation learning, even pre-trained on the same
downstream task dataset, TAP already boosts the absolute accuracy on the
TextVQA dataset by +5.4%, compared with a non-TAP baseline. To further improve
the performance, we build a large-scale dataset based on the Conceptual Caption
dataset, named OCR-CC, which contains 1.4 million scene text-related image-text
pairs. Pre-trained on this OCR-CC dataset, our approach outperforms the state
of the art by large margins on multiple tasks, i.e., +8.3% accuracy on TextVQA,
+8.6% accuracy on ST-VQA, and +10.2 CIDEr score on TextCaps.

low-frequency bursts detected from active M-dwarfs are expected to probe their

radio emission, reveal conditions within their atmospheres. However, to date,
only one candidate solar-like coherent radio burst has been identified from
these stars, preventing robust observational constraints on their space weather
environment. During simultaneous optical and radio monitoring of the nearby
dM5.5e star Proxima Centauri, we detected a bright, long-duration optical
flare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts. These
detections include the first example of an interferometrically detected
coherent stellar radio burst temporally coincident with a flare, strongly
indicating a causal relationship between these transient events. The
polarization and temporal structure of the trailing long-duration burst enable
us to identify it as a type IV burst. This represents the most compelling
detection of a solar-like radio burst from another star to date. Solar type IV
bursts are strongly associated with space weather events such as coronal mass

Despite its impressive performance, a more thorough understanding of the
advantages inside the box is still highly demanded to help reduce the
significant computation and parameter overhead introduced by this novel
structure. In this paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this spatially-adaptive

semantic-awareness rather than spatial-adaptiveness, especially for
high-resolution input masks. Inspired by this observation, we propose
class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight but equally-effective

spatial-adaptiveness, we introduce intra-class positional map encoding
calculated from semantic layouts to modulate the normalization parameters of
CLADE and propose a truly spatially-adaptive variant of CLADE, namely
CLADE-ICPE.Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets, we
demonstrate that the proposed CLADE can be generalized to different SPADE-based

a ""type-0"" two Higgs doublet model, with a $Z_4$ symmetry, for which ${\cal

new Higgs states necessarily comparable to or lighter than the weak scale, with
no wiggle room to decouple them whatsoever. Surprisingly, this model is not yet
entirely excluded by collider searches, and will be incisively probed by the
high-luminosity run of the LHC, as well as future Higgs factories. We also

the leading order hydrodynamic sound mode is always given by the leading-order

indicate the presence of a Keplerian, rotationally supported, circumstellar gas
disc. Current disc models, referred to as ""decretion discs"", make use of the
zero torque inner boundary condition typically applied to accretion discs, with
the 'decretion' modelled by adding mass to the disc at a radius of about two
per cent larger than the inner disc boundary. We point out that, in this model,
the rates at which mass and energy need to be added to the disc are implausibly
large. What is required is that the disc has not only a source of mass but also
a continuing source of angular momentum. We argue that the disc evolution may
be more physically modelled by application of the non-zero torque inner
boundary condition of Nixon & Pringle (2020), which determines the torque
applied at the boundary as a fraction of the advected angular momentum flux
there and approaches the accretion and decretion disc cases in the appropriate
limits. We provide supporting arguments for the suggestion that the origin of
the disc material is small-scale magnetic flaring events on the stellar
surface, which, when combined with rapid rotation, can provide sufficient mass
to form, and sufficient angular momentum to maintain, a Keplerian Be star disc.
We discuss the origin of such small-scale magnetic fields in radiative stars
with differential rotation. We conclude that small-scale magnetic fields on the
stellar surface, may be able to provide the necessary mass flux and the
necessary time-dependent torque on the disc inner regions to drive the observed
disc evolution.

misalignment found in galaxies, but there still is a lack of understanding of
the contribution from each formation channel candidate. We aim to answer the
question by investigating the misaligned galaxies in Horizon-AGN, a
cosmological large-volume simulation of galaxy formation. There are 27,903
galaxies of stellar mass $M_* > 10^{10} M_\odot$ in our sample, of which 5,984
are in a group of the halo mass of $M_{200} > 10^{12} M_\odot$. We have
identified four main formation channels of misalignment and quantified their
level of contribution: mergers (35%), interaction with nearby galaxies (23%),
interaction with dense environments or their central galaxies (21%), and
secular evolution including smooth accretion from neighboring filaments (21%).
We found in the simulation that the gas, rather than stars, is typically more
vulnerable to dynamical disturbances; hence, misalignment formation is mainly
due to the change in the rotational axis of the gas rather than stars,
regardless of the origin. We have also inspected the lifetime (duration) of the
misalignment. The decay timescale of the misalignment shows a strong
anti-correlation with the kinematic morphology ($V/{\sigma}$) and the cold gas
fraction of the galaxy. The misalignment has a longer lifetime in denser
regions, which is linked with the environmental impact on the host galaxy.
There is a substantial difference in the length of the misalignment lifetime
depending on the origin, and it can be explained by the magnitude of the
initial position angle offset and the physical properties of the galaxies.

similar rate as the spins, they can induce qualitatively distinct frustrated

substantially influence the nuclear regions of disc galaxies. In this study we
explore the structure and dynamics of inner bars by deriving maps and radial
profiles of their mean stellar population content and comparing them to
previous findings in the context of main bars. To this end, we exploit
observations obtained with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE of three
double-barred galaxies in the TIMER sample. The results indicate that inner
bars can be distinguished based on their stellar population properties alone.
More precisely, inner bars show elevated metallicities and depleted
[$\alpha$/Fe] abundances. Although they exhibit slightly younger stellar ages
compared to the nuclear disc, the typical age differences are small, except at
their outer ends. These ends of the inner bars are clearly younger compared to
their inner parts, an effect known from main bars as orbital age separation. In
particular, the youngest stars (i.e. those with the lowest radial velocity
dispersion) seem to occupy the most elongated orbits along the (inner) bar
major axis. We speculate that these distinct ends of bars could be connected to
the morphological feature of ansae. Radial profiles of metallicity and
[$\alpha$/Fe] enhancements are flat along the inner bar major axis, but show
significantly steeper slopes along the minor axis. This radial mixing in the
inner bar is also known from main bars and indicates that inner bars
significantly affect the radial distribution of stars. In summary, based on
maps and radial profiles of the mean stellar population content and in line
with previous TIMER results, inner bars appear to be scaled down versions of
the main bars seen in galaxies. This suggests the picture of a ""galaxy within a
galaxy"", with inner bars in nuclear discs being dynamically equivalent to main
bars in main galaxy discs.

stars. The physics of the inner crust is largely dependent on that of its
$S$-wave neutron superfluid which has made its presence known through pulsar
glitches and modifications on the neutron star cooling. Moreover, with recent
gravitational-wave observations of neutron star mergers, the need for an
equation of state for the matter of these compact stars is further accentuated
and a model-independent treatment of neutron superfluidity is important.
\textit{Ab initio} techniques developed for finite systems can be guided to
perform extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit and attain this
model-independent extraction of various quantities of infinite superfluid
neutron matter. To inform such an extrapolation scheme, we performed
calculations of the neutron $^1S_0$ pairing gap using the model-independent
odd-even staggering in the context of the particle-conserving, projected BCS
theory under twisted boundary conditions. While the practice of twisted
boundary conditions is standard in solid state physics and has been used
repeatedly in the past to reduce finite-size effects, this is the first time it
is employed in the context of pairing. We find that a twist-averaging approach
results in a substantial reduction of the finite-size effects, bringing systems
with $N\gtrapprox 50$ within a $2\%$ error margin from the infinite system.
This can significantly reduce extrapolation-related errors in the extraction of

huge numbers of strong gravitational lens systems, much effort is being
invested into developing automated procedures for handling the data. The
several orders of magnitude increase in the number of strong galaxy-galaxy lens
systems is an insurmountable challenge for traditional modelling techniques.
Whilst machine learning techniques have dramatically improved the efficiency of
lens modelling, parametric modelling of the lens mass profile remains an
important tool for dealing with complex lensing systems. In particular, source
reconstruction methods are necessary to cope with the irregular structure of
high-redshift sources. In this paper, we consider a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) that analyses the outputs of semi-analytic methods which
parametrically model the lens mass and linearly reconstruct the source surface
brightness distribution. We show the unphysical source reconstructions that
arise as a result of incorrectly initialised lens models can be effectively
caught by our CNN. Furthermore, the CNN predictions can be used to
automatically re-initialise the parametric lens model, avoiding unphysical
source reconstructions. The CNN, trained on reconstructions of lensed S\'ersic
sources, accurately classifies source reconstructions of the same type with a
precision $P > 0.99$ and recall $R > 0.99$. The same CNN, without re-training,
achieves $P=0.89$ and $R=0.89$ when classifying source reconstructions of more
complex lensed HUDF sources. Using the CNN predictions to re-initialise the
lens modelling procedure, we achieve a 69 per cent decrease in the occurrence
of unphysical source reconstructions. This combined CNN and parametric

include projective measurements, have been shown to exhibit rich quantum
critical behavior. There are many complementary perspectives on this behavior.
For example, there is a known correspondence between d-dimensional local
non-unitary quantum circuits and tensor networks on a D=(d+1)-dimensional
lattice. Here, we show that in the case of systems of non-interacting fermions,
there is furthermore a full correspondence between non-unitary circuits in d
spatial dimensions and unitary non-interacting fermion problems with static
Hermitian Hamiltonians in D=(d+1) spatial dimensions. This provides a powerful
new perspective for understanding entanglement phases and critical behavior
exhibited by non-interacting circuits. Classifying the symmetries of the
corresponding non-interacting Hamiltonian, we show that a large class of random
circuits, including the most generic circuits with randomness in space and
time, are in correspondence with Hamiltonians with static spatial disorder in
the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We find the criticality that is
known to occur in all of these classes to be the origin of the critical
entanglement properties of the corresponding random non-unitary circuit. To
exemplify this, we numerically study the quantum states at the boundary of
Haar-random Gaussian fermionic tensor networks of dimension D=2 and D=3. We
show that the most general such tensor network ensemble corresponds to a
unitary problem of non-interacting fermions with static disorder in
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class DIII, which for both D=2 and D=3 is known to
exhibit a stable critical metallic phase. Tensor networks and corresponding
random non-unitary circuits in the other nine Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry
classes can be obtained from the DIII case by implementing Clifford algebra
extensions for classifying spaces.

properties, i.e. the narrow pulse profile, the high pulsed fraction of 80-90%
and its dependence on the energy, can be better reproduced using a magnetized
atmosphere model instead of a simply blackbody. With a maximum likelihood
analysis in the energy-phase space, we inferred that the pulsar has, in
correspondence of one magnetic pole, a hot spot of temperature T~1 MK and
colatitude extension {\theta}~20{\deg}. For the pulsar distance of 1.5 kpc,
this corresponds to a cap of R~5-6 km, greater than the standard dimension of
the dipolar polar caps. The large pulsed fraction further argues against
emission from the entire star surface, as it would be expected in the case of
secular cooling. An unpulsed (<40% pulsed fraction), non-thermal component,
probably originating in a wind nebula, is also detected. The pulsar geometry
derived with our spectral fits in the X-ray is relatively well constrained

We find that because of the inability to separate degrees of freedom by spatial
location when defining the radiation region, the entanglement entropy of
radiation emitted into the bath is a time-independent constant, consistent with
recent work on black hole information in asymptotically flat space. If we
instead consider an entanglement entropy between two sectors of a specific
division of the Hilbert space, we then find non-trivial time-dependence, with
the Page time a monotonically decreasing function of the brane angle --
provided both branes are below a particular angle. However, the properties of
the entropy depend discontinuously on this angle, which is the first example of
such discontinuous behavior for an AdS brane in AdS space.

\ h \ {\rm Mpc} ^{-1}$ yields a dark energy Figure of Merit (FOM) of 1018. This
is comparable to taking a weak lensing cut at $\ell = 5000$ and a galaxy
clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cut at $\ell = 3000$ in a traditional $3
\times 2$ point analysis. We also find that the fraction of the observed
galaxies used in the photometric clustering part of the analysis is one of the
main drivers of the FOM. Removing $50 \% \ (90 \%)$ of the clustering galaxies
decreases the FOM by $19 \% \ (62 \%)$. Given that the FOM depends so heavily
on the fraction of galaxies used in the clustering analysis, extensive efforts
should be made to handle the real-world systematics present when extending the
analysis beyond the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample.

$\Sigma_{\rm H2}<12-25$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for the Slug nebula and
$\Sigma_{\rm H2}<34-68$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for the Jackpot nebula. These are
consistent with the expected molecular gas surface densities, as predicted via

circumstellar discs appear in a variety of shapes with diverse substructures
being ubiquitous. This has given rise to the question of whether these
substructures are triggered by planet-disc interactions. Besides direct
imaging, one of the most promising methods to distinguish between different
disc shaping mechanisms is to study the kinematics of the gas disc. In
particular, the deviations of the rotation profile from Keplerian velocity can
be used to probe perturbations in the gas pressure profile that may be caused
by embedded planets. In this paper we aim to analyze the gas brightness
temperature and kinematics of the transitional disc around the CQ Tau star in
order to resolve and characterize substructure in the gas, caused by possible
perturbers. For our analysis we use spatially resolved ALMA observations of
12CO, 13CO and C18O (J=2-1). We further extract robust line centroids for each
channel map and fit a number of Keplerian disc models to the velocity field.
The gas kinematics of the CQ Tau disc present non-Keplerian features, showing
bent and twisted iso-velocity curves in 12CO and 13CO. Significant spiral
structures are detected between 10-180 au in both the brightness temperature
and the rotation velocity of 12CO after subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric
model, which may be tracing planet-disc interactions with an embedded planet or
low-mass companion. We identify three spirals, two in the brightness
temperature and one in the velocity residuals, spanning a large azimuth and
radial extent. The brightness temperature spirals are morphologically connected
to spirals observed in NIR scattered light in the same disc, indicating a
common origin. Together with the observed large dust and gas cavity, the
spirals support the hypothesis of a massive embedded companion in the CQ Tau
disc.

play a major role in the fit, and NLO EW corrections where relevant. We find
that these updates have an important impact on the PDFs, and for the first time
the NNLO fit is strongly favoured over the NLO, reflecting the wider range and
in particular increased precision of data included in the fit. There are some
changes to central values and a significant reduction in the uncertainties of
the PDFs in many, though not all, cases. Nonetheless, the PDFs and the
resulting predictions are generally within one standard deviation of the MMHT14

due to the improved parameterisation and new precise data, the $\bar d, \bar u$

strange quark PDF due to the effect of LHC $W,Z$ data and inclusion of new NNLO

AllWISE. By computing periodograms of all these sources, we identify ~56,000
periodic variables. Of these, ~42,000 are short-period (P<1 day), near-contact
or contact eclipsing binaries, many of which are on the main sequence. We use
the periodic and aperiodic variables to test computationally inexpensive
methods of periodic variable classification and identification, utilizing
various measures of the probability distribution function of fluxes and of
timescales of variability. The combination of variability measures from our
periodogram and non-parametric analyses with infrared colors from WISE and
absolute magnitudes, colors and variability amplitude from Gaia is useful for
the identification and classification of periodic variables. Furthermore, we
show that the effectiveness of non-parametric methods for the identification of
periodic variables is comparable to that of the periodogram but at a much lower
computational cost. Future surveys can utilize these methods to accelerate more
traditional time-series analyses and to identify evolving sources missed by
periodogram-based selections.

emission seen in the general population. Why these systems are uniquely visible
in Ly$\alpha$ at redshifts where the IGM is likely significantly neutral is not
clear. With the goal of better understanding these results, we have begun a
campaign with MMT and Magellan to measure Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies with similar
[OIII]+H$\beta$ EWs at $z\simeq2-3$. At these redshifts, the IGM is highly
ionized, allowing us to clearly disentangle how the Ly$\alpha$ properties
depend on the [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW. Here we present Ly$\alpha$ EWs of $49$
galaxies at $z=2.2-3.7$ with intense [OIII]+H$\beta$ line emission (EW

$>20$ \r{A}) becomes more common in galaxies with larger [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW,
reflecting a combination of increasingly efficient ionizing photon production

of Ly$\alpha$ strengths is related to the observed ellipticity, with those
systems that appear edge-on or elongated having weaker Ly$\alpha$ emission. We
use these results to interpret the anomalous Ly$\alpha$ properties seen in

accomplished by combining the anatomical structure and the semantic

segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh
model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation
mask (i.e., mask-to-mesh). A new graph-based residual convolutional network
(Graph-ResNet), whose nodes fuse the information of the mesh model and feature
vectors extracted from the segmentation network, is developed to produce the
patient-level differential classification results. Extensive experiments on 661
patients' CT scans (five phases per patient) show that SMCN can improve the
mass segmentation and detection accuracy compared to the strong baseline method
nnUNet (e.g., for nonPDAC, Dice: 0.611 vs. 0.478; detection rate: 89% vs. 70%),
achieve similar sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PDAC and nonPDAC

difference is ascribed to uncertainty in the spin temperature \Tsp\ = 100 K
that is often used to convert 21cm HI HI absorption to N(HI). Here we propose
another way to infer the gas column from HI absorption. In our Galaxy there is
a nearly linear correlation between the inteferometrically-measured integrated
21cm HI absorption \WHI\ and reddening, \WHI\ $\propto$ \EBV$^{1.10}$ for \WHI\
$\ga 0.7$ \kms\ or \EBV\ $\ga 0.04$ mag. Scaling \EBV\ then provides the total
gas column density N(H) from the same dust column that is responsible for
optical obscuration and X-ray absorption, without calculating N(HI). Values of
N(H) so derived typically exceed N(HI) by a factor 4 because the ubiquitous
Galactic 21cm HI HI absorption samples only a portion of the interstellar gas.
If the well-studied case of Hydra-A is a guide, even very large disparities in
X-ray and 21cm HI gas column densities can be explained by resolving the core

correction of the CME speed assuming radial propagation from the flare site.
Our method is uniquely capable to produce physically reasonable deprojected

the deprojected speed estimates via limits in the true angular width of a CME
based on multiview-point observations. Our corrections range up to 1.37-2.86
for CMEs originating from the center of the disk. On average, the deprojected

the full ice-cream cone model performs better while for fast and very fast CMEs
(VPOS > 700 km/s) the shallow ice-cream model gives much better results. CMEs
with 691-878 km/s POS speeds have a minimum ToA mean absolute error (MAE) of

3D vision, as the order-invariant point cloud structure still presents
challenges to the design of neural network architectures. Recent works explored
learning either global or local features or both for point clouds, however none
of the earlier methods focused on capturing contextual shape information by
analysing local orientation distribution of points. In this paper, we leverage
on point orientation distributions around a point in order to obtain an
expressive local neighborhood representation for point clouds. We achieve this
by dividing the spherical neighborhood of a given point into predefined cone
volumes, and statistics inside each volume are used as point features. In this
way, a local patch can be represented by not only the selected point's nearest
neighbors, but also considering a point density distribution defined along
multiple orientations around the point. We are then able to construct an
orientation distribution function (ODF) neural network that involves an
ODFBlock which relies on mlp (multi-layer perceptron) layers. The new ODFNet
model achieves state-of the-art accuracy for object classification on
ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, and segmentation on ShapeNet S3DIS

coronagraphic optical elements. We measure a statistically significant
$31.8\pm7.0$ mas eastward motion of the planet between the two most

varying different peak features, such as the shape and compactness as well as
the tidal field surrounding the peak. We find that initial density peaks with
high compactness and low tidal field induce the most rapid BH growth at early

matter distribution lead to the formation of high density gas clumps in the
centers of halos, and thus boost early BH accretion. Moreover, such initially
compact density peaks in low tidal field regions also lead to a more compact BH
host galaxy morphology. This can explain the tight correlation between BH
growth and host galaxy compactness seen in observations.

for a traction control system and for a yaw stability control system has to be
through the electric motor used for traction. The regenerative braking
capability of fully electric vehicles has to be taken into account in designing
braking controllers like ABS and yaw stability control through differential
braking. Fully electric vehicles are usually lighter vehicles with different
dynamic characteristics than that of their predecessors using internal
combustion engines. As such, their yaw stability control systems have to be
re-designed and tested. This paper reports the initial results of ongoing work
on yaw stability controller design for a fully electric vehicle. Two different
implementations on a research prototype fully electric light commercial vehicle
are considered. The first implementation uses the production yaw stability
control system in the internal combustion engine powered conventional vehicle.
The drive torque change commands from the production ECU are read, modified and
sent to the electric motor driver in trying to mimic the conventional vehicle.
The differential braking commands are the same as in the conventional vehicle.
In the second implementation, a generic yaw stability control system that
calculates and issues its own drive torque change commands and differential
braking commands is designed and implemented. Offline simulations on a
validated model and a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system are used in
designing the yaw stability control system.

a very dense RFP packing scheme where any point in a field is typically
accessible to three or more robots. This design provides flexibility in target
assignment. However, the task of collision-less trajectory planning is
especially challenging. We present two multi-agent distributed control
strategies that are highly efficient and computationally inexpensive for
determining collision-free paths for RFPs in heavily overlapping workspaces. We
demonstrate that a reconfiguration path between two arbitrary robot
configurations can be efficiently found if ""folded"" state, in which all robot
arms are retracted and aligned in a lattice-like orientation, is inserted
between the initial and final states. Although developed for SDSS-V, the
approach we describe is generic and so applicable to a wide range of RFP

one of the key challenges in building a theoretical foundation for deep
learning. A central obstacle is that the motion of a network in
high-dimensional parameter space undergoes discrete finite steps along complex
stochastic gradients derived from real-world datasets. We circumvent this
obstacle through a unifying theoretical framework based on intrinsic symmetries
embedded in a network's architecture that are present for any dataset. We show
that any such symmetry imposes stringent geometric constraints on gradients and
Hessians, leading to an associated conservation law in the continuous-time
limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), akin to Noether's theorem in
physics. We further show that finite learning rates used in practice can
actually break these symmetry induced conservation laws. We apply tools from
finite difference methods to derive modified gradient flow, a differential
equation that better approximates the numerical trajectory taken by SGD at
finite learning rates. We combine modified gradient flow with our framework of
symmetries to derive exact integral expressions for the dynamics of certain
parameter combinations. We empirically validate our analytic expressions for
learning dynamics on VGG-16 trained on Tiny ImageNet. Overall, by exploiting
symmetry, our work demonstrates that we can analytically describe the learning
dynamics of various parameter combinations at finite learning rates and batch
sizes for state of the art architectures trained on any dataset.

shared by neuroscience and machine learning. It is therefore exciting that both
fields converge not only on shared questions but also on similar approaches. A
pressing question in these areas is understanding how the structure of the
representation used by neural networks affects both their generalization, and
robustness to perturbations. In this work, we investigate the latter by
juxtaposing experimental results regarding the covariance spectrum of neural
representations in the mouse V1 (Stringer et al) with artificial neural
networks. We use adversarial robustness to probe Stringer et al's theory
regarding the causal role of a 1/n covariance spectrum. We empirically
investigate the benefits such a neural code confers in neural networks, and
illuminate its role in multi-layer architectures. Our results show that
imposing the experimentally observed structure on artificial neural networks
makes them more robust to adversarial attacks. Moreover, our findings
complement the existing theory relating wide neural networks to kernel methods,
by showing the role of intermediate representations.

applications due to its mechanical and optical properties (transparency,
dielectric, etc.), has become common in recent years. However, glass, a brittle
material, has its vulnerability to fracture. Processes such as heat treatment
(heat tempering) or chemical strengthening through ion-exchange have been used
to create residual stress profiles on the glass, in a bid to improve its
fracture strength. However, failure still occurs, which is mostly catastrophic
and expensive to repair. Therefore understanding, predicting, and eventually
improving the resistance to damage or fracture of chemically strengthened glass
is important to designing new glasses that would be tougher while retaining
their transparency. The relationship between the glass residual stress
parameters such as the compressive stress (CS), depth of compression layer
(DOL), and central tension (CT) versus apparent (effective) fracture toughness
for different crack depth was investigated in this study using a Silicon
Carbide particle blast plus ring-on-ring (RoR) test method. The results also
showed that improving the fracture resistance of glass via chemical
strengthening requires a proper combination of CS, DOL, and CT, which is
particularly dependent on the initial/existing crack (flaw) depth. It was
determined that for a damage event involving the introduction of a shallow
crack depth, the criterion for optimal resistance to fracture, in terms of
apparent fracture toughness, is weighted more towards a high CS, than deep DOL
while for a deep flaw damage event, it is more weighted towards deep DOL, than
a high CS. These results provide a valuable piece of information in the design
of a more robust glass in engineering applications.

astronomically-forced climatic variation over Mars' recent orbital history.
Retracing the formation of these layers by quantifying the sensitivity of
deposition rates of polar material to astronomical forcing is critical for the
interpretation of this record. Using a Mars global climate model (GCM), we
investigate the sensitivity of annual polar water ice and dust surface
deposition to various obliquities and surface water ice distributions at zero
eccentricity, providing a reasonable characterization of the evolution of the
PLD during recent low-eccentricity epochs. For obliquities between 15{\deg} -
35{\deg}, predicted net annual accumulation rates range from -1 to +14 mm/yr
for water ice and from +0.003 to +0.3 mm/yr for dust. GCM-derived rates are
ingested into an integration model that simulates polar accumulation of water
ice and dust over 5 consecutive obliquity cycles (~700 kyrs) during a low
eccentricity epoch. A subset of integration simulations predict combined
accumulation of water ice and dust in the north at time averaged rates that are
near the observationally-inferred value of 0.5 mm/yr. Three types of layers are
produced per obliquity cycle: a ~30 m-thick dust-rich (~25% dust VMR) layer
forms at high obliquity, a ~0.5 m-thick dust lag forms at low obliquity, and
two ~10 m-thick dust-poor (~3%) layers form when obliquity is
increasing/decreasing. The ~30 m-thick dust-rich layer is reminiscent of a ~30
m feature derived from visible imagery analysis the north PLD, while the ~0.5
m-thick dust lag is a factor of ~2 smaller than observed ""thin layers"".
Overall, this investigation provides further evidence for obliquity forcing in
the PLD climate record, and demonstrates the importance of ice-on-dust
nucleation in polar depositional processes.

concerns, with attackers usually employing complex hacking techniques to expose
their structures. Data poisoning-enabled perturbation attacks are complex
adversarial ones that inject false data into models. They negatively impact the
learning process, with no benefit to deeper networks, as they degrade a model's
accuracy and convergence rates. In this paper, we propose an
attack-agnostic-based defense method for mitigating their influence. In it, a
Defensive Feature Layer (DFL) is integrated with a well-known DNN architecture
which assists in neutralizing the effects of illegitimate perturbation samples
in the feature space. To boost the robustness and trustworthiness of this
method for correctly classifying attacked input samples, we regularize the
hidden space of a trained model with a discriminative loss function called
Polarized Contrastive Loss (PCL). It improves discrimination among samples in
different classes and maintains the resemblance of those in the same class.
Also, we integrate a DFL and PCL in a compact model for defending against data
poisoning attacks. This method is trained and tested using the CIFAR-10 and
MNIST datasets with data poisoning-enabled perturbation attacks, with the
experimental results revealing its excellent performance compared with those of
recent peer techniques.

environments used to study open-endedness, Minecraft allows the construction of
almost any kind of structure, including actuated machines with circuits and

Minecraft creations through both interactive and automated evolution. While
evolution succeeds when tasked to grow a structure towards a specific target,
it is unable to find a solution when rewarded for creating a simple machine
that moves. Thus, EvoCraft offers a challenging new environment for automated

sensitivity, frequency selectivity, and temporal resolution to external
signals. These specialized cells utilize an internal active amplifier to
achieve highly sensitive mechanical detection. One of the manifestations of
this active process is the occurrence of spontaneous limit-cycle motion of the
hair cell bundle. As hair bundles under in vivo conditions are typically
coupled to each other by overlying structures, we explore the role of this
coupling on the dynamics of the system, using a combination of theoretical and
experimental approaches. Our numerical model suggests that the presence of
chaotic dynamics in the response of individual bundles enhances their ability
to synchronize when coupled, resulting in significant improvement in the
system's ability to detect weak signals. This synchronization persists even for
a large frequency dispersion and a large number of oscillators comprising the
system. Further, the amplitude and coherence of the active motion is not
reduced upon increasing the number of oscillators. Using artificial membranes,
we impose mechanical coupling on groups of live and functional hair bundles,
selected from in vitro preparations of the sensory epithelium, allowing us to
explore the role of coupling experimentally. Consistent with the numerical
simulations of the chaotic system, synchronization occurs even for large
frequency dispersion and a large number of hair cells. Further, the amplitude
and coherence of the spontaneous oscillations are independent of the number of
hair cells in the network. We therefore propose that hair cells utilize their
chaotic dynamics to stabilize the synchronized state and avoid the amplitude
death regime, resulting in collective coherent motion that could play a role in
generating spontaneous otoacoustic emissions and an enhanced ability to detect
weak signals.

best decision whose probability of violating the uncertainty constraints is
within the prespecified risk level. As a CCP is often nonconvex and is
difficult to solve to optimality, much effort has been devoted to developing
convex inner approximations for a CCP, among which the conditional
value-at-risk (CVaR) has been known to be the best for more than a decade. This
paper studies and generalizes the ALSO-X, originally proposed by Ahmed,
Luedtke, SOng, and Xie (2017), for solving a CCP. We first show that the ALSO-X
resembles a bilevel optimization, where the upper-level problem is to find the
best objective function value and enforce the feasibility of a CCP for a given
decision from the lower-level problem, and the lower-level problem is to
minimize the expectation of constraint violations subject to the upper bound of
the objective function value provided by the upper-level problem. This
interpretation motivates us to prove that when uncertain constraints are convex
in the decision variables, ALSO-X always outperforms the CVaR approximation. We
further show (i) sufficient conditions under which ALSO-X can recover an
optimal solution to a CCP; (ii) an equivalent bilinear programming formulation
of a CCP, inspiring us to enhance ALSO-X with a convergent alternating
minimization method (ALSO-X+); (iii) extensions of ALSO-X and ALSO-X+ to solve
distributionally robust chance constrained programs (DRCCPs) under

healthcare through many applications, from data augmentation for training
machine learning systems to preserving patient privacy. Conditional Adversarial
Generative Networks (cGANs) use a conditioning factor to generate images and
have shown great success in recent years. Intuitively, the information in an
image can be divided into two parts: 1) content which is presented through the
conditioning vector and 2) style which is the undiscovered information missing
from the conditioning vector. Current practices in using cGANs for medical
image generation, only use a single variable for image generation (i.e.,
content) and therefore, do not provide much flexibility nor control over the
generated image. In this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image
itself, disentangled representations of style and content, and use this
information to impose control over the generation process. In this framework,
style is learned in a fully unsupervised manner, while content is learned
through both supervised learning (using the conditioning vector) and
unsupervised learning (with the inference mechanism). We undergo two novel
regularization steps to ensure content-style disentanglement. First, we
minimize the shared information between content and style by introducing a
novel application of the gradient reverse layer (GRL); second, we introduce a
self-supervised regularization method to further separate information in the
content and style variables. We show that in general, two latent variable
models achieve better performance and give more control over the generated
image. We also show that our proposed model (DRAI) achieves the best
disentanglement score and has the best overall performance.

Observations consist of quaternions, 4-dimensional unit vectors reflecting both

known crystal symmetries as well as satisfy the unit length constraint. A
popular method for estimating ODFs non-parametrically is symmetrized kernel
density estimation. However, disadvantages of this approach include difficulty
in interpreting results quantitatively, as well as in quantifying uncertainty
in the ODF. We propose to use a mixture of symmetric Bingham distributions as a
flexible parametric ODF model, inferring the number of mixture components, the
mixture weights, and scale and location parameters based on crystal orientation
data. Furthermore, our Bayesian approach allows for structured uncertainty

defining an `offset' from the average relations, we compute a Delta_rSK,
Delta_rSFMS, Delta_rMGMS for each galaxy, to investigate correlations with
global properties. We find the following correlations with at least 2 sigma
significance: the rSK is lower (i.e. lower star formation efficiency) in
galaxies with higher M_*, larger Sersic index and lower specific SFR (sSFR);
the rSFMS is lower (i.e. lower sSFR) in galaxies with higher M_* and larger
Sersic index; the rMGMS is lower (i.e. lower gas fraction) in galaxies with
lower sSFR. In the ensemble of all 15,000 data points, the rSK relation and
rMGMS show equally tight scatters and strong correlation coefficients, compared
with a larger scatter and weaker correlation in the rSFMS. Moreover, whilst
there is no correlation between Delta_rSK and Delta_rMGMS in the sample, the
offset of a galaxy's rSFMS does correlate with both of the other two offsets.
Our results therefore indicate that the rSK and rMGMS are independent
relations, whereas the rSFMS is a result of their combination.

the rMGMS of star-forming and retired spaxels on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis for
eight individual ALMaQUEST galaxies. Six of these galaxies have their retired
spaxels concentrated within the central few kpc. Molecular gas is detected in
40-100% of retired spaxels in the eight galaxies in our sample. Both the
star-forming and retired rMGMS show a diversity in normalization from
galaxy-to-galaxy. However, in any given galaxy, the rMGMS for retired regions
is found to be distinct from the star-forming sequence and gas fractions of
retired spaxels are up to an order of magnitude lower than the star-forming

absence) of molecular gas via a mechanism that typically begins in the centre

recent study has proposed a charging infrastructure planning tool to support
intercity trips for the estimated EV market share (6 percent) in Michigan for
2030. The main goal of this study is to estimate the emission reduction
associated with this electrification rate and infrastructure investment for
light duty vehicles. To this end, a state-of-the-art emission estimation
framework is proposed to be applied to the state-wide intercity travels. The
main contributions of the proposed framework includes: 1) Incorporating a micro
emission estimation model for simulated vehicle trajectories of the intercity
network of Michigan, 2) Adjusting the micro emission model results considering
impacts of monthly travel demand and temperature variations, and heterogeneity
of vehicles based on their make, model, and age. The emission estimation
framework is then compared with the traditional VMT analysis method as a
benchmark. Finally, five different scenarios are explored for EV adoption to
assess potential emission savings from the given electrification rate for each
scenario. The results suggest an annual CO2 emission savings of 0.58-0.92
million-ton. The CO2 social cost savings may justify the investment on the
network electrification. Note that only 3.7 to 8.6 percent of the total EV
energy requirements must be provided via the DC fast charger network proposed
by the charging infrastructure planning tool. This requires annual energy
consumption of 22.15 to 51.76 BWh for the estimated EV market share in Michigan

Due to mobility, lack of global-knowledge and limited communication resources,
designing an optimal BSM broadcast rate-control protocol is challenging.
Recently, minimizing Age of Information (AoI) has gained momentum in designing
BSM broadcast rate-control protocols. In this paper, we show that minimizing
AoI solely does not always improve the safety of V2V networks. Specifically, we
propose a novel metric, termed Trackability-aware Age of Information TAoI, that
in addition to AoI, takes into account the self risk assessment of vehicles,
quantified in terms of self tracking error (self-TE) -- which provides an
indication of collision risk posed by the vehicle. Self-TE is defined as the
difference between the actual location of a certain vehicle and its
self-estimated location. Our extensive experiments, based on realistic SUMO

human travel behavior using such new data sources, limited research has been
done to extract multimodal travel demand patterns out of them. This paper
presents a data-driven analytical framework to bridge the gap. To be able to
successfully detect travel modes using the passively collected location
information, we conduct a smartphone-based GPS survey to collect ground truth
observations. Then a jointly trained single-layer model and deep neural network
for travel mode imputation is developed. Being ""wide"" and ""deep"" at the same
time, this model combines the advantages of both types of models. The framework
also incorporates the multimodal transportation network in order to evaluate
the closeness of trip routes to the nearby rail, metro, highway and bus lines
and therefore enhance the imputation accuracy. To showcase the applications of
the introduced framework in answering real-world planning needs, a separate
mobile device location data is processed through trip end identification and
attribute generation, in a way that the travel mode imputation can be directly
applied. The estimated multimodal travel demand patterns are then validated
against typical household travel surveys in the same Washington D.C. and

using segmented telescopes in a modest observation bandwidth. This concept,
named ""spectroscopic fourth-order coronagraphy"", is based on a fourth-order
coronagraph with a focal-plane mask that modulates the complex amplitude of the
Airy disk along one direction. While coronagraphs applying the complex
amplitude mask can achieve the theoretical limit performance for any arbitrary
pupils, the focal plane mask severely limits the bandwidth. Here, focusing on
the fact that the focal-plane mask modulates the complex amplitude along one
direction, we noticed that the mask can be optimized for each spectral element
generated by a spectrograph. We combine the fourth-order coronagraph with two
spectrographs to produce a stellar spectrum on the focal plane and reconstruct
a white pupil on the Lyot stop. Based on the wavefront analysis of an optical
design applying an Offner-type imaging spectrograph, we found that the
achievable contrast of this concept is 10^{-10} at 1.2 - 1.5 times the
diffraction limit over the wavelength range of 650 - 750 nm for the entrance
pupil of the LUVOIR telescope. Thus, this coronagraph concept could bring new
habitable planet candidates not only around G- and K-type stars beyond 20 - 30
pc but also around very nearby M-type stars. This approach potentially promotes
the characterization of the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial planets with
future on- and off-axis segmented large telescopes.

Historically, additionally employing the VGG-based perceptual loss has helped
to overcome this issue, significantly improving the synthesis quality, but at

In this work, we propose a novel, simplified GAN model, which needs only
adversarial supervision to achieve high quality results. We re-design the
discriminator as a semantic segmentation network, directly using the given
semantic label maps as the ground truth for training. By providing stronger
supervision to the discriminator as well as to the generator through spatially-
and semantically-aware discriminator feedback, we are able to synthesize images
of higher fidelity with better alignment to their input label maps, making the
use of the perceptual loss superfluous. Moreover, we enable high-quality
multi-modal image synthesis through global and local sampling of a 3D noise
tensor injected into the generator, which allows complete or partial image
change. We show that images synthesized by our model are more diverse and
follow the color and texture distributions of real images more closely. We
achieve an average improvement of $6$ FID and $5$ mIoU points over the state of

specific frequencies (SN<2.5 with a median of SN=1) than ETGs of comparable
mass. This is consistent with a scenario of rapid, early dissipative formation,
with relatively low levels of accretion of low-mass, high-SN satellites. The GC
half-number radii are compact, but follow the relations found in normal ETGs.
We identify an anticorrelation between the specific angular momentum (lambda_R)

extreme that it fails to properly resolve the turbulence. In this work, we
derive and implement the ""non-twisting flux tube,"" a local simulation domain
that remains rectangular at all parallel locations. Convergence and runtime
tests indicate that it can calculate the heat flux more efficiently than the
conventional flux tube. For one test case, it was 30 times less computationally

advantageous when the magnetic shear is high and the domain includes at least
two regions of turbulent drive (e.g. stellarator simulations, pedestal
simulations, tokamak simulations with several poloidal turns). Additionally, it
more accurately models the inboard midplane when the magnetic shear is large.
Lastly, we show how the non-twisting flux tube can be generalized to allow
further optimization and control of the simulation domain.

a maximum $T_{C}$ ~${253 K}$ and an extrapolated upper critical magnetic field
$B_{C2(0)}$ up to ${135 T}$ at 183 GPa. This is one of the first examples of
ternary high-$T_{C}$ superconducting hydrides. Our experiments show that a part
of the atoms in the structures of recently discovered ${Im3m}$-$YH_{6}$ and
${Fm3m}$-$LaH_{10}$ can be replaced with lanthanum (~70 %) and yttrium (~25 %),
respectively, with a formation of unique ternary superhydrides containing
incorporated $La@H_{24}$ and $Y@H_{32}$ which are specific for
${Im3m}$-$LaH_{6}$ and ${Fm3m}$-$YH_{10}$. Ternary La-Y hydrides were obtained
at pressures of 170-196 GPa via the laser heating of $P6_{3}$${/mmc}$
lanthanum-yttrium alloys in the ammonia borane medium at temperatures above
2000 K. A novel tetragonal $(La,Y)H_{4}$ was discovered as an impurity phase in

critical current density $J_{C}$ in $(La,Y)H_{10}$ may exceed $2500 A/mm^{2}$
at 4.2 K, which is comparable with that for commercial superconducting wires
such as ${NbTi}$, $Nb_{3}$${Sn}$. Hydrides that are unstable in a pure form may

number helical swimmer moving across viscosity gradients. Experimentally, a
double-layer viscosity is generated by superposing two miscible fluids with
similar densities but different dynamic viscosities. A synthetic helical
magnetically-driven swimmer is then made to move across the viscosity gradients
along four different configurations: either head-first (pusher swimmer) or
tail-first (puller), and through either positive (i.e. going from low to high
viscosity) or negative viscosity gradients. We observe qualitative differences
in the penetration dynamics for each case. We find that the swimming speed can
either increase or decrease while swimming across the viscosity interface,
which results from the fact that the head and the tail of the swimmer can be in
environments in which the local viscosity leads to different relative amounts
of drag and thrust. In order to rationalize the experimental measurements, we
next develop a theoretical hydrodynamic model. We assume that the classical
resistive-force theory of slender filaments is locally valid along the helical
propeller and use it to calculate the swimming speed as a function of the
position of the swimmer relative to the fluid-fluid interface. The predictions
of the model agree well with experiments for the case of positive viscosity
gradients. When crossing across a negative gradient, gravitational forces in
the experiment become important, and we modify the model to include buoyancy,
which agrees with experiments. In general our results show that it is harder
for a pusher swimmer to cross from low to high viscosity, whereas for a puller
swimmer it is the opposite. Our model is also extended to the case of a swimmer
crossing a continuous viscosity gradient.

thousands of rows and up to hundred of thousands of columns. We develop
coupling techniques tailored to the setting of high-dimensional regression with

establishing geometric drift and minorization conditions for the algorithm
under consideration, we prove that the proposed couplings have finite expected

'Horseshoe', we empirically demonstrate the scalability of the proposed
couplings. A highlight of our findings is that less than 1000 iterations can be
enough for a Gibbs sampler to reach stationarity in a regression on 100,000
covariates. The numerical results also illustrate the impact of the prior on
the computational efficiency of the coupling, and suggest the use of priors
where the local precisions are Half-t distributed with degree of freedom larger

corresponding market payment policies that accurately reflect the value of the

intriguing electronic phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity where
the electrons are mediated by lattice for creating supercurrent. The Mott
transition, which is a source for many fascinating emergent behaviors, is
originally thought to be driven solely by correlated electrons with an Ising
criticality. Recent studies on the known Mott systems have shown that the
lattice degree of freedom is also at play, giving rise to either Landau or
unconventional criticality. However, the underlying coupling mechanism of
charge and lattice degrees of freedom around the Mott critical endpoint remains
elusive, leading to difficulties in understanding the associated Mott physics.
Here we report a study of Mott transition in cubic PbCrO3 by measuring the
lattice parameter, using high-pressure x-ray diffraction techniques. The Mott
criticality in this material is revealed with large lattice anomalies, which is
governed by giant viscoelasticity that presumably results from a combination of
lattice elasticity and electron viscosity. Because of the viscoelastic effect,
the lattice of this material behaves peculiarly near the critical endpoint,
inconsistent with any existing university classes. We argue that the
viscoelasticity may play as a hidden degree of freedom behind the Mott
criticality.

precise understanding of the concepts. This creates a gap when fusing knowledge
graphs into language modeling, especially when there is insufficient labeled
data. Thus, we propose to employ external entity descriptions to provide
contextual information for knowledge understanding. We retrieve descriptions of
related concepts from Wiktionary and feed them as additional input to
pre-trained language models. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art
result in the CommonsenseQA dataset and the best result among non-generative
models in OpenBookQA.

treatment strategies which take into account patient heterogeneity. However,
health-outcome information, which is used as the reward for reinforcement
learning methods, is often not well coded but rather embedded in clinical
notes. Extracting precise outcome information is a resource intensive task, so
most of the available well-annotated cohorts are small. To address this issue,
we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that efficiently leverages
a small sized labeled data with true outcome observed, and a large unlabeled
data with outcome surrogates. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised,
efficient approach to Q-learning and doubly robust off policy value estimation.
Generalizing SSL to sequential treatment regimes brings interesting challenges:
1) Feature distribution for Q-learning is unknown as it includes previous
outcomes. 2) The surrogate variables we leverage in the modified SSL framework
are predictive of the outcome but not informative to the optimal policy or
value function. We provide theoretical results for our Q-function and value
function estimators to understand to what degree efficiency can be gained from
SSL. Our method is at least as efficient as the supervised approach, and
moreover safe as it robust to mis-specification of the imputation models.

gravitational waves and light.
  * GW170817 was the first detection of a neutron star merger with
gravitational waves. * The detection of a spatially coincident weak burst of
$\gamma$-rays (GRB 170817A) 1.7 s after the merger constituted the first
electromagnetic detection of a gravitational wave source and established a
connection between at least some cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and
binary neutron star mergers. * A fast-evolving optical and near-infrared
transient (AT 2017gfo) associated with the event can be interpreted as
resulting from the ejection of $\sim$0.05 M$_{\odot}$ of material enriched in
r-process elements, finally establishing binary neutron star mergers as at
least one source of r-process nucleosynthesis. * Radio and X-ray observations
revealed a long-rising source that peaked $\sim$160 d after the merger.
Combined with the apparent superluminal motion of the associated VLBI source,
these observations show that the merger produced a relativistic structured jet
whose core was oriented $\approx$ 20 deg from the line of sight and with
properties similar to SGRBs. The jet structure likely results from the jet
interaction with the merger ejecta. * The electromagnetic and gravitational
wave information can be combined to produce constraints on the expansion rate
of the universe and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. These
multimessenger endeavors will be a major emphasis for future work.

the non-linear interaction between downstream-propagating coherent structures
with the quasi-periodic shock cells in the jet plume. The turbulent
perturbations are represented as axially-extended wavepackets and the shock
cells are modelled as a set of stationary waveguide modes. Unlike previous
BBSAN models, the physical parameters describing the hydrodynamic components
are not scaled using the acoustic field. Instead, the characteristics of both
the turbulent and shock components are educed from large-eddy simulation and
particle image velocimetry datasets. Apart from using extracted data, a
reduced-order description of the wavepacket structure is obtained using
parabolised stability equations (PSE). The validity of the model is tested by
comparing far-field sound pressure level predictions to azimuthally-decomposed
experimental acoustic data from a cold Mach 1.5 underexpanded jet. At polar
angles and frequencies where BBSAN dominates, good agreement in spectral shape
and sound amplitude is observed for the first three azimuthal modes.
Encouraging comparisons of the radiated noise spectra, in both frequency and
amplitude, reinforce the suitability of using reduced-order linear wavepacket
sources for predicting BBSAN peaks. On the other hand, the mismatch in sound
amplitude at interpeak frequencies reveals the role of wavepacket jitter in the
underlying sound generating mechanism.

fatality rate has fallen precipitously. Several possible explanations have been
floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing,
shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and
reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and
decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level
data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April
1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each
stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the
hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to
decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in
the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the
national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second
wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR.
By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second
peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first
and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by
November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in
age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding
factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic
picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis
is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by
artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but
also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified
line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.

intelligence applications often live in high dimensions with strong
non-convexity and massive local minima. First-order methods, such as the
stochastic gradient method and Adam, are often used to find global minima.
Recently, the consensus-based optimization (CBO) method has been introduced as
one of the gradient-free optimization methods and its convergence is proven
with dimension-dependent parameters, which may suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. By replacing the isotropic geometric Brownian motion with the
component-wise one, the latest improvement of the CBO method is guaranteed to
converge to the global minimizer with dimension-independent parameters,
although the initial data need to be well-chosen. In this paper, based on the
CBO method and Adam, we propose a consensus-based global optimization method
with adaptive momentum estimation (Adam-CBO). Advantages of the Adam-CBO method
include: (1) capable of finding global minima of non-convex objective functions
with high success rates and low costs; (2) can handle non-differentiable
activation functions and thus approximate low-regularity functions with better
accuracy. The former is verified by approximating the $1000$ dimensional
Rastrigin function with $100\%$ success rate at a cost only growing linearly
with respect to the dimensionality. The latter is confirmed by solving a

  Adaptation","Accepted to ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, deep self-training approaches emerged as a powerful solution to the
unsupervised domain adaptation. The self-training scheme involves iterative
processing of target data; it generates target pseudo labels and retrains the
network. However, since only the confident predictions are taken as pseudo
labels, existing self-training approaches inevitably produce sparse pseudo
labels in practice. We see this is critical because the resulting insufficient
training-signals lead to a suboptimal, error-prone model. In order to tackle
this problem, we propose a novel Two-phase Pseudo Label Densification
framework, referred to as TPLD. In the first phase, we use sliding window
voting to propagate the confident predictions, utilizing intrinsic
spatial-correlations in the images. In the second phase, we perform a
confidence-based easy-hard classification. For the easy samples, we now employ
their full pseudo labels. For the hard ones, we instead adopt adversarial
learning to enforce hard-to-easy feature alignment. To ease the training
process and avoid noisy predictions, we introduce the bootstrapping mechanism
to the original self-training loss. We show the proposed TPLD can be easily
integrated into existing self-training based approaches and improves the
performance significantly. Combined with the recently proposed CRST
self-training framework, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on two
standard UDA benchmarks.

interference since interventions at a particular pollution source likely impact
air quality and health at distant locations and air quality and health at any
given location are likely impacted by interventions at many sources. The
structure of interference in this context is dictated by complex atmospheric
processes governing how pollution emitted from a particular source is
transformed and transported across space, and can be cast with a bipartite
structure reflecting the two distinct types of units: 1) interventional units
on which treatments are applied or withheld to change pollution emissions; and
2) outcome units on which outcomes of primary interest are measured. We propose
new estimands for bipartite causal inference with interference that construe
two components of treatment: a ""key-associated"" (or ""individual"") treatment and
an ""upwind"" (or ""neighborhood"") treatment. Estimation is carried out using a
semi-parametric adjustment approach based on joint propensity scores. A
reduced-complexity atmospheric model is deployed to characterize the structure
of the interference network by modeling the movement of air parcels through

new end-to-end framework, the TransFormer with Visual Tokens for Human-Robot

predicts the appropriate action to take in each scenario and identifies the

scaling of the size of this crescent is an open question in the stress focusing
of elastic thin sheets. According to experiments and simulations, this size
depends on the outer dimension of the sheet, but intuition and rudimentary
energy balance indicate it should only depend on the sheet thickness. We
address this discrepancy by modeling the observed crescent with a more
geometric approach, where we treat the crescent as a curved crease in an
isometric sheet. Although curved creases have already been studied extensively,
the crescent in a crumpled sheet has its own unique features: the material
crescent terminates within the material, and the material extent is
indefinitely larger than the extent of the crescent. These features together
with the general constraints of isometry lead to constraints linking the
surface profile to the crease-line geometry. We construct several examples
obeying these constraints, showing finite curved creases are fully realizable.
This approach has some particular advantages over previous analyses, as we are
able to describe the entire material without having to exclude the region
around the sharp crescent. Finally, we deduce testable relations between the
crease and the surrounding sheet, and discuss some of the implications of our
approach with regards to the scaling of the crescent size.

and anomalous data in terms of the joint distribution of images and their
representation. Unfortunately, this objective function is not directly
optimizable under the unsupervised setting where no anomalous data is provided

we manage to decompose it into four components. In order to optimize in an

  This paper makes two contributions to address this issue: (1) It extends the
conventional twin neural network and introduces a training method for low-shot
learning when labeled data are limited and imbalanced, and (2) it introduces a
novel semi-supervised learning strategy that uses additional unlabeled training
data to achieve greater accuracy. Our proposed multi-task twin neural network

that its accuracy with limited training data approaches the accuracy of

self-training provides additional pseudo labels for fine tuning a pretrained

$N$-player equilibria indeed converge towards the solution of such a kind of

the fact that the corresponding master equation has already been proved to be
uniquely solvable under the presence of the common noise, it becomes however
more subtle than in the standard setting because the mean field interaction

accelerating stars from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search Program. Twenty
years of precise radial-velocity monitoring of 12 Psc with the Tull
Spectrograph at the Harlan J. Smith telescope reveals a moderate radial
acceleration ($\approx$10 m s$^{-1}$ yr $^{-1}$), which together with relative
astrometry from Keck/NIRC2 and the astrometric acceleration between $Hipparcos$
and $Gaia$ DR2 yields a dynamical mass of $M_B$ = 0.605$^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$
$M_{\odot}$ for 12 Psc B, a semi-major axis of 40$^{+2}_{-4}$ AU, and an
eccentricity of 0.84$\pm$0.08. We also report an updated orbit fit of the white
dwarf companion to the metal-poor (but barium-rich) G9 V dwarf HD 159062 based
on new radial velocity observations from the High-Resolution Spectrograph at
the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and astrometry from Keck/NIRC2. A joint fit of the
available relative astrometry, radial velocities, and tangential astrometric
acceleration yields a dynamical mass of $M_B$ = 0.609$^{+0.010}_{-0.011}$
$M_{\odot}$ for HD 159062 B, a semi-major axis of 60$^{+5}_{-7}$ AU, and
preference for circular orbits ($e$$<$0.42 at 95% confidence). 12 Psc B and HD
159062 B join a small list of resolved ""Sirius-like"" benchmark white dwarfs
with precise dynamical mass measurements which serve as valuable tests of white

quantum computation (CVQC) protocol for a classical client to delegate decision
problems in BQP to an untrusted quantum prover under computational assumptions.
In this work, we explore further the feasibility of CVQC with the more general
sampling problems in BQP and with the desirable blindness property. We
contribute affirmative solutions to both as follows.
  (1) Motivated by the sampling nature of many quantum applications (e.g.,
quantum algorithms for machine learning and quantum supremacy tasks), we
initiate the study of CVQC for quantum sampling problems (denoted by SampBQP).
More precisely, in a CVQC protocol for a SampBQP problem, the prover and the
verifier are given an input $x\in \{0,1\}^n$ and a quantum circuit $C$, and the
goal of the classical client is to learn a sample from the output $z \leftarrow
C(x)$ up to a small error, from its interaction with an untrusted prover. We
demonstrate its feasibility by constructing a four-message CVQC protocol for
SampBQP based on the quantum Learning With Error assumption.
  (2) The blindness of CVQC protocols refers to a property of the protocol
where the prover learns nothing, and hence is blind, about the client's input.
It is a highly desirable property that has been intensively studied for the
delegation of quantum computation. We provide a simple yet powerful generic
compiler that transforms any CVQC protocol to a blind one while preserving its
completeness and soundness errors as well as the number of rounds.
  Applying our compiler to (a parallel repetition of) Mahadev's CVQC protocol
for BQP and our CVQC protocol for SampBQP yields the first constant-round blind
CVQC protocol for BQP and SampBQP respectively, with negligible and inverse
polynomial soundness errors respectively, and negligible completeness errors.

forward as a possible quantum mechanism of charge-directed reactivity governing

based on the indirect (fragment ion-based) characterization of the proposed
electronic phenomena suggest that the photoionization-induced electronic
coherence can survive for tens of femtoseconds, while some theoretical studies
predict much faster decay of the coherence due to the quantum uncertainty in
the nuclear positions and the nuclear-motion effects. The open questions are:
do long-lived electronic quantum coherences exist in complex molecules and can
they be probed directly, i.e. via electronic observables? Here, we use x-rays
both to create and to directly probe quantum coherence in the photoionized
amino acid glycine. The outgoing photoelectron wave leaves behind a positively
charged ion that is in a coherent superposition of quantum mechanical
eigenstates lying within the ionizing pulse spectral bandwidth. Delayed x-ray
pulses track the induced coherence through resonant x-ray absorption that
induces Auger decay and by the photoelectron emission from sequential double
photoionization. Sinusoidal temporal modulation of the detected signal at early
times (0 - 25 fs) is observed in both measurements. Advanced ab initio
many-electron simulations, taking into account the quantum uncertainty in the
nuclear positions, allow us to explain the first 25 fs of the detected coherent
quantum evolution in terms of the electronic coherence.

According to the sunspot observations, the current solar cycle 24 manifest to
be less intense in comparison with the previous recent sunspot cycles. In the
course of the current sunspot cycle 24, several small and large sunspot groups
have produced various moderate and intense flare/CME events. There are a few
active regions with a large number of flaring activities passed across the
visible disk of the Sun during 2012-2015. In this study, we consider the three
periods 22-29 Oct 2013, 01-08 Nov 2013, and 25 Oct- 08-Nov 2014, during which
228 flares have been observed. Considering only active regions near the central
part of the disk, 59 CMEs (halo or partial) have been reported among which only
39 events are associated with flares. We conclude that an active region with a
larger area, more complex morphology and stronger magnetic field has a
comparatively higher possibility of producing extremely fast CMEs (speed > 1500
km/sec). So that among the 5 X class flares of the reported periods, 3 of them
(60%) are associated with a CME. The lift-off time for CME-flare associated
events has a +15 to+30 minute time interval range after the occurrence time of
associated flares suggesting that the flares produce the CMEs. Additionally, we
compiled the geomagnetic storms occurring within1-5 days after the CME onset.
10% of the 59 CMEs are related to a magnetic storm but all are moderate storms.

promising approach given that it allows computation tasks to be carried out in

for the long overall completion times. Specifically, by using polynomial codes,
computed results from only a subset of devices are needed to reconstruct the
final result. However, there is no incentive for the edge devices to complete
the computation tasks. In this paper, we present an all-pay auction to
incentivize the edge devices to participate in the coded computation tasks. In
this auction, the bids of the edge devices are represented by the allocation of
their Central Processing Unit (CPU) power to the computation tasks. All edge
devices submit their bids regardless of whether they win or lose in the

prove that the least squares estimator is computable via solving an essentially
constrained convex quadratic programming (QP) problem with $(d+1)n$ variables,
$n(n-1)$ linear inequality constraints and $n$ possibly non-polyhedral

solve the generally very large-scale convex QP, we design a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method (proxALM) whose subproblems are solved by the semismooth
Newton method (SSN). To further accelerate the computation when $n$ is huge, we
design a practical implementation of the constraint generation method such that
each reduced problem is efficiently solved by our proposed proxALM.
Comprehensive numerical experiments, including those in the pricing of basket

pedestrians, trains etc., making it a very complex system to study. Even a bus
system responsible for delivering commuters from their origins to their
destinations in a loop service already exhibits very complicated dynamics.
Here, we investigate the dynamics of a simplified version of such a bus loop
system consisting of two buses serving three bus stops. Specifically, we
consider a configuration of one bus operating as a normal bus which picks up
passengers from bus stops $A$ and $B$, and then delivers them to bus stop $C$,
whilst the second bus acts as an express bus which picks up passengers only
from bus stop $B$ and then delivers them to bus stop $C$. The two buses are
like asymmetric agents coupled to bus stop $B$ as they interact via picking up
passengers from this common bus stop. Intriguingly, this \emph{semi-express}
bus configuration is more efficient and has a lower average waiting time for
buses, compared to a configuration of two normal buses or a configuration of
two express buses. We reckon the efficiency arises from the chaotic dynamics
exhibited in the semi-express system, where the tendency towards anti-bunching
is greater than that towards bunching, in contradistinction to the regular
bunching behavior of two normal buses or the independent periodic behaviour of
two non-interacting express buses.

of minor agents were introduced in (Huang, 2010) in an LQG setup. The Nash
certainty equivalence was used to obtain a Markovian closed-loop Nash
equilibrium for the limiting system when the number of minor agents tends to
infinity. In the past years several approaches to major--minor mean field game
problems have been developed, principally (i) the Nash certainty equivalence
and analytic approach, (ii) master equations, (iii) asymptotic solvability, and
(iv) the probabilistic approach. For the LQG case, the recent work (Huang,
2021) establishes the equivalency of the Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium
obtained via (i) with those obtained via (ii) and (iii). In this work, we
demonstrate that the Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium of (i) is
equivalent to that of (iv) for the LQG case. These two studies answer the
long-standing questions about the consistency of the solutions to major-minor
LQG MFG systems derived using different approaches.

cross-correlation. To present our network with greater varieties of images, we
also propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy to train trackers with
unpaired images, overcoming barriers to data collection. To train and evaluate
our tracker, we introduce and release the first lesion tracking benchmark,

proposed method, DLT, locates lesion centers with a mean error distance of 7
mm. This is 5% better than a leading registration algorithm while running 14
times faster on whole CT volumes. We demonstrate even greater improvements over
detector or similarity-learning alternatives. DLT also generalizes well on an

Finally, we plug DLT into an automatic tumor monitoring workflow where it leads
to an accuracy of 85% in assessing lesion treatment responses, which is only

terrestrial planet HD 21749c as well as an outer sub-Neptune HD 21749b, both

21749b to be $22.7\pm2.2\ M_{\oplus}$ with a density of $7.0^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$

new high-cadence PFS RV data to disentangle the stellar activity signal from
the planetary signal. We find that HD 21749 has a similar rotational timescale
as the planet's orbital period, and the amplitude of the planetary orbital RV
signal is estimated to be similar to that of the stellar activity signal. We
perform Gaussian Process (GP) regression on the photometry and RVs from HARPS
and PFS to model the stellar activity signal. Our new models reveal that HD
21749b has a radius of $2.86\pm0.20\ R_{\oplus}$, an orbital period of
$35.6133\pm0.0005$ d with a mass of $M_{b}=20.0\pm2.7\ M_{\oplus}$ and a

the plausible deniability of a dynamic system for its ""secret"" against

observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this
paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for
discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is
allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix.
First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic
information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous
""hold on"" events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of
opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard
projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that
are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure
called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified
under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative
examples for the proposed approach are also provided. Compared with the
existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more
general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent

explored. The neural network models, trained on 26400 seconds of simulator

history, its emotion flow, facial expressions, audio, and speakers'
personalities) with a heterogeneous graph neural network, and then predict
suitable emotions for feedback. Secondly, we employ an

  Our proposed algorithm is fast and easy to implement and can be used in
dynamic networks where the edges and vertices are added or deleted constantly.
More importantly, based on the experimental results the proposed algorithm has
reasonable solutions and running time which enables us to use it in distributed

topic both in academia and industry. These attacks, along with traditional
security threats, can compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of organization's assets that are dependent on the usage of machine learning
models. While it is not easy to predict the types of new attacks that might be
developed over time, it is possible to evaluate the risks connected to using
machine learning models and design measures that help in minimizing these
risks.
  In this paper, we outline a novel framework to guide the risk management
process for organizations reliant on machine learning models. First, we define
sets of evaluation factors (EFs) in the data domain, model domain, and security
controls domain. We develop a method that takes the asset and task importance,
sets the weights of EFs' contribution to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, and based on implementation scores of EFs, it determines the
overall security state in the organization. Based on this information, it is
possible to identify weak links in the implemented security measures and find
out which measures might be missing completely. We believe our framework can
help in addressing the security issues related to usage of machine learning
models in organizations and guide them in focusing on the adequate security
measures to protect their assets.

investigate the complimentary roles of spatial and temporal information and
propose a novel dynamic spatiotemporal network (DS-Net) for more effective

network to explicitly extract spatial and temporal features. A dynamic weight
generator (DWG) is designed to automatically learn the reliability of
corresponding saliency branch. And a top-down cross attentive aggregation (CAA)
procedure is designed so as to facilitate dynamic complementary aggregation of
spatiotemporal features. Finally, the features are modified by spatial
attention with the guidance of coarse saliency map and then go through decoder
part for final saliency map. Experimental results on five benchmarks VOS,

characterize the field. The need for a reference severely restricts the utility
of holography. Phase retrieval, in contrast, is theoretically consistent with
sensors that directly measure coherent or partially coherent fields with no
prior assumptions. Unfortunately, phase retrieval has not yet been successfully
implemented for large-scale fields. Here we show that both holography and phase
retrieval are capable of quantum-limited coherent signal estimation and we
describe phase retrieval strategies that approach the quantum limit for >1

a phase transition to a magnetically ordered phase occurs before the

pattern at incident energies $E_\text{lab}\gtrsim 200$ MeV, with the Airy
structure of the far-side scattering cross section clearly seen at medium and
large angles. Such a rainbow pattern is well described by the deep real optical
potential (OP) given by the double-folding model (DFM). At lower energies, the
extensive elastic $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering data show consistently that the
nuclear rainbow pattern at backward angles is deteriorated by an oscillating
enhancement of elastic cross section that is difficult to describe in the
conventional optical model (OM). Given a significant $\alpha$ spectroscopic
factor predicted for the dissociation $^{16}$O$\to\alpha+^{12}$C by the shell
model and $\alpha$-cluster models, the contribution of the elastic $\alpha$
transfer (or the core-core exchange) to the elastic $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C
scattering should not be negligible and is expected to account for the enhanced
elastic cross section at backward angles. To reveal the impact of the elastic
$\alpha$ transfer, a systematic coupled reaction channels analysis of the
elastic $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C scattering has been performed, with the coupling
between the elastic scattering and elastic $\alpha$ transfer channels treated
explicitly, using the real OP given by the DFM. We found that the elastic
$\alpha$ transfer enhances the near-side scattering significantly at backward
angles, giving rise to an oscillating distortion of the smooth Airy structure.
The dynamic polarization of the OP by the coupling between the elastic
scattering and elastic $\alpha$ transfer channels can be effectively taken into
account in the OM calculation by an angular-momentum (or parity) dependent
potential added to the imaginary OP, as suggested by Frahn and Hussein 40 years

emission. Using [OIV] emission as a proxy of the AGN intrinsic luminosity, we
find that both of the extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission and reflection continuum
are linearly correlated with the [OIV] luminosity, indicating a connection
between the AGN and the extended emission.

significant time delays between the optical V and the AD corrected J, H and Ks

are consistent with each other. However, considering the lag between V and Ks
bands to represent the inner edge of the dust torus, the torus in Z229-15 lies
at a distance of 0.017 pc from the central ionizing continuum. This is smaller
than that expected from the radius luminosity (R-L) relationship known from
DRM. Using a constant {\alpha} = 0.1 to account for the AD component, as is
normally done in DRM, the deduced radius (0.025 pc) lies close to the expected
R-L relation. However, usage of constant {\alpha} in DRM is disfavoured as the
{\alpha} of the ionizing continuum changes with the flux of the source.

has a willing living donor with whom the patient is not compatible, the pair
patient--donor can join a pool of incompatible pairs and, if compatibility
between patient and donor in two our more pairs exists, organs can be exchanged
between them. The problem can be modeled as an integer program that, in
general, aims at finding the pairs that should be selected for transplant such

a better fit over some than over others. Under this setting, the aim is to find
the maximum cardinality stable exchange, a solution where no blocking cycle
exists. For this purpose we propose three novel integer programming models

adjusted for both finding stable and strongly stable exchanges under strict
preferences and for the case when ties in preferences may exist. Furthermore,
we study a situation when the stability requirement can be relaxed by
addressing the trade-off between maximum cardinality versus number of blocking

ellipses are not defined. They are manifested as circular and linear
polarization, for which respectively the semi-major axes and normal vectors of
polarization ellipses become indefinite. First observed in conical diffraction
in the 1830s, the field of polarization singularities has been systematically
reshaped and deepened by many pioneers of wave optics. Together with other
exotic phenomena such as non-Hermiticity and topology, polarization
singularities have been introduced into the vibrant field of nanophotonics,
rendering unprecedented flexibilities for manipulations of light-matter
interactions at the nanoscale. Here we review the recent results on the
generation and observation of polarization singularities in metaphotonics. We
start with the discussion of polarization singularities in the Mie theory,
where both electric and magnetic multipoles are explored from perspectives of
local and global polarization properties. We then proceed with the discussion
of various photonic-crystal structures, for which both near- and far-field
patterns manifest diverse polarization singularities characterized by the
integer Poincare or more general half-integer Hopf indices (topological
charges). Next, we review the most recent studies of conversions from
polarization to phase singularities in scalar wave optics, demonstrating how
bound states in the continuum can be exploited to generate directly optical
vortices of various charges. Throughout our paper, we discuss and highlight
several fundamental concepts and demonstrate their close connections and
special links to metaphotonics. We believe polarization singularities can
provide novel perspectives for light-matter manipulation for both fundamental

by a scalable synthesis method leads to high mass activities for the oxygen
evolution reaction with outstanding improvements by 10 and 50 times,
respectively, compared to those prepared via the state of the art synthesis
method. Here, detailed comparisons at both laboratory and industrial scales
show that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 appears to be the most active and stable
perovskite catalyst under alkaline conditions, while PrBaCo2O6 reveals
thermodynamic instability described by the density functional theory based
Pourbaix diagrams highlighting cation dissolution under oxygen evolution
conditions. Operando Xray absorption spectroscopy is used in parallel to
monitor electronic and structural changes of the catalysts during oxygen
evolution reaction. The exceptional BSCF functional stability can be correlated
to its thermodynamic metastability under oxygen evolution conditions as
highlighted by Pourbaix diagram analysis. BSCF is able to dynamically self
reconstruct its surface, leading to formation of Co based oxyhydroxide layers
while retaining its structural stability. Differently, PBCO demonstrates a high
initial oxygen evolution reaction activity while it undergoes a degradation
process considering its thermodynamic instability under oxygen evolution
conditions as anticipated by its Pourbaix diagram. Overall, this work
demonstrates a synergetic approach of using both experimental and theoretical
studies to understand the behavior of perovskite catalysts.

two metrics, i.e., WMDRel and CLinRel. WMDRel measures the semantic relevance

deep visual feature space, CLinRel is a visual-oriented cross-lingual relevance
measure. As for the second scenario, which has zero reference and is thus more
challenging, we propose CMedRel to compute a cross-media relevance between the

HEMNet preserves the underlying EM procedure, thereby fully retaining the
convergence properties of the original EM algorithm. We achieve significant
improvement in performance on several semantic segmentation benchmarks and

heatmap regression-based facial landmark detection methods neglect to explore
the high-order feature correlations, which is very important to learn more
representative features and enhance shape constraints. Moreover, no explicit
global shape constraints have been added to the final predicted landmarks,
which leads to a reduction in accuracy. To address these issues, in this paper,
we propose a Multi-order Multi-constraint Deep Network (MMDN) for more powerful
feature correlations and shape constraints learning. Specifically, an Implicit
Multi-order Correlating Geometry-aware (IMCG) model is proposed to introduce
the multi-order spatial correlations and multi-order channel correlations for
more discriminative representations. Furthermore, an Explicit Probability-based
Boundary-adaptive Regression (EPBR) method is developed to enhance the global
shape constraints and further search the semantically consistent landmarks in
the predicted boundary for robust facial landmark detection. It's interesting
to show that the proposed MMDN can generate more accurate boundary-adaptive
landmark heatmaps and effectively enhance shape constraints to the predicted
landmarks for faces with large pose variations and heavy occlusions.
Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our MMDN over state-of-the-art facial landmark detection

oscillator populations in the mean-field limit. First, we clarify existence and
uniqueness of our set of characteristic equations, which are formulated in the
space of probability measures together with the bounded-Lipschitz metric. Then,
we investigate dynamical properties within the framework of the characteristic

all oscillators are synchronized within each population. Even though it turns
out that this so called all-synchronized state is never asymptotically stable,
under some conditions and with a suitable definition of stability, the
all-synchronized state can be proven to be at least locally stable. In summary,
our work provides a rigorous mathematical framework upon which the further
study of multi-population higher-order coupled particle systems can be based.

test by tapping a built-in bio-sensor, these short-term ECG tests often miss
intermittent and asymptomatic abnormalities of the heart. It is also infeasible
to expect persistently active user participation for long-term continuous
cardiac monitoring in order to capture these and other types of abnormalities
of the heart. To alleviate the need for continuous user attention and active
participation, a lightweight neural network is designed to infer
electrocardiogram (ECG) from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal sensed at the
skin surface by a wearable optical sensor. To increase the utility of
reconstructed ECG signals for screening cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), a
diagnosis-oriented training strategy is developed to encourage the neural
network to capture the pathological features of ECG. Model interpretation can
be leveraged to obtain insights from data-driven models, for example, to reveal
some associations between CVDs and ECG/PPG and to demonstrate how the neural
network copes with motion artifacts in the ambulatory application. The
experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the feasibility of inferring
ECG from PPG, achieving a high fidelity of ECG reconstruction with only about
40K parameters.

conjugate mixture models. These models exploit the explicit transformations

rely on vocal biometric features as a gender cue can be unsuitable and
potentially harmful for certain users. Going beyond speech signals, in this
paper we compare different approaches to inform direct ST models about the

English into Italian and French. To this aim, we manually annotated large

lifetime ($\tau_3$). We find that T2HK, T2HKK and ESS$\nu$SB are sensitive to

the sensitivities of the three experiments and specially investigate the role
played by the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. It is seen that for experiments with
flux peak near the second oscillation maxima, the poorer sensitivity to
$\theta_{23}$ results in weaker constraints on the decay lifetime. Although,
T2HKK has one detector close to the second oscillation maxima, having another
detector at the first oscillation maxima results in superior sensitivity to
decay. In addition, we find a synergy between the two baselines of the T2HKK
experiment which helps in giving a better sensitivity for $\theta_{23}$ in the
higher octant. We discuss the octant sensitivity in presence of decay and show
that there is an enhancement in sensitivity which occurs due to the
contribution from the survival probability $P_{\mu\mu}$ which is more
pronounced for the experiments at the second oscillation maxima. We also obtain
the combined sensitivity of T2HK+ESS$\nu$SB and T2HKK+ESS$\nu$SB as

typically amplitude, phase, and polarization. Pseudospins, such as those
arising from valley degrees of freedom in photonic structures, have recently
emerged as an excellent candidate for this toolbox, in parallel with rapid
development of spintronics and valleytronics in condensed-matter physics. Here,
by employing symmetry-broken honeycomb photonic lattices, we demonstrate
valley-dependent wavepacket self-rotation manifested in spiraling intensity
patterns, which occurs without any initial orbital angular momentum.
Theoretically, we show that such wavepacket self-rotation is induced by the
Berry phase and results in Zitterbewegung oscillations. The ""center-of-mass"" of
the wavepacket oscillates at a gap-dependent frequency, while the helicity of
self-rotation is valley-dependent, that is, correlated with the Berry
curvature. Our results lead to new understanding of the venerable
Zitterbewegung phenomenon from the perspective of topology and are readily
applicable on other platforms such as two-dimensional Dirac materials and
ultracold atoms.

evidence from the field. Thus, education of software engineers must include
strong and applied education in empirical research methods. For most students,
the master's thesis is the last, but also most applied form of this education
in their studies.
  Problem: Especially thesis work in collaboration with industry requires that
concerns of stakeholders from academia and practice are carefully balanced. It
is possible, yet difficult to do high-impact empirical work within the
timeframe of a typical thesis. In particular, if this research aims to provide
practical value to industry, academic quality can suffer. Even though
constructive research methods such as Design Science Research (DSR) exist,
thesis projects repeatably struggle to apply them.
  Principle solution idea: DSR enables balancing such concerns by providing
room both for knowledge questions and design work. Yet, only limited experience
exists in our field on how to make this research method work within the context
of a master's thesis. To enable running design science master's theses in
collaboration with industry, we complement existing method descriptions and
guidelines with our own experience and pragmatic advice to students, examiners,
and supervisors in academia and industry.
  Method: This paper itself is based on DSR. Based on 12 design science theses
over the last seven years, we collect common pitfalls and good practice from
analysing the theses, the student-supervisor interaction, the
supervisor-industry interaction, the examiner feedback, and, where available,
reviewer comments on publications that are based on such theses.
  Results: We provide concrete advise for framing research questions,
structuring a report, as well as for planning and conducting empirical work
with practitioners.

Along the way, we prove that the formal series obtained as the composition of a

consequence, the composition of an $\mathcal{S}$-synchronized sequence and a

Gamma-ray binaries are systems that radiate the dominant part of
their non-thermal emission in the gamma-ray band. In a wind-driven scenario,
these binaries are thought to consist of a pulsar orbiting a massive star,
accelerating particles in the shock arising in the wind collision. Aims. We
develop a comprehensive, numerical model for the non-thermal emission of shock
accelerated particles including the dynamical effects of fluid instabilities
and orbital motion. We demonstrate the model on a generic binary system.
Methods. The model is built on a dedicated three-dimensional particle transport
simulation for the accelerated particles dynamically coupled to a simultaneous
relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the wind interaction. In a
post-processing step, a leptonic emission model involving synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission is evaluated based on resulting particle distributions
and fluid solutions, consistently accounting for relativistic boosting and
$\gamma\gamma$-absorption in the stellar radiation field. The model is
implemented as an extension to the Cronos code. Results. In the generic binary,
the wind interaction leads to the formation of an extended, asymmetric
wind-collision region distorted by the effects of orbital motion, mixing and
turbulence giving rise to strong shocks terminating the pulsar wind and
secondary shocks in the turbulent fluid flow. With the presented approach it
is, for the first time, possible to consistently account for the dynamical
shock structure in particle transport processes, yielding a complex
distribution of accelerated particles. The predicted emission extends over a
broad region of energy, with significant orbital modulation in all bands.

the effective spin is likely negative and the effective precession spin is
non-negligible. As for the NSBH merger, supposing the mass of the light object
follow the distribution of current neutron stars (NSs) with a reasonably
measured/constrained mass, the spin of the low mass BH is so small that is hard
to generate bright electromagnetic emission. Finally, we estimate a merger rate

problems by hierarchically constructing complex features from the raw input

exploiting unstructured auxiliary data such as visual and textual information,
and when it comes to using user-item rating matrix, feature extraction is done
by using matrix factorization. As matrix factorization has some limitations,
some works have been done to replace it with deep neural network. but these
works either need to exploit unstructured data such item's reviews or images,
or are specially designed to use implicit data and don't take user-item rating
matrix into account. In this paper, we investigate the usage of novel
representation learning algorithms to extract users and items representations
from rating matrix, and offer a deep neural network for Collaborative
Filtering. Our proposed approach is a modular algorithm consisted of two main
phases: REpresentation eXtraction and a deep neural NETwork (RexNet). Using two
joint and parallel neural networks in RexNet enables it to extract a hierarchy
of features for each entity in order to predict the degree of interest of users
to items. The resulted predictions are then used for the final recommendation.
Unlike other deep learning recommendation approaches, RexNet is not dependent
to unstructured auxiliary data such as visual and textual information, instead,
it uses only the user-item rate matrix as its input. We evaluated RexNet in an
extensive set of experiments against state of the art recommendation methods.
The results show that RexNet significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms
in a variety of data sets with different degrees of density.

whether, and how fast, a similar phenomenon occurs in a stochastic swarm of
simple agents whose goal is to maintain the same direction of motion for as
long as possible. The agents are randomly initiated as marching either
clockwise or counterclockwise on a wide ring-shaped region, which we model as
$k$ ""narrow"" concentric tracks on a cylinder. Collisions cause agents to change
their direction of motion. To avoid this, agents may decide to switch tracks so
as to merge with platoons of agents marching in their direction.
  We prove that such agents must eventually converge to a local consensus about
their direction of motion, meaning that all agents on each narrow track must
eventually march in the same direction. We give asymptotic bounds for the
expected amount of time it takes for such convergence or ""stabilization"" to
occur, which depends on the number of agents, the length of the tracks, and the
number of tracks. We show that when agents also have a small probability of
""erratic"", random track-jumping behaviour, a global consensus on the direction
of motion across all tracks will eventually be reached. Finally, we verify our
theoretical findings in numerical simulations.

management that is employed in many real-world scenarios such as detecting
credit card fraud in banks. The so-called complex events are expressed using a
specification language that is typically implemented and executed on a specific
runtime system. While the tight coupling of these two components has been
regarded as the key for supporting CEP at high performance, such dependencies
pose several inherent challenges as follows. (1) Application development atop a
CEP system requires extensive knowledge of how the runtime system operates,
which is typically highly complex in nature. (2) The specification language
dependence requires the need of domain experts and further restricts and
steepens the learning curve for application developers. In this paper, we
propose CEPLESS, a scalable data management system that decouples the
specification from the runtime system by building on the principles of
serverless computing. CEPLESS provides operator as a service and offers
flexibility by enabling the development of CEP application in any specification
language while abstracting away the complexity of the CEP runtime system. As
part of CEPLESS, we designed and evaluated novel mechanisms for in-memory
processing and batching that enables the stateful processing of CEP operators
even under high rates of ingested events. Our evaluation demonstrates that
CEPLESS can be easily integrated into existing CEP systems like Apache Flink
while attaining similar throughput under a high scale of events (up to 100K
events per second) and dynamic operator update in up to 238 ms.

used to displace the hole relative to the non-uniform strain profile, allowing
a new mechanism for electric modulation of the hole g-tensor. Using this
mechanism we demonstrate tuning of the hole $g$-factor by up to 500\%. In

  The review identifies 32 counting methods introduced during the period 1981 -
2018. Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework 1 describes
selected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes
arguments for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are
rank-dependent, fractionalized, and introduced to measure contribution,
participation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three criteria for internal
validity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting
methods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test
homogeneity of the counting methods. These methods and elements may be used to
assess the internal validity of counting methods. Finally, a literature search
finds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three of the 32
counting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three
counting methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the
studies that introduced the counting methods.
  The review provides practitioners in research evaluation and researchers in

Accepted by AAAI-21",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Representing a true label as a one-hot vector is a common practice in
training text classification models. However, the one-hot representation may
not adequately reflect the relation between the instances and labels, as labels
are often not completely independent and instances may relate to multiple
labels in practice. The inadequate one-hot representations tend to train the
model to be over-confident, which may result in arbitrary prediction and model
overfitting, especially for confused datasets (datasets with very similar
labels) or noisy datasets (datasets with labeling errors). While training
models with label smoothing (LS) can ease this problem in some degree, it still
fails to capture the realistic relation among labels. In this paper, we propose
a novel Label Confusion Model (LCM) as an enhancement component to current
popular text classification models. LCM can learn label confusion to capture
semantic overlap among labels by calculating the similarity between instances
and labels during training and generate a better label distribution to replace
the original one-hot label vector, thus improving the final classification
performance. Extensive experiments on five text classification benchmark
datasets reveal the effectiveness of LCM for several widely used deep learning
classification models. Further experiments also verify that LCM is especially
helpful for confused or noisy datasets and superior to the label smoothing
method.

that the bulk band gap in ZrTe5 is controlled by strain to the crystal,
realizing a more stabilized WTI state or an ideal Dirac semimetal state

21-cm power spectrum from $150 \, {\rm MHz}$ GMRT observations which
corresponds to the neutral hydrogen (HI) at redshift $z = 8.28$. Here TGE is
used to measure the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS)
$C_{\ell}(\Delta\nu)$ first, from which we estimate the 21-cm power spectrum
$P(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$. The data here are much too small for a detection,
and the aim is to demonstrate the capabilities of the estimator. We find that
the estimated power spectrum is consistent with the expected foreground and
noise behaviour. This demonstrates that this estimator correctly estimates the
noise bias and subtracts this out to yield an unbiased estimate of the power
spectrum. More than $47\%$ of the frequency channels had to be discarded from
the data owing to radio-frequency interference, however the estimated power
spectrum does not show any artifacts due to missing channels. Finally, we show
that it is possible to suppress the foreground contribution by tapering the sky
response at large angular separations from the phase center. We combine the k
modes within a rectangular region in the `EoR window' to obtain the spherically
binned averaged dimensionless power spectra $\Delta^{2}(k)$ along with the
statistical error $\sigma$ associated with the measured $\Delta^{2}(k)$. The
lowest $k$-bin yields $\Delta^{2}(k)=(61.47)^{2}\,{\rm K}^{2}$ at
$k=1.59\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, with $\sigma=(27.40)^{2} \, {\rm K}^{2}$. We
obtain a $2 \, \sigma$ upper limit of $(72.66)^{2}\,\textrm{K}^{2}$ on the mean

advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study
district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the
election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts.
District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a
natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and
plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the
manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters
(receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private
signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per
receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single
communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time,
we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single
communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction
between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private
signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than
(semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public
signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial
time unless P=NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design
of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing
so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design
a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems
beyond elections when the sender's utility function is state-dependent.

addresses weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), with the goal of
bridging the gap between image-level annotations and pixel-level segmentation.
We formulate WSSS as a novel group-wise learning task that explicitly models
semantic dependencies in a group of images to estimate more reliable pseudo
ground-truths, which can be used for training more accurate segmentation
models. In particular, we devise a graph neural network (GNN) for group-wise
semantic mining, wherein input images are represented as graph nodes, and the
underlying relations between a pair of images are characterized by an efficient
co-attention mechanism. Moreover, in order to prevent the model from paying
excessive attention to common semantics only, we further propose a graph
dropout layer, encouraging the model to learn more accurate and complete object
responses. The whole network is end-to-end trainable by iterative message
passing, which propagates interaction cues over the images to progressively
improve the performance. We conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012

the widespread adoption of open source projects. Without a license, any source

recent studies provide evidence that most popular open source projects have a
license, developers might lack confidence or expertise when they need to
combine software licenses, leading to a mistaken project license
unification.This license usage is challenged by the high degree of reuse that
occurs in the heart of modern software development practices, in which
third-party libraries and frameworks are easily and quickly integrated into a
software codebase.This scenario creates what we call ""multi-licensed"" projects,
which happens when one project has components that are licensed under more than
one license. Although these components exist at the file-level, they naturally
impact licensing decisions at the project-level. In this paper, we conducted a
mix-method study to shed some light on these questions. We started by parsing
1,426,263 (source code and non-source code) files available on 1,552 JavaScript

that 947 projects (61%) employ more than one license. On average, there are 4.7

urban planning. Trajectories provide detailed views on specific routes, but
typically do not capture all traffic. Loop detectors capture all traffic flow
at specific locations instead, but provide no information on individual routes.
Given a set of loop-detector measurements and a set of representative
trajectories, our goal is to investigate how one can effectively combine these
two partial data sources to create a more complete picture of the underlying
mobility. Specifically, we want to reconstruct a realistic set of routes from
the loop-detector data, using the given trajectories as representatives of
typical behavior.
  We model loop-detector data as a network flow that needs to be covered by the
reconstructed routes and we capture realism of the routes via the Fr\'echet
distance to the representatives. We prove that several forms of the resulting
problem are NP-hard. Hence we explore heuristics that decompose the flow well
while following the representatives to varying degrees. First we propose the
Fr\'echet Routes (FR) heuristic which generates candidates routes with bounded
Fr\'echet distance. Second we describe a variant of multi-commodity min-cost
flow (MCMCF) which is loosely coupled to the trajectories. Lastly we consider
global min-cost flow (GMCF) which is essentially agnostic to the
representatives.
  We evaluate these approaches on synthetic and real-world trajectory data with
a map-matched ground truth. We find that GMCF explains the flow best, but
produces a large number of routes (significantly more than the ground truth);
these routes are often nonsensical. MCMCF produces a large number of mostly
realistic routes which explain the flow reasonably well. In contrast, FR
produces significantly smaller sets of realistic routes that still explain the
flow well, albeit with a higher running time.

components define the structured context of labelled examples and the
confidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the

interpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our
framework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST

robust rules from perturbed MNIST data and achieve comparable or superior

the incident wavefronts and frequencies which are not partially reflected, but
are instead transmitted through the scatterer, or dissipated within it. We
analyze the relevant symmetry properties, and find that they support
exceptional points (EPs) which can be directly probed with steady-state
excitation.
  We study degenerate coherent perfect absorption (CPA EP), which is a specific
example of the new kind of EP mentioned above. We show that the CPA EP is
chiral in a ring resonator, and use this to design a resonator which
predominantly absorbs or reflects light, depending on the direction of

  We extend CPA from cavities with a linear dielectric response to include the
saturating nonlinearity and dispersion of a two-level absorbing medium. We show
that the SALT algorithm in the single-mode regime can also be used to find the
saturable CPA modes through a simple mapping. We also clarify the bad-cavity
limit of dispersive but linear CPA, identifying new modes that are hybrids of
the cavity and atomic degrees of freedom.
  We present and solve the general problem of scattering from an arbitrary
cavity with a saturable two-level amplifying or absorbing medium, generalizing
the known phenomenology of bistability that has mainly been studied in
structures with little or no spatial complexity. We carefully analyze the
validity of approximations used for isolated resonances, and find that the
previously used inverse single-pole approximation requires some modification
for the case of scattering.

$\gamma$-rays energy ($E_{\gamma}\leq 12$ MeV), which is caused by the pygmy
dipole resonance (PDR), is treated within the phonon damping model (PDM) plus
exact thermal pairing (EP) without adding any extra PDR strength function. The
numerical calculations performed for $^{161-163}$Dy show that, because of the
effect of EP, the EP+PDM can describe reasonably well the total RSF data in
both low- and high-energy regions of $\gamma$-rays. Consequently, as compared
to the conventional description within the phenomenological generalized
Lorentzian (GLO) and standard Lorentzian (SLO) models, the EP+PDM calculations
can eliminate at least eight free parameters. This indicates the important role
of microscopic approaches towards the precise description of the RSF. In
particular, temperature is found to have significant contributions to the RSF
below the neutron separation energy, questioning again the validity of the
Brink-Axel hypothesis in this energy region.

the pressure of optimal trade-off between reducing wiring cost and promoting
communication efficiency. However, the question of whether this trade-off
exists in empirical human brain networks and, if so, how it takes effect is
still not well understood. Here, we employed a multiobjective evolutionary
algorithm to directly and quantitatively explore the cost-efficiency trade-off
in human brain networks. Using this algorithm, we generated a population of
synthetic networks with optimal but diverse cost-efficiency trade-offs. It was
found that these synthetic networks could not only reproduce a large portion of
connections in the empirical brain networks but also embed a resembling
small-world structure. Moreover, the synthetic and empirical brain networks
were found similar in terms of the spatial arrangement of hub regions and the
modular structure, which are two important topological features widely assumed
to be outcomes of cost-efficiency trade-offs. The synthetic networks had high
robustness against random attack as the empirical brain networks did.
Additionally, we also revealed some differences of the synthetic networks from
the empirical brain networks, including lower segregated processing capacity
and weaker robustness against targeted attack. These findings provide direct
and quantitative evidence that the structure of human brain networks is indeed
largely influenced by optimal cost-efficiency trade-offs. We also suggest that
some additional factors (e.g., segregated processing capacity) might jointly
determine the network organization with cost and efficiency.

the world, they were all conceived on the premise of predictable, controllable
generation with nonnegligible marginal costs. Recent changes, specifically, the
increasing renewable integration, have challenged such assumptions. In light of
this shift, this thesis intends to devise new frameworks and advance our
understanding of the future markets. The first part focuses on mechanism design
when the model fully reflects the physics of the grid and the participants. We
consider a market that involves continuous goods, general nonconvex
constraints, and second stage costs. We then design the payments and conditions
under which coalitions cannot influence the outcome. Under the
incentive-compatible VCG mechanism, we prove that coalition-proof outcomes are
achieved if bids are convex and constraints are polymatroids. By relaxing
incentive-compatibility, we investigate core-selecting mechanisms that are
coalition-proof without conditions. We show that they generalize the economic
rationale of the LMP mechanism, and can approximate truthfulness without the
price-taking assumption. Finally, they are budget-balanced. The second part
coordinates regional markets to exploit the geographic diversification of
renewables. In Europe, reserves remain an exclusive responsibility of regional
operators. This limited coordination and the sequential structure hinder the
utilization of generation and transmission. To promote reserve exchange, a
preemptive model can optimally withdraw inter-area transmission capacity from
day-ahead energy for reserves. This bilevel program however does not suggest
costs that guarantee coordination. We formulate a new preemptive model that
allows us to obtain stable benefits immune to deviations. Our proposal,
least-core benefits, achieves minimal stability violation with a tractable
computation.

induce the driving forces of the dynamical system. Our approach is illustrated

completion problem of a third order tensor was proposed, which performed better
than some existing methods. Tubal rank is only defined on one mode of third
order tensor without low rank structure in the other two modes. That is, low
rank structures on the other two modes are missing. Motivated by this, we first
introduce multi-tubal rank, and then establish a relationship between
multi-tubal rank and Tucker rank. Based on the multi-tubal rank, we propose a
novel low rank tensor completion model. For this model, a tensor factorization
based method is applied and the corresponding convergence anlysis is
established. In addition, spatio-temporal characteristics are intrinsic
features in video and internet traffic tensor data. To get better performance,
we make full use of such features and improve the established tensor completion
model. Then we apply tensor factorization based method for the improved model.
Finally, numerical results are reported on the completion of image, video and
internet traffic data to show the efficiency of our proposed methods. From the
reported numerical results, we can assert that our methods outperform the
existing methods.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. ICN can benefit from Complex Event
Processing (CEP), which is an in-network processing paradigm to specify and
perform efficient query operations on data streams. However, integrating CEP
into ICN is a challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) typical ICN
architectures do not provide support for forwarding and processing continuous
data streams; (2) IoT applications often need short response times and require
robust event detection, which both are hard to accomplish using existing CEP
systems.
  In this article, we present a novel network architecture, called INetCEP, for
efficient CEP-based in-network processing as part of ICN. INetCEP enables
efficient data processing in ICN by means of (1) a unified communication model
that supports continuous data streams, (2) a meta query language for CEP to
specify data processing operations in the data plane, and (3) query processing
algorithms to resolve the specified operations. Our experimental results for
two IoT use cases and datasets show that INetCEP offers very short response
times of up to 73 {\mu}s under high workload and is more than 15X faster in
terms of forwarding events than the state-of-the-art CEP system Flink.
Furthermore, the delivery and processing of complex queries is around 32X
faster than Flink and more than 100X faster than a naive pull-based reference
approach, while maintaining 100% accuracy.

with kernels beyond Einstein-de Sitter (EdS), that can be applied to a wide
variety of generalized cosmologies. We build upon a formalism that was recently
employed for standard cosmology in Chen, Vlah & White (2020), and utilize an
expansion of the density-weighted velocity moment generating function that
explicitly separates the magnitude of the $k$-modes and their angle to the
line-of-sight direction dependencies. We compute the PS for matter and biased
tracers to 1-loop Perturbation Theory (PT) and show that the expansion has a
correct infrared and ultraviolet behavior, free of unwanted divergences. We
also add Effective Field Theory (EFT) counterterms, necessary to account for
small-scale contributions to PT, and employ an IR-resummation prescription to
properly model the smearing of the BAO due to large scale bulk flows within
Standard-PT. To demonstrate the applicability of our formalism, we apply it on
the $\Lambda$CDM and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models, and compare our numerical
results against the ELEPHANT suite of $N$-body simulations, finding very good
agreement up to $k= 0.27\, \text{Mpc}^{-1} h$ at $z=0.5$ for the first three
non-vanishing Legendre multipoles of the PS. To our knowledge, the model
presented in this work is the most accurate theoretical EFT-PT for modified
gravity to date, being the only one that accounts for beyond linear local
biasing in redshift-space. Hence, we argue our RSD modeling is a promising tool
to construct theoretical templates in order to test deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM using real data obtained from the next stage of cosmological
surveys such as DESI and LSST.

suffer from frequent page table walks. We investigate two complementary
techniques for addressing this cost: reducing the number of accesses required
and reducing the latency of each access. The first approach is accomplished by
opportunistically ""flattening"" the page table: merging two levels of
traditional 4KB page table nodes into a single 2MB node, thereby reducing the
table's depth and the number of indirections required to search it. The second
is accomplished by biasing the cache replacement algorithm to keep page table
entries during periods of high TLB miss rates, as these periods also see high
data miss rates and are therefore more likely to benefit from having the
smaller page table in the cache than to suffer from increased data cache
misses.
  We evaluate these approaches for both native and virtualized systems and
across a range of realistic memory fragmentation scenarios, describe the
limited changes needed in our kernel implementation and hardware design,
identify and address challenges related to self-referencing page tables and
kernel memory allocation, and compare results across server and mobile systems
using both academic and industrial simulators for robustness.
  We find that flattening does reduce the number of accesses required on a page
walk (to 1.0), but its performance impact (+2.3%) is small due to Page Walker
Caches (already 1.5 accesses). Prioritizing caching has a larger effect
(+6.8%), and the combination improves performance by +9.2%. Flattening is more
effective on virtualized systems (4.4 to 2.8 accesses, +7.1% performance), due
to 2D page walks. By combining the two techniques we demonstrate a
state-of-the-art +14.0% performance gain and -8.7% dynamic cache energy and
-4.7% dynamic DRAM energy for virtualized execution with very simple hardware
and software changes.

efficient soft-output detectors based on two forms of channel puncturing:
augmented and two-sided. The augmented WL detector (AWLD) employs a punctured
channel derived by triangularizing the true channel in augmented form, followed
by leftsided Gaussian elimination. The two-sided WL detector (dubbed WLZ)
employs right-sided reduction and left-sided elimination to puncture the
channel. We prove that augmented channel puncturing is optimal in maximizing
the lower-bound on the achievable information rate (AIR) based on a new
mismatched detection model. We show that the AWLD decomposes into an MMSE
prefilter and channel gain compensation stages, followed by a regular WL
detector (WLD) that computes least-squares softdecision estimates. Similarly,
WLZ decomposes into a pre-processing reduction step followed by WLD. AWLD
attains the same performance as the existing AIR-based partial marginalization
(PM) detector, but with less computational complexity. We empirically show that
WLZ attains the best complexityperformance tradeoff among tree-based detectors.

are quite general, in this paper we focus on two specific questions.
  The first concerns crisis detection, which is of prime interest for the
public in general and for policy makers in particular because of the
significant impact that crises have on the economy. Certain features in stock
markets lead to this type of anomaly detection: Given the assets' returns, we
describe the relationship between portfolios' return and volatility by means of
a copula, without making any assumption on investor strategies. We examine a
recent method relying on copulae to construct an appropriate indicator that
allows us to automate crisis detection. On real data, the indicator detects all
past crashes in the cryptocurrency market, whereas from the DJ600-Europe index,
from 1990 to 2008, the indicator identifies correctly 4 crises and issues one
false positive for which we offer an explanation.
  Our second contribution is to introduce an original computational framework
to model asset allocation strategies, which is of independent interest for
digital finance and its applications. Our approach addresses the crucial
question of evaluating portfolio management, and is relevant to individual
managers as well as financial institutions. To evaluate portfolio performance,
we provide a new portfolio score, based on the aforementioned framework and
concepts. In particular, our score relies on the statistical properties of
portfolios, and we show how they can be computed efficiently.

exoplanet detection. It relies on sophisticated data processing to reach high
contrasts at small angular separations. Most data processing techniques of this
type are based on the angular differential imaging (ADI) observing strategy to
perform the reference PSF subtraction, and generally make use of
signal-to-noise (S/N) maps to infer the existence of planetary signals via
thresholding. An alternative method for generating the final detection map was
recently proposed with the regime-switching model (RSM) map, which uses a
regime-switching framework to generate a probability map based on cubes of
residuals generated by different PSF subtraction techniques. In this paper, we
present several improvements to the original RSM map, focusing on novel PSF
subtraction techniques and their optimal combinations, as well as a new
procedure for estimating the probabilities involved. We started by implementing
two forward-model versions of the RSM map algorithm based on the LOCI and KLIP
PSF subtraction techniques. We then addressed the question of optimally
selecting the PSF subtraction techniques to optimise the overall performance of
the RSM map. A new forward-backward approach was also implemented to take into
account both past and future observations to compute the RSM map probabilities,
leading to improved precision in terms of astrometry and lowering the
background speckle noise. We tested the ability of these various improvements
to increase the performance of the RSM map based on different data sets via a
computation of ROC curves. These results demonstrate the benefits of these
proposed improvements. Finally, we present a new framework to generate contrast
curves based on probability maps. The contrast curves highlight the higher
performance of the RSM map compared to a standard S/N map at small angular
separations.

elements of the cosmic web are clusters and filaments, separated by voids
filling most of the volume. In individual 2D sheets positions of clusters and
filaments do not coincide. As a result, in projection clusters and filaments
fill in 2D voids. This leads to the decrease of amplitudes of CFs in
projection. For this reason amplitudes of 2D CFs are lower than amplitudes of
3D CFs, the difference is the larger, the thicker are 2D samples. Using PS and

proposed as a tool to support the health authorities in their quest to

Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy

notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the

We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the
operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health
authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing
(even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and
Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in
practice by health authorities, and how it introduces the risk of function

hypothesis i) is statistically unlikely with regards to the data we collected.
We then show some interesting correlation with hypothesis ii), suggesting that

Free-carrier absorption in the highly doped n- and p-layers is minimized by
positioning them close to a node of the vacuum electromagnetic-field. The
surface, however, resides at an anti-node of the vacuum field and results in
significant loss. These losses are much reduced by surface passivation. The
strong dependence on wavelength implies that the main effect of the surface
passivation is to eliminate the surface electric field, thereby quenching
below-bandgap absorption via a Franz-Keldysh-like effect. An additional benefit
is that the surface passivation reduces scattering at the GaAs surface. These
results are important in other nano-photonic devices which rely on a

computation-intensive and time-sensitive applications, such as recommendation
systems and daily payment methods. However, computing task competition
involving limited resources increases the task processing latency and energy
consumption of mobile devices, as well as time constraints. Mobile edge
computing (MEC) has been widely used to address these problems. However, there
are limitations to existing methods used during computation offloading. On the
one hand, they focus on independent tasks rather than dependent tasks. The
challenges of task dependency in the real world, especially task segmentation
and integration, remain to be addressed. On the other hand, the multiuser
scenarios related to resource allocation and the mutex access problem must be
considered. In this paper, we propose a novel offloading approach, Com-DDPG,
for MEC using multiagent reinforcement learning to enhance the offloading
performance. First, we discuss the task dependency model, task priority model,
energy consumption model, and average latency from the perspective of server
clusters and multidependence on mobile tasks. Our method based on these models
is introduced to formalize communication behavior among multiple agents; then,
reinforcement learning is executed as an offloading strategy to obtain the
results. Because of the incomplete state information, long short-term memory
(LSTM) is employed as a decision-making tool to assess the internal state.
Moreover, to optimize and support effective action, we consider using a
bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) to learn and enhance features
obtained from agents' communication. Finally, we simulate experiments on the
Alibaba cluster dataset. The results show that our method is better than other
baselines in terms of energy consumption, load status and latency.

in which a large number of devices contend for transmitting timely status
packets to their corresponding receivers over wireless noisy channels, using a
carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme. When each device completes one
transmission, due to possible transmission failure, two cases with and without
transmission feedback to each device must be considered. Particularly, for the
case with no feedback, the device uses policy (I): It will go to an idle state
and release the channel regardless of the outcome of the transmission. For the
case with perfect feedback, if the transmission succeeds, the device will go to
an idle state, otherwise, it uses either policy (W), i.e., it will go to a
waiting state and re-contend for channel access; or it uses policy (S), i.e.,
it will stay at a service state and occupy this channel to attempt another
transmission. For those three policies, the closed-form expressions of the
average age of information (AoI) of each device are characterized under schemes
with and without preemption in service. It is shown that, for each policy, the
scheme with preemption in service always achieves a smaller average AoI,
compared with the scheme without preemption. Then, a mean-field approximation
approach with guaranteed accuracy is developed to analyze the asymptotic
performance for the considered system with an infinite number of devices and
the effects of the system parameters on the average AoI are characterized.
Simulation results show that the proposed mean-field approximation is accurate
even for a small number of devices. The results also show that policy (S)
achieves the smallest average AoI compared with policies (I) and (W), and the
average AoI does not always decrease with the arrival rate for all three
policies.

generically more involved and richer than the effective Proca equation adopted
as a model in previous work. We discuss the general equations and focus on the
case of a cold plasma in the background of a spherically-symmetric black hole,
showing that the system admits plasma-driven, quasibound electromagnetic states
that are prone to become superradiantly unstable when the black hole rotates.
The quasibound states are different from those of the Proca equation and have
some similarities with the case of a massive scalar field, suggesting that the
linear instability can be strongly suppressed compared to previous estimates.
Our framework provides the first step towards a full understanding of the
plasma-photon interactions around astrophysical black holes.

  Shuffles","155 pages, PhD thesis",,,,"math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this thesis we introduce a new type of card shuffle called the one-sided
transposition shuffle. At each step a card is chosen uniformly from the pack
and then transposed with another card chosen uniformly from below it. This
defines a random walk on the symmetric group generated by a distribution which
is non-constant on the conjugacy class of transpositions. Nevertheless, we
provide an explicit formula for all eigenvalues of the shuffle by demonstrating
a useful correspondence between eigenvalues and standard Young tableaux. This
allows us to prove the existence of a total-variation cutoff for the one-sided
transposition shuffle at time $n\log n$. We also study weighted generalisations
of the one-sided transposition shuffle called biased one-sided transposition
shuffles. We compute the full spectrum for every biased one-sided transposition
shuffle, and prove the existence of a total variation cutoff for certain
choices of weighted distribution. In particular, we recover the eigenvalues and
well known mixing time of the classical random transposition shuffle. We study
the hyperoctahedral group as an extension of the symmetric group, and formulate
the one-sided transposition shuffle and random transposition shuffle as random
walks on this new group. We determine the spectrum of each hyperoctahedral
shuffle by developing a correspondence between their eigenvalues and standard
Young bi-tableaux. We prove that the one-sided transposition shuffle on the
hyperoctahedral group exhibits a cutoff at $n\log n$, the same time as its
symmetric group counterpart. We conjecture that this results extends to the
biased one-sided transposition shuffles and the random transposition shuffle on

First, I show that our definition is in fact a formalization of Wright's famous

approaches to causation that are claimed to stand in opposition to each other.
Second, I modify our definition to offer a substantial improvement: I weaken
the difference-making condition in such a way that it avoids the problematic

of causation forms a natural compromise between counterfactual approaches and

We developed a new methodology to generate images to form a uniform time
series. We adjusted each image's contrast until the FWHM of the normalized
intensity distribution attained a value between 0.10 and 0.11. This methodology
of the ""Equal Contrast technique"" is expected to compensate for the change of
emulsion, development, contrast of the images due to centering of Ca-K line on
the exit slit and sky transparency. Besides, this procedure will correct
variations in density-to-intensity conversion for different images. We find
that the correlation between sunspot and Ca-K line data improves by a large
amount. For example, correlation coefficient (CC) between monthly averaged
sunspots and Ca-K plage areas for the equal contrast data improves to 0.9
compared to 0.75 for the ""Good"" data with unequal contrast. The CC for equal
contrast images improves to $\sim$0.78 from $\sim$0.46 for the ""Okay"" data with

farside. The problem is referred to as the lunar farside highlands problem. In
this article, the author deduces the center of mass shift of the moon from its
geometrical center and the difference in crustal thickness between the far and
near lunar sides necessary to explain it. Although there have been other
theories proposed to explain these phenomena, this theory explains them as
arising naturally from the effects on lunar material due to the earth's
external gravity force and the moon's synchronous rotation and revolution. The
author's mathematical model results in a calculated value of 1.6 km for the
center of mass shift and a crustal thickness difference of 16 km. The author's
deduced values of center of mass shift and crustal thickness difference are
close to within about 5 to 10% of their accepted values. One unexpected and

essentially treated as a non-fundamental force of entropic origin. A number of
good studies have been carried out in this direction. Quantum gravity has also
significantly improved our understanding by combining gravity well with quantum
physics. However, there are still many impediments to our understanding
especially in the limits of extreme. The effects of quantum gravity start
appearing on the scene at Planck length which is the smallest length in nature
idealized so far. While as this study incorporates a model which is valid for
potential energy corrections at small distances but we have also given a bold
try to use it confidently for the corrections at very large distances as well.
The model uses two techniques namely Boltzmann and Tsallis statistical
approaches to explore the thermodynamics within the ambit of brane world model
giving its further modified version. We have computed partition function by
using both Boltzmann and Tsallis statistical approaches and then used it to
study thermodynamics of the brane world model. We have analyzed both
analytically and graphically, the thermodynamic quantities like Helmholtz free
energy and specific heat. The thermodynamic stability of the model is also
discussed depending on the number of galaxies.

apparatus of natural language understanding. This, we argue, will provide a
basis for more realistic, computationally sound, and scalable models of natural
language dialogue, syntax and semantics. Given that the bottom up, inductively
constructed, semantic and syntactic structures are brittle, and seemingly
incapable of adequately representing the meaning of longer sentences or
realistic dialogues, natural language understanding is in need of a new
foundation. Coinduction, which uses top down constraints, has been successfully
used in the design of operating systems and programming languages. Moreover,
implicitly it has been present in text mining, machine translation, and in some
attempts to model intensionality and modalities, which provides evidence that
it works. This article shows high level formalizations of some of such uses.
  Since coinduction and induction can coexist, they can provide a common
language and a conceptual model for research in natural language understanding.
In particular, such an opportunity seems to be emerging in research on
compositionality. This article shows several examples of the joint appearance
of induction and coinduction in natural language processing. We argue that the
known individual limitations of induction and coinduction can be overcome in
empirical settings by a combination of the the two methods. We see an open
problem in providing a theory of their joint use.

if new states are somehow hidden. In models with extended Higgs sectors, large
deviations in the Higgs trilinear coupling can appear at one loop because of
non-decoupling effects in the radiative corrections involving the additional
scalar states. It is then natural to ask how two-loop corrections modify this
result, and whether new large corrections can appear again. We present new
results on the dominant two-loop corrections to the Higgs trilinear coupling in
several models with extended scalar sectors. We illustrate the analytical
expressions with numerical examples and show that, while they remain smaller
than their one-loop counterparts and do not modify significantly the
non-decoupling effects observed at one loop, the two-loop corrections are not
entirely negligible -- a typical size being 10-20% of the one-loop corrections.

reduce privacy risks by not explicitly sharing private data. However, recent
works demonstrated that sharing model updates makes FL vulnerable to inference
attacks. In this work, we show our key observation that the data representation
leakage from gradients is the essential cause of privacy leakage in FL. We also
provide an analysis of this observation to explain how the data presentation is

degraded, while FL performance is maintained. In addition, we derive certified
robustness guarantee to FL and convergence guarantee to FedAvg, after applying
our defense. To evaluate our defense, we conduct experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR10 for defending against the DLG attack and GS attack. Without sacrificing
accuracy, the results demonstrate that our proposed defense can increase the

search the K nearest neighbors from the whole training sample space, referred
them to the lazy part of KNN classification. This lazy part has been the
bottleneck problem of applying KNN classification due to the complete search of
K nearest neighbors. In this paper, a one-step computation is proposed to
replace the lazy part of KNN classification. The one-step computation actually
transforms the lazy part to a matrix computation as follows. Given a test data,
training samples are first applied to fit the test data with the least squares
loss function. And then, a relationship matrix is generated by weighting all
training samples according to their influence on the test data. Finally, a
group lasso is employed to perform sparse learning of the relationship matrix.
In this way, setting K value and searching K nearest neighbors are both
integrated to a unified computation. In addition, a new classification rule is
proposed for improving the performance of one-step KNN classification. The

allowed us to identify three molecular components associated with the nebula,
namely: at $-$39 km/s (component A), $-$25 km/s (component B), and $-$17 km/s
(component C). Six molecular condensations (MC1 to MC6) were identified in
component A, with MC3 (the densest and more massive one) being the molecular
counterpart of IRAS12326-6245. For this source, we estimated an H$_2$ column
density up to 8$\times$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. To explain the morphology and
velocity of components A, B, and C, we propose a simple model consisting of a
partially complete semisphere-like structure expanding at ~ 12 km/s. The

in which a star loses mass to its companion. Assuming that the donor star loses
mass along the instantaneous interstellar axis, we derive the orbit-averaged
equations of motion describing the evolution of the donor rotational angular
momentum vector (spin) which accompanies the transfer of mass. We consider: (i)
a model in which the mass transfer rate is constant within each orbit and (ii)
a phase-dependent rate in which all mass per orbit is lost at periapsis. In
both cases, we find that the ejection of $\gtrsim 30$ per cent of the donor's
initial mass causes its spin to nearly flip onto the orbital plane of the
binary, independently of the initial spin-orbit alignment. Moreover, we show
that the spin flip due to mass transfer can easily dominate over tidal
synchronisation in any giant stars and main-sequence stars with masses
$\sim1.5$ to $5\,\rm M_\odot$. Finally, the general equations of motion,
including tides, are used to evolve a realistic population of massive binary
stars leading to the formation of binary black holes. Assuming that the stellar
core and envelope are fully coupled, the resulting tilt of the first-born black
hole reduces its spin projection onto the orbit normal by a factor
$\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This result supports previous studies in favour of an
insignificant contribution to the effective spin projection, $\chi_{\rm eff}$,

available in other machine learning setups. In this work, we propose a
detection strategy to identify adversarial support sets, aimed at destroying
the understanding of a few-shot classifier for a certain class. We achieve this
by introducing the concept of self-similarity of a support set and by employing
filtering of supports. Our method is attack-agnostic, and we are the first to
explore adversarial detection for support sets of few-shot classifiers to the
best of our knowledge. Our evaluation of the miniImagenet (MI) and CUB datasets
exhibits good attack detection performance despite conceptual simplicity,
showing high AUROC scores. We show that self-similarity and filtering for
adversarial detection can be paired with other filtering functions,
constituting a generalisable concept.

usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This
is in contrast to the ""open world"" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be
deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect
so-called ""out-of-distribution"" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's
semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A
natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise
softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves
that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy
and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on
these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we
re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and
consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on
completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent
post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called ""meta
classification"". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted
metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we
consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance,
cutting down the number of detection errors by up to 52% when comparing the
best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only
marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method
contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.

services. They process large collections of items, for instance web pages or
e-commerce products, and present the user with a small ordered selection. The
goal of a ranking system is to help a user find the items they are looking for
with the least amount of effort. Thus the rankings they produce should place
the most relevant or preferred items at the top of the ranking. Learning to
rank is a field within machine learning that covers methods which optimize
ranking systems w.r.t. this goal. Traditional supervised learning to rank
methods utilize expert-judgements to evaluate and learn, however, in many
situations such judgements are impossible or infeasible to obtain. As a
solution, methods have been introduced that perform learning to rank based on
user clicks instead. The difficulty with clicks is that they are not only
affected by user preferences, but also by what rankings were displayed.
Therefore, these methods have to prevent being biased by other factors than
user preference. This thesis concerns learning to rank methods based on user
clicks and specifically aims to unify the different families of these methods.
  As a whole, the second part of this thesis proposes a framework that bridges
many gaps between areas of online, counterfactual, and supervised learning to
rank. It has taken approaches, previously considered independent, and unified
them into a single methodology for widely applicable and effective learning to
rank from user clicks.

is able to approximate, numerically at least, the solutions of the Kolmogorov

  In this contribution we study variants of the deep networks by using
different discretizations schemes of the stochastic differential equation. We
compare the performance of the associated networks, on benchmarked examples,

complex cell, based on Gaussian derivatives. It is most important to account
for the insensitivity of the complex response to small shifts of the image. The
new model uses a linear combination of the first few derivative filters, at a
single position, to approximate the first derivative filter, at a series of

that is insensitive to small shifts of the image. This model, unlike previous
approaches, is based on the scale space theory of visual processing. In
particular, the complex cell is built from filters that respond to the \twod\

are studied in one and two dimensions, using the steerability of the Gaussian
derivatives. The response of the model to basic images, such as edges and
gratings, is derived formally. The response to natural images is also
evaluated, using statistical measures of shift insensitivity. The relevance of

reinforcement learning: non-stationarity and exponential growth of state-action
space, by combining Deep-Q Networks for policy learning with Nash equilibrium
for action selection. Q-values proxy as payoffs in Nash settings, and mutual
best responses define joint action selection. Coordination is implicit because
multiple/no Nash equilibria are resolved deterministically. We demonstrate that
knowledge of game type leads to an assumption of mirrored best responses and
faster convergence than Nash-Q. Specifically, the Friend-or-Foe algorithm
demonstrates signs of convergence to a Set Controller which jointly chooses
actions for two agents. This encouraging given the highly unstable nature of
decentralized coordination over joint actions. Inspired by the dueling network
architecture, which decouples the Q-function into state and advantage streams,
as well as residual networks, we learn both a single and joint agent
representation, and merge them via element-wise addition. This simplifies
coordination by recasting it is as learning a residual function. We also draw
high level comparative insights on key MADRL and game theoretic variables:
competitive vs. cooperative, asynchronous vs. parallel learning, greedy versus
socially optimal Nash equilibria tie breaking, and strategies for the no Nash
equilibrium case. We evaluate on 3 custom environments written in Python using

  Traffic Video Data",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the
on-ramps has been widely implemented to improve vehicle mobility of the
freeway. Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on
predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic
volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which
have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and
provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video
data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses
traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies
directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study
demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the
proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2)
shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream
of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to
extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering
controls.

widely employed in image generation and translation tasks. However, when fed
with a flat input, current CNN models may fail to generate vivid results due to
the spatially shared convolution kernels. We call it the flatness degradation
of CNNs. Unfortunately, such degradation is the greatest obstacles to generate
a spatially-variant output from a flat input, which has been barely discussed
in the previous literature. To tackle this problem, we propose a model agnostic
solution, i.e. Noise Incentive Block (NIB), which serves as a generic plug-in
for any CNN generation model. The key idea is to break the flat input condition
while keeping the intactness of the original information. Specifically, the NIB
perturbs the input data symmetrically with a noise map and reassembles them in
the feature domain as driven by the objective function. Extensive experiments
show that existing CNN models equipped with NIB survive from the flatness
degradation and are able to generate visually better results with richer
details in some specific image generation tasks given flat inputs, e.g.
semantic image synthesis, data-hidden image generation, and deep neural
dithering.

unexpected event due to incomplete knowledge about the data distribution or an
unknown process that suddenly comes into play and distorts observations. Due to
such events' rarity, to train deep learning models on the Anomaly Detection
(AD) task, scientists only rely on ""normal"" data, i.e., non-anomalous samples.
Thus, letting the neural network infer the distribution beneath the input data.
In such a context, we propose a novel framework, named Multi-layer One-Class
ClassificAtion (MOCCA),to train and test deep learning models on the AD task.
Specifically, we applied it to autoencoders. A key novelty in our work stems
from the explicit optimization of intermediate representations for the AD task.
Indeed, differently from commonly used approaches that consider a neural
network as a single computational block, i.e., using the output of the last
layer only, MOCCA explicitly leverages the multi-layer structure of deep
architectures. Each layer's feature space is optimized for AD during training,
while in the test phase, the deep representations extracted from the trained
layers are combined to detect anomalies. With MOCCA, we split the training
process into two steps. First, the autoencoder is trained on the reconstruction
task only. Then, we only retain the encoder tasked with minimizing the L_2
distance between the output representation and a reference point, the
anomaly-free training data centroid, at each considered layer. Subsequently, we
combine the deep features extracted at the various trained layers of the
encoder model to detect anomalies at inference time. To assess the performance
of the models trained with MOCCA, we conduct extensive experiments on publicly
available datasets. We show that our proposed method reaches comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art approaches available in the
literature.

of two camera pose estimators that deal with the information from pairwise

Transformer-like structure is adopted to build a geometry model over a local

to supervised and traditional ones on the KITTI and Malaga dataset.

robotic systems. Extracting the exact section and re-observing the extracted
video section in detail is important for imitating complex skills because human
motions give valuable hints for robots. However, the general video
understanding methods focus more on the understanding of the full frame,lacking
consideration on extracting accurate sections and aligning them with the
human's intent. We propose a Learning-from-Observation framework that splits
and understands a video of a human demonstration with verbal instructions to
extract accurate action sequences. The splitting is done based on local minimum
points of the hand velocity, which align human daily-life actions with
object-centered face contact transitions required for generating robot motion.
Then, we extract a motion description on the split videos using video
captioning techniques that are trained from our new daily-life action video
dataset. Finally, we match the motion descriptions with the verbal instructions
to understand the correct human intent and ignore the unintended actions inside
the video. We evaluate the validity of hand velocity-based video splitting and
demonstrate that it is effective. The experimental results on our new video
captioning dataset focusing on daily-life human actions demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. The source code, trained models, and the
dataset will be made available.

equations (RQMEs) should remain in low momentum motion. However, it is found
that some formulas from RQMEs were lost in Schr\""odinger equation. For example,
a free relativistic particle has positive and negative energy branches. The
former includes positive kinetic energy (PKE) and the latter negative kinetic
energy (NKE). The latter should be treated on an equal footing as the former.
Nevertheless, from Schr\""odinger equation, a free particle can have only PKE.
Starting from RQMEs and taking low momentum approximation, we derive NKE
Schr\""odinger equation which is for the cases that free particles have NKE.
Thus negative energy branch of RQMEs can be retained in low momentum motion. We
point out a fact that whether Schr\""odinger equation is applicable in a region
where a particle's energy E is less than potential V, E<V, has never been
quantitatively verified. In such a region NKE Schr\""odinger equation should be
employed. With the help of NKE Schr\""odinger equation, the lost formulas are
recovered. The so-called difficulty of negative probability of Klein-Gordon
equation for free particles is solved. A PKE (NKE) particle can have stationary
motion only when it is subject to an attractive (repulsive) potential, which is
determined by Virial theorem. Two NKE electrons in a potential can constitute a
stablesystem, a new kind of possible mechanism for electron paring. The whole
discussion stems from RQMEs with no any new postulation. Experiments are
suggested, which may confirm that there are indeed NKE electrons.
