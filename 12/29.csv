computing systems. State-of-the-art memory security-reliability co-designs
(e.g. Synergy) have achieved a good balance on performance, confidentiality,
integrity, and reliability. However, these works merely rely on encryption to
ensure data confidentiality, which has been proven unable to prevent
information leakage from memory access patterns. Ring ORAM is an attractive
confidential protection protocol to hide memory access patterns to the
untrusted storage system. Unfortunately, it does not compatible with the
security-reliability co-designs. A forced combination would result in more
severe performance loss.
  In this paper, we propose IRO, an Integrity and Reliability enhanced Ring
ORAM design. To reduce the overhead of integrity verification, we propose a low
overhead integrity tree RIT and use a Minimum Update Subtree Tree (MUST) to
reduce metadata update overhead. To improve memory reliability, we present
Secure Replication to provide channel-level error resilience for the ORAM tree
and use the mirrored channel technique to guarantee the reliability of the
MUST. Last, we use the error correction pointer (ECP) to repair permanent
memory cell fault to further improve device reliability and lifetime. A compact
metadata design is used to reduce the storage and consulting overhead of the
ECP.
  IRO provides strong security and reliability guarantees, while the resulting
storage and performance overhead is very small. Our evaluation shows that IRO
only increases 7.54% execution time on average over the Baseline under two
channels four AES-GCM units setting. With enough AES-GCM units to perform
concurrent MAC computing, IRO can reduce 2.14% execution time of the Baseline.

universal representation learning, i.e., embeddings of different levels of

granular objectives into the pre-training stage. We conduct experiments on
datasets for English and Chinese including the GLUE and CLUE benchmarks, where
our model surpasses its baselines and alternatives on a wide range of
downstream tasks. We present our approach of constructing analogy datasets in
terms of words, phrases and sentences and experiment with multiple
representation models to examine geometric properties of the learned vector
space through a task-independent evaluation. Finally, we verify the
effectiveness of our unified pre-training strategy in two real-world text

download the fresh files from the server in a certain period of time. Each user
can get the fresh files from any relay as long as the relay has stored the

updating capacity of each relay, different cache designs will lead to different
average freshness of all updating files at users. In order to keep the average
freshness as large as possible in the cache updating system, we formulate an
average freshness-optimal cache updating problem (AFOCUP) to obtain an optimal
cache scheme. However, because of the nonlinearity of the AFOCUP, it is
difficult to seek out the optimal cache scheme. As a result, an linear
approximate model is suggested by distributing the total update rates
completely in accordance with the number of files in the relay in advance. Then
we utilize the greedy algorithm to search the optimal cache scheme that is

increasingly rely on sharing time-sensitive information for monitoring and

fresh, as outdated information loses its value and can lead to system failures
and safety risks. The Age-of-Information is a performance metric that captures
how fresh the information is from the perspective of the destination.
  In this paper, we show that as the congestion in the wireless network
increases, the Age-of-Information degrades sharply, leading to outdated
information at the destination. Leveraging years of theoretical research, we
propose WiFresh: an unconventional architecture that achieves near optimal
information freshness in wireless networks of any size, even when the network
is overloaded. Our experimental results show that WiFresh can improve
information freshness by two orders of magnitude when compared to an equivalent
standard WiFi network. We propose and realize two strategies for implementing
WiFresh: one at the MAC layer using hardware-level programming and another at

muscle tears. However, there are not many biomechanical studies of muscle
transfers, with the available ones often limited to passive movements in
anatomical planes. Using data from three activities of daily living (ADL) and
an available computational musculoskeletal model of the shoulder, we analyse
the impact of a subscapularis tear and its treatment by a pectoralis major
(PMA) transfer of the clavicular, sternal, or both segments. The shoulder model
is validated against experimental data: the model kinematics with motion
capture, muscle activity with EMG measurements, and model joint reaction force
with in-vivo data from an instrumented prosthesis. Our results indicate that
subscapularis tear requires a compensatory activation of the supraspinatus and
is accompanied by a reduced co-contraction of the infraspinatus, both of which
can be partially recovered after PMA transfer. Furthermore, although the PMA
acts asynchronously to the subscapularis before the transfer, its patterns of
activation change significantly after the transfer. Overall, this study
demonstrates that muscle transfers have a significant impact on the
neuromuscular system of the joint during active motion, beyond mere kinematics.
Capability of a transferred muscle segment to activate similarly to intact
subscapularis is found to be dependent on a considered motion. Differences in
the activation patterns between intact subscapularis and segments of PMA may
explain the difficulty of some patients in adapting their psycho-motor patterns
during the rehabilitation period. Thereby, rehabilitation programs could
benefit from targeted training on specific motion patterns and biofeedback
programs. Finally, the condition of the anterior deltoid should be considered
to avoid adding limitations to the joint function before a transfer of the
clavicular part.

acquiring automatically annotated training data via a natural interaction with
a human showing the object of interest, handheld. However, learning solely from
this data may introduce biases (the so-called domain shift), and prevents
adaptation to novel tasks. While Weakly-supervised Learning (WSL) offers a
well-established set of techniques to cope with these problems in
general-purpose Computer Vision, its adoption in challenging robotic domains is
still at a preliminary stage. In this work, we target the scenario of a robot
trained in a teacher-learner setting to detect handheld objects. The aim is to
improve detection performance in different settings by letting the robot
explore the environment with a limited human labeling budget. We compare
several techniques for WSL in detection pipelines to reduce model re-training
costs without compromising accuracy, proposing solutions which target the
considered robotic scenario. We show that the robot can improve adaptation to
novel domains, either by interacting with a human teacher (Active Learning) or
with an autonomous supervision (Semi-supervised Learning). We integrate our

management to establish and maintain reliable links. To do so, existing
solutions mostly rely on explicit coordination between the transmitter (TX) and
the receiver (RX), which significantly reduces the airtime available for
communication and further complicates the network protocol design. This paper
advances the state of the art by presenting DeepBeam, a framework for beam
management that does not require pilot sequences from the TX, nor any beam
sweeping or synchronization from the RX. This is achieved by inferring (i) the
Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and (ii) the actual beam being used by the
transmitter through waveform-level deep learning on ongoing transmissions
between the TX to other receivers. In this way, the RX can associate
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) levels to beams without explicit coordination with
the TX. This is possible because different beam patterns introduce different
impairments to the waveform, which can be subsequently learned by a
convolutional neural network (CNN). We conduct an extensive experimental data
collection campaign where we collect more than 4 TB of mmWave waveforms with
(i) 4 phased array antennas at 60.48 GHz, (ii) 2 codebooks containing 24

some positive constant $\gamma_0$ depending on $d$, such that the Cauchy
problem is locally and globally well-posed for any initial data $h_0$ which is
radial, supported away from the origin and in the negative Sobolev space $\dot
H^{-\gamma_0}(\R^d)$. In particular, it leads to local and global existences of
the solutions to Cauchy problem considered above for the initial data in a
proper subspace of $L^p(\R^d)$ with some $p<2$. {\it Secondly,} the sharp
asymptotic behavior of the solutions ( i.e. $L^2$-decay estimates ) as $t\to
+\infty$ are obtained with arbitrary large initial data $h_0\in \dot
H^{-\gamma_0}(\R^d)$ in the defocusing case and in the focusing case with
suitably small initial data $h_0$.

adversarial examples remains an open discussion. Indeed, many different
strategies can be employed to efficiently generate adversarial attacks, some of
them relying on different theoretical justifications. Among these strategies,
universal (input-agnostic) perturbations are of particular interest, due to
their capability to fool a network independently of the input in which the
perturbation is applied. In this work, we investigate an intriguing phenomenon
of universal perturbations, which has been reported previously in the
literature, yet without a proven justification: universal perturbations change
the predicted classes for most inputs into one particular (dominant) class,
even if this behavior is not specified during the creation of the perturbation.
In order to justify the cause of this phenomenon, we propose a number of
hypotheses and experimentally test them using a speech command classification
problem in the audio domain as a testbed. Our analyses reveal interesting
properties of universal perturbations, suggest new methods to generate such
attacks and provide an explanation of dominant classes, under both a geometric
and a data-feature perspective.

However, some languages are under-resourced, e.g., South Asian languages like

DeepHateExplainer. Bengali texts are first comprehensively preprocessed, before
classifying them into political, personal, geopolitical, and religious hates
using a neural ensemble method of transformer-based neural architectures (i.e.,
monolingual Bangla BERT-base, multilingual BERT-cased/uncased, and

sensitivity analysis and layer-wise relevance propagation(LRP), before
providing human-interpretable explanations. Finally, we compute
comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores to measure the quality of explanations
w.r.t faithfulness. Evaluations against machine learning~(linear and tree-based

special instances of DT invariants, where $Z$ is the attractor stability

More recently, the development and deployment of CUDA-aware MPI implementations

presents a novel datatype handling strategy for nested strided datatypes, which

substantial attention to non-contiguous GPU data and CUDA-aware MPI

demonstrates its contributions through an MPI interposer library, TEMPI. TEMPI
can be used with existing MPI deployments without system or application

MPI_Pack speedup of up to 242000x and MPI_Send speedup of up to 59000x compared

half-spherical alginate capsule at the air-water interface, which diffusively
releases water-soluble spreading molecules (weak surfactants such as
polyethylene glycol (PEG)), which act as ""fuel"" by modulating the air-water
interfacial tension. For a number of different fuels, we can observe symmetry
breaking and spontaneous propulsion although the alginate particle and emission
are isotropic. The propulsion mechanism is similar to soap or camphor boats,
which are, however, typically asymmetric in shape or emission to select a
swimming direction. We develop a theory of Marangoni boat propulsion starting
from low Reynolds numbers by analyzing the coupled problems of surfactant
diffusion and advection and fluid flow, which includes surfactant-induced fluid
Marangoni flow, and surfactant adsorption at the air-water interface; we also
include a possible evaporation of surfactant. The swimming velocity is
determined by the balance of drag and Marangoni forces. We show that
spontaneous symmetry breaking resulting in propulsion is possible above a
critical dimensionless surfactant emission rate (Peclet number). We derive the
relation between Peclet number and swimming speed and generalize to higher
Reynolds numbers utilizing the concept of the Nusselt number. The theory
explains the observed swimming speeds for PEG-alginate capsules, and we unravel
the differences to other Marangoni boat systems based on camphor, which are
mainly caused by surfactant evaporation from the liquid-air interface. The
capsule Marangoni microswimmers also exhibit surfactant-mediated repulsive
interactions with walls, which can be qualitatively explained by surfactant
accumulation at the wall.

electron gases (2DEGs) of varying depths, under unbiased (gates grounded) and
biased (gates at a positive or negative voltage) conditions. Unbiased
illuminations in 2DEGs located more than 70 nm away from the surface result in
a gain in mobility at a given electron density, primarily driven by the
reduction of background impurities. In 2DEGs closer to the surface, unbiased
illuminations result in a mobility loss, driven by an increase in surface
charge density. Biased illuminations performed with positive applied gate
voltages result in a mobility gain, whereas those performed with negative
applied voltages result in a mobility loss. The magnitude of the mobility gain
(loss) weakens with 2DEG depth, and is likely driven by a reduction (increase)
in surface charge density. Remarkably, this mobility gain/loss is fully
reversible by performing another biased illumination with the appropriate gate
voltage, provided both n-type and p-type ohmic contacts are present.

between spatial features and their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose
novel tensor representations for compactly capturing such higher-order
relationships between visual features for the task of action recognition. We
propose two tensor-based feature representations, viz. (i) sequence
compatibility kernel (SCK) and (ii) dynamics compatibility kernel (DCK). SCK
builds on the spatio-temporal correlations between features, whereas DCK
explicitly models the action dynamics of a sequence. We also explore
generalization of SCK, coined SCK(+), that operates on subsequences to capture
the local-global interplay of correlations, which can incorporate multi-modal
inputs e.g., skeleton 3D body-joints and per-frame classifier scores obtained
from deep learning models trained on videos. We introduce linearization of
these kernels that lead to compact and fast descriptors. We provide experiments
on (i) 3D skeleton action sequences, (ii) fine-grained video sequences, and
(iii) standard non-fine-grained videos. As our final representations are
tensors that capture higher-order relationships of features, they relate to
co-occurrences for robust fine-grained recognition. We use higher-order tensors
and so-called Eigenvalue Power Normalization (EPN) which have been long
speculated to perform spectral detection of higher-order occurrences, thus
detecting fine-grained relationships of features rather than merely count
features in action sequences. We prove that a tensor of order r, built from Z*
dimensional features, coupled with EPN indeed detects if at least one
higher-order occurrence is `projected' into one of its binom(Z*,r) subspaces of
dim. r represented by the tensor, thus forming a Tensor Power Normalization
metric endowed with binom(Z*,r) such `detectors'.

J0717.5+3745. The cluster hosts the most powerful radio halo known to date.
These new observations, in combination with published uGMRT (300$-$850 MHz) and
VLA (1$-$6.5 GHz) data, reveal that the halo is more extended than previously
thought, with a largest linear size of $\sim2.2 \rm Mpc$. The halo shows a
steep spectrum ($\alpha_{144\,\text{MHz}}^{1.5\,\text{GHz}}\sim-1.4$) and a
steepening ($\alpha_{1.5 \text{GHz}}^{5.5 \text{GHz}}\sim-1.9$) above 1.5 GHz.
We find a strong scattering in spectral index maps on scales of 50$-$100 kpc.
We suggest that such a strong scattering may be a consequence of the regime
where inverse Compton dominate the energy losses of electrons. The spectral
index becomes steeper and shows an increased curvature in the outermost regions
of the halo. We combined the radio data with \textit{Chandra} observations to
investigate the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of
the intracluster medium (ICM). Despite a significant substructure in the halo
emission, the radio brightness correlates strongly with the X-ray brightness at
all observed frequencies. The radio-versus-X-ray brightness correlation slope
steepens at a higher radio frequency (from $b_{144 \text{MHz}}=0.67\pm0.05$ to
$b_{3.0 \text{GHz}}=0.98\pm0.09$) and the spectral index shows a significant
anti correlation with the X-ray brightness. Both pieces of evidence further
support a spectral steepening in the external regions. The compelling evidence
for a steep spectral index, the existence of a spectral break above 1.5 GHz,
and the dependence of radio and X-ray surface brightness correlation on
frequency are interpreted in the context of turbulent reacceleration models.
Under this scenario, our results allowed us to constrain that the turbulent
kinetic pressure of the ICM is up to 10%.

hysteresis of a shape transition of an elastic object, by an elastic disk
undergoing cyclic localized swelling. Driving the control parameter of a
hysteretic shape transition in a completely time-reversible manner gives rise
to a non-time-reversible shape sequence and a net swimming motion if the
elastic object is immersed into a viscous fluid. We prove this concept with a
microswimmer which is a flat circular elastic disk that undergoes a transition
into a dome-like shape by localized swelling of an inner disk. The control
parameter of this shape transition is a scalar swelling factor of the disk
material. With a fixed outer frame with an additional attractive interaction in
the central region, the shape transition between flat and dome-like shape
becomes hysteretic and resembles a hysteretic opening and closing of a scallop.
Employing Stokesian dynamics simulations of a discretized version of the disk
we show that the swimmer is effectively moving into the direction of the
opening of the dome in a viscous fluid if the swelling parameter is changed in
a time-reversible manner. The swimming mechanism can be qualitatively
reproduced by a simple 9-bead model.

computationally challenging for classical processors. With an increasing

a potential to improve quantum walks simulations substantially. However,

diagonalisation studies remains poorly understood as the accessible system
sizes are too small to be in an asymptotic scaling regime. We develop a model
of the crossover in short 1D chains in which the MBL phase is destabilised by
the formation of many-body resonances. The model reproduces several properties
of the numerically observed crossover, including an apparent correlation length
exponent $\nu=1$, exponential growth of the Thouless time with disorder
strength, linear drift of the critical disorder strength with system size,
scale-free resonances, apparent $1/\omega$ dependence of disorder-averaged
spectral functions, and sub-thermal entanglement entropy of small subsystems.
In the crossover, resonances induced by a local perturbation are rare at
numerically accessible system sizes $L$ which are smaller than a
\emph{resonance length} $\lambda$. For $L \gg \sqrt{\lambda}$, resonances
typically overlap, and this model does not describe the asymptotic transition.
The model further reproduces controversial numerical observations which Refs.
[\v{S}untajs et al, 2019] and [Sels & Polkovnikov, 2020] claimed to be
inconsistent with MBL. We thus argue that the numerics to date is consistent

combinations of the data points stored at the server, as opposed to a single
file. This extends the scope of the Authors' past work that only considered the
class of linear functions that operate element-wise over the files. On
observing that the existing cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval scheme
does not work in the proposed setting, this paper designs a novel coded caching
scheme that outperforms uncoded caching schemes that either use unicast
transmissions or let each user recover all files in the library.

deep models for vision tasks such as classification. However, recent work has
shown that it is possible for these models to produce substantially different
attribution maps even when two very similar images are given to the network,
raising serious questions about trustworthiness. To address this issue, we
propose a robust attribution training strategy to improve attributional
robustness of deep neural networks. Our method carefully analyzes the
requirements for attributional robustness and introduces two new regularizers
that preserve a model's attribution map during attacks. Our method surpasses
state-of-the-art attributional robustness methods by a margin of approximately
3% to 9% in terms of attribution robustness measures on several datasets

suitable for access networks due to its limited distance and compatibility with
point-to-multipoint (P2MP) topology; with the help of trusted relays, it can be
extended to long-haul and metro networks. Spaceborne QKD on the other hand, has
much smaller channel loss and extended transmission distance, which can be used
for transoceanic and long-haul networks exploiting satellite-based trusted

behind faster matrix multiplication algorithms, the unraveling of quantum
entanglement, and the breakthrough on the cap set problem. Strassen's
asymptotic spectra program (FOCS 1986) characterizes optimal matrix
multiplication algorithms through monotone functionals. Our work advances and
makes novel connections among two recent developments in the study of tensors,
namely
  - the slice rank of tensors, a notion of rank for tensors that emerged from
the resolution of the cap set problem (Ann. of Math. 2017),
  - and the quantum functionals of tensors (STOC 2018), monotone functionals
defined as optimizations over moment polytopes.
  More precisely, we introduce an extension of slice rank that we call weighted
slice rank and we develop a minimax correspondence between the asymptotic
weighted slice rank and the quantum functionals. Weighted slice rank
encapsulates different notions of bipartiteness of quantum entanglement.
  The correspondence allows us to give a rank-type characterization of the
quantum functionals. Moreover, whereas the original definition of the quantum
functionals only works over the complex numbers, this new characterization can
be extended to all fields. Thereby, in addition to gaining deeper understanding
of Strassen's theory for the complex numbers, we obtain a proposal for quantum
functionals over other fields. The finite field case is crucial for
combinatorial and algorithmic problems where the field can be optimized over.

anti-diagonal in $G\times G$, which was implicitly used in Runde's work but
hitherto not studied in depth. Our main novelty is an explicit formula for this
minorant when $G$ is a countable virtually abelian group, in terms of the
Plancherel measure for $G$. As further applications, we characterize those
non-abelian groups where the minorant attains its minimal value, and present
some examples to support the conjecture that the minorant always coincides with

partition function and entanglement entropy of half great circle with antipodal
points being the entangling surface, we obtain different results compared to
previous works, with more reasonable CFT limits and qualitatively different
behaviour as the deformation parameter $\mu$ goes to infinity, which
contradicts the simple version of the cutoff AdS holography proposal. For a
modified version of cutoff AdS holography which is supposed to work only in the
sector of classical pure gravity, we show that the flow equation of the metric
and one point function of energy-momentum tensor in $T\bar{T}$ deformation
corresponds to the flow equation of the boundary metric and Brown-York tensor
on a cutoff surface in AdS space as the cutoff surface moves in the direction
of normal geodesics. In addition the flow equation of gravity on-shell action
takes the form of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, with straightforward generalization
to higher dimensions. As an example we give a holographic computation of the
sphere partition function of $T\bar{T}$ CFT.

explore the second possibility with the help of recent developments in

structures before starting the backtracking, it is often ineffective for
complex graphs. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for subgraph
matching that performs on-the-fly pruning during the backtracking. Our main
idea is to `learn from failure'. That is, our algorithm generates failure
patterns when a partial embedding is found unable to become an isomorphic

prunes partial embeddings matched with a failure pattern. This pruning does not
change the result because failure patterns are designed to represent the
conditions that never yield an isomorphic embedding. Additionally, we introduce
an efficient representation of failure patterns for constant-time pattern
matching. The experimental results show that our method improves the
performance by up to 10000 times than existing methods.

string-net configuration is a trivalent graph with labeled edges, drawn in the

string-net construction is that, unlike the original construction, tetrahedral
reflection symmetry is not assumed, nor is it assumed that the ground state

Marangoni boats (soap or camphor boats) at low Reynolds numbers. Propulsion is
generated by release (diffusive emission or dissolution) of water-soluble
surfactant molecules, which modulate the air-water interfacial tension.
Propulsion either requires asymmetric release or spontaneous symmetry breaking
by coupling to advection for a perfectly symmetrical swimmer. We study the
diffusion-advection problem for a sphere in Stokes flow analytically and
numerically both for constant concentration and constant flux boundary
conditions. We derive novel results for concentration profiles under constant
flux boundary conditions and for the Nusselt number (the dimensionless ratio of
total emitted flux and diffusive flux). Based on these results, we analyze the
Marangoni boat for small Marangoni propulsion (low Peclet number) and show that
two swimming regimes exist, a diffusive regime at low velocities and an
advection-dominated regime at high swimmer velocities. We describe both the
limit of large Marangoni propulsion (high Peclet number) and the effects from
evaporation by approximative analytical theories. The swimming velocity is
determined by force balance, and we obtain a general expression for the
Marangoni forces, which comprises both direct Marangoni forces from the surface
tension gradient and Marangoni flow forces. We unravel, whether the Marangoni
flow contribution is exerting a forward or backward force during propulsion.
Our main result is the relation between Peclet number and swimming velocity.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking and, thus, swimming occurs for a perfectly
symmetrical swimmer above a critical Peclet number, which becomes small for
large system sizes. We find a supercritical swimming bifurcation for a
symmetric swimmer and an avoided bifurcation in the presence of an asymmetry.

important structural question of how to think about subsystems and localization
of information in quantum gravity. Paralleling field theory, the answer to this
is expected to be an important ingredient in the mathematical structure of the
theory. Perturbative gravity results indicate a structure different from that
of quantum field theory, but suggest an avenue to defining subsystems. If black
holes do behave similarly to familiar subsystems, unitarity demands new
interactions that transfer entanglement from them. Such interactions can be
parameterized in an effective approach, without directly addressing the
question of the fundamental dynamics, whether that is associated with quantum
spacetime, wormholes, or something else. Since such interactions need to extend
outside the horizon, that raises the question of whether they can be

observations of strong gravity regions. This note overviews and provides

condensed matter physics for their ability to learn complex patterns from very
high dimensional data sets towards classifying complex long-range patterns of
entanglement and correlations in many-body quantum systems. Small-scale quantum
computers are already showing potential gains in learning tasks on large
quantum and very large classical data sets. A particularly interesting class of
algorithms, the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) could learn
features of a quantum data set by performing a binary classification task on a
nontrivial phase of quantum matter. Inspired by this promise, we present a
generalization of QCNN, the branching quantum convolutional neural network, or
bQCNN, with substantially higher expressibility. A key feature of bQCNN is that
it leverages mid-circuit (intermediate) measurement results, realizable on
current trapped-ion systems, obtained in pooling layers to determine which sets
of parameters will be used in the subsequent convolutional layers of the
circuit. This results in a branching structure, which allows for a greater
number of trainable variational parameters in a given circuit depth. This is of
particular use on current-day NISQ devices, where circuit depth is limited by
gate noise. We present an overview of the ansatz structure and scaling, and
provide evidence of its enhanced expressibility compared to QCNN. Using
artificially-constructed large data sets of training states as a
proof-of-concept we demonstrate the existence of training tasks in which bQCNN
far outperforms an ordinary QCNN. Finally, we present future directions where

a natural choice of the set of gauge invariant variables for each chosen gauge

evolution of overdensities in the initial density field, a limit that can be
circumvented by detecting halo particles in the initial conditions. We thus
propose `MUltiscale Spherical Collapse Lagrangian Evolution Using
Press-Schechter' (muscle-ups), a new scheme that reproduces the results from
Lagrangian perturbation theory on large scales, while improving the modelling
of overdensities on small scales. In muscle-ups, we adapt the extended Press
and Schechter (EPS) formalism to Lagrangian algorithms of the displacement
field. For regions exceeding a collapse threshold in the density smoothed at a
radius $R$, we consider all particles within a radius $R$ collapsed. Exploiting
a multi-scale smoothing of the initial density, we build a halo catalogue on
the fly by optimizing the selection of halo candidates. This allows us to
generate a density field with a halo mass function that matches one measured in
$N$-body simulations. We further explicitly gather particles in each halo
together in a profile, providing a numerical, Lagrangian-based implementation
of the halo model. Compared to previous semi-analytical Lagrangian methods, we
find that muscle-ups improves the recovery of the statistics of the density

transport in a confined space via self-propelling microdroplets. These
microdroplets can form spontaneously from localized liquid-liquid phase
separation as a ternary mixture is diluted by a diffusing poor solvent. High
speed images reveal how the microdroplets grow, break up and propel rapidly
along the solid surface, with a maximal velocity up to ~160 um/s, in response
to a sharp concentration gradient resulting from phase separation. The
microdroplet self-propulsion induces a replenishing flow between the walls of
the confined space towards the location of phase separation, which in turn
drives the mixture out of equilibrium and leads to a repeating cascade of
events. Our findings on the complex and rich phenomena of self-propelling
droplets suggest an effective approach to enhanced flow motion of
multicomponent liquid mixtures within confined spaces for time effective
separation and smart transport processes.

of a previously unidentified instrumental signature in K2. Systematic errors in
K2, beyond those due to the motion of the detector, plague our AGN and other
faint-target, guest-observer science proposals. Weakly illuminated pixels are
dominated by low frequency trends that are both non-astrophysical and
correlated from object to object. A critical clue to understanding this
instrumental noise is that different targets observed in the same channels of
Campaign 8 (rear facing) and Campaign 16 (forward facing) had nearly identical
light curves after time reversal of one of the campaigns. This observation
strongly suggests that the underlying problem relates to the relative
Sun-spacecraft-field orientation, which was approximately the same on day 1 of
Campaign 8 as the last day of Campaign 16. Furthermore, we measure that the
instrumental signature lags in time as a function of radius from the center of
the detector, crossing channel boundaries. Systematics documented in this
investigation are unlikely to be due to Moir\'{e} noise, rolling band, or
pointing jitter. Instead this work strongly suggests temperature-dependent
focus changes that are further subject to channel variations. Further
characterization of this signature is crucial for rehabilitating K2 data for

samples distributed across a large network of clients while the data remains
local. It is, however, known that federated learning is prone to multiple
system challenges including system heterogeneity where clients have different
computation and communication capabilities. Such heterogeneity in clients'
computation speeds has a negative effect on the scalability of federated
learning algorithms and causes significant slow-down in their runtime due to
the existence of stragglers. In this paper, we propose a novel
straggler-resilient federated learning method that incorporates statistical
characteristics of the clients' data to adaptively select the clients in order
to speed up the learning procedure. The key idea of our algorithm is to start
the training procedure with faster nodes and gradually involve the slower nodes
in the model training once the statistical accuracy of the data corresponding
to the current participating nodes is reached. The proposed approach reduces
the overall runtime required to achieve the statistical accuracy of data of all
nodes, as the solution for each stage is close to the solution of the
subsequent stage with more samples and can be used as a warm-start. Our
theoretical results characterize the speedup gain in comparison to standard
federated benchmarks for strongly convex objectives, and our numerical
experiments also demonstrate significant speedups in wall-clock time of our

star accreting from the wind of a supergiant companion with a $\sim$4.57 day
orbital period. The source shows an asymmetric eclipse profile that remained
stable across several years. We aim at investigating the geometrical and
physical properties of stellar wind structures formed by the interaction
between the compact object and the supergiant star. In this work we analyse the
temporal and spectral evolution of this source along its orbit using six
archival XMM-Newton observations and the accumulated Swift/BAT hard X-ray light
curve. XMM-Newton light curves show that the source hardens during the ingress
and egress of the eclipse, in accordance with the asymmetric profile seen in
Swift/BAT data. A reduced pulse modulation is observed on the ingress to the
eclipse. We model XMM-Newton spectra by means of a thermally-comptonized
continuum (nthcomp) adding two gaussian emission lines corresponding to Fe
K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$. We included two absorption components to account for
the interstellar and intrinsic media. We found that the local absorption column
outside the eclipse fluctuates uniformly around $\sim$
6$\times$10$^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$, whereas, when the source enters and leaves the
eclipse, the column increases by a factor of $\gtrsim$3, reaching values up to
$\sim$35 and $\sim$15$\times 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$, respectively. Combining the
physical properties derived from the spectral analysis, we propose a scenario
where a photo-ionisation wake (mainly) and an accretion wake (secondarily) are
responsible for the orbital evolution of the absorption column, the continuum
emission and the variability seen at the Fe-line complex.

nonlinear mechanical systems has been developed. The method is restricted to
the regime of an isolated nonlinear mode and consists of a two-step procedure:
In the first step, a multiharmonic analysis of the autonomous system is
performed to directly compute the amplitude-dependent characteristics of the
considered nonlinear mode. In the second step, these modal properties are used
to construct a two-dimensional reduced order model (ROM) that facilitates the
efficient computation of steady-state and unsteady dynamics provided that
nonlinear modal interactions are absent. The proposed methodology is applied to
several nonlinear mechanical systems ranging form single degree-of-freedom to
Finite Element models. Unsteady vibration phenomena such as approaching
behavior towards an equilibrium point or limit cycles, and resonance passages
are studied regarding the effect of various nonlinearities such as cubic
springs, unilateral contact and friction. It is found that the proposed ROM
facilitates very fast and accurate analysis of the slow dynamics of nonlinear
systems. Moreover, the ROM concept offers a huge parameter space including
additional linear damping, stiffness and near-resonant forcing.

this study, we critically assess the influence of soil contaminants, by
separating the bone elemental fingerprint into two groups of different
components prior to the NN analysis. The first group includes elements related
to the bone matrix (Ca and P) as well as elements that are regularly
incorporated in the living bone tissues (Mg, Na, Sr, and Ba). The second group
includes metals with a low probability of accumulation in living bone tissues
whose presence is more likely to be related to diagenesis and the chemical
composition of the burial soil (Al, Fe, Mn). The NN analysis of the spectral
data, based on the use of an open access software, provided accurate results,
indicating that it can be a promising tool for enhancing LIBS applications in
osteoarchaeology. The influence of bone diagenesis and soil contaminants is
significant. False classifications occurred exclusively in the NN analyses that
relied partially on elemental peaks from the second group of elements. Overall,
the present study indicates that discrimination between individuals through
LIBS and NN analysis of bone material in an archaeological setting is possible,
but a targeted approach based on selected elements is required and the
influence of bone diagenesis will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

flux is also necessary for solar Stirling engine to work efficiently. The

photovoltaic and energy storage-integrated Stirling engine or thermal field
emission technologies in the same concentrating solar power system, providing a
great potential in terms of energy production per unit area. The photovoltaic
cells can be deposited on the concentrating solar power main mirror to allow
the system to collect and convert the diffuse component of the light. The
design allows utilization of existing equipment, particularly a high-grade
parabolic dish or midgrade Fresnel concentrator for rooftop installation. To
optimize the use of solar energy, beam splitters thermally decouple the modules
by splitting the solar spectrum into three spectral ranges and directing
visible, ultraviolet and infrared radiation into the photovoltaic cells,
gate/Cs-filled gap and cavity-type solar receiver, respectively. A
photon-enhanced gate electrode creates on the cathode surface an electrostatic
field large enough to compensate space charge field and initiates thermal field
emission process. In the thermal field emission cathodes with nano-structured
surfaces, the current density can reach values close to the field emission

Hilbert space. Such ubiquitous, well-known, and very foundational fact,
however, is traditionally subtle to be explained in typical first classes in
quantum mechanics, as well as to senior physicists who have grown up with the
lesson that self-adjointness is ""just technical"". The usual difficulties are to
clarify the connection between the demand for certain physical features in the
theory and the corresponding mathematical requirement of self-adjointness, and
to distinguish between self-adjoint and hermitian operator not just at the
level of the mathematical definition but most importantly from the perspective
that mere hermiticity, without self-adjointness, does not ensure the desired
physical requirements and leaves the theory inconsistent. In this work we
organise an amount of standard facts on the physical role of self-adjointness
into a coherent pedagogical path aimed at making quantum observables emerge as
necessarily self-adjoint, and not merely hermitian operators. Next to the
central core of our line of reasoning -- the necessity of a non-trivial
declaration of a domain to associate with the formal action of an observable,
and the emergence of self-adjointness as a consequence of fundamental physical
requirements -- we include some complementary materials consisting of a few
instructive mathematical proofs and a short retrospective, ranging from the
past decades to the current research agenda, on the self-adjointness problem

rank three, i.e., projectors on half-dimensional subspaces. For systems
consisting only of qubits, it was shown analytically that a set of projectors
on half-dimensional subspaces can be arranged in an informationally optimal
fashion for quantum state tomography, thus forming so-called mutually unbiased
subspaces. Our method goes beyond qubits-only systems and we find that in

scene-adaptive spatial sampling of an hyperspectral scene, guided by its
super-pixel segmented image, is capable of obtaining high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve this, we acquire an RGB image of the scene, compute
its super-pixels, from which we generate a spatial mask of locations where we
measure high-resolution spectrum. The hyperspectral image is subsequently
estimated by fusing the RGB image and the spectral measurements using a
learnable guided filtering approach. Due to low computational complexity of the
superpixel estimation step, our setup can capture hyperspectral images of the
scenes with little overhead over traditional snapshot hyperspectral cameras,
but with significantly higher spatial and spectral resolutions. We validate the
proposed technique with extensive simulations as well as a lab prototype that

water remediation. However, achieving directed motion without breaking detailed
balance, for example by asymmetric topographical patterning, is challenging.
Here we engineer a two-dimensional periodic topographical design with detailed
balance in its unit cell where we observe spontaneous particle edge guidance
and corner accumulation of self-propelled particles. This emergent behaviour is
guaranteed by a second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, a topologically robust
non-equilibrium phenomenon, that we use to dynamically break detailed balance.
Our stochastic circuit model predicts, without fitting parameters, how guidance
and accumulation can be controlled and enhanced by design: a device guides
particles more efficiently if the topological invariant characterizing it is
non-zero. Our work establishes a fruitful bridge between active and topological
matter, and our design principles offer a blueprint to design devices that
display spontaneous, robust and predictable guided motion and accumulation,

algorithms. Their popularity stems from their empirical success on several
challenging learning problems. However, most scholars agree that a convincing
theoretical explanation for this success is still lacking.
  This article surveys the known approximation properties of the outputs of NNs
with the aim of uncovering the properties that are not present in the more
traditional methods of approximation used in numerical analysis. Comparisons
are made with traditional approximation methods from the viewpoint of rate
distortion. Another major component in the analysis of numerical approximation
is the computational time needed to construct the approximation and this in
turn is intimately connected with the stability of the approximation algorithm.
So the stability of numerical approximation using NNs is a large part of the
analysis put forward.
  The survey, for the most part, is concerned with NNs using the popular ReLU
activation function. In this case, the outputs of the NNs are piecewise linear
functions on rather complicated partitions of the domain of $f$ into cells that
are convex polytopes. When the architecture of the NN is fixed and the
parameters are allowed to vary, the set of output functions of the NN is a
parameterized nonlinear manifold. It is shown that this manifold has certain
space filling properties leading to an increased ability to approximate (better
rate distortion) but at the expense of numerical stability. The space filling
creates a challenge to the numerical method in finding best or good parameter
choices when trying to approximate.

Here, we report, for the first time, the spectral properties of a unified model

Advective Flow paradigm. We compare our theoretical results with the X-Ray
spectral features of Z and Atoll sources, across different states. We also fit

offers great potential for informing both innovation economics and development
policy. We study the economic transition of the PR China from an agrarian
country to a high-tech economy as one example for such a case. It is clear from
past literature that rapidly rising productivity levels played a crucial role.
However, the distribution of labor productivity in Chinese firms has not been
comprehensively investigated and it remains an open question if this can be
used to guide economic development. We analyze labor productivity and the
dynamic change of labor productivity in firm-level data for the years 1998-2013
from the Chinese Industrial Enterprise Database. We demonstrate that both
variables are conveniently modeled as L\'evy alpha-stable distributions,
provide parameter estimates and analyze dynamic changes to this distribution.
We find that the productivity gains were not due to super-star firms, but due
to a systematic shift of the entire distribution with otherwise mostly
unchanged characteristics. We also found an emerging right-skew in the
distribution of labor productivity change. While there are significant
differences between the 31 provinces and autonomous regions of the P.R. China,
we also show that there are systematic relations between micro-level and
province-level variables. We conclude with some implications of these findings
for development policy.

two-dimensional anisotropic tilted Dirac systems. We study the spectrum of
intraband and interband transitions through the joint density of states (JDOS),
the optical conductivity tensor, and the Drude spectral weight. The energy
bands present an indirect gap in each valley. Thus a new possibility opens for
the position of the Fermi level (an ``indirect zone''), and for the momentum
space for allowed transitions. The JDOS near each gap displays a set of three
van Hove singularities which are in contrast to the case of gapped graphene (an
absorption edge only) or 8-$Pmmn$ borophene (two interband critical points due
to the tilt). For the Fermi level lying in the gap, the JDOS shows the usual
linear dependence on frequency, while when above an indirect zone it looks
similar to the borophene case. These spectral characteristics determine the
prominent structure of the optical conductivity. The longitudinal conductivity
illustrates the strong anisotropy of the optical response. Similarly, the Drude
weight is anisotropic and shows regions of nonlinear dependence on the Fermi
level. The breaking of valley symmetry leads to a finite Hall response and
associated optical properties. The anomalous and valley Hall conductivities
present graphene-like behavior with characteristic modifications due to the
indirect zones. Almost perfect circular dichroism can be achieved by tuning the
exciting frequency with an appropriate Fermi level position. We also calculate
the spectra of optical opacity and polarization rotation, which can reach
magnitudes of tenths of radians in some cases. The spectral features of the
calculated response properties are signatures of the simultaneous presence of
tilt and mass and suggest optical ways to determine the formation of different

Legal invoice review is and has been a pain point for corporate legal

arrive one after another, and the algorithm is required to instantly decide
whether to take the current point as a center before observing the next point.
Decisions are irrevocable. The goal is to minimize both the number of centers
and the $k$-means cost. Previous works in this setting assume that the input's
order is random, or that the input's aspect ratio is bounded. It is known that
if the order is arbitrary and there is no assumption on the input, then any
algorithm must take all points as centers. Moreover, assuming a bounded aspect
ratio is too restrictive -- it does not include natural input generated from
mixture models.
  We introduce a new complexity measure that quantifies the difficulty of
clustering a dataset arriving in arbitrary order. We design a new random
algorithm and prove that if applied on data with complexity $d$, the algorithm
takes $O(d\log(n) k\log(k))$ centers and is an $O(k^3)$-approximation. We also
prove that if the data is sampled from a ``natural"" distribution, such as a
mixture of $k$ Gaussians, then the new complexity measure is equal to
$O(k^2\log(n))$. This implies that for data generated from those distributions,
our new algorithm takes only $\text{poly}(k\log(n))$ centers and is a
$\text{poly}(k)$-approximation. In terms of negative results, we prove that the
number of centers needed to achieve an $\alpha$-approximation is at least
$\Omega\left(\frac{d}{k\log(n\alpha)}\right)$.

characterized by the ratio of the nearest-neighbor (NN) antiferromagnetic

Virtual shape functions ensure the smoothness of the morphing wing at every

control allocation errors, the closed-loop stability is guaranteed in the
Lyapunov sense. Wind tunnel tests demonstrate that INDI-QP-V can make the
seamless wing morph actively to resist ``1-cos'' gusts and modify the spanwise

control law was executed in real time. Furthermore, as compared to the linear

of why would anyone engage in individual information seeking, which is a
necessary condition for social learning's efficacy. We propose an evolutionary
model solving this paradox, provided agents (i) aim not only at information
quality but also vie for audience and prestige, and (ii) do not only value

higher accuracy and the taste for original opinions are evolutionary-stable,
within a mutually beneficial division of labour-like equilibrium. When such

for energy production purposes because of its aneutronic character and the
absence of radioactive species among reactants and products. Its exploitation
in the thermonuclear regime, however, appears to be prohibitive due to the low
reactivity of the $^{11}$B fuel at temperatures up to 100 keV. A fusion chain
sustained by elastic collisions between the alpha particles and fuel ions, this
way scattered to suprathermal energies, has been proposed as a possible route
to overcome this limitation. Based on a simple model, this work investigates
the reproduction process in an infinite, non-degenerate $^{11}$B plasma, in a
wide range of densities and temperatures which are of interest for laser-driven
experiments ($10^{24} \lesssim n_e \lesssim 10^{28} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T_e
\lesssim 100$ keV, $T_i \sim$ 1 keV). In particular, cross section data for the
$\alpha$-$p$ scattering which include the nuclear interaction have been used.
The multiplication factor, $k_\infty$, increases markedly with electron
temperature and less significantly with plasma density. However, even at the
highest temperature and density considered, and despite a more than twofold
increase by the inclusion of the nuclear scattering, $k_\infty$ turns out to be
of the order of $10^{-2}$ only. In general, values of $k_\infty$ very close to
1 are needed in a confined scheme to enhance the suprathermal-to-thermonuclear
energy yield by factors of up to $10^3$-$10^4$.

principally evaluative research approaches. Most of the studies are conducted
at the organizational level, mainly using methods such as interviews, surveys,
field studies and case studies. The USA, India and China are major players in
GSE, with USA-India collaborations being the most frequently studied, followed
by USA-China. While a considerable number of GSE-related studies have been
published since January 2011 they are currently quite narrowly focused, on
exploratory research and explanatory theories, and the critical research
paradigm has been untouched. An absence of formulative research,
experimentation and simulation, and a related focus on evaluative approaches,
all suggest that existing tools, methods and approaches from related fields are
being tested in the GSE context, even though these may not be inherently
applicable to the additional scale and complexity of GSE.

reasoning and programmer effort to two-phased locking. NBR is implemented using
OS signals and a lightweight handshaking mechanism between participating
threads to determine when it is safe to reclaim a record. Experiments on a
lock-based binary search tree and a lazy linked list show that NBR
significantly outperforms many state of the art reclamation algorithms. In the
tree NBR is faster than next best algorithm, DEBRA by upto 38% and HP by upto

(RL) problem in community detection by considering variants of the modularity
metric in the detection algorithms. These metrics purportedly largely mitigate
the RL problem and are preferable to modularity in many realistic scenarios.
However, they are not generally suitable for analyzing weighted networks or for
detecting hierarchical community structure. Resolution limit problems can be
complicated, though, and in particular it can be unclear when it should be
considered as problem. In this paper, we introduce a metric that we call
generalized modularity density $Q_g$ that eliminates the RL problem at any
desired resolution and is easily extendable to study weighted and hierarchical
networks. We also propose a benchmark test to quantify the resolution limit
problem, examine various modularity-like metrics to show that the new metric
$Q_g$ performs best, and show that $Q_g$ can identify modular structure in
real-world and artificial networks that is otherwise hidden.

much richer than for the related, integrable, Korteweg-de Vries equation $u_t +

to significantly impact the dynamics. Narrow width gives rise to rarefaction
and dispersive shock wave (DSW) solutions that are accompanied by the
generation of two-phase linear wavetrains, solitary wave shedding, and
expansion shocks. Both narrow and broad initial widths give rise to two-phase
nonlinear wavetrains or DSW implosion and a new kind of dispersive Lax shock
for symmetric data. The dispersive Lax shock is described by an approximate
self-similar solution of the BBM equation whose limit as $t \to \infty$ is a
stationary, discontinuous weak solution. By introducing a slight asymmetry in
the data for the dispersive Lax shock, the generation of an incoherent solitary
wavetrain is observed. Further asymmetry leads to the DSW implosion regime that

be designed in a fully decentralized manner and achieves approximate
synchronization with arbitrary precision, under only mild assumptions on the
individual vector fields and the underlying (undirected) graph structure. The
proposed coupling law is motivated by the so-called funnel control method
studied in adaptive control under the observation that arbitrary precision
synchronization can be achieved for heterogeneous multi-agent systems by a
high-gain coupling; consequently we call our novel synchronization method
`(node-wise) funnel coupling.' By adjusting the conventional proof technique in
the funnel control study, we are even able to obtain asymptotic synchronization
with the same funnel coupling law. Moreover, the emergent collective behavior
that arises for a heterogeneous multi-agent system when enforcing arbitrary
precision synchronization by the proposed funnel coupling law, is analyzed in
this paper. In particular, we introduce a single scalar dynamics called
`emergent dynamics' which describes the emergent synchronized behavior of the
multi-agent system under funnel coupling. Characterization of the emergent
dynamics is important because, for instance, one can design the emergent
dynamics first such that the solution trajectory behaves as desired, and then,
provide a design guideline to each agent so that the constructed vector fields
yield the desired emergent dynamics. We illustrate this idea via the example of
a distributed median solver based on funnel coupling.

entities and thus find application in a variety of domains. We consider a
setting where not only the member agents are adaptive but also the multiagent
system viewed as an entity in its own right is adaptive. Specifically, the
social structure of a multiagent system can be reflected in the social norms
among its members. It is well recognized that the norms that arise in society
are not always beneficial to its members. We focus on prosocial norms, which
help achieve positive outcomes for society and often provide guidance to agents
to act in a manner that takes into account the welfare of others.
  Specifically, we propose Cha, a framework for the emergence of prosocial
norms. Unlike previous norm emergence approaches, Cha supports continual change
to a system (agents may enter and leave) and dynamism (norms may change when
the environment changes). Importantly, Cha agents incorporate prosocial
decision making based on inequity aversion theory, reflecting an intuition of
guilt arising from being antisocial. In this manner, Cha brings together two
important themes in prosociality: decision making by individuals and fairness
of system-level outcomes. We demonstrate via simulation that Cha can improve
aggregate societal gains and fairness of outcomes.

Variational Auto-encoder (VAE)-based discriminator with the help of the

generator for better pseudo labels. To learn from the pseudo labels that are

noise-weighted Dice loss. We validated our framework with two situations:
objects with a simple shape model like optic disc in fundus images and fetal
head in ultrasound images, and complex structures like lung in X-Ray images and

Learning (AUE-CRL) framework to learn the AU representations without AU
annotations and adaptively use representations to facilitate facial expression
recognition. Specifically, it leverages AU-expression correlations to guide the
learning of the AU classifiers, and thus it can obtain AU representations
without incurring any AU annotations. Then, it introduces a knowledge-guided
attention mechanism that mines useful AU representations under the constraint
of AU-expression correlations. In this way, the framework can capture local
discriminative and complementary features to enhance facial representation for
facial expression recognition. We conduct experiments on the challenging
uncontrolled datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework
over current state-of-the-art methods. Codes and trained models are available

can be eruptive with coronal mass ejections. Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) has
been suggested as the central magnetic structure of solar eruptions, and their
ideal instabilities including mainly the kink instability (KI) and torus
instability (TI) provide important candidates for triggering mechanisms. Here
using magnetic field extrapolations from observed photospheric magnetograms, we
systematically studied the variation of coronal magnetic fields, focusing on
MFRs, through major flares including 29 eruptive and 16 confined events. We
found that nearly 90\% events possess MFR before flare and 70\% have MFR even
after flare. We calculated the controlling parameters of KI and TI, including
the MFR's maximum twist number and the decay index of its strapping field.
Using the KI and TI thresholds empirically derived from solely the pre-flare
MFRs, two distinct different regimes are shown in the variation of the MFR
controlling parameters through flares. For the events with both parameters
below their thresholds before flare, we found no systematic change of the
parameters after the flares, in either the eruptive or confined events. In
contrast, for the events with any of the two parameters exceeding their
threshold before flare (most of them are eruptive), there is systematic
decrease in the parameters to below their thresholds after flares. These
results provide a strong constraint for the values of the instability
thresholds and also stress the necessity of exploring other eruption mechanisms
in addition to the ideal instabilities.

in the verification and synthesis of reactive systems. The spectrum of
omega-automata is defined by two characteristics: the acceptance condition
(e.g. B\""uchi or parity) and the determinism (e.g., deterministic or
nondeterministic) of an automaton. These characteristics play a crucial role in
applications of automata theory. For example, certain acceptance conditions can
be handled more efficiently than others by dedicated tools and algorithms.
Furthermore, some applications, such as synthesis and probabilistic model

omega-automata. However, properties cannot always be represented by automata
with the desired acceptance condition and determinism. In this paper we study
the problem of approximating linear-time properties by automata in a given

user-defined precision given in terms of the size of the finite lasso
representation of infinite executions that are preserved. We study the state

of one-dimensional strong shock waves are characterised for the first time in a
kinetic collisional framework in the Mach number range $2\le M\le 10$. Our
analysis draws upon the well-known bimodal nature of the probability density
function (PDF) of gas particles in the shock, as opposed to their Maxwellian
distribution in the freestream, the latter exhibiting an order of magnitude
higher dominant frequencies than the former. Inside the (finite-thickness)
shock region, the strong correlation between perturbations in the bimodal PDF
and fluctuations in the normal stress suggests introducing a novel two-bin
model to describe the reduced-order dynamics of a large number of collision
interactions of gas particles. Our model correctly predicts the
order-of-magnitude difference in fluctuation frequencies in the shock versus
those in the freestream and is consistent with the small-amplitude fluctuations
obtained from the highly resolved Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
computations of the same configuration. The variation of low-frequency
fluctuations with changes in the conditions upstream of the shock revealed that
these fluctuations can be described by a Strouhal number, based on the bulk
velocity upstream of the shock and the shock-thickness based on the maximum
density-gradient inside the shock, that remains practically independent of Mach
number in the range examined. Our results are expected to have far-reaching
implications for boundary conditions employed in the vicinity of shocks in the

inevitable problem. Unsupervised feature selection has attracted more and more
attention because it does not rely on labels. The performance of spectral-based
unsupervised methods depends on the quality of constructed similarity matrix,
which is used to depict the intrinsic structure of data. However, real-world
data contain a large number of noise samples and features, making the
similarity matrix constructed by original data cannot be completely reliable.
Worse still, the size of similarity matrix expands rapidly as the number of

Inspired by principal component analysis, we propose a simple and efficient
unsupervised feature selection method, by combining reconstruction error with
$l_{2,p}$-norm regularization. The projection matrix, which is used for feature
selection, is learned by minimizing the reconstruction error under the sparse
constraint. Then, we present an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the

advantages of both the consensus analysis and the preference analysis to
estimate the parameters of multiple model instances from data corrupted by
outliers, for robust model fitting. Instead of analyzing the information of
each data point or each model hypothesis independently, we formulate the
consensus information and the preference information as a hierarchical
representation to alleviate the sensitivity to gross outliers. Specifically, we
firstly construct a hierarchical representation, which consists of a model
hypothesis layer and a data point layer. The model hypothesis layer is used to
remove insignificant model hypotheses and the data point layer is used to
remove gross outliers. Then, based on the hierarchical representation, we
propose an effective hierarchical message propagation (HMP) algorithm and an
improved affinity propagation (IAP) algorithm to prune insignificant vertices
and cluster the remaining data points, respectively. The proposed HRMP can not
only accurately estimate the number and parameters of multiple model instances,
but also handle multi-structural data contaminated with a large number of
outliers. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real images show that
the proposed HRMP significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art model

by a strength parameter that can be set equal to any real number. This model
covers a large variety of interactions including different vertex repulsion and
attraction strengths between any two random walks as well as self-reinforced
interactions. We show that the process of empirical vertex occupation measures

the flow induced by a smooth vector field. Further, if the set of equilibria of
the field is formed by isolated points, then the vertex occupation measures
converge (a.s.) to an equilibrium of the field. These facts are shown by means
of the construction of a strict Lyapunov function. We show that if the absolute
value of the interaction strength parameters are smaller than a certain upper
bound, then, for any number of random walks ($m\geq 2$) on any graph ($d \geq

provide two additional examples of repelling random walks for the cases $m=d=2$

pigeon-holes CAN IDS works into testing on limited, often inappropriate data

introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network

emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate

is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply.

  future gravitational wave observation DECIGO","7 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in EPJC",,"10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08796-w",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A model-independent test of the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ is very
important in cosmology. In order to estimate cosmic curvature from cosmological
probes like standard candles, one has to be able to measure the luminosity
distance $D_L(z)$, it's derivative with respect to redshift $D'_L(z)$ and
independently know the expansion rate $H(z)$ at the same redshift. In this
paper, we study how such an idea could be implemented with the future
generation of space-based DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (DECIGO), in combination with cosmic chronometers providing
cosmology-independent $H(z)$ data. Our results show that for the Hubble diagram
of simulated DECIGO data acting as a new type of standard siren, it would be
able to constrain cosmic curvature with the precision of $\Delta \Omega_k=
0.09$ with the currently available sample of 31 measurements of Hubble
parameters. In the framework of the third generation ground-based gravitational
wave detectors, the spatial curvature is constrained to be $\Delta\Omega_k=
0.13$ for Einstein Telescope (ET). More interestingly, compared to other
approaches aiming for model-independent estimations of spatial curvature, our
analysis also achieves the reconstruction of the evolution of $\Omega_k(z)$, in
the framework of a model-independent method of Gaussian processes (GP) without
assuming a specific form. Therefore, one can expect that the newly emerged
gravitational wave astronomy can become useful in local measurements of cosmic
curvature using distant sources.

disordered topological insulators is robust throughout the central portion of
the band gap where localized modes do not arise. Since transmission is robust
in topological insulators, the essential field variable is the phase of the
transmitted field, or, equivalently, its spectral derivative, which is the
transmission time. Except near resonances with bulk localized modes that couple
the upper and lower edges of a topological insulator, the transmission time in
a topological insulator is proportional to the density of states and to the
energy excited within the sample. The average transmission time is enhanced in
disordered TIs near the band edge and slightly suppressed in the center of the
band gap. The variance of the transmission time at the band edge for a random
ensemble with moderate disorder is dominated by fluctuations at resonances with
localized states, and initially scales quadratically. When modes are absent,
such as in the center of the band gap, the transmission time self-averages and
its variance scales linearly. This leads to significant sample-to-sample
fluctuations in the transmission time. However, because the transmission time
is the sum of contributions from the continuum edge mode, which stretches
across the band gap, and far-off-resonance modes near the band edge, there are
no sharp features in the spectrum of transmission time in the center of the
band gap. As a result, ultrashort, broadband pulses are faithfully transmitted
in the center of the band gap of topological insulators with moderate disorder
and bent paths. This allows for robust signal propagation in complex
topological metawaveguides for applications in high-speed optoelectronics and
telecommunications.

platforms, such as social robotics and self-driving cars. Many trajectory
planning algorithms use a reference curve based Frenet frame with time to
reduce the planning dimension. However, there is a common implicit assumption
in classic trajectory planning approaches, which is that the generated
trajectory should follow the reference curve continuously. This assumption is
not always true in real applications and it might cause some undesired issues
in planning. One issue is that the projection of the planned trajectory onto
the reference curve maybe discontinuous. Then, some segments on the reference
curve are not the image of any part of the planned path. Another issue is that
the planned path might self-intersect when following a simple reference curve
continuously. The generated trajectories are unnatural and suboptimal ones when
these issues happen. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate these issues and
then introduce an efficient trajectory generation method which uses a new
transformation from the Cartesian frame to Frenet frames. Experimental results
on a simulated street scenario demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

real-world applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
human-computer interaction. Compared with the rapid development of deep
learning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance
segmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In
particular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class
is a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a
usual bin-picking scene, many identical objects are stacked together and the
model of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;
instead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.
Based on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)
for instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named
FPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for
inferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing
features of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers
geometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the
proposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest
geometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also
surpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally
efficient. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/xyjbaal/FPCC.

perform multi-scale analysis. By aggregating features at different scales,
MS-GWNN can encode the multi-scale contextual interactions in the whole

show that for every $f$, $cc_{IC}(f)\leq exp(cc(f))$. They also show that fully
computing the incentive compatible mechanism is strictly harder than computing
only the output: there exists a social choice function $f$ such that
$cc_{IC}(f)=cc(f)+1$. In a follow-up work, Babaioff, Blumrosen, Naor, and
Schapira [EC'08] provide a social choice function $f$ such that
$cc_{IC}(f)=\Theta(n\cdot cc(f))$, where $n$ is the number of players. The
question of whether the exponential upper bound of Fadel and Segal is tight
remained wide open. In this paper we solve this question by explicitly
providing an $f$ such that $cc_{IC}(f)= exp(cc(f))$. In fact, we establish this
via two very different proofs. In contrast, we show that if the players are
risk-neutral and we can compromise on a randomized truthful-in-expectation
implementation (and not on deterministic ex-post implementation) gives that
$cc_{TIE}(f)=poly(n,cc(f))$ for every function $f$, as long as the domain of
$f$ is single parameter or a convex multi-parameter domain. We also provide
efficient algorithms for deterministic computation of payments in several
important domains.

metal-rich thin disc to the old, metal-poor thick disc, a number of
smaller-scale structures -- such as velocity streams, north-south asymmetries,
and kinematic features of spiral arms -- are clearly revealed. Particularly,
the skewness of $V_{\phi}$ and $J_{\phi}$ reveals a new substructure at
$R\simeq12$\,kpc and $Z\simeq0$\,kpc, possibly related to dynamical effects of
spiral arms in the outer disc. We further study the stellar migration through
analysing the stellar orbital parameters and stellar birth radii. The results
suggest that the thick disc stars near the solar radii and beyond are mostly
migrated from the inner disc of $R\sim4 - 6$\,kpc due to their highly
eccentrical orbits. Stellar migration due to dynamical processes with angular
momentum transfer (churning) are prominent for both the old, metal-rich stars

Development Environments (IDEs), which can accelerate software development by
suggesting the next probable token based on the contextual code in real-time.
Recent studies have shown that statistical language modeling techniques can
improve the performance of code completion tools through learning from
large-scale software repositories. However, these models suffer from two major
drawbacks: a) Existing research uses static embeddings, which map a word to the
same vector regardless of its context. The differences in the meaning of a
token in varying contexts are lost when each token is associated with a single
representation; b) Existing language model based code completion models perform
poor on completing identifiers, and the type information of the identifiers is
ignored in most of these models. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
develop a multi-task learning based pre-trained language model for code
understanding and code generation with a Transformer-based neural architecture.
We pre-train it with hybrid objective functions that incorporate both code
understanding and code generation tasks. Then we fine-tune the pre-trained
model on code completion. During the completion, our model does not directly
predict the next token. Instead, we adopt multi-task learning to predict the
token and its type jointly and utilize the predicted type to assist the token
prediction. Experiments results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model when compared with state-of-the-art methods.

the resonant magnetic scattering, combined with the spectral function obtained

prefers to be parallel to the field ($m_{\text{AF}} \parallel H$), giving rise
to large and small moment sites around which the P$_{12}$ and Ru cage contract

emerge from Bose-Einstein condensation of electron-hole pairs. Some candidate
materials were suggested but it has been elusive to confirm its existence.
Recent works gave renewed support for the EI picture of the charge density wave
(CDW) state below the critical temperature $T_c \approx 200 $ K of
$1T$-TiSe$_{2}$. Yet, an important link to its establishment is to show that a
majority fraction of the measured $T_c$ indeed follows from the Coulomb
interaction alone, while a quantitative match of the $T_c$ may require
assistance from the electron-lattice coupling. This will establish that the CDW
is formed predominantly by the Coulomb interaction and help confirm the EI view
for TiSe$_2$. Here, we provide such calculations by solving the exciton gap
equation with material specific electronic structures. We obtain, with no
fitting parameters, $T_c \approx 135 \pm 27$ K for the normal state gap of $E_g
\approx 74 \pm 15$ meV. It seems that the calculated $T_c$ from Coulomb
interaction gives a majority fraction of experimental $T_c$ for recently
determined values of $E_g$. The measured doping dependence of $T_c$ was
satisfactorily reproduced as well. Also in agreement with experiments are the
same set of calculations of the photoemission spectroscopy and density of
states. The semiconducting state above and EI below $T_c$ together should give
a coherent picture of $1T$-TiSe$_2$.

language generation (NLG). However, they are treated as black boxes and lack
interpretability. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework,
heterogeneous rendering machines (HRM), that interprets how neural generators
render an input dialogue act (DA) into an utterance. HRM consists of a renderer
set and a mode switcher. The renderer set contains multiple decoders that vary
in both structure and functionality. For every generation step, the mode
switcher selects an appropriate decoder from the renderer set to generate an
item (a word or a phrase). To verify the effectiveness of our method, we have
conducted extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets. In terms of automatic
metrics (e.g., BLEU), our model is competitive with the current
state-of-the-art method. The qualitative analysis shows that our model can
interpret the rendering process of neural generators well. Human evaluation
also confirms the interpretability of our proposed approach.

their dissimilar projected bulk band structures and the ensemble interpretation
of quantum mechanics, according to which all resonant electrons are governed by
a single wave function. Ag(100) has an energy gap above its vacuum level,
whereas Ag(111) does not. Consequently, the dissipation rate of the wave

coupling, only small AMR signals have been detected thus far, prompting a
search for new mechanisms to enhance the signal. In this study on CaMnO3/CaIrO3
heterostructures, we report a unique dual-four-fold symmetric 70% AMR; a signal
two orders of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar systems. We
find that one order is enhanced by tuning a large biaxial anisotropy through
octahedral tilts of similar sense in the constituent layers, while the second
order is triggered by a spin-flop transition in a nearly Mott-type phase.
Dynamics between these two phenomena as evidenced by the step-like AMR and a
superimposed biaxial-anisotropy-induced AMR capture a subtle interplay of
pseudospin coupling with the lattice and external magnetic field. Our study
shows that a combination of charge-transfer, interlayer coupling, and a
spin-flop transition can yield a giant AMR relevant for sensing and
antiferromagnetic memory applications.

Liouville space basis using the complex eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian.
We have calculated the one- and two-dimensional Fourier transform SSESR (1DFT

While the 1DFT SSESR spectrum reflects the complex eigenenergy spectrum, the
2DFT gives detailed information on the quantum coherence in the spin-relaxation
dynamics as a cross-correlation between the two frequencies. We found a giant
response of the coherent SSESR around the EP ring singularity due to the
vanishing normalization factors at the EP ring and the resonance effect. We
have discovered that the giant response is much larger in magnitudes in the

and etc. see rapid growth during recent years. Despite the remarkable
achievements, the repetition problem has been observed in nearly all text
generation models undermining the generation performance extensively. To solve
the repetition problem, many methods have been proposed, but there is no
existing theoretical analysis to show why this problem happens and how it is
resolved. In this paper, we propose a new framework for theoretical analysis
for the repetition problem. We first define the Average Repetition Probability
(ARP) to characterize the repetition problem quantitatively. Then, we conduct
an extensive analysis of the Markov generation model and derive several upper
bounds of the average repetition probability with intuitive understanding. We
show that most of the existing methods are essentially minimizing the upper
bounds explicitly or implicitly. Grounded on our theory, we show that the
repetition problem is, unfortunately, caused by the traits of our language
itself. One major reason is attributed to the fact that there exist too many
words predicting the same word as the subsequent word with high probability.
Consequently, it is easy to go back to that word and form repetitions and we
dub it as the high inflow problem. Furthermore, we derive a concentration bound
of the average repetition probability for a general generation model. Finally,
based on the theoretical upper bounds, we propose a novel rebalanced encoding
approach to alleviate the high inflow problem. The experimental results show
that our theoretical framework is applicable in general generation models and
our proposed rebalanced encoding approach alleviates the repetition problem
significantly. The source code of this paper can be obtained from

drift towards high-density regions. The drift affected heat kernel based
affinity with a globally fixed Parzen window either discards genuine neighbors
or forces distant data points to become a member of the neighborhood. This
yields a biased affinity matrix. In this paper, the bias due to uneven data
sampling on the Riemannian manifold is catered to by a variable Parzen window
determined as a function of neighborhood size, ambient dimension, flatness
range, etc. Additionally, affinity adjustment is used which offsets the effect
of uneven sampling responsible for the bias. An affinity metric which takes
into consideration the irregular sampling effect to yield accurate label

porous silica (MCM-41) and periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) by
incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. The effect of tuning
the water/surface interaction from hydrophilic to more hydrophobic on the water
mobility, while keeping the pore size in the range 3.5-4.1 nm, was assessed
from the comparative study of three PMOs comprising different organic bridging
units and the purely siliceous MCM-41 case. An extended dynamical range was
achieved by combining time-of-flight (IN5B) and backscattering (IN16B)
quasielastic neutron spectrometers providing complementary energy resolutions.
Liquid water was studied at regularly spaced temperatures ranging from 300 K to
243 K. In all systems, the molecular dynamics could be described consistently
by the combination of two independent motions resulting from fast local motion
around the average molecule position and the confined translational jump
diffusion of its center of mass. All the molecules performed local relaxations,
whereas the translational motion of a fraction of molecules was frozen on the
experimental timescale. This study provides a comprehensive microscopic view on
the dynamics of liquid water confined in mesopores, with distinct surface
chemistries, in terms of non-mobile/mobile fraction, self-diffusion
coefficient, residence time, confining radius, local relaxation time, and their
temperature dependence. Importantly, it demonstrates that the strength of the
water/surface interaction determines the long-time tail of the dynamics, which
we attributed to the translational diffusion of interfacial molecules, while
the water dynamics in the pore center is barely affected by the interface
hydrophilicity.

existence of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Even if a number of converse
results have been reported regarding the existence of such functionals, there

time-delay systems for which such constructive methods are lacking, it was
shown that Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals that are also allowed to depend on
the time-derivative of the state-trajectory are efficient tools for the study
of the stability properties. However, in such an approach the initial condition
needs to be assumed absolutely continuous with a square integrable weak

are evaluated based on the magnitude of both the initial condition and its

an autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its
environment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems
as a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and
nonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python
and OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB's recently launched (R2019a)
Reinforcement Learning Toolbox to develop the valve controller; trained using
the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink to
simulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for
evaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and
experiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL
controller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a
lower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better
at disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves.
Successful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring
significant investment of time and efforts. We introduce ""Graded Learning"" as a
simplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic
""Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning"". It is shown via experiments that it
helps converge the learning task of complex non-linear real world systems.

order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster
medium (ICM) properties of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with ${\sim}150$
X-ray counts. One of the dominant sources of uncertainty on the ICM density
profile estimated with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow X-ray data
is due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the ICM temperature
obtained through the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We
show that we can decrease the uncertainty on the density profile by a factor
${\sim}5$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness profile
measured by $Chandra$ and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the
SPT cluster catalog. We apply this technique to the whole sample of 67 clusters
in order to track the evolution of the ICM core density during cluster growth.
We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile is well modeled by the
combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core
profile. We show that the fraction of cool-cores in this sample is remarkably
stable with redshift although clusters have gained a factor ${\sim}4$ in total

relying on a random termination rule before $\kmax$ and on a constant step size
in the Stochastic Approximation step. Our bounds provide some improvements on
the literature. First, they allow $\kmax$ to scale as $\sqrt{n}$ which is
better than $n^{2/3}$ which was the best rate obtained so far; it is at the
cost of a larger dependence upon the tolerance $\epsilon$, thus making this
control relevant for small to medium accuracy with respect to the number of

that thanks to an optimized choice of the step size and of the bounds in terms
of quantities characterizing the optimization problem at hand, our results
desig a less conservative choice of the step size and provide a better control

formation and stellar evolution with observations. In order to test these
theories, we need accurate models of observable binary populations. The Kepler
Eclipsing Binary Catalog (KEBC), with its estimated $>$90% completeness,
provides an observational anchor on binary population models. In this work we
present the results of a new forward-model of the binary star population in the
Kepler field. The forward-model takes a single star population from a model of
the galaxy and pairs the stars into binaries by applying the constraints on the
population from the results of observational binary population surveys such as
arXiv:1007.0414 and arXiv:1303.3028. A synthetic binary population is
constructed from the initial distributions of orbital parameters. We identify
the eclipsing binary sample from the generated binary star population and
compare this with the observed sample of eclipsing binaries contained in the
KEBC. Finally, we update the distributions of the synthetic population and
repeat the process until the synthetic eclipsing binary sample agrees with the
KEBC. The end result of this process is a model of the underlying binary star
population that has been fit to observations. We find that for fixed flat mass
ratio and eccentricity input distributions, the binary period distribution is
logarithmically flat above $\sim$3.2d. With additional constraints on
distributions from observations, we can further adjust the synthetic binary
population by relaxing other input constraints, such as mass ratio and
eccentricity.

enables compelling applications such as subtitle translation for a live event

allow editing of partial translation giving rise to re-translation approaches.
The current re-translation approaches are based on autoregressive sequence
generation models (ReTA), which generate tar-get tokens in the (partial)
translation sequentially. The multiple re-translations with sequential
generation inReTAmodelslead to an increased inference time gap between the
incoming source input and the corresponding target output as the source input

ReTA models are not favorable for resource-constrained devices. In this work,
we propose a faster re-translation system based on a non-autoregressive

language models (PLMs) by emitting predictions in internal layers without
passing through the entire model. In this paper, we empirically analyze the
working mechanism of dynamic early exiting and find that it faces a performance
bottleneck under high speed-up ratios. On one hand, the PLMs' representations
in shallow layers lack high-level semantic information and thus are not
sufficient for accurate predictions. On the other hand, the exiting decisions
made by internal classifiers are unreliable, leading to wrongly emitted early
predictions. We instead propose a new framework for accelerating the inference
of PLMs, CascadeBERT, which dynamically selects proper-sized and complete
models in a cascading manner, providing comprehensive representations for
predictions. We further devise a difficulty-aware objective, encouraging the
model to output the class probability that reflects the real difficulty of each
instance for a more reliable cascading mechanism. Experimental results show
that CascadeBERT can achieve an overall 15\% improvement under 4$\times$
speed-up compared with existing dynamic early exiting methods on six
classification tasks, yielding more calibrated and accurate predictions.

By the complex geometry and composition of the periodontal ligament, its

location around the root (cervical, middle, or apical). These different aspects
of the periodontal ligament make it difficult to develop a functional

periodontal ligament structural organization is specific to its biomechanical
environment, and its biomechanical properties are specific to its structural
arrangement. This balance between structure and biomechanics can be explained
by a mechanosensitive periodontal cellular activity. These specifications have
to be considered in the further tissue engineering strategies for the

technique in krypton (Kr) at variable pressure (0.1-10 mbar). The laser

the depletion of the density of the Kr 5p'[3/2]$_2$ fluorescing state through
photoionization (PIN) and amplified stimulated emission (ASE) is investigated.
This is done by combining TALIF experiments with a simple 0D numerical model.
We demonstrate that for a gas pressure of 3 mbar and 15 < $\le$ 480
MW.cm$^{-2}$, a saturated fluorescence signal is obtained, which is largely
attributed to PIN, ASE being negligible. Also, a broadening of the two-photon
absorption line (i.e. 4p$^6$ $^1$S0$\to$5p'[3/2]$_2$) is recorded due to the
production of charged species through PIN, inducing a Stark effect. For
I$\le$15 MW.cm$^{-2}$, though, PIN is significantly limited, the absorption
line is noticeably narrowed, and the quadratic dependence of the TALIF signal
intensity versus the laser energy is obtained. Thus, in this case, the
investigated Kr TALIF scheme, using the 5p'[3/2]$_2\to$5s[3/2]$_1$ fluorescence
channel, can be used for calibration purposes in ps-TALIF experiments. These
results are of interest for fundamental research since most ps-TALIF studies
performed in Kr do not investigate in detail the role of PIN and ASE on the
depletion of the Kr 5p'[3/2]$_2$ state density. Moreover, this work contributes
to the development of ps-TALIF for determining absolute densities and quenching
coefficients of H and N atoms in plasmas. This is useful in numerous

perform a quantum non-demolition measurement of a transverse component of the
polarized collective nuclear spin, we maintain a population in helium-3
metastable state with a discharge. The collective spin associated to $F=1/2$
metastable level hybridizes with the ground state one by metastability exchange
collisions. To access nuclear spin fluctuations, one continuously measures the
light leaking out of an optical cavity, where it has interacted dispersively
with the metastable state collective spin. In a three coupled collective spin
model (nuclear, metastable and Stokes), we calculate moments of the nuclear
spin squeezed component $I_z$ conditioned on the time averaged optical signal.
In the photon counting scheme, the squeezed observable is $I_z^2$ rather than
$I_z$. In the homodyne detection scheme, we solve the stochastic equation for
the system state conditioned on the measurement; the conditional expectation
value of $I_z$ depends linearly on the signal and the conditional variance of
$I_z$ does not depend on it. The conditional variance decreases as
$(\Gamma_{\rm sq}t)^{-1}$, where the squeezing rate $\Gamma_{\rm sq}$ depends
linearly on the light intensity in the cavity at weak atom-field coupling and
saturates at strong coupling to the ground state metastability exchange
effective rate, proportional to the metastable atom density. Including
de-excitation of metastable atoms at the walls, which induces nuclear spin
decoherence with an effective rate $\gamma_\alpha$, we find a limit
$\propto(\gamma_\alpha/\Gamma_{\rm sq})^{1/2}$ on the conditional variance

Light clusters are produced in space and time very close to the scission point.
Within the nonequilibrium statistical operator method, a generalized Gibbs
distribution is constructed from the information given by the observed yields
of isotopes. Using this relevant statistical operator, yields are calculated
taking excited states and continuum correlations into account, in accordance
with the virial expansion of the equation of state. Clusters with mass number
$A \le 10$ are well described using the nonequilibrium generalizations of

Yields of larger clusters, which fail to reach this quasi-equilibrium form of
the relevant distribution, are described by nucleation kinetics, and a
saddle-to-scission relaxation time of about 7000 fm/c is inferred. Light
charged particle emission, described by reaction kinetics and virial

a novel approach for image-to-image retrieval using scene graph similarity
measured by graph neural networks. In our approach, graph neural networks are
trained to predict the proxy image relevance measure, computed from
human-annotated captions using a pre-trained sentence similarity model. We
collect and publish the dataset for image relevance measured by human
annotators to evaluate retrieval algorithms. The collected dataset shows that
our method agrees well with the human perception of image similarity than other
competitive baselines.

Whiteland","On Abelian Closures of Infinite Non-binary Words",,,,,"math.CO cs.FL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Two finite words $u$ and $v$ are called abelian equivalent if each letter
occurs equally many times in both $u$ and $v$. The abelian closure
$\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ of an infinite word $\mathbf{x}$ is the set of
infinite words $\mathbf{y}$ such that, for each factor $u$ of $\mathbf{y}$,
there exists a factor $v$ of $\mathbf{x}$ which is abelian equivalent to $u$.
The notion of an abelian closure gives a characterization of Sturmian words:
among uniformly recurrent binary words, periodic and aperiodic Sturmian words
are exactly those words for which $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{x})$ equals the shift
orbit closure $\Omega(\mathbf{x})$. Furthermore, for an aperiodic binary word
that is not Sturmian, its abelian closure contains infinitely many minimial
subshifts. In this paper we consider the abelian closures of well-known
families of non-binary words, such as balanced words and minimal complexity
words. We also consider abelian closures of general subshifts and make some
initial observations of their abelian closures and pose some related open
questions.

LBM is proposed to treat curved solid walls of microgaseous flows. The
developed boundary treatment combines the Maxwellian diffuse reflection scheme
and a single-node boundary scheme which contains a free parameter as well as
the distance ratio. The curved boundary condition is analyzed within the
multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model for a unidirectional microflow. It is
shown that the derived slip velocity depends on the free parameter as well as
the distance ratio and relaxation times. By virtue of the free parameter, the
combination parameter and the uniform relaxation time are theoretically
determined to realize the accurate slip boundary condition. In addition, it is
found that besides the halfway diffuse-bounce-back (DBB) scheme, previous
curved boundary schemes only containing the distance ratio cannot ensure
uniform relaxation times to realize the slip boundary condition. Some numerical
examples with planar and curved boundaries are carried out to validate the
present curved boundary scheme. The good and robust consistency of numerical
predictions with analytical solutions demonstrates our theoretical analysis.

total ejecta mass reaches $\approx0.1\,M_\odot$ with an average velocity of
$\approx0.1\,c$ and lanthanide fraction of $\approx 0.005$. We further perform
the radiative transfer simulation employing the obtained ejecta profile. We
find that, contrary to a naive expectation from the large ejecta mass and low
lanthanide fraction, the optical emission is not as bright as that in
GW170817/AT2017gfo, while the infrared emission can be brighter. This light
curve property is attributed to preferential diffusion of photons toward the
equatorial direction due to the prolate ejecta morphology, large opacity
contribution of Zr, Y, and lanthanides, and low specific heating rate of the
ejecta. Our results suggest that these light curve features could be used as an
indicator for the presence of a long-lived remnant NS. We also found that the
bright optical emission broadly consistent with GW170817/AT2017gfo is realized

that the robustness and loops are strongly related to each other. Therefore, we

Let $\operatorname{gr}_J(R/I)$ denote the associated ring of $R/I$ with respect
to $J$, which corresponds to the normal cone in geometry. The main result of
this paper shows that if $I = (f_1,...,f_r)$, where $f_1,...,f_r$ is a
$J$-filter regular sequence, there exists a number $N$ such that if $f_i'
\equiv f_i \mod J^N$ and $I' = (f_1',...,f_r')$, then $\operatorname{gr}_J(R/I)
\cong \operatorname{gr}_J(R/I')$. If $J$ is an $\mathfrak m$-primary ideal,
this result implies a long standing conjecture of Srinivas and Trivedi on the
invariance of the Hilbert-Samuel function under small perturbations, which has
been solved recently by Ma, Quy and Smirnov. As a byproduct, the Artin-Rees
number of $I$ and $I'$ with respect to $J$ are the same. Furthermore, we give
explicit upper bounds for the smallest number $N$ with the above property.
These results solve two problems raised by Ma, Quy and Smirnov. There are other
interesting consequences on the invariance of the Achilles-Manaresi function,
the relation type, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, the Cohen-Macaulayness
and the Gorensteiness of the Rees algebra of $R/I$ with respect to $J$ under
small perturbation of $I$. We also prove a converse of the main result showing
that the condition $I$ being generated by a $J$-filter regular sequence is the
best possible for its validity. The main result can be also extended to
perturbations with respect to filtrations of ideals. As a consequence, if $R$
is a power series ring, $f_1,...,f_r$ is a filter regular sequence, and $f_i'$
is the $n$-jet of $f_i$ for $n \gg 0$, then $I$ and $I'$ have the same initial
ideal with respect to any Noetherian monomial order. A special case of this

scale-invariant hyperelectric spectrum, when the coupling decreases a flat
hypermagnetic spectrum can be generated for typical wavelengths larger than the
effective horizon. After the gauge coupling flattens out the late-time
hypermagnetic power spectra outside the horizon in the radiation epoch are
determined by the hyperelectric fields at the end of inflation whereas the
opposite is true in the case of decreasing coupling. Instead of imposing an
abrupt freeze after inflation, we consider a smooth evolution of the mode
functions by positing that the gauge couplings and their conformal time
derivatives are always continuous together with the background extrinsic
curvature. The amplified gauge power spectra are classified according to their
transformation properties under the duality symmetry. After clarifying the role
of the comoving and of the physical spectra in the formulation of the relevant
magnetogenesis constraints, the parameter space of the scenario is scrutinized.
It turns out that a slightly blue hyperelectric spectrum during inflation may
lead to a quasi-flat hypermagnetic spectrum prior to matter radiation equality
and before the relevant wavelengths reenter the effective horizon. In this
framework the gauge coupling is always perturbative but the induced large-scale
magnetic fields can be of the order of a few hundredths of a nG and over
typical length scales between a fraction of the Mpc and $100$ Mpc prior to the
gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy.

consists of multiple types of nodes and edges. Representation learning on
heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain low-dimensional node representations that
could preserve both node attributes and relation information. However, most of
the existing graph convolution approaches were designed for homogeneous graphs,
and therefore cannot handle heterogeneous graphs. Some recent methods designed
for heterogeneous graphs are also faced with several issues, including the
insufficient utilization of heterogeneous properties, structural information
loss, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose HGConv, a novel
Heterogeneous Graph Convolution approach, to learn comprehensive node
representations on heterogeneous graphs with a hybrid micro/macro level
convolutional operation. Different from existing methods, HGConv could perform
convolutions on the intrinsic structure of heterogeneous graphs directly at
both micro and macro levels: A micro-level convolution to learn the importance
of nodes within the same relation, and a macro-level convolution to distinguish
the subtle difference across different relations. The hybrid strategy enables
HGConv to fully leverage heterogeneous information with proper
interpretability. Moreover, a weighted residual connection is designed to
aggregate both inherent attributes and neighbor information of the focal node
adaptively. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate not only the
superiority of HGConv over existing methods, but also the intuitive
interpretability of our approach for graph analysis.

  Understanding","ACL 2021 main conference",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Pre-training of text and layout has proved effective in a variety of
visually-rich document understanding tasks due to its effective model
architecture and the advantage of large-scale unlabeled scanned/digital-born
documents. We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to
model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal
framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder,
LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but
also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it
better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage.
Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the
Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative
positional relationship among different text blocks. Experiment results show
that LayoutLMv2 outperforms LayoutLM by a large margin and achieves new
state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of downstream visually-rich document
understanding tasks, including FUNSD (0.7895 $\to$ 0.8420), CORD (0.9493 $\to$
0.9601), SROIE (0.9524 $\to$ 0.9781), Kleister-NDA (0.8340 $\to$ 0.8520),
RVL-CDIP (0.9443 $\to$ 0.9564), and DocVQA (0.7295 $\to$ 0.8672). We made our
model and code publicly available at \url{https://aka.ms/layoutlmv2}.

  one",,,"10.1007/s00209-022-02967-z",,"math.AG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $M$ be a complex manifold. We prove that a compact submanifold $S\subset
M$ with splitting tangent sequence (called a splitting submanifold) is rational
homogeneous when $M$ is in a large class of rational homogeneous spaces of
Picard number one. Moreover, when $M$ is irreducible Hermitian symmetric, we
prove that $S$ must be also Hermitian symmetric. The basic tool we use is the
restriction and projection map $\pi$ of the global holomorphic vector fields on
the ambient space which is induced from the splitting condition. The usage of
global holomorphic vector fields may help us set up a new scheme to classify
the splitting submanifolds in explicit examples, as an example we give a
differential geometric proof for the classification of compact splitting
submanifolds with $\dim\geq 2$ in a hyperquadric, which has been previously
proven using algebraic geometry.

  Finder Spectroscopy","Astronomical Journal, in press",,"10.3847/1538-3881/abd7ee",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have used the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF) to gather high
resolution, high signal-to-noise near-infrared spectra of 13 field red
horizontal-branch (RHB) stars, one open-cluster giant, and one very metal-poor
halo red giant. The HPF spectra cover the 0.81$-$1.28 \micron\ wavelength range
of the $zyJ$ bands, filling in the gap between the optical (0.4$-$1.0~\micron)
and infrared (1.5$-$2.4~\micron) spectra already available for the program
stars. We derive abundances of 17 species from LTE-based computations involving
equivalent widths and spectrum syntheses, and estimate abundance corrections
for the species that are most affected by departures from LTE in RHB stars.
Generally good agreement is found between HPF-based metallicities and abundance
ratios and those from the optical and infrared spectral regions. Light element
transitions dominate the HPF spectra of these red giants, and HPF data can be
used to derive abundances from species with poor or no representation in
optical spectra (\eg, \species{C}{i}, \species{P}{i}, \species{S}{i},
\species{K}{i}). Attention is drawn to the HPF abundances in two field
solar-metallicity RHB stars of special interest: one with an extreme carbon
isotope ratio, and one with a rare very large lithium content. The latter star
is unique in our sample by exhibiting very strong \species{He}{i} 10830~\AA\
absorption. The abundances of the open cluster giant concur with those derived
from other wavelength regions. Detections of \species{C}{i} and \species{S}{i}
in HD~122563 are reported, yielding the lowest metallicity determination of
[S/Fe] from more than one multiplet.

optimizers and a fundamental problem in DBMS. A desired CardEst method should
attain good algorithm performance, be stable to varied data settings, and be
friendly to system deployment. However, no existing CardEst method can fulfill
the three criteria at the same time. Traditional methods often have significant
algorithm drawbacks such as large estimation errors. Recently proposed deep
learning based methods largely improve the estimation accuracy but their
performance can be greatly affected by data and often difficult for system
deployment.
  In this paper, we revitalize the Bayesian networks (BN) for CardEst by
incorporating the techniques of probabilistic programming languages. We present
BayesCard, the first framework that inherits the advantages of BNs, i.e., high
estimation accuracy and interpretability, while overcomes their drawbacks, i.e.
low structure learning and inference efficiency. This makes BayesCard a perfect
candidate for commercial DBMS deployment. Our experimental results on several
single-table and multi-table benchmarks indicate BayesCard's superiority over
existing state-of-the-art CardEst methods: BayesCard achieves comparable or
better accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference time, 1-3 orders
faster training time, 1-3 orders smaller model size, and 1-2 orders faster
updates. Meanwhile, BayesCard keeps stable performance when varying data with
different settings. We also deploy BayesCard into PostgreSQL. On the IMDB
benchmark workload, it improves the end-to-end query time by 13.3%, which is
very close to the optimal result of 14.2% using an oracle of true cardinality.

range structural order, with invariance under rotations and under discrete
scale change, but without translational invariance. d-dimensional quasicrystals
can be described in terms of lattices of higher dimension $D>d$, and many of
their properties can be simply derived from analyses that take into account the
extra ""hidden"" dimensions. In particular, as recent theoretical and
experimental studies have shown, quasicrystals can have topological properties
inherited from the parent crystals. These properties are discussed here for the
simplest of quasicrystals, the 1D Fibonacci chain. The Fibonacci noninteracting
tight-binding Hamiltonians are characterized by multifractality of spectrum and
states, which is manifested in many of its physical properties, notably in
transport. Perturbations due to disorder and re-entrance phenomena are
described, along with the crossover to strong Anderson localization.
Perturbations due to boundary conditions also give information on the spatial
and topological electronic properties, as is shown for the superconducting
proximity effect. Related models including phonon and mixed Fibonacci models
are discussed, as well as generalizations to other quasiperiodic chains and
higher dimensional extensions. Interacting quasiperiodic systems and the case
for many body localization are briefly discussed. Some experimental
realizations of the 1D quasicrystal and their potential applications are
described.

ScO$_{2}^-$, TiO$_{2}^-$, VO$_{2}^-$, CrO$_{2}^-$, MnO$_{2}^-$, are calculated
using semilocal and hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and many-body
perturbation theory within the $GW$ approximation using one-shot perturbative
and eigenvalue self-consistent formalisms. Different levels of theory are
compared with each other and with available photoelectron spectra. We show that
one-shot $GW$ with a PBE0 starting point ($G_0W_0$@PBE0) consistently provides
very good agreement for all experimentally measured binding energies (within
0.1-0.2 eV or less), which we attribute to the success of PBE0 in mitigating
self-interaction error and providing good quasiparticle wave functions, which
renders a first-order perturbative $GW$ correction effective. One-shot $GW$
calculations with semilocal exchange in the DFT starting point (e.g.
$G_0W_0$@PBE) do poorly in predicting electron removal energies by underbinding
orbitals with typical errors near 1.5 eV. Higher amounts of exact exchange
(e.g. 50%) in the DFT starting point of one-shot $GW$ do not provide very good
agreement with experiment by overbinding orbitals with typical errors near 0.5
eV. While not as accurate as $G_0W_0$@PBE0, the $G$-only eigenvalue
self-consistent $GW$ scheme with $W$ fixed to the PBE level ($G_nW_0$@PBE)
provides a reasonably predictive level of theory (typical errors near 0.3 eV)
to describe photoelectron spectra of these $3d-$transition metal dioxide
anions. Adding eigenvalue self-consistency also in $W$ ($G_nW_n$@PBE), on the
other hand, worsens the agreement with experiment overall. Our findings on the
performance of various $GW$ methods are discussed in the context of our
previous studies on other transition metal oxide molecular systems.

show that the production of single SM-like Higgs bosons via $W^{\pm}/Z$-pairs

  Capillary Network of a Mouse Brain","22 pages, 5 Figures",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Purpose: To simulate the intravoxel incoherent perfusion magnetic resonance
magnitude signal from the motion of blood particles in three realistic vascular
network graphs from a mouse brain. Methods: In three networks generated from
the cortex of a mouse scanned by two-photon laser microscopy, blood flow in
each vessel was simulated using Poiseuille law. The trajectories, flow speeds
and phases acquired by a fixed number of simulated blood particles during a
Stejskal-Tanner monopolar pulse gradient scheme were computed. The resulting
magnitude signal as a function of b-value was obtained by integrating all
phases and the pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* was estimated by fitting an
exponential signal decay. To better understand the anatomical source of the
IVIM perfusion signal, the above was repeated by restricting the simulation to
various types of vessels. Results: The characteristics of the three
microvascular networks were respectively: vessel lengths [mean +/- std. dev.]:
67.2 +/- 53.6 um, 59.8 +/- 46.2 um, and 64.5 +/- 50.9 um; diameters: 6.0 +/-
3.5 um, network 2: 5.7 +/- 3.6 um, and network 3: 6.1 +/- 3.7 um; simulated
blood velocity: 0.9 +/- 1.7 um/ms, 1.4 +/- 2.5 um/ms and 0.7 +/- 2.1 um/ms.
Exponential fitting of the simulated signal decay as a function of b-value
resulted in the following D* [10-3 mm2/s]: 31.7, 40.4 and 33.4. The signal
decay for low b-values was the largest in the larger vessels, but the smaller
vessels and the capillaries accounted more to the total volume of the networks.
Conclusion:This simulation improves the theoretical understanding of the IVIM
perfusion estimation method by directly linking the MR IVIM perfusion signal to
an ultra-high resolution measurement of the microvascular network and a
realistic blood flow simulation.

fundamental physics and for their potential applications, especially in the
rapidly growing field of quantum computing. Despite intense theoretical and
experimental efforts, materials with a reasonably high transition temperature
are still rare. Even more rare are those that combine superconductivity with a
non-trivial band topology, to potentially host exotic states of matter such as
Majorana fermions. Here, we predict a remarkably high superconducting critical
temperature of 21-28 K in the easily exfoliable, topologically non-trivial 2D
semimetal W2N3 . By studying its electronic and superconducting properties as a
function of doping and strain, we find large changes in the electron-phonon
interactions that make this material a unique platform to study different
coupling regimes and test the limits of current theories of superconductivity.
Last, we discuss the possibility of tuning the material to achieve coexistence
of superconductivity and topologically non-trivial edge states.

  pp, no figure",,,,"math.DG math.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The classical Weyl problem (solved by Lewy, Alexandrov, Pogorelov, and
others) asks whether any metric of curvature $K\geq 0$ on the sphere is induced
on the boundary of a unique convex body in $\R^3$. The answer was extended to
surfaces in hyperbolic space by Alexandrov in the 1950s, and a ``dual''
statement, describing convex bodies in terms of the third fundamental form of
their boundary (e.g. their dihedral angles, for an ideal polyhedron) was later
proved.
  We describe three conjectural generalizations of the Weyl problem in $\HH^3$
and its dual to unbounded convex subsets and convex surfaces, in ways that are
relevant to contemporary geometry since a number of recent results and
well-known open problems can be considered as special cases. One focus is on
convex domain having a ``thin'' asymptotic boundary, for instance a quasicircle
-- this part of the problem is strongly related to the theory of Kleinian
groups. A second direction is towards convex subsets with a ``thick'' ideal
boundary, for instance a disjoint union of disks -- here one find connections
to problems in complex analysis, such as the Koebe circle domain conjecture. A
third direction is towards complete, convex disks of infinite area in $\HH^3$
and surfaces in hyperbolic ends -- with connections to questions on circle
packings or grafting on the hyperbolic disk. Similar statements are proposed in
anti-de Sitter geometry, a Lorentzian cousin of hyperbolic geometry where
interesting new phenomena can occur, and in Minkowski and Half-pipe geometry.
We also collect some partial new results mostly based on recent works.

state $s_0$. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based approach that
interleaves discovering new states from $s_0$ and improving the accuracy of a
model estimate that is used to compute goal-conditioned policies to reach newly
discovered states. The resulting algorithm, DisCo, achieves a sample complexity
scaling as $\tilde{O}(L^5 S_{L+\epsilon} \Gamma_{L+\epsilon} A \epsilon^{-2})$,
where $A$ is the number of actions, $S_{L+\epsilon}$ is the number of states
that are incrementally reachable from $s_0$ in $L+\epsilon$ steps, and
$\Gamma_{L+\epsilon}$ is the branching factor of the dynamics over such states.
This improves over the algorithm proposed in [1] in both $\epsilon$ and $L$ at
the cost of an extra $\Gamma_{L+\epsilon}$ factor, which is small in most
environments of interest. Furthermore, DisCo is the first algorithm that can
return an $\epsilon/c_{\min}$-optimal policy for any cost-sensitive
shortest-path problem defined on the $L$-reachable states with minimum cost
$c_{\min}$. Finally, we report preliminary empirical results confirming our

performance and computational resources. Apart from increased performance,
large scale systems face two challenges that hinder further growth: energy
efficiency and resiliency. At the same time, applications seeking increased
performance rely on advanced parallelism for exploiting system resources, which
leads to increased pressure on system interconnects. At large system scales,
increased communication locality can be beneficial both in terms of application
performance and energy consumption. Towards this direction, several studies
focus on deriving a mapping of an application's processes to system nodes in a
way that communication cost is reduced. A common approach is to express both
the application's communication patterns and the system architecture as graphs
and then solve the corresponding mapping problem. Apart from communication
cost, the completion time of a job can also be affected by node failures. Node
failures may result in job abortions, requiring job restarts. In this paper, we
address the problem of assigning processes to system resources with the goal of
reducing communication cost while also taking into account node failures. The
proposed approach is integrated into the Slurm resource manager. Evaluation
results show that, in scenarios where few nodes have a low outage probability,
the proposed process placement approach achieves a notable decrease in the
completion time of batches of MPI jobs. Compared to the default process
placement approach in Slurm, the reduction is 18.9% and 31%, respectively for
two different MPI applications.

feature-level fusion that generates a secure multimodal template from each
user's face and iris biometrics. We integrate a deep hashing (binarization)
technique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal
shared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture
by combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate
it with a deep hashing framework, which makes it computationally prohibitive to
forge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication. The
efficacy of the proposed approach is shown using a multimodal database of face
and iris and it is observed that the matching performance is improved due to
the fusion of multiple biometrics. Furthermore, the proposed approach also
provides cancelability and unlinkability of the templates along with improved
privacy of the biometric data. Additionally, we also test the proposed hashing
function for an image retrieval application using a benchmark dataset. The main
goal of this paper is to develop a method for integrating multimodal fusion,

manners to control the process. Many of them have a global assumption around
the distributions of the process data. They are supposed to be Normal, but it

made some wrong decisions that waste funds. So, the main question while working
with multivariate data set is how to find the multivariate distribution of the

knowledge, a copula function guarantees dependence on the result function. It
is not enough when there is no other fundamental information about the

maximum entropy concept to deal with this situation. In this paper, first of
all, we get the joint distribution of a data set from a manufacturing process

effective adjuvant radiation technique for early-stage breast cancer. However,
clinical dose evaluations follow the water-based TG-43 approach with its
considerable approximations. Towards clinical adoption of advanced TG-186
model-based dose evaluations, this study presents a comprehensive investigation
for PBSI considering both target and normal tissue doses. METHODS: Dose
calculations are performed with the free open-source Monte Carlo (MC) code,
egs_brachy, using 2 types of virtual patient models: TG43sim (simulated TG-43
conditions: all water with no interseed attenuation) and MCref (heterogeneous
tissue modelling from patient CT, interseed attenuation, seeds at implant
angle) for 35 patients. Sensitivity of dose metrics to seed orientation and the
threshold for glandular/adipose tissue segmentation are assessed. RESULTS: In
the target volume, D90 is 14.1% lower with MCref than with TG43sim, on average.
Conversely, normal tissue doses are generally higher with MCref than with
TG43sim, e.g., by 22% for skin D1cm2, 82% for ribs Dmax, and 71% for heart
D1cm3. Discrepancies between MCref and TG43sim doses vary over the patient
cohort, as well as with the tissue and metric considered. Doses are sensitive
to the glandular/adipose tissue segmentation threshold with differences of a
few percent in target D90. Skin doses are sensitive to seed orientation.
CONCLUSIONS: TG-43 dose evaluations generally underestimate doses to critical
normal organs/tissues while overestimating target doses. There is considerable
variation in MCref and TG43sim on a patient-by-patient basis, suggesting that
clinical adoption of patient-specific MC dose calculations is motivated. The
MCref framework presented herein provides a consistent modelling approach for
clinical implementation of advanced TG-186 dose calculations.

a coupling matrix to predict the characteristics of this kind of indirect

layers (instead of the uppermost layer) for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
models, which has proven effective on various NLP tasks. However, it is still
not entirely clear why and when EncoderFusion should work. In this paper, our
main contribution is to take a step further in understanding EncoderFusion.
Many of previous studies believe that the success of EncoderFusion comes from
exploiting surface and syntactic information embedded in lower encoder layers.
Unlike them, we find that the encoder embedding layer is more important than
other intermediate encoder layers. In addition, the uppermost decoder layer
consistently pays more attention to the encoder embedding layer across NLP
tasks. Based on this observation, we propose a simple fusion method,
SurfaceFusion, by fusing only the encoder embedding layer for the softmax
layer. Experimental results show that SurfaceFusion outperforms EncoderFusion
on several NLP benchmarks, including machine translation, text summarization,
and grammatical error correction. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance

replace words or characters in the original texts to achieve success attacks.
Recent methods use pre-trained language models as the substitutes generator.
While in Chinese, such methods are not applicable since words in Chinese
require segmentations first. In this paper, we propose a pre-train language
model as the substitutes generator using sentence-pieces to craft adversarial
examples in Chinese. The substitutions in the generated adversarial examples
are not characters or words but \textit{'pieces'}, which are more natural to
Chinese readers. Experiments results show that the generated adversarial
samples can mislead strong target models and remain fluent and semantically
preserved.

most methods focus on head users with large-scale interactions and hence suffer
from data sparsity issues. Several solutions integrate side information such as
demographic features and product reviews, another is to transfer knowledge from
other rich data sources. We argue that current methods are limited by the
strict privacy policy and have low scalability in real-world applications and
few works consider the behavioral characteristics behind long-tailed users. In
this work, we propose the Hybrid Interest Modeling (HIM) network to hybrid both
personalized interest and semi-personalized interest in learning long-tailed
users' preferences in the recommendation. To achieve this, we first design the
User Behavior Pyramid (UBP) module to capture the fine-grained personalized
interest of high confidence from sparse even noisy positive feedbacks.
Moreover, the individual interaction is too sparse and not enough for modeling
user interest adequately, we design the User Behavior Clustering (UBC) module
to learn latent user interest groups with self-supervised learning mechanism
novelly, which capture coarse-grained semi-personalized interest from
group-item interaction data. Extensive experiments on both public and
industrial datasets verify the superiority of HIM compared with the
state-of-the-art baselines.

learning model trained on a database of human-labelled clinical
diffusion-weighted (DW) stroke lesions to a model trained on the same database
enhanced with synthetic DW stroke lesions. Methods: In this institutional
review board approved study, a stroke database of 962 cases (mean age 65+/-17
years, 255 males, 449 scans with DW positive stroke lesions) and a normal
database of 2,027 patients (mean age 38+/-24 years,1088 females) were obtained.
Brain volumes with synthetic DW stroke lesions were produced by warping the
relative signal increase of real strokes to normal brain volumes. A generic 3D
U-Net was trained on four different databases to generate four different
models: (a) 375 neuroradiologist-labeled clinical DW positive stroke
cases(CDB);(b) 2,000 synthetic cases(S2DB);(c) CDB+2,000 synthetic
cases(CS2DB); or (d) CDB+40,000 synthetic cases(CS40DB). The models were tested
on 20%(n=192) of the cases of the stroke database, which were excluded from the
training set. Segmentation accuracy was characterized using Dice score and
lesion volume of the stroke segmentation, and statistical significance was
tested using a paired, two-tailed, Student's t-test. Detection sensitivity and
specificity was compared to three neuroradiologists. Results: The performance
of the 3D U-Net model trained on the CS40DB(mean Dice 0.72) was better than
models trained on the CS2DB (0.70,P <0.001) or the CDB(0.65,P<0.001). The deep
learning model was also more sensitive (91%[89%-93%]) than each of the three
human readers(84%[81%-87%],78%[75%-81%],and 79%[76%-82%]), but less
specific(75%[72%-78%] vs for the three human readers (96%[94%-97%],92%[90%-94%]
and 89%[86%-91%]). Conclusion: Deep learning training for segmentation and
detection of DW stroke lesions was significantly improved by enhancing the
training set with synthetic lesions.

transport in porous media. The resulting mathematical model is a coupled,
nonlinear evolution system. The flow model component builds on the Richards
equation, modified to incorporate nonstandard effects like dynamic capillarity
and hysteresis, and a reactive transport equation for the solute. The two model
components are strongly coupled. On one hand, the flow affects the
concentration of the solute; on the other hand, the surface tension is a
function of the solute, which impacts the capillary pressure and, consequently,
the flow. After applying an Euler implicit scheme, we consider a set of
iterative linearization schemes to solve the resulting nonlinear equations,
including both monolithic and two splitting strategies. The latter include a
canonical nonlinear splitting and an alternate linearized splitting, which
appears to be overall faster in terms of numbers of iterations, based on our
numerical studies. The (time discrete) system being nonlinear, we investigate
different linearization methods. We consider the linearly convergent L-scheme,
which converges unconditionally, and the Newton method, converging
quadratically but subject to restrictions on the initial guess. Whenever
hysteresis effects are included, the Newton method fails to converge. The
L-scheme converges; nevertheless, it may require many iterations. This aspect
is improved by using the Anderson acceleration. A thorough comparison of the
different solving strategies is presented in five numerical examples,
implemented in MRST, a toolbox based on MATLAB.

conventional text emotion recognition. It can be regarded as a personalized and
interactive emotion recognition task, which is supposed to consider not only
the semantic information of text but also the influences from speakers. The
current method models speakers' interactions by building a relation between
every two speakers. However, this fine-grained but complicated modeling is
computationally expensive, hard to extend, and can only consider local context.
To address this problem, we simplify the complicated modeling to a binary
version: Intra-Speaker and Inter-Speaker dependencies, without identifying
every unique speaker for the targeted speaker. To better achieve the simplified
interaction modeling of speakers in Transformer, which shows excellent ability
to settle long-distance dependency, we design three types of masks and
respectively utilize them in three independent Transformer blocks. The designed
masks respectively model the conventional context modeling, Intra-Speaker

information extracted by Transformer blocks diversely contributes to the
prediction, and therefore we utilize the attention mechanism to automatically

$\sim80\%$ of the systems lack evidence of interactions whilst the remaining
$\sim20\%$ involve some kind of interaction, as inferred from their observed
distorted morphology. We have considered separately, samples of satellites and
central galaxies, and each of these samples were tested against suitable
control sets to analyse the results. We find that central galaxies showing
signs of interactions present evidence of enhanced star formation activity and
younger stellar populations. As a counterpart, satellite samples show these
galaxies presenting older stellar populations with a lower star formation rate
than the control sample. The observed trends correlate with the stellar mass
content of the galaxies and with the projected distance between the members
involved in the interaction. The most massive systems are less affected since
they show no star formation excess, possibly due to their more evolved stage
and less gas available to form new stars. Our results suggest that it is
arguable a transfer of material during interactions, with satellites acting as
donors to the central galaxy. As a consequence of the interactions, satellite
stellar population ages rapidly and new bursts of star formation may frequently

attention-based feature extraction and data augmentation based on Neural

extracted from fixed regions of speech such as the syllable nucleus. We propose
an attention-based deep learning model that automatically derives optimal

Combining both techniques achieves 94.8% precision and 49.2% recall for the

(SoCs) to satisfy the computational needs of complex applications widely used
in real life, such as airplane controllers, autonomous driving automobiles,
medical devices, drones, and hand-held devices. Modern SoCs integrate
multi-core CPUs and various types of accelerators including GPUs and DSPs.
Uncontrolled heat dissipation is one of the main sources of interference that
can adversely affect the reliability and real-time performance of
safety-critical applications. The mechanisms currently available to protect
SoCs from overheating, such as frequency throttling or core shutdown, may
exacerbate the problem as they cause unpredictable delay and deadline misses.
Dynamic changes in ambient temperature further increase the difficulty of
solving this problem.
  This dissertation addresses the challenges caused by thermal interference in
real-time mixed-criticality systems built with heterogeneous embedded SoC
platforms. We propose a novel thermal-aware system framework with analytical
timing and thermal models to guarantee safe execution of real-time tasks under
the thermal constraints of a multi-core CPU/GPU integrated SoC. For
mixed-criticality tasks, the proposed framework bounds the heat generation of
the system at each criticality level and provides different levels of assurance
against ambient temperature changes. In addition, we propose a data-driven
thermal parameter estimation scheme that is directly applicable to MCSs built
with commercial-off-the-shelf multi-core processors to obtain a precise thermal
model without using special measurement instruments or access to proprietary
information. The practicality and effectiveness of our solutions have been
evaluated using real SoC platforms and our contributions will help develop
systems with thermal safety and real-time predictability.

both concept drift and class imbalance. Online learning tries to find a
trade-off between exploiting previously learned information and incorporating
new information into the model. This requires both the incremental update of
the model and the ability to unlearn outdated information. The improper use of
unlearning, however, can lead to the retroactive interference problem, a
phenomenon that occurs when newly learned information interferes with the old
information and impedes the recall of previously learned information. The
problem becomes more severe when the classes are not equally represented,
resulting in the removal of minority information from the model. In this work,
we propose the Drift-Aware Multi-Memory Model (DAM3), which addresses the class
imbalance problem in online learning for memory-based models. DAM3 mitigates
class imbalance by incorporating an imbalance-sensitive drift detector,
preserving a balanced representation of classes in the model, and resolving
retroactive interference using a working memory that prevents the forgetting of
old information. We show through experiments on real-world and synthetic
datasets that the proposed method mitigates class imbalance and outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

This quantity is independent of many experimental variables and, as such, is

column. The \kovats retention indices of a large number of molecules have been
determined experimentally. The ""NIST 20: GC Method\slash Retention Index
Library"" database has collected and, more importantly, curated retention
indices of a subset of these compounds resulting in a highly valued reference
database. The experimental data in the library form an ideal data set for
training machine learning models for the prediction of retention indices of
unknown compounds. In this article, we describe the training of a graph neural
network model to predict the \kovats retention index for compounds in the NIST

predict the \kovats retention index with a mean unsigned error of 28 index
units as compared to 44, the putative best result using a convolutional neural

scheme based on a group contribution approach that achieves a mean unsigned

data source as the group contribution approach, making its application
straightforward and convenient to apply to existing libraries. Our results

the strength of conditional dependence and it is 0 if and only if $Y$ and $Z$
are conditionally independent given $X$, and 1 if and only if $Y$ is a
measurable function of $Z$ and $X$. Thus, our measure -- which we call kernel
partial correlation (KPC) coefficient -- can be thought of as a nonparametric
generalization of the partial correlation coefficient that possesses the above
properties when $(X,Y,Z)$ is jointly normal. We describe two consistent methods
of estimating KPC. Our first method utilizes the general framework of geometric
graphs, including $K$-nearest neighbor graphs and minimum spanning trees. A
sub-class of these estimators can be computed in near linear time and converges
at a rate that automatically adapts to the intrinsic dimension(s) of the
underlying distribution(s). Our second strategy involves direct estimation of
conditional mean embeddings using cross-covariance operators in the reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces. Using these empirical measures we develop forward
stepwise (high-dimensional) nonlinear variable selection algorithms. We show
that our algorithm, using the graph-based estimator, yields a provably

high-dimensional regime when the number of covariates grows exponentially with
the sample size, under suitable sparsity assumptions. Extensive simulation and

problems in the sense that for a given required accuracy, an energy cut-off for

Further, the method is particularly promising for nonlinear eigenvalue problems
in electronic structure calculations as it shall reduce the cost of early

an outcome of spin-orbit coupling provided that the global inversion symmetry
is lacking, also known as 'spin-momentum locking'. The recently discovered
hidden spin polarization indicates that specific atomic site asymmetry could
also induce measurable spin polarization, leading to a paradigm shift to
centrosymmetric crystals for potential spintronic applications. Here, combining
spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical
calculations, we report distinct spin-layer locking phenomena surrounding
different high-symmetry momenta in a centrosymmetric, layered material BiOI.
The measured spin is highly polarized along the Brillouin zone boundary, while
is almost vanishing around the zone center due to its nonsymmorphic crystal
structure. Our work not only demonstrates the existence of hidden spin
polarization, but also uncovers the microscopic mechanism of the way spin,

constraint qualifications in nonlinear semidefinite programming. It can be
characterized in terms of any fixed orthonormal basis of the, let us say,
$\ell$-dimensional kernel of the constraint matrix, by the linear independence
of a set of $\ell(\ell+1)/2$ derivative vectors. We show that this linear
independence requirement can be equivalently formulated in a smaller set, of
$\ell$ derivative vectors, by considering all orthonormal bases of the kernel
instead. This allows us to identify that not all bases are relevant for a
constraint qualification to be defined, giving rise to a strictly weaker
variant of nondegeneracy related to the global convergence of an external
penalty method. We use some of these ideas to revisit an approach of Forsgren
[Math. Prog. 88, 105--128, 2000] for exploiting the sparsity structure of a
transformation of the constraints to define a constraint qualification, which
led us to develop another relaxed notion of nondegeneracy using a simpler

Following this we analyse an active cylindrical dipole in terms of scalar and

the analyticity of scattering amplitude in a nonrelativitstic potential model
in three dimensions with an additional compact dimension. He showed that, under
certain circumstances, the forward amplitude is nonanalytic. He argued that in
high energy scattering if such a behaviour persists it would be in conflicts
with the established results of quantum field theory and LHC might observe such
behaviors. We envisage a real scalar massive field in flat Minkowski spacetime

LSZ formalism is adopted to study the analyticity of the scattering amplitude.
The nonforward dispersion relation is proved. In addition the Jin-Martin bound

presented to look for evidence of the large-radius-compactification scenario. A
seemingly violation of Froissart-Martin bound at LHC energy might hint that an

structures, and their effects on the passive mitigation of vibrations by means
of friction damping. Under the condition of (nearly) commensurable natural
frequencies, the nonlinear character of friction can cause so-called nonlinear
modal interactions. If harmonic forcing near the natural frequency of a
specific mode is applied, for instance, another mode may be excited due to
nonlinear energy transfer and thus contribute considerably to the vibration
response. We investigate how this phenomenon affects the performance of
friction damping. To this end, we study the steady-state, periodic forced
vibrations of a system of two beams connected via a local mechanical friction
joint. The system can be tuned to continuously adjust the ratio between the
first two natural frequencies in the range around the $1:3$ internal resonance,
in order to trigger or suppress the emergence of modal interactions. Due to the
re-distribution of the vibration energy, the vibration level can in fact be
reduced in certain situations. However, in other situations, the multi-harmonic
character of the vibration has detrimental effects on the effective damping
provided by the friction joint. The resulting response level can be
significantly larger than in the absence of modal interactions. Moreover, it is
shown that the vibration behavior is highly sensitive in the neighborhood of
internal resonances. It is thus concluded that the condition of internal
resonance should be avoided in the design of friction-damped systems.

coupling of internally resonant modes. However, research focused primarily on
conservative systems commonly assumes that the near-resonant forced response
closely follows the autonomous dynamics. Our results for even a simple system
of two coupled oscillators with a cubic spring clearly contradict this common
belief. We demonstrate analytically and numerically global effects of a weak
local damping source in a harmonically forced nonlinear system under condition
of 1:3 internal resonance: The global motion becomes asynchronous, i.e., mode
complexity is introduced with a non-trivial phase difference between the modal
oscillations. In particular, we show that a maximum mode complexity with a
phase difference of $90^\circ$ is attained in a multi-harmonic sense. This
corresponds to a transition from generalized standing to traveling waves in the
system's modal space. We further demonstrate that the localization is crucially
affected by the system's damping. Finally, we propose an extension of the
definition of mode complexity and mode localization to nonlinear quasi-periodic
motions, and illustrate their application to a quasi-periodic regime in the
forced response.

suggest that the system passively (self-)adapts the axial location of the
slider to achieve and maintain a condition of self-resonance, which could be
useful in applications such as energy harvesting. The purpose of this work is
to provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon based on an appropriate
model. A key feature of the proposed model is a small clearance between the
slider and the beam. This clearance gives rise to backlash and frictional
contact interactions, both of which are found to be essential for the
self-adaptive behavior. Contact is modeled in terms of the Coulomb and
Signorini laws, together with the Newton impact law. The set-valued character
of the contact laws is accounted for in a measure differential inclusion
formulation. Numerical integration is carried out using Moreau's time-stepping
scheme. The proposed model reproduces qualitatively most experimental
observations. However, although the system showed a distinct self-adaptive
character, the behavior was found to be non-resonant for the considered set of
parameters. Beside estimating the relationship between resonance frequency and
slider location, the model permits predicting the operating limits with regard
to excitation level and frequency. Finally, some specific dynamical phenomena
such as hysteresis effects and transient resonance captures underline the rich
dynamical behavior of the system.
