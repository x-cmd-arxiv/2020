method for the solution of 2D scattering problems with complex backgrounds,
providing an alternative to Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) or other artificial
boundary conditions. Based on half-plane representations for the solution, the
scattering problem is rewritten as a system of integral equations in which the
unknowns are restrictions of the solution to the boundaries of a finite number
of overlapping half-planes contained in the domain: this integral equation
system is coupled to a standard finite element discretisation localised around
the scatterer. While satisfactory numerical results have been obtained for real
wavenumbers, wellposedness and equivalence to the original scattering problem
have been established only for complex wavenumbers. In the present paper, by
combining the HSM framework with a complex-scaling technique, we provide a new
formulation for real wavenumbers which is provably well-posed and has the
attraction for computation that the complex-scaled solutions of the integral
equation system decay exponentially at infinity. The analysis requires the
study of double-layer potential integral operators on intersecting infinite
lines, and their analytic continuations. The effectiveness of the method is
validated by preliminary numerical results.

key relevance in modern optoelectronics. This work deals with the theoretical
research on optical properties of a PT--symmetric nano--scaled dimer formed by
two dielectric wires, one is with loss and the other with gain, wrapped with
graphene sheets. We show the existence of two non--radiating trapped modes
which transform into radiating modes by increasing the gain--loss parameter.
Moreover, these modes reach the lasing condition for suitable values of this
parameter, a fact that makes these modes to achieve an ultra high quality
factor that is manifested on the response of the structure when it is excited
by a plane wave. Unlike other mechanism that transform trapped modes into
radiating modes, we show that the variation of gain--loss parameter in the
balanced loss--gain structure here studied leads to a variation in the phase
difference between induced dipole moments on each wires, without appreciable
variation in the modulus of these dipole moments. We provide an approximated
method that reproduces the main results provided by the rigorous calculation.
Our theoretical findings reveal the possibility to develop unconventional
optical devices and structures with enhanced functionality.

delivery, liquid-liquid extraction, nanomaterial synthesis and cosmetics. A
commonly used method to generate a large number of micro or nanodroplets in one
simple step is solvent exchange (also called nanoprecipitation), in which a
good solvent of the droplet phase is displaced by a poor one, generating an
oversaturation pulse that leads to droplet nucleation. Despite its crucial
importance, the droplet growth resulting from the oversaturation pulse in this
ternary system is still poorly understood. We experimentally and theoretically
study this growth in Hele-Shaw like channels by measuring the total volume of
the oil droplets that nucleates out of it. In order to prevent the
oversaturated oil from exiting the channel, we decorated some of the channels
with a porous region in the middle. Solvent exchange is performed with various
solution compositions, flow rates and channel geometries, and the measured
droplets volume is found to increase with the P\'eclet number $Pe$ with an
approximate effective power law $V\propto Pe^{0.50}$. A theoretical model is
developed to account for this finding. With this model we can indeed explain
the $V\propto Pe^{1/2}$ scaling, including the prefactor, which can collapse
all data of the ""porous"" channels onto one universal curve, irrespective of
channel geometry and composition of the mixtures. Our work provides a
macroscopic approach to this bottom-up method of droplet generation and may
guide further studies on oversaturation and nucleation in ternary systems.

shows an improved resolution of at least a factor of two in the low mass region
when compared to previous methods, without the loss of sensitivity of previous
analyses. It turns out that it also leads to an improvement of the mass
reconstruction of the 125 GeV Higgs for the same production process. We use an
effective Lagrangian to describe a scalar with a generic Yukawa coupling to the
top quarks. A full phenomenological analysis was performed, using Standard
Model background and signal events generated with MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO and
reconstructed using a kinematic fit. The use of CP-sensitive variables allows
then to maximize the distinction between CP-even and CP-odd components of the
Yukawa couplings. Confidence Levels (CLs) for the exclusion of $\phi$ bosons
with mixed CP (both CP-even and CP-odd components) were determined as a
function of the top Yukawa couplings to the $\phi$ boson. The mass range
analysed starts slightly above the $\Upsilon$ mass up to 40 GeV, although the
analysis can be used for an arbitrary mass. %We focus on dileptonic final
states of the $t\bar{t}\phi$ system, with $\phi\rightarrow b\bar{b}$. If no new
light scalar is found, exclusion limits at 95\% CL for the absolute value of
the CP-even and CP-odd Yukawa are derived. %couplings are expected to be,
approximately, as low as 0.10 and 0.50, respectively, at the end of the High
Luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). Finally, we analyse how these limits
constrain the parameter space of the complex two-Higgs doublet model (C2HDM).

continuous targets, the RF/GBT kernels are competitive to their respective

Virtual Reality (VR) as a platform for entertainment, education, and heritage
preservation. Existing 3D reconstruction systems inevitably make trade-offs
between three conflicting goals: the efficiency of reconstruction (e.g., time
and memory requirements), the visual quality of the constructed scene, and the
rendering speed on the VR device. This paper proposes a reconstruction system
that simultaneously meets all three goals. The key idea is to avoid the
resource-demanding process of reconstructing a high-polygon mesh altogether.
Instead, we propose to directly transfer details from the original point cloud
to a low polygon mesh, which significantly reduces the reconstruction time and
cost, preserves the scene details, and enables real-time rendering on mobile VR
devices.
  While our technique is general, we demonstrate it in reconstructing cultural
heritage sites. We for the first time digitally reconstruct the Elmina Castle,
a UNESCO world heritage site at Ghana, from billions of laser-scanned points.
The reconstruction process executes on low-end desktop systems without
requiring high processing power, making it accessible to the broad community.

the time fractional Allen-Cahn equation. The proposed scheme is shown to be
unconditionally stable (in a variational energy sense), and is maximum bound
preserving. Interestingly, the discrete energy stability result obtained in
this paper can recover the classical energy dissipation law when the fractional
order $\alpha \rightarrow 1.$ That is, our scheme can asymptotically preserve
the energy dissipation law in the $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ limit. This seems to
be the first work on variable time-stepping scheme that can preserve both the
energy stability and the maximum bound principle.
  Our Crank-Nicolson scheme is build upon a reformulated problem associated
with the Riemann-Liouville derivative. As a by product, we build up a
reversible transformation between the L1-type formula of the Riemann-Liouville
derivative and a new L1-type formula of the Caputo derivative, with the help of
a class of discrete orthogonal convolution kernels. This is the first time such
a \textit{discrete} transformation is established between two discrete
fractional derivatives. We finally present several numerical examples with an
adaptive time-stepping strategy to show the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

show that Gromov's Tree Approximation Lemma for hyperbolic spaces can be
improved in the case of quasi-trees to give a uniform approximation for any set
of points, independent of cardinality. From this we show that having uniform
tree approximation for finite subsets is equivalent to being able to uniformly
approximate the entire space by a tree. As another consequence we note that the
boundary of a quasi-tree is isometric to the boundary of its approximating tree
under a certain choice of visual metric, and that this gives a natural
extension of the standard metric on the boundary of a tree.

short block lengths and low/no error floors make them attractive for

paper aims at enhancing the traditional adaptive belief propagation (ABP)

traditional ABP is to sparsify certain columns of the parity-check matrix
corresponding to the least reliable bits with small log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)
values. This sparsification strategy may not be optimal when some bits have
large LLR magnitudes but wrong signs. Motivated by this observation, we propose
a Perturbed ABP (P-ABP) to incorporate a small number of unstable bits with
large LLRs into the sparsification operation of the parity-check matrix. In
addition, we propose to apply partial layered scheduling or hybrid dynamic

that our proposed decoding algorithms lead to improved error correction

of actions, and a large as well as partially overlapping space of temporal pose

two-stage activity generation method to achieve this goal, where the first

  based on the City of Helsinki","28 pages, 11 figures, submitted to journal",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding the usage patterns for bike-sharing systems is essential in
terms of supporting and enhancing operational planning for such schemes.
Studies have demonstrated how factors such as weather conditions influence the
number of bikes that should be available at bike-sharing stations at certain
times during the day. However, the influences of these factors usually vary
over the course of a day, and if there is good temporal resolution, there could
also be significant effects only for some hours/minutes (rush hours, the hours
when shops are open, and so forth). Thus, in this paper, an analysis of
Helsinki's bike-sharing data from 2017 is conducted that considers full
temporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, the data are available at a very
high frequency. Hence, the station hire data is analysed in a spatiotemporal
functional setting, where the number of bikes at a station is defined as a
continuous function of the time of day. For this completely novel approach, we
apply a functional spatiotemporal hierarchical model to investigate the effect
of environmental factors and the magnitude of the spatial and temporal
dependence. Challenges in computational complexity are faced using a
bootstrapping approach. The results show the necessity of splitting the
bike-sharing stations into two clusters based on the similarity of their
spatiotemporal functional observations in order to model the station hire data
of Helsinki's bike-sharing system effectively. The estimated functional
influences of the proposed factors are different for the two clusters.
Moreover, the estimated parameters reveal high random effects in the data that
are not explained by the mean of the process. In this random-effects model, the
temporal autoregressive parameter dominates the spatial dependence.

a technique to improve the KLD for the systems with relative degree greater

critical exponents, and scaling relations are rare. Here, we derived them
explicitly as a function of a control parameter $m$ representing the

solving the rate equation and performing numerical simulations. Our results
clearly show that the transition point approaches unity and the order-parameter
exponent $\beta$ approaches zero algebraically as $m \to \infty$, whereas they
approach these values exponentially for a static network. Moreover, the upper
critical dimension becomes $d_u=4$ for growing networks, whereas it is $d_u=2$

After adding data from further predictive simulations on a highest current JET

identify a new scaling formula for ${\lambda}_q$ as a simple modification to
the Eich formula #14, which reproduces the Eich scaling formula for the present

low plasma current to be explored in the initial phases of ITER operation. The
new physics that gives rise to the wider ${\lambda}q_^{XGC} is identified to be
the weakly-collisional, trapped-electron-mode turbulence across the magnetic
separatrix, which is known to be an efficient transporter of the electron heat

  extending a conjecture of Marchal",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present work studies the continuation class of the regular $n$-gon
solution of the $n$-body problem. For odd numbers of bodies between $n = 3$ and
$n = 15$ we apply one parameter numerical continuation algorithms to the
energy/frequency variable, and find that the figure eight choreography can be
reached starting from the regular $n$-gon. The continuation leaves the plane of
the $n$-gon, and passes through families of spatial choreographies with the
topology of torus knots. Numerical continuation out of the $n$-gon solution is
complicated by the fact that the kernel of the linearization there is high
dimensional. Our work exploits a symmetrized version of the problem which
admits dense sets of choreography solutions, and which can be written as a
delay differential equation in terms of one of the bodies. This symmetrized
setup simplifies the problem in several ways. On one hand, the direction of the
kernel is determined automatically by the symmetry. On the other hand, the set
of possible bifurcations is reduced and the $n$-gon continues to the eight
after a single symmetry breaking bifurcation. Based on the calculations
presented here we conjecture that the $n$-gon and the eight are in the same
continuation class for all odd numbers of bodies.

observe that Nb2O5 is the only surface oxide that grows significantly within

concerns in endovascular interventions. Intravascular sensing of tool
interaction with the arteries is advantageous to minimize such complications
and enhance navigation safety. Intraluminal information is currently limited
due to the lack of intravascular contact sensing technologies. We present
monitoring of the intraluminal tool interaction with the arterial wall using an
image-based estimation approach within vascular robotic navigation. The
proposed image-based method employs continuous finite element simulation of the
tool using imaging data to estimate multi-point forces along tool-vessel wall
interaction. We implemented imaging algorithms to detect and track contacts,
and compute pose measurements. The model is constructed based on the nonlinear
beam element and flexural rigidity profile over the tool length. During remote
cannulation of aortic arteries, intraluminal monitoring achieved tracking local
contact forces, building a contour map of force on the arterial wall and
estimating tool structural stress. Results suggest that high risk intraluminal
forces may happen even with low insertion force. The presented online
monitoring system delivers insight into the intraluminal behavior of
endovascular tools and is well suited for intraoperative visual guidance for
the clinician, robotic control of vascular procedures and research on

some clumpy high-z galaxies without observable tidal features could be the

(or more) agents play a non-visual referential game has been previously
investigated using approaches based on the REINFORCE algorithm and the (Neural)
Iterated Learning Model. Following the more recent introduction of the
\textit{Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax} (ST-GS) approach, this paper
investigates to what extent the drivers of compositionality identified so far
in the field apply in the ST-GS context and to what extent do they translate
into (emergent) systematic generalisation abilities, when playing a visual
referential game. Compositionality and the generalisation abilities of the
emergent languages are assessed using topographic similarity and zero-shot
compositional tests. Firstly, we provide evidence that the test-train split
strategy significantly impacts the zero-shot compositional tests when dealing
with visual stimuli, whilst it does not when dealing with symbolic ones.
Secondly, empirical evidence shows that using the ST-GS approach with small
batch sizes and an overcomplete communication channel improves compositionality
in the emerging languages. Nevertheless, while shown robust with symbolic
stimuli, the effect of the batch size is not so clear-cut when dealing with
visual stimuli. Our results also show that not all overcomplete communication
channels are created equal. Indeed, while increasing the maximum sentence
length is found to be beneficial to further both compositionality and
generalisation abilities, increasing the vocabulary size is found detrimental.
Finally, a lack of correlation between the language compositionality at
training-time and the agents' generalisation abilities is observed in the
context of discriminative referential games with visual stimuli. This is
similar to previous observations in the field using the generative variant with
symbolic stimuli.

alkali/alkaline earth/post-transition metals; M/M' = transition metals,
lanthanides; Q = chalcogens) using high-throughput density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. We validate the presence of low-$\kappa_l$ in this family
of materials by calculating $\kappa_l$ of several predicted stable compounds
using the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation within a first-principles DFT
framework. Our analysis reveals that the low-$\kappa_l$ in the AMM'Q$_3$
compounds originates from the presence of either a strong lattice anharmonicity
that enhances the phonon scatterings or rattlers cations that lead to multiple
scattering channels in their crystal structures. Our predictions suggest new
experimental research opportunities in the synthesis and characterization of
these stable, low-$\kappa_l$ compounds.

(3) we utilize the depth feature diversity as well as the level of difficulty

for defining dependent type theories, including non-extensional ones. Using the
theory of sketches, one may define syntactic categories for type theories in a
style that resembles the use of Martin-L\""of's Logical Framework, following the
""judgments as types"" principle. The concentration of type theories into their
locally Cartesian closed categories of judgments is particularly convenient for
proving syntactic metatheorems by semantic means (canonicity, normalization,
etc.). Perhaps surprisingly, the notion of a context plays no role in the
definitions of type theories in this sense, but the structure of a class of
display maps can be imposed on a theory post facto wherever needed, as
advocated by the Edinburgh school and realized by the %worlds declarations of
the Twelf proof assistant.
  Uemura has proposed representable map categories together with a stratified
logical framework for similar purposes. The stratification in Uemura's
framework restricts the use of dependent products to be strictly positive, in
contrast to the tradition of Martin-L\""of's logical framework and
Schroeder-Heister's analysis of higher-level deductions. We prove a semantic
adequacy result for locally Cartesian closed categories relative to Uemura's
representable map categories: if a theory is definable in the framework of
Uemura, the locally Cartesian closed category that it generates is a
conservative (fully faithful) extension of its syntactic representable map
category. On this basis, we argue for the use of locally Cartesian closed
categories as a simpler alternative to Uemura's representable map categories.

dynamical objects to perturbation helps bridge from theoretical to real-world
dynamical systems. Classical theories of structural stability and isolated
invariant sets treat robustness of qualitative dynamics to sufficiently small
errors. But they do not indicate just how large a perturbation can become
before the qualitative behavior of our system changes fundamentally. Here we
introduce a quantity, intensity of attraction, that measures the robustness of
attractors in metric terms. Working in the setting of ordinary differential
equations on $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider robustness to vector field
perturbations that are time-dependent or -independent. We define intensity in a
control-theoretic framework, based on the magnitude of control needed to steer
trajectories out of a domain of attraction. Our main result is that intensity
also quantifies the robustness of an attractor to time-independent vector field
perturbations; we prove this by connecting the reachable sets of control theory
to isolating blocks of Conley theory. In addition to treating classical
questions of robustness in a new metric framework, intensity of attraction
offers a novel tool for resilience quantification in ecological applications.
Unlike many measurements of resilience, intensity detects the strength of
transient dynamics in a domain of attraction.

block due to their black-box nature. Some of this difficulty can be alleviated
if predictions were accompanied by explanations expressed in clinically

domain-specific features(morphological features like ground-glass opacity and
disease indications like pneumonia) directly from the image data. Predictions
about these features are then used to construct a symbolic model (a decision
tree) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays, accompanied with two

prevalent in both research and practice. A common empirical strategy involves
the application of predictive modeling techniques to 'mine' variables of
interest from available data, followed by the inclusion of those variables into
an econometric framework, with the objective of estimating causal effects.
Recent work highlights that, because the predictions from machine learning
models are inevitably imperfect, econometric analyses based on the predicted
variables are likely to suffer from bias due to measurement error. We propose a
novel approach to mitigate these biases, leveraging the ensemble learning
technique known as the random forest. We propose employing random forest not
just for prediction, but also for generating instrumental variables to address
the measurement error embedded in the prediction. The random forest algorithm
performs best when comprised of a set of trees that are individually accurate
in their predictions, yet which also make 'different' mistakes, i.e., have
weakly correlated prediction errors. A key observation is that these properties
are closely related to the relevance and exclusion requirements of valid
instrumental variables. We design a data-driven procedure to select tuples of
individual trees from a random forest, in which one tree serves as the
endogenous covariate and the other trees serve as its instruments. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in mitigating
estimation biases and its superior performance over three alternative methods

This shows a gap in the standard and robust losses that cannot be obtained via

method to determine fundamental properties (in particular ages) of stars. The
Kepler Space Telescope initiated a revolution by detecting oscillations in more
than 500 main-sequence and subgiant stars. However, most Kepler stars are
faint, and therefore have limited constraints from independent methods such as
long-baseline interferometry. Here, we present the discovery of solar-like
oscillations in $\alpha$ Men A, a naked-eye (V=5.1) G7 dwarf in TESS's Southern
Continuous Viewing Zone. Using a combination of astrometry, spectroscopy, and
asteroseismology, we precisely characterize the solar analog alpha Men A (Teff
= 5569 +/- 62 K, R = 0.960 +/- 0.016 Rsun, M = 0.964 +/- 0.045 Msun). To
characterize the fully convective M dwarf companion, we derive empirical
relations to estimate mass, radius, and temperature given the absolute Gaia
magnitude and metallicity, yielding M = 0.169 +/- 0.006, R = 0.19 +/- 0.01 and
Teff = 3054 +/- 44 K. Our asteroseismic age of 6.2 +/- 1.4 (stat) +/- 0.6 (sys)
Gyr for the primary places $\alpha$ Men B within a small population of M dwarfs
with precisely measured ages. We combined multiple ground-based spectroscopy
surveys to reveal an activity cycle of 13.1 +/- 1.1 years, a period similar to
that observed in the Sun. We used different gyrochronology models with the
asteroseismic age to estimate a rotation period of ~30 days for the primary.
Alpha Men A is now the closest (d=10pc) solar analog with a precise
asteroseismic age from space-based photometry, making it a prime target for
next-generation direct imaging missions searching for true Earth analogs.

over a finite field of characteristic 2 is isomorphic to one in this family.
This improvement to the addition algorithm, applicable to a larger class of

$\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal form, and replaces the previously best known
complexity of $13\mathbf{M} + 3\mathbf{S}$ on L\'opez-Dahab models applicable
to these twisted curves. The derived doubling algorithm is essentially optimal,
without any assumption of special cases. We show moreover that the Montgomery
scalar multiplication with point recovery carries over to the twisted models,
giving symmetric scalar multiplication adapted to protect against side channel
attacks, with a cost of $4\mathbf{M} + 4\mathbf{S} + 1\mathbf{m}_t +

symmetry is a generator of real four-dimensional representation of $SO(4)$. In
the particular representation such an effective Hamiltonian is a purely
imaginary matrix, and it is proportional to the antisymmetric tensor of a
fictitious electromagnetic field which one can define in the momentum space.
The quantum time evolution of the low-energy quasiparticle state becomes this
way closely related to the classical relativistic motion of a charged particle
in the presence of the Lorentz force that would be derived from such an
electromagnetic field configuration. The condition for the emergence of a
Bogoliubov-Fermi surface can then be understood as orthogonality of the
fictitious electric and magnetic fields, which would allow zero Lorentz force.
The corresponding zero-energy eigenstates are identified as the physical
timelike and the unphysical spacelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation.
We study the looming instability of the inversion-symmetric Bogoliubov-Fermi
surface in presence of electron-electron interaction by formulating a concrete
interacting model on the Lieb lattice that features the requisite $SO(4)$
kinetic energy term together with nearest-neighbor two-body repulsion. The
latter is shown to favor dynamical breaking of the inversion symmetry. The
inversion symmetry in our lattice model indeed becomes spontaneously broken at
zero temperature at infinitesimal repulsion, with the original Bogoliubov-Fermi

the perspective transformation by incorporating the stereo rig roll angle. The
road disparities are then estimated using semi-global matching. A disparity map
transformation algorithm is then performed to better distinguish the damaged

(J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) with two
detectors which are located in 24 m (an existing detector) and 48 m (new one)
baselines to improve the sensitivity of the search for sterile neutrinos,
especially in the low $\Delta m^2$ region, which has been indicated by the
global fit of the appearance mode. The new second detector has a similar
structure as the existing JSNS$^2$ detector, which is already working. To
compensate for the reduction of the neutrino flux due to the distance from the
mercury target, the target mass of the Gd-loaded liquid scintillator which is
the Linear AlkylBenzene (LAB) based liquid scintillator inside the acrylic
vessel is 35 tons. To keep the same photo-coverage of the detector as the first
detector, we will surround the acrylic vessel with 240 PMTs. With this
experimental setup and 5 years (times 1 MW beam power) exposure, the
sensitivity of the JSNS$^2$-II is significantly improved compared to the
current JSNS$^2$, especially in the low $\Delta m^2$ oscillation parameter
region. The JSNS$^2$-II can also confirm or refute the most of the oscillation
parameters' space preferred by the previous experiments with 3 sigma C.L..
Considering these situations and world wide status of the sterile neutrino

the ComplexNet with quantum based sinusoidal nonlinearities. In essence, our
work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution and

proposed as a promising mechanical element for quantum optomechanics. This
quantum fluid shows highly desirable properties (e.g. extremely low acoustic
loss) for a quantum optomechanical system. In current implementations,
superfluid optomechanical systems suffer from external sources of loss, which
spoils the quality factor of resonators. In this work, we propose a new
implementation, exploiting nanofluidic confinement. Our approach, based on
acoustic resonators formed within phononic nanostructures, aims at limiting
radiation losses to preserve the intrinsic properties of superfluid 4He. In
this work, we estimate the optomechanical system parameters. Using recent
theory, we derive the expected quality factors for acoustic resonators in
different thermodynamic conditions. We calculate the sources of loss induced by
the phononic nanostructures with numerical simulations. Our results indicate
the feasibility of the proposed approach in a broad range of parameters, which
opens new prospects for more complex geometries.

novel model called Attentive DenseNet based Factorization Machines (AdnFM).
AdnFM can extract more comprehensive deep features by using all the hidden

selects dominant features via an attention mechanism. Also, high-order

in a multimodal scenario, by exploiting both textual and visual features of
ambiguous verbs leading to a new problem, the Visual Verb Sense Disambiguation
(VVSD). Here, the sense of a verb is assigned considering the content of an
image paired with it rather than a sentence in which the verb appears.
Annotating a dataset for this task is more complex than textual disambiguation,
because assigning the correct sense to a pair of $<$image, verb$>$ requires
both non-trivial linguistic and visual skills. In this work, differently from
the literature, the VVSD task will be performed in a transductive
semi-supervised learning (SSL) setting, in which only a small amount of labeled
information is required, reducing tremendously the need for annotated data. The
disambiguation process is based on a graph-based label propagation method which
takes into account mono or multimodal representations for $<$image, verb$>$
pairs. Experiments have been carried out on the recently published dataset
VerSe, the only available dataset for this task. The achieved results
outperform the current state-of-the-art by a large margin while using only a

to continuum models, are unique in their capability to simulate complex
materials behavior. The fundamental limitation in multiscale models is the
presence of uncertainty in the computational predictions delivered by them. In
this work, a sequential multiscale model has been developed, incorporating
discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations and a strain gradient
plasticity (SGP) model to predict the size effect in plastic deformations of
metallic micro-pillars. The DDD simulations include uniaxial compression of
micro-pillars with different sizes and over a wide range of initial dislocation
densities and spatial distributions of dislocations. An SGP model is employed
at the continuum level that accounts for the size-dependency of flow stress and
hardening rate. Sequences of uncertainty analyses have been performed to assess
the predictive capability of the multiscale model. The variance-based global
sensitivity analysis determines the effect of parameter uncertainty on the SGP
model prediction. The multiscale model is then constructed by calibrating the
continuum model using the data furnished by the DDD simulations. A Bayesian
calibration method is implemented to quantify the uncertainty due to
microstructural randomness in discrete dislocation simulations (density and
spatial distributions of dislocations) on the macroscopic continuum model
prediction (size effect in plastic deformation). The outcomes of this study
indicate that the discrete-continuum multiscale model can accurately simulate
the plastic deformation of micro-pillars, despite the significant uncertainty
in the DDD results. Additionally, depending on the macroscopic features
represented by the DDD simulations, the SGP model can reliably predict the size
effect in plasticity responses of the micropillars with below 10% of error

Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to extract the underlying
features of the text, learns a representation of the context of the text
through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BILSTM), and incorporates the
multi-head attention (MHATT) mechanism to extract chapter-level features. In
this approach, the MHATT mechanism aims to improve the recognition accuracy of
abbreviations to efficiently deal with the problem of inconsistency in
full-text labels. Moreover, conditional random field (CRF) is used to label
sequence tags because this probabilistic method does not need strict
independence assumptions and can accommodate arbitrary context information. The
experimental evaluation on a publicly-available dataset shows that the proposed
hybrid approach achieves the best recognition performance; in particular, it
substantially improves performance in recognizing abbreviations, polysemes, and
low-frequency entities, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. For
instance, compared with the recognition accuracies for low-frequency entities
produced by the BILSTM-CRF algorithm, those produced by the hybrid approach on

Later, larger tilted discs form with the size increasing with the magnetic
moment of the star. The normal vector to the discs are tilted at different
angles, from 5-10 degrees up to 30-40 degrees. Small tilts may result from the
winding of the magnetic field lines about the rotational axis of the star and
the action of the magnetic force which tends to align the disc. Another
possible explanation is the magnetic Bardeen-Petterson effect in which the disc
settles in the equatorial plane of the star due to precessional and viscous

$x_\mathrm{mig}$ normalized to the crater minor-axis diameter $D_\mathrm{cy}$
can be expressed as a function of the initial inclination of the target
$\tan\theta$, the effective friction coefficient $\mu$, and two parameters $K$

binding tiny ($\sim 5$~{\textmu}m) glass beads. The granular columns were
compressed with a piston until reaching a maximum load force of 20~N with a
constant compression rate $v$ ($0.17 \leq v \leq 2000$~{\textmu}m~s$^{-1}$).
After that, the piston was stopped and the relaxation process was quantified.
From the experimental results, we found that the compression force $F$
nonlinearly increases with the increase of compression stroke $z$ depending on
particles. Besides, periodic undulation and sudden force drops were observed on
$F(z)$ in dust particles and glass beads, respectively. The relaxation process
was characterized by an exponential decay of stress followed by a logarithmic
dependence one in both kinds of particles. These experimental findings are the
main point in this study. To understand the underlying physics governing the

z^{\alpha}$ for dust particles and $F \propto \exp(z/z_G)$ for glass beads
($\alpha=2.4$ and $z_G=70$~{\textmu}m). Then, we found that the growing manners
of periodic undulation and force drops were identical to those of mean

of Tucson that shows sun dagger events at both the summer solstice and the
equinoxes. On each of these dates, a wedge-shaped sunbeam with opening angles
20{\deg}-30{\deg} touches the center of the spiral, with both of these being
confidently intentionally constructed by peoples of the Hohokam culture c.
800--1300 AD. More generally for claimed sun daggers throughout the American
Southwest, the critical question is whether the ancient indigenous peoples
intentionally placed the petroglyph so as to create a solar marker. The
confident starting point for proving the intentionality of sun daggers in
general is a histogram measured by the Prestons showing highly significant
peaks for indicated declinations within 2{\deg} of -23.4{\deg}, 0.0{\deg}, and
+23.4{\deg}, with this being not by chance. In a review of solsticial and
equinoctal sun daggers, we find that they all have beams of light shaped like a
long-thin triangle with an apex opening angle of <40{\deg} that touches the
center of the petroglyph symbol. The majority of the sun daggers use a spiral
petroglyph, with circles and other symbols being used. Where a spiral or
circular petroglyph has a coincidental light/shadow display, the false alarm
rate is measured to be 20% to 33%. Sun daggers that have indicated declinations
other than +-23.4{\deg} or 0.0{\deg} are false alarms, including claims for
alignments to cross-quarter days and lunar standstills, which are certainly
wrong. Intentional sun daggers are not related to any form of calendric
regulation, astronomical tools, or public ceremony. Rather, abundant
ethnographic evidence shows that sun daggers are a part of sites, called Sun
Shrines, where a local Sun watcher would have lone vigils, with offerings and
prayers to the gods on the solstices and equinoxes.

fragments first increases and then decreases to one as population identity

situations, we find that even a small fraction of impressionable individuals

categories. We also follow and extend several prior classifications to support
our synthesis of the data. Our results reveal that currently GSE studies are
focused on Management and Infrastructure related factors. Most of the studies
are conducted at the organizational level using methods such as interviews,
surveys, field studies and case studies. We use inter-country network analysis
to confirm that the USA and India are major players in GSE, with USA-India
collaborations being the most frequently studied, followed by USA-China.
Specific groups of countries have dominated the reported GSE project locations.
In contrast, regions including Central Asia, South Asia (except India), Africa
and South East Asia have not been covered in these studies. While a
considerable number of GSE-related studies have been published they are
currently quite narrowly focused on exploratory research and explanatory
theories. The critical research paradigm has been untouched, perhaps due to a
lack of criteria and principles for carrying out such research in GSE. An
absence of formulative research, experimentation and simulation, and a
comparative focus on evaluative approaches, all suggest that existing tools,

perturbations around Kerr black holes. Imposing regularity conditions on these
perturbations on the future (past) horizon corresponds to imposing an in-going
(out-going) wave boundary condition. For exotic compact objects (ECOs) with
external Kerr spacetime, however, it is not yet clear how to physically impose
boundary conditions for curvature perturbations on their boundaries. We address
this problem using the Membrane Paradigm, by considering a family of fiducial
observers (FIDOs) that float right above the horizon of a linearly perturbed
Kerr black hole. From the reference frame of these observers, the ECO will
experience tidal perturbations due to in-going gravitational waves, respond to
these waves, and generate out-going waves. As it also turns out, if both
in-going and out-going waves exist near the horizon, the Newman Penrose (NP)
quantity $\psi_0$ will be numerically dominated by the in-going wave, while the
NP quantity $\psi_4$ will be dominated by the out-going wave. In this way, we
obtain the ECO boundary condition in the form of a relation between $\psi_0$
and the complex conjugate of $\psi_4$, in a way that is determined by the ECO's
tidal response in the FIDO frame. We explore several ways to modify
gravitational-wave dispersion in the FIDO frame, and deduce the corresponding
ECO boundary condition for Teukolsky functions. We subsequently obtain the
boundary condition for $\psi_4$ alone, as well as for the Sasaki-Nakamura and
Detweiler's functions. As it also turns out, reflection of spinning ECOs will
generically mix between different $\ell$ components of the perturbations
fields, and be different for perturbations with different parities. We also
apply our boundary condition to computing gravitational-wave echoes from
spinning ECOs, and solve for the spinning ECOs' quasi-normal modes.

process of the labels. Second, the extra unlabeled samples are employed to
transfer the knowledge from base classes to novel classes through contrastive
learning. Specifically, we force the augmented positive pairs close while push
the negative ones distant. Our contrastive transfer scheme implicitly learns
the novel-class embeddings to alleviate the over-fitting problem on the few
labeled data. Thus, we can mitigate the degeneration of embedding generality in
novel classes. Extensive experiments indicate that PTN outperforms the

  Sidiropoulos","eTREE: Learning Tree-structured Embeddings",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Matrix factorization (MF) plays an important role in a wide range of machine
learning and data mining models. MF is commonly used to obtain item embeddings
and feature representations due to its ability to capture correlations and
higher-order statistical dependencies across dimensions. In many applications,
the categories of items exhibit a hierarchical tree structure. For instance,
human diseases can be divided into coarse categories, e.g., bacterial, and
viral. These categories can be further divided into finer categories, e.g.,
viral infections can be respiratory, gastrointestinal, and exanthematous viral
diseases. In e-commerce, products, movies, books, etc., are grouped into
hierarchical categories, e.g., clothing items are divided by gender, then by
type (formal, casual, etc.). While the tree structure and the categories of the
different items may be known in some applications, they have to be learned
together with the embeddings in many others. In this work, we propose eTREE, a
model that incorporates the (usually ignored) tree structure to enhance the
quality of the embeddings. We leverage the special uniqueness properties of
Nonnegative MF (NMF) to prove identifiability of eTREE. The proposed model not
only exploits the tree structure prior, but also learns the hierarchical
clustering in an unsupervised data-driven fashion. We derive an efficient
algorithmic solution and a scalable implementation of eTREE that exploits
parallel computing, computation caching, and warm start strategies. We showcase
the effectiveness of eTREE on real data from various application domains:
healthcare, recommender systems, and education. We also demonstrate the
meaningfulness of the tree obtained from eTREE by means of domain experts

However, these approaches do not apply well for packaged software (PS)
implementation; hence this phenomenon requires independent consideration. To
explore PS implementation, we conducted ethnographic studies in packaged
software development companies, in particular, to understand aspects of the
feasibility study approach for PS implementation. From an analysis of these
cases, we conclude that firstly; the analyst has more of a hybrid
analyst-sales-marketing role than the analyst in traditional RE feasibility
study. Secondly; the use of a live scenario software demonstration in order to
convince the client to buy into the PS may lead to increased perceived
feasibility and reduced resistance to PS implementation. Thirdly; the
assessment criteria that are used to estimate the effort and time needed for PS
implementation are new features, level of customization, software 'output', and
technical needs. Fourthly; the feasibility study for PS implementation differs
strongly from traditional RE as the analyst mainly considers how to deal with

helical electromotive driving. The root mean square Mach number of the
hydrodynamic turbulent steady-state taken as initial condition varies from 0.1

scales: local inverse transfer, non-local inverse transfer and local direct
transfer. A shell decomposition allows to associate these three phenomena with
clearly distinct velocity scales while the helical decomposition allows to
establish the role of the different helical components and the compressive part

Therefore, developing efficient and accurate perception method compatible with

An Anchor-based Spatio-Temporal Attention 3D Convolution operation (ASTA3DConv)
is proposed in this paper to process dynamic 3D point cloud sequences. The
proposed convolution operation builds a regular receptive field around each
point by setting several virtual anchors around each point. The features of
neighborhood points are firstly aggregated to each anchor based on the
spatio-temporal attention mechanism. Then, anchor-based 3D convolution is
adopted to aggregate these anchors' features to the core points. The proposed
method makes better use of the structured information within the local region
and learns spatio-temporal embedding features from dynamic 3D point cloud
sequences. Anchor-based Spatio-Temporal Attention 3D Convolutional Neural

parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically
distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform
poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for
ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP)
was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the
Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear
minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being
used in large-scale systems.
  To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory
AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that
estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the
required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for
the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP
(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference
suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically
characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The
relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on
state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP
converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP
for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE
predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed
point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results'

particular, a side-gate is utilized to control the location of ions within a
solid polymer electrolyte to form an electric double layer at the interface of
electrolyte and WSe2 and induce a vertical electric field. Additionally, a
back-gate is used to apply a 2nd vertical electric field. An on-off ratio of
the light emission up to 90 was observed under constant pump light intensity.
In addition, a blue shift of the photoluminescence line up to 36 meV was
observed. We attribute this blue shift to the decrease of exciton binding
energy due to the change of nonlinear in-plane dielectric constant and use it
to determine the 3rd order off-diagonal susceptibility \c{hi}^((3)

normalized by using intensity mapping functions (IMFs) in consideration of
saturated pixels. Then, the normalized images are coded by using the local

energy flow between the renewable energy and electric grid. In this paper, a
hierarchical structure of grid energy router is proposed to greatly facilitate
peer-to-peer energy sharing among energy routers. It can be placed at critical
buses to make active distribution networks develop into multiple interconnected
prosumer-based autonomous systems. To alleviate the mismatch between the
medium-time dispatch and device-level control caused by the forecast error of
distributed generation, a bi-level primary energy dispatching strategy is
proposed to fully utilize the energy buffer of multiple grid energy routers.
The power variation in short-time scale is well suppressed by sharing energy
buffer in the upper-level control, and the energy buffer is further optimized
to better absorb the variation. Combining measured information, the lower-level
control is designed to track the optimized instruction of energy buffer in
real-time scale, which is a distributed process. The power flow constraint is
assumed to be handled by medium-time dispatch, and the current constraint of
the device is only taken into consideration. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hierarchical structure and primary
energy dispatching strategy of the grid energy router.

has been extensively studied in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). To predict
the answer, it is common practice to employ a predictor to draw information
only from the final encoder layer which generates the \textit{coarse-grained}
representations of the source sequences, i.e., passage and question. Previous
studies have shown that the representation of source sequence becomes more
\textit{coarse-grained} from \textit{fine-grained} as the encoding layer
increases. It is generally believed that with the growing number of layers in
deep neural networks, the encoding process will gather relevant information for
each location increasingly, resulting in more \textit{coarse-grained}
representations, which adds the likelihood of similarity to other locations
(referring to homogeneity). Such a phenomenon will mislead the model to make
wrong judgments so as to degrade the performance. To this end, we propose a
novel approach called Adaptive Bidirectional Attention, which adaptively
exploits the source representations of different levels to the predictor.

vehicle-to-animal collisions by developing an efficient approach for the

techniques on dashcam video. Our approach leverages the Mask R-CNN model for
detecting and identifying various commonly found animals. Then, we perform lane
detection to deduce whether a detected animal is on the vehicle's lane or not
and track its location and direction of movement using a centroid based object
tracking algorithm. This approach ensures that the framework is effective at
determining whether an animal is obstructing the path or not of an autonomous
vehicle in addition to predicting its movement and giving feedback accordingly.
This system was tested under various lighting and weather conditions and was
observed to perform relatively well, which leads the way for prominent

gravitational interaction. The latter reduces to general relativity in a
particular conformal frame for which the gravitational coupling and active
gravitational masses are fixed. Specifically, we consider a cosmological model
in this framework that is {\it dynamically} identical to the standard model
(SM) of cosmology. However, {\it kinematics} of test particles traveling in the
new background metric is modified thanks to a new (cosmological) fundamental
mass scale, $\gamma$, of the model. Since the lapse-function of the new metric
is radially-dependent any incoming photon experiences (gravitational)
red/blueshift in the {\it comoving} frame, unlike in the SM. Distance scales
are modified as well due to the scale $\gamma$. The claimed $4.4\sigma$ tension
level between the locally measured Hubble constant, $H_{0}$, with SH0ES and the
corresponding value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) could
then be significantly alleviated by an earlier-than-thought recombination.
Assuming vanishing spatial curvature, either one of the Planck 2018 (P18) or
dark energy survey (DES) yr1 data sets subject to the SH0ES prior imply that
$\gamma^{-1}$ is $O(100)$ times larger than the Hubble scale, $H_{0}^{-1}$.
Considering P18+SH0ES or P18+DES+SH0ES data set combinations, the odds against
vanishing $\gamma$ are over 1000:1 and 2000:1, respectively, and the model is
strongly favored over the SM with a deviance information criterion (DIC) gain
$\gtrsim 10$ and $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The tension is reduced in this
model to $\sim 1.5$ and $1.3 \sigma$, respectively. We conclude that the
$H_{0}$ tension may simply result from a yet unrecognized fundamental symmetry
of the gravitational interaction -- Weyl invariance. (abridged)

suggest that the newly discovered S4714 and S62 are best suited for such a test
because of their small pericenter distances relative to Sgr A*. Depending on
the initial inclination of the star, the line width would vary by as much as
$20-76\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ within a period of $20-40$ years. Such a variation is
comparable to the current detection limit. Since the precession rate is
sensitive to the orbital eccentricity and stellar quadrupole structure,
monitoring the rotation of S-stars could also help us better constrain the
orbital elements of the S-stars and their internal structures.

MDM is defined to be an algebraic fiber space between normal quasi-projective

$\operatorname{Pic}(X/U)_{\mathbb{Q}}=\operatorname{N} ^1(X/U)_{\mathbb{Q}}$
and the (relative) movable cone is decomposed into the semi-ample cones of
finitely many small $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial modifications, each of which is
assumed to be rational polyhedral. An MDS is an MDM where $U$ is a point. We
prove that the relative $D$-MMP runs and terminates in either a good
$D$-minimal model or a $D$-Mori fiber space for an arbitrary divisor $D$ on an
MDM, and that an algebraic fiber space satisfying
$\operatorname{Pic}(X/U)_{\mathbb{Q}}= \operatorname{N} ^1(X/U)_{\mathbb{Q}}$
is an MDM if and only if a Cox sheaf is finitely generated over $U$. These are
generalizations to an MDM of the fundamental results by Hu and Keel for an MDS.
We also show that if the composition of two algebraic fiber spaces $f$ and $g$

MDMs. We prove that a base change of an MDM by a proper flat morphism is again
an MDM, provided that the base change is normal $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial and that
any $\mathbb{Q}$-line bundle on the base change descends to the original MDM.

and ubiquitous phenomenon that crucially reduces the quality of imageries and
limits the scenarios of application. Therefore, thin cloud removal is an
indispensable procedure to enhance the utilization of remote sensing images.
Generally, even though contaminated by thin clouds, the pixels still retain
more or less surface information. Hence, different from thick cloud removal,
thin cloud removal algorithms normally concentrate on inhibiting the cloud
influence rather than substituting the cloud-contaminated pixels. Meanwhile,
considering the surface features obscured by the cloud are usually similar to
adjacent areas, the dependency between each pixel of the input is useful to
reconstruct contaminated areas. In this paper, to make full use of the
dependencies between pixels of the image, we propose a Multi-Head Linear
Attention Generative Adversarial Network (MLAGAN) for Thin Cloud Removal. The
MLA-GAN is based on the encoding-decoding framework consisting of multiple
attention-based layers and deconvolutional layers. Compared with six deep
learning-based thin cloud removal benchmarks, the experimental results on the
RICE1 and RICE2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework MLA-GAN has
dominant advantages in thin cloud removal.

weak lensing surveys. One important challenge is about suppressing the shear
bias on source images of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR$\lesssim10$).
Previously, it has been demonstrated that the shear estimators defined in the
Fourier_Quad (FQ) method can achieve sub-percent accuracy at the very faint end
(SNR$\lesssim5$) through ensemble averaging. Later, it is found that we can
approach the minimum statistical error (the Cramer-Rao Bound) by symmetrizing
the full PDF of the FQ shear estimators (the PDF_SYM approach), instead of
taking ensemble averages. Recently, with a large amount of mock galaxy images,
we are able to identify some small amount of shear biases in the PDF_SYM
approach at the faint end. The multiplicative bias goes up to
$1-2\times10^{-2}$ at SNR $\lesssim 10$, and the anisotropy of the point spread
function (PSF) causes an additive bias that can reach a few times $10^{-4}$. We
find that these biases originate from the noise-source coupling in the galaxy
power spectrum. It turns out that this problem can be largely fixed by adding
additional terms to the FQ shear estimators. The resulting multiplicative and
additive biases can be significantly suppressed to the level of $10^{-3}$ and
$10^{-5}$ respectively. These corrections substantially extend the available
SNR range for accurate shear measurement with the PDF_SYM approach.

However, such investigation is lost in previous deep networks that understand

GDANet introduces Geometry-Disentangle Module to dynamically disentangle point

Complementary Attention Module that regards the features from sharp and gentle

Lotka's law and a cooperative game that maximizes benefit-cost ratio for
collaborations. The model is built on a circle to express the game, expressing
the cost by the distance between nodes. The benefit of coauthoring with a

Confident itemsets discover how biomedical concepts are related to class labels

black-box's behavior for individual predictions. Optimizing fidelity,
interpretability, and coverage measures, BioCIE produces class-wise

that the ground truths of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are extremely hard to

instead of performing convolution over this superpixel graph, we further
partition it into several sub-graphs by pruning the edges with weak weights, so
as to strengthen the correlations of nodes with high similarity. This second
round of clustering also further reduces the graph size, thus reducing the
computation burden of graph convolution. Experimental results on three widely
used benchmark datasets well prove the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

stars, supernovae, frozen lakes and the Earth's mantle. In these contexts, the
goal of laboratory and numerical studies is to determine the relation between
the internal temperature gradients and the heat flux transported by the
turbulent flow. This is the constitutive law of turbulent convection, to be
input into large-scale models of such natural flows. However, in contrast with
the radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on
convection driven by heating and cooling plates: the heat transport is then
severely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the
realization of the mixing-length scaling-law used in evolution models of
geophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important
discrepancy between the scaling-laws measured in laboratory experiments and
those used eg. in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and
numerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves
the mixing-length scaling regime, also known as the `ultimate' regime of
thermal convection. This constitutes the first clear observation of this regime
of turbulent convection. Our study therefore bridges the gap between models of
natural flows and laboratory experiments. It opens an experimental avenue for a
priori determinations of the constitutive laws to be implemented into models of
geophysical and astrophysical flows, as opposed to empirical fits of these
constitutive laws to the scarce observational data.

without sending their private data to a central server. Extensive works have
studied the performance guarantee of the global model, however, it is still
unclear how each individual client influences the collaborative training
process. In this work, we defined a new notion, called {\em Fed-Influence}, to
quantify this influence over the model parameters, and proposed an effective
and efficient algorithm to estimate this metric. In particular, our design
satisfies several desirable properties: (1) it requires neither retraining nor
retracing, adding only linear computational overhead to clients and the server;
(2) it strictly maintains the tenets of federated learning, without revealing
any client's local private data; and (3) it works well on both convex and
non-convex loss functions, and does not require the final model to be optimal.
Empirical results on a synthetic dataset and the FEMNIST dataset demonstrate
that our estimation method can approximate Fed-Influence with small bias.
Further, we show an application of Fed-Influence in model debugging.

limitations that pose barriers to the quantitative representation of
lexicographic preferences, there exists a subset of the rational numbers over
which the proposed new connective can be naturally defined. Lexicographic logic
can be used to define in a simple way some well-known preferential operators,
like ""$A$ and if possible $B$"", and ""$A$ or failing that $B$"". Moreover, many
other hierarchical preferential operators can be defined using a systematic
approach. We argue that the new logic is an effective formalism for ranking
query results according to the satisfaction level of user preferences.

scaled up in the domain dimension $d$ compared to the usual Karhunen-Lo\`eve

each weight and bias has an independent Gaussian prior, but with the key
difference that the variances decrease in the width of the network in such a
way that the resulting function is \emph{almost surely} well defined in the
limit of an infinite width network. We show that in a Bayesian treatment of
inferring unknown functions, the induced posterior over functions is amenable
to Monte Carlo sampling using Hilbert space Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods. This type of MCMC is popular, e.g. in the Bayesian Inverse Problems
literature, because it is stable under \emph{mesh refinement}, i.e. the
acceptance probability does not shrink to $0$ as more parameters of the
function's prior are introduced, even \emph{ad infinitum}. In numerical
examples we demonstrate these stated competitive advantages over other function
space priors. We also implement examples in Bayesian Reinforcement Learning to
automate tasks from data and demonstrate, for the first time, stability of MCMC
to mesh refinement for these type of problems.

pave the way for probing their deep interiors. We explore the pulsational
properties of ultra-massive helium-rich white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen and
oxygen-neon cores resulting from single stellar evolution. Our goal is to
provide a theoretical basis that could eventually help to discern the core
composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and the scenario of their formation
through asteroseismology, anticipating the possible future detection of
pulsations in this type of stars. We find that, given that the white dwarf
models coming from the three scenarios considered are characterized by distinct
core chemical profiles, their pulsation properties are also different, thus
leading to distinctive signatures in the period-spacing and mode-trapping
properties. Our results indicate that, in case of an eventual detection of
pulsating ultra-massive helium-rich white dwarfs, it would be possible to
derive valuable information encrypted in the core of these stars in connection
with the origin of such exotic objects. The detection of pulsations in these
stars has many chances to be achieved soon through observations collected with
ongoing space missions.

a simple PSpice model of the capacitive couplings within an MPGD. The crosstalk
pulse shape can be understood as due to a CR-differentiator. Crosstalk can
occur simultaneously through more than one capacitive coupling path. The
crosstalk signals on these paths add differently if the signal is induced via a
current source as in normal detector operation or via a voltage source as is
often done in benchtop tests with an external voltage pulse generator. A few
means for reducing the crosstalk are investigated with the model. It shows that
a low-impedance AC path from the amplification electrode that faces the readout
structure to ground is important for minimizing crosstalk. This implies a need
for a sufficiently large capacitance of that amplification electrode to ground.
This result has consequences for how much such an amplification electrode can
be segmented without incurring crosstalk.

Particularly, by adopting a dynamical Hamiltonian approach, we are capable to

In these cases, we have analyzed the general solutions of accretion employing
the isothermal equations of state. The steady state and spherically symmetric
accretion of different test fluids onto the conformal gravity black hole has
been considered. Further, we have classified these flows in the context of
equations of state and the cases of conformal gravity black hole. The new
behavior of polytropic fluid accretion is also discussed in all three cases of
black hole. Black hole mass accretion rate is the most important part of this
research in which we have investigated that the Schwarzschild black hole
produce a typical signature than the conformal gravity black hole and
Schwarzschild de-Sitter black hole. The critical fluid flow and the mass
accretion rate have been presented graphically by the impact parameters
$\beta$, $\gamma$, $k$ and these parameters have great significance.
Additionally, the maximum mass rate of accretion fall near the universal and
Killing horizons and minimum rate of accretion occurs in between these regions.

in GAN latent space. Supervised and self-supervised approaches that search for
anticipated directions or use off-the-shelf classifiers to drive image

the space of perceptually meaningful directions is nowhere close to being fully
mapped. As this space is broad and full of creative potential, we want tools
for direction discovery that capture the richness and generalizability of human

tool use, in order to identify directions that are perceptually meaningful to

dependent hierarchical feature extraction method. It is widely used in several
computer vision problems. The CNNs learn the important visual features from
training samples automatically. It is observed that the network overfits the
training samples very easily. Several regularization methods have been proposed
to avoid the overfitting. In spite of this, the network is sensitive to the
color distribution within the images which is ignored by the existing
approaches. In this paper, we discover the color robustness problem of CNN by
proposing a Color Channel Perturbation (CCP) attack to fool the CNNs. In CCP
attack new images are generated with new channels created by combining the
original channels with the stochastic weights. Experiments were carried out
over widely used CIFAR10, Caltech256 and TinyImageNet datasets in the image
classification framework. The VGG, ResNet and DenseNet models are used to test
the impact of the proposed attack. It is observed that the performance of the
CNNs degrades drastically under the proposed CCP attack. Result show the effect
of the proposed simple CCP attack over the robustness of the CNN trained model.
The results are also compared with existing CNN fooling approaches to evaluate
the accuracy drop. We also propose a primary defense mechanism to this problem
by augmenting the training dataset with the proposed CCP attack. The
state-of-the-art performance using the proposed solution in terms of the CNN
robustness under CCP attack is observed in the experiments. The code is made

optics (TO) and metasurfaces, many unprecedented devices such as invisibility
cloaks have been recently realized. However, each of these methods has some
drawbacks limiting the applicability of the designed devices for real-life
scenarios. For instance, TO studies lead to bulky coating layer with the
thickness that is comparable to, or even larger than the dimension of the
concealed object. In this paper, based on the coordinate transformation, an
ultrathin carpet cloak is proposed to hide objects with arbitrary shape and
size using a thin anisotropic material, called as infinitely anisotropic medium
(IAM). It is shown that unlike the previous metasurface-based carpet cloaks,
the proposed IAM hides objects from all viewing incident angles while it is
extremely thin compared with the object dimensions. This material also
circumvents the conventional transformation optics complexities and could be
easily implemented in practical scenarios. To demonstrate the capability of the
proposed carpet cloak, several full-wave simulations are carried out. Finally,
as a proof of concept, the IAM is implemented based on the effective medium
theory which exhibits good agreement with the results obtained from the
theoretical investigations. The introduced material not only constitutes a
significant step towards the invisibility cloak but also can greatly promote
the practical application of the other TO-based devices.
