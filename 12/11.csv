address the lack of explainability of many of its models. We focus on
explanations for discrete Bayesian network classifiers (BCs), targeting greater
transparency of their inner workings by including intermediate variables in
explanations, rather than just the input and output variables as is standard
practice. The proposed influence-driven explanations (IDXs) for BCs are
systematically generated using the causal relationships between variables
within the BC, called influences, which are then categorised by logical
requirements, called relation properties, according to their behaviour. These
relation properties both provide guarantees beyond heuristic explanation
methods and allow the information underpinning an explanation to be tailored to
a particular context's and user's requirements, e.g., IDXs may be dialectical
or counterfactual. We demonstrate IDXs' capability to explain various forms of
BCs, e.g., naive or multi-label, binary or categorical, and also integrate
recent approaches to explanations for BCs from the literature. We evaluate IDXs
with theoretical and empirical analyses, demonstrating their considerable
advantages when compared with existing explanation methods.

single unit of a single item within a finite period of time. Motivated by
real-world problems, such as, e.g., long-term rental of rooms and apartments,
we assume that customers arrive online according to a Poisson process, and
their valuations are drawn from an unknown distribution and discounted over
time. We evaluate our mechanisms in terms of competitive ratio, measuring the
worst-case ratio between their revenue and that of an optimal mechanism that
knows the distribution of valuations. First, we focus on the identical
valuation setting, where all the customers value the item for the same amount.
In this setting, we provide a mechanism M_c that achieves the best possible
competitive ratio, discussing its dependency on the parameters in the case of
linear discount. Then, we switch to the random valuation setting. We show that,
if we restrict the attention to distributions of valuations with a monotone
hazard rate, then the competitive ratio of M_c is lower bounded by a strictly
positive constant that does not depend on the distribution. Moreover, we
provide another mechanism, called M_pc, which is defined by a piecewise
constant pricing strategy and reaches performances comparable to those obtained
with M_c. This mechanism is useful when the seller cannot change the posted
price too often. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performances of our
mechanisms in a number of experimental settings.

one non-differentiable component in the pipeline, Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS), and building up an end-to-end system. However, what makes for its
one-to-one prediction has not been well understood. In this paper, we first
point out that one-to-one positive sample assignment is the key factor, while,
one-to-many assignment in previous detectors causes redundant predictions in
inference. Second, we surprisingly find that even training with one-to-one
assignment, previous detectors still produce redundant predictions. We identify
that classification cost in matching cost is the main ingredient: (1) previous
detectors only consider location cost, (2) by additionally introducing
classification cost, previous detectors immediately produce one-to-one
prediction during inference. We introduce the concept of score gap to explore
the effect of matching cost. Classification cost enlarges the score gap by
choosing positive samples as those of highest score in the training iteration
and reducing noisy positive samples brought by only location cost. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantages of end-to-end object detection on crowded scenes.

should be a strong incentive to investigate a related challenging problem
interesting in its own; namely integrating an arbitrary power of a given
polynomial on a simple set (e.g., unit box or unit sphere) with respect to
Lebesgue or Haar measure.

considerable attention in the community due to the performance gains exhibited
on the KITTI3D benchmark, in particular on the commonly reported validation
split. This generated a distorted impression about the superiority of
Pseudo-LiDAR-based (PL-based) approaches over methods working with RGB images
only. Our first contribution consists in rectifying this view by pointing out
and showing experimentally that the validation results published by PL-based
methods are substantially biased. The source of the bias resides in an overlap
between the KITTI3D object detection validation set and the training/validation
sets used to train depth predictors feeding PL-based methods. Surprisingly, the
bias remains also after geographically removing the overlap. This leaves the
test set as the only reliable set for comparison, where published PL-based
methods do not excel. Our second contribution brings PL-based methods back up
in the ranking with the design of a novel deep architecture which introduces a
3D confidence prediction module. We show that 3D confidence estimation
techniques derived from RGB-only 3D detection approaches can be successfully
integrated into our framework and, more importantly, that improved performance
can be obtained with a newly designed 3D confidence measure, leading to
state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI3D benchmark.

  Design. Prospective study. Setting. Province of Granada (Spain). Population.
Consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized, admitted to ICU, recovered and died
from March 15 to September 22, 2020. Study variables. The number of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized or admitted to ICU for COVID-19.
  Results. The data reported by hospitals was used to develop a mathematical
model that reflects the flow of the population among the different interest
groups in relation to COVID-19. This tool has allowed us to analyse different
scenarios based on socio-health restriction measures, and to forecast the
number of people infected, hospitalized and admitted to the ICU until May 2021.
  Conclusions. The mathematical model is capable of providing predictions on
the evolution of the COVID-19 sufficiently in advance as to anticipate the
peaks of prevalence and hospital and ICU care demands, and also the appearance
of periods in which the care for non-COVID patients could be intensified.

m_{ij}^2$.
  Calculation of the probabilities for a given neutrino-type either to survive
or to mutate into another type, as functions of momentum $p$ and travelling
distance $L$, are properly based on wave-packet models of varying complexity.
Approximations neglecting subtle effects like decoherence result in the
standard oscillation formulae with terms proportional to $\sin^2(\Delta
m_{ij}^2 L / 4 p)$.
  The same result may also be derived by a simple plane-wave model as shown in
most textbooks. However, those approaches rely on unphysical a-priory
assumptions: either ""equal energy"" or ""equal velocity"" or ""equal momentum"" in
the phases of different mass eigenstates -- which are refuted elsewhere. In
addition, some assume tacitly that interference occurs at time $t = L$.
  This study re-examines the plane-wave model. No unphysical assumption is
necessary for deriving the standard formulae: a heuristic approach relies only
on carefully defining interference at time $t = L / \beta$, and is justified by
coherence arguments based in a qualitative way on wave-packets.

the late evolution and final fate of massive stars. We develop spherically
symmetric time-dependent and steady-state hydrodynamical models of the
radiation-driven wind outflows and associated mass loss from classical WR
stars. The simulations are based on combining the opacities typically used in
static stellar structure and evolution models with a simple parametrised form
for the enhanced line-opacity expected within a supersonic outflow. Our
simulations reveal high mass-loss rates initiated in deep and hot optically
thick layers around T\approx 200kK. The resulting velocity structure is
non-monotonic and can be separated into three phases: i) an initial
acceleration to supersonic speeds ii) stagnation and even deceleration, and
iii) an outer region of rapid re-acceleration. The characteristic structures
seen in converged steady-state simulations agree well with the outflow
properties of our time-dependent models. By directly comparing our dynamic
simulations to corresponding hydrostatic models, we demonstrate explicitly that
the need to invoke extra energy transport in convectively inefficient regions
of stellar structure and evolution models is merely an artefact of enforcing a
hydrostatic outer boundary. Moreover, the ""dynamically inflated"" inner regions
of our simulations provide a natural explanation for the often-found mismatch
between predicted hydrostatic WR radii and those inferred from spectroscopy.
Finally, we contrast our simulations with alternative recent WR wind models
based on co-moving frame radiative transfer for computing the radiation force.
Since CMF transfer currently cannot handle non-monotonic velocity fields, the
characteristic deceleration regions found here are avoided in such simulations
by invoking an ad-hoc very high degree of clumping.

the risk of thrombosis due to a combination of non-physiological hemodynamics
and synthetic biomaterials. Limited work has been done to address platelet
adhesion and aggregation on artificial surfaces under flow with sub-threshold
concentrations of weak agonists. We perfused a blood analog containing
hemoglobin-depleted red blood cells and fluorescently labeled platelets across
a titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) surface at
shear rates of 400 and 1000 s-1. Upstream of the specimen, sub-threshold
concentrations of ADP were uniformly introduced at concentrations of 0, 5, and
10 nM. Time-lapse videos of depositing platelets were recorded, and the
percentage of the surface covered was quantified. Surface coverage percentages
at 400 s-1and 1000 s-1were compared for each concentration of ADP and material
surface combination. We observed a threshold concentration of ADP that
expedites platelet deposition that is dependent on both shear and material
surface chemistry. Additionally, we observed embolization when thrombus areas
exceeded 300{\mu}m2, which was dependent on the combination of shear, ADP
concentration, and material surface. This work is the first to simultaneously
examine the three key contributing factors leading to thrombotic events. Our
findings assist in considering alternative material choices constituting VADs
and the need to address material reactivity in assessing antiplatelet agent
tests.

progressions and strong divisibility sequences. First, we have used methods of
commutative algebra and complex analysis to establish new nontrivial lower
bounds for the $\mathrm{lcm}$ of some quadratic sequences. Next, a more
profound study of the arithmetic properties of strong divisibility sequences
allowed us to obtain three interesting identities involving the $\mathrm{lcm}$
of these sequences, which generalizes some previous identities of Farhi (2009)
and Nair (1982); as consequences, we have deduced a precise estimates for the
$\mathrm{lcm}$ of generalized Fibonacci sequence (the so-called Lucas
sequences). We have also developed a method that provides an effective version
to the asymptotic result of Bateman (2002) concerning the $\mathrm{lcm}$ of an
arithmetic progression. Finally, we found that the latter method can be adapted
to estimate the $\mathrm{lcm}$ of the sequence $(n^2+1)_n$, which allowed us in
particular to improve the lower bounds of Farhi (2005) and Oon (2013). The

Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) transceiver, designed for multiple Base
Stations supporting multicast MCC in presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We
formulate minimization problems with the Sum-Mean-Square-Error (SMSE) at
legitimate users as an objective function, and a lower bound for the MSE at
eavesdroppers as a constraint. Security is achieved thanks to physical layer
security mechanisms, namely MIMO beamforming and Artificial Noise (AN).
Reliability is achieved by designing a system which is robust to Channel State
Information errors. They can be of known distribution or norm-bounded. In the
former case, a coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to solve the problem.
In the latter case, we propose an worst-case based iterative algorithm.
Numerical results at physical layer and system level reveal the crucial role of
robust designs for reliable MCC. We show the interest of both robust design and
AN to improve the security gap. We show that full BS cooperation in preferred
for highly secured and reliable MCC but dynamic clustering allows to trade-off
security and reliability against capacity.

  formalism","52 pages. Major revision developed throughout refereeing process",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop a possibilistic semantic formalism for quantum phenomena from an
operational perspective. This semantic system is based on a Chu duality between
preparation processes and yes/no tests, the target space being a three-valued
set equipped with an informational interpretation. A basic set of axioms is
introduced for the space of states. This basic set of axioms suffices to
constrain the space of states to be a projective domain. The subset of pure
states is then characterized within this domain structure. After having
specified the notions of properties and measurements, we explore the notion of
compatibility between measurements and of minimally disturbing measurements. We
achieve the characterization of the domain structure on the space of states by
requiring the existence of a scheme of discriminating yes/no tests, necessary
condition for the construction of an orthogonality relation on the space of
states. This last requirement about the space of states constrain the
corresponding projective domain to be ortho-complemented. An orthogonality
relation is then defined on the space of states and its properties are studied.
Equipped with this relation, the ortho-poset of ortho-closed subsets of pure
states inherits naturally a structure of Hilbert lattice. Finally, the
symmetries of the system are characterized as a general subclass of Chu
morphisms. We prove that these Chu symmetries preserve the class of minimally
disturbing measurements and the orthogonality relation between states. These
symmetries lead naturally to the ortho-morphisms of Hilbert lattice defined on
the set of ortho-closed subsets of pure states.

local fragment of a strongly correlated system, entangled with the wider
environment. The `energy-weighted' density matrix embedding theory (EwDMET) was
established recently as a way to systematically control the resolution of the
fragment-environment coupling, and allow for true quantum fluctuations over
this boundary to be self-consistently optimized within a fully static
framework. In this work, we reformulate the algorithm to ensure that EwDMET can
be considered equivalent to an optimal and rigorous truncation of the
self-consistent dynamics of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). A practical
limitation of these quantum embedding approaches is often a numerical fitting
of a self-consistent object defining the quantum effects. However, we show here
that in this formulation, all numerical fitting steps can be entirely
circumvented, via an effective Dyson equation in the space of truncated
dynamics. This provides a robust and analytic self-consistency for the method,
and an ability to systematically and rigorously converge to DMFT from a static,
wave function perspective. We demonstrate that this improved approach can solve
the correlated dynamics and phase transitions of the Bethe lattice Hubbard
model in infinite dimensions, as well as one- and two-dimensional Hubbard
models where we clearly show the benefits of this rapidly convergent basis for
correlation-driven fluctuations. This systematically truncated description of
the effective dynamics of the problem also allows access to quantities such as
Fermi liquid parameters and renormalized dynamics, and demonstrates a
numerically efficient, systematic convergence to the zero-temperature dynamical

to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics,

the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its
application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate
how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an

experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision making
is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight

variables and a real action. We may package the {\it real} connection variables
into the complex Self-Dual Ashtekar connection (and will do so to make contact
with previous work), but that operation is essentially cosmetic and can be
undone at any step or even bypassed altogether. The action will remain the
(real) Einstein-Cartan action, forgoing the addition of the usual Holst (or
Nieh-Yan) term with an imaginary coefficient. It is then found that the
constraints are solved by a modification of the Chern-Simons state which is a
pure phase (in the Lorentzian theory, we stress), the phase containing only the
fully gauge-invariant imaginary part of the Chern-Simons functional. Thus, the
state for the ""real theory"" is non-pathological with regards to the most
egregious criticisms facing its ""non-real"" cousin, solving the complex theory.
A straightforward modification of the real Chern-Simons state is also a
solution in quasi-topological theories based on the Euler invariant, for which
the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, is dynamical. In that case it is enough
to shift the usual factor of $\Lambda$ in the wave function to the inside of
the spatial Chern-Simons integral. The trick only works for the quasi-Euler
theory with a critical coupling previously identified in the literature. It
does not apply to the quasi-Pontryagin theory.

wind interacts with the interplanetary CME (ICME) resulting in constant
acceleration or deceleration. The upgraded version of the model (EAMv3),
presented here, incorporates two basic improvements: (a) a new technique for
the calculation of the acceleration (or deceleration) of the ICME from the Sun

the upgraded EAM model is performed via comparisons to predictions from the
ensemble version of the Drag-Based model (DBEM) and the WSA-ENLIL+Cone ensemble
model. A common sample of 16 CMEs/ICMEs, in 2013-2014, is used for the
comparison. Basic performance metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE),
mean error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE) between observed and
predicted values of ToA are presented. MAE for EAM model was 8.7$\pm$1.6 hours

ME for EAM was -1.4$\pm$2.7 hours in contrast with -9.7$\pm$3.4 and
-6.1$\pm$3.3 hours from DBEM and ENLIL. We also study the hypothesis of
stronger deceleration in the interplanetary (IP) space utilizing the EAMv3 and
DBEM models. In particularly, the DBEM model perform better when a greater
value of drag parameter, of order of a factor of 3, is used in contrast to

techniques to fool image classifiers by altering the physical light condition

attacks that place hand-crafted adversarial objects, projector-based ones
obviate modifying the physical entities, and can be performed transiently and
dynamically by altering the projection pattern. However, subtle light
perturbations are insufficient to fool image classifiers, due to the complex
environment and project-and-capture process. Thus, existing approaches focus on
projecting clearly perceptible adversarial patterns, while the more interesting
yet challenging goal, stealthy projector-based attack, remains open. In this
paper, for the first time, we formulate this problem as an end-to-end
differentiable process and propose a Stealthy Projector-based Adversarial
Attack (SPAA) solution. In SPAA, we approximate the real Project-and-Capture
process using a deep neural network named PCNet, then we include PCNet in the
optimization of projector-based attacks such that the generated adversarial
projection is physically plausible. Finally, to generate both robust and
stealthy adversarial projections, we propose an algorithm that uses minimum
perturbation and adversarial confidence thresholds to alternate between the
adversarial loss and stealthiness loss optimization. Our experimental
evaluations show that SPAA clearly outperforms other methods by achieving
higher attack success rates and meanwhile being stealthier, for both targeted

considerable evolution occurs from z=3.6 to z=1.5, after which it slows down to

of analyzing all variants of a program family simultaneously, in a single run
without generating any of the variants explicitly. The elements of the
underlying lifted analysis domain are tuples, which maintain one property per
variant. Still, explicit property enumeration in tuples, one by one for all
variants, immediately yields combinatorial explosion. This is particularly
apparent in the case of program families that, apart from Boolean features,
contain also numerical features with big domains, thus admitting astronomic
configuration spaces.
  The key for an efficient lifted analysis is proper handling of
variability-specific constructs of the language (e.g., feature-based runtime
tests and #if directives). In this work, we introduce a new symbolic
representation of the lifted abstract domain that can efficiently analyze
program families with numerical features. This makes sharing between property
elements corresponding to different variants explicitly possible. The elements
of the new lifted domain are constraint-based decision trees, where decision
nodes are labeled with linear constraints defined over numerical features and
the leaf nodes belong to an existing single-program analysis domain. To
illustrate the potential of this representation, we have implemented an
experimental lifted static analyzer, called SPLNUM^2Analyzer, for inferring
invariants of C programs. It uses existing numerical domains (e.g., intervals,
octagons, polyhedra) from the APRON library as parameters. An empirical
evaluation on benchmarks from SV-COMP and BusyBox yields promising preliminary
results indicating that our decision trees-based approach is effective and
outperforms the tuple-based approach, which is used as a baseline lifted

quantum communication tasks, we study the dense coding capacity (DCC) and
teleportation fidelity (TF) of Haar uniformly generated random multipartite
states of various ranks. We prove that when a rank-2 two-qubit state, a Werner
state, and a pure state possess the same amount of entanglement, the DCC of a
rank-2 state belongs to the envelope made by pure and Werner states. In a
similar way, we obtain an upper bound via the generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state for rank-2 three-qubit states when the dense
coding with two senders and a single receiver is performed and entanglement is
measured in the senders:receiver bipartition. The normalized frequency
distribution of DCC for randomly generated two-, three- and four-qubit density
matrices with global as well as local decodings at the receiver's end are
reported. The estimation of mean DCC for two-qubit states is found to be in
good agreement with the numerical simulations. Universally, we observe that the
performance of random states for dense coding as well as teleportation
decreases with the increase of the rank of states which we have shown to be
surmounted by the local pre-processing operations performed on the shared
states before starting the protocols, irrespective of the rank of the states.
The local pre-processing employed here is based on positive operator valued
measurements along with classical communication and we show that unlike dense
coding with two-qubit random states, senders' operations are always helpful to
probabilistically enhance the capabilities of implementing dense coding as well
as teleportation.

AdS/CFT, where the vacuum is described by a thermal density matrix, $\rho =
\frac{e^{-K}}{\mbox{Tr}(e^{-K})}$ with $K$ the modular Hamiltonian. In AdS/CFT,
both the expectation value of $K$ and its fluctuations $\langle \Delta K^2
\rangle$ have been calculated; both obey an area law identical to the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law of black hole mechanics: $\langle K \rangle =
\langle \Delta K^2 \rangle = \frac{A}{4 G_N}$, where $A$ is the area of an
(extremal) entangling surface. It has also been shown that $\Delta K$
gravitates in AdS, and hence generates metric fluctuations. These theoretical
results are intriguing, but it is not known how to precisely extend such ideas
about holographic quantum gravity to ordinary flat space. We take the approach
of considering whether experimental signatures in metric fluctuations could
determine properties of the vacuum of quantum gravity in flat space. In
particular, we propose a theoretical model motived by the AdS/CFT calculations
that reproduces the most important features of modular Hamiltonian
fluctuations; the model consists of a high occupation number bosonic degree of
freedom. We show that if this theory couples through ordinary gravitational
couplings to the mirrors in an interferometer with strain sensitivity similar
to what will be available for gravitational waves, vacuum fluctuations could be
observable.

alternative is to consider adaptive algorithms that ensure strong performance

This approach also leads to a game-theoretic analysis, but in the correlated
play that arises from joint learning dynamics rather than factored agent
behavior at equilibrium. We develop and advocate for this hindsight rationality

end, we re-examine mediated equilibrium and deviation types in extensive-form

strengths and weaknesses of each type of equilibrium in the literature, and
prove that no tractable concept subsumes all others. This line of inquiry
culminates in the definition of the deviation and equilibrium classes that
correspond to algorithms in the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR)
family, relating them to all others in the literature. Examining CFR in greater
detail further leads to a new recursive definition of rationality in correlated
play that extends sequential rationality in a way that naturally applies to
hindsight evaluation.

solutions are a family of explicit solutions to various Einstein-matter systems
that start out smooth but then develop a Big Bang singularity as $t \downarrow
0$, i.e., curvature blowup along a spacelike hypersurface. The family is
parameterized by the Kasner exponents $\widetilde{q}_1,\cdots,\widetilde{q}_D
\in \mathbb{R}$, which satisfy two algebraic constraints. There are heuristics
in the mathematical physics literature, going back more than 50 years,
suggesting that the Big Bang formation should be stable under perturbations of
the Kasner initial data, given say at $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace$, as long as the
exponents are ""sub-critical"" in the following sense:
$\mathop{\max_{I,J,B=1,\cdots,D}}_{I < J}
\{\widetilde{q}_I+\widetilde{q}_J-\widetilde{q}_B\}<1$. Previous works have
shown the stability of the singularity under stronger assumptions: 1) the
Einstein-scalar field system with $D = 3$ and $\widetilde{q}_1 \approx

equations for $D \geq 39$ with $\max_{I=1,\cdots,D} |\widetilde{q}_I| < 1/6$.
We prove that the Kasner singularity is dynamically stable for \emph{all}
sub-critical Kasner exponents, thereby justifying the heuristics in the full
regime where stable monotonic-type curvature blowup is expected. We treat the
$1+D$-dimensional Einstein-scalar field system for $D \geq3$ and the $1+D$
dimensional Einstein-vacuum equations for $D \geq 10$. Moreover, for the
Einstein-vacuum equations in $1+3$ dimensions, where instabilities are in
general expected, we prove that all singular Kasner solutions have stable Big
Bangs under polarized $U(1)$-symmetric perturbations of their initial data. Our
results hold for open sets of initial data in Sobolev spaces without symmetry,

globules are suitable objects for studying the physics of low-mass star
formation. To study the magnetic field of the prototypical Bok globule B335, we
obtained a spatially resolved polarization map with SOFIA/HAWC+ at a wavelength
of 214$\,\mu$m. For the first time, these observations reveal that polarization
holes in Bok globules, that is, the decrease in polarization degree towards
their dense centers, also occur in the far-infrared wavelength regime. The
observed polarization pattern is uniform with a mean polarization angle of
48$^\circ\pm $26$^\circ$ and a magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 142$\,\mu$G.
Moreover, we use complementary polarimetic data for B335 obtained at
near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths to analyze and constrain the magnetic
field across different scales. By applying the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative
transfer code POLARIS (Reissl et al. 2016), we developed a model for the
density and magnetic field structure as well as for the dust properties of this
globule. We conclude that the column density towards the center of B335 is too
low to cause the observed polarization hole in B335 via dichroic absorption
(Brauer et al. 2016). Furthermore, we conclude that the effect of
self-scattering has no significant impact on the observed polarization.
Adopting dust-grain alignment via the radiative torque mechanism, a combination
of the interstellar radiation field and the central star as radiation sources
is consistent with the decrease in polarization degree at the outer regions of
B335 ($\approx\,$10$^4\,$au from the core). However, the model fails to explain
the low polarization degree within the inner 5000 au.

detections in the current frame. To avoid matching with false positive
detections, prior work filters out detections with low confidence scores via a
threshold. However, finding a proper threshold is non-trivial, which requires
extensive manual search via ablation study. Also, this threshold is sensitive
to many factors such as target object category so we need to re-search the
threshold if these factors change. To ease this process, we propose to
automatically select high-quality detections and remove the efforts needed for
manual threshold search. Also, prior work often uses a single threshold per
data sequence, which is sub-optimal in particular frames or for certain
objects. Instead, we dynamically search threshold per frame or per object to
further boost performance. Through experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, our
method can filter out $45.7\%$ false positives while maintaining the recall,
achieving new S.O.T.A. performance and removing the need for manually threshold

Here, we fabricated Josephson Junctions (JJ) of K1-xV3Sb5 and induced
superconductivity over long junction lengths. Through magnetoresistance and
current vs. phase measurements, we observed magnetic field sweeping direction
dependent magnetoresistance, and an anisotropic interference pattern with a
Fraunhofer pattern for in-plane magnetic field, but a suppression of critical
current for out-of-plane magnetic field. These results indicate an anisotropic
internal magnetic field in K1-xV3Sb5 which influences the superconducting
coupling in the junction, possibly giving rise to spin-triplet
superconductivity. In addition, the observation of long-lived fast oscillations
shows evidence of spatially localized conducting channels arising from edge

Recent studies in big transfer (BiT) show that few-shot learning can greatly
benefit from pretraining on large scale labeled dataset in a different domain.
This paper asks a more challenging question: ""can we use as few as possible
labels for few-shot learning in both pretraining (with no labels) and
fine-tuning (with fewer labels)?"".
  Our key insight is that the clustering of target samples in the feature space
is all we need for few-shot finetuning. It explains why the vanilla
unsupervised pretraining (poor clustering) is worse than the supervised one. In
this paper, we propose transductive unsupervised pretraining that achieves a
better clustering by involving target data even though its amount is very
limited. The improved clustering result is of great value for identifying the
most representative samples (""eigen-samples"") for users to label, and in
return, continued finetuning with the labeled eigen-samples further improves
the clustering. Thus, we propose eigen-finetuning to enable fewer shot learning
by leveraging the co-evolution of clustering and eigen-samples in the
finetuning. We conduct experiments on 10 different few-shot target datasets,
and our average few-shot performance outperforms both vanilla inductive
unsupervised transfer and supervised transfer by a large margin. For instance,
when each target category only has 10 labeled samples, the mean accuracy gain
over the above two baselines is 9.2% and 3.42 respectively.

(SNIa) have propagated systematic uncertainties into a covariance matrix and
either binned or smoothed the systematic vectors in redshift space. We
demonstrate that systematic error budgets of these analyses can be improved by
a factor of $\sim1.5\times$ with the use of unbinned and unsmoothed covariance
matrices. To understand this, we employ a separate approach that simultaneously
fits for cosmological parameters and additional self-calibrating scale
parameters that constrain the size of each systematic. We show that the
covariance-matrix approach and scale-parameter approach yield equivalent
results, implying that in both cases the data can self-calibrate certain
systematic uncertainties, but that this ability is hindered when information is
binned or smoothed in redshift space. We review the top systematic
uncertainties in current analyses and find that the reduction of systematic
uncertainties in the unbinned case depends on whether a systematic is
consistent with varying the cosmological model and whether or not the
systematic can be described by additional correlations between SN properties
and luminosity. Furthermore, we show that the power of self-calibration
increases with the size of the dataset, which presents a tremendous opportunity
for upcoming analyses of photometrically classified samples, like those of
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope
(NGRST). However, to take advantage of self-calibration in large,
photometrically-classified samples, we must first address the issue that
binning is required in currently-used photometric methodologies.

in high-redshift astrophysics, but poorly understood. The Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) is a unique laboratory to study this because of its metallicity of
0.2 Zsol, its proximity, and because it is currently forming stars. We used a
spectral type catalog in combination with GAIA magnitudes to calculate
temperatures and luminosities of bright SMC stars. By comparing these with
literature studies, we tested the validity of our method, and using GAIA data,
we estimated the completeness of stars in the catalog as a function of
luminosity. This allowed us to obtain a nearly complete view of the most
luminous stars in the SMC. When then compared with stellar evolution
predictions. We also calculated the extinction distribution, the ionizing
photon production rate, and the star formation rate. Our results imply that the
SMS hosts only 30 very luminous main-sequence stars (M > 40 Msol; L > 10^5
Lsol), which are far fewer than expected from the number of stars in the
luminosity range 3*10^4 < L/Lsol < 3*10^5 and from the typically quoted star
formation rate in the SMC. Even more striking, we find that for masses above M
> 20 Msol, stars in the first half of their hydrogen-burning phase are almost
absent. This mirrors a qualitatively similar peculiarity that is known for the
Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud. This amounts to a lack of
hydrogen-burning counterparts of helium-burning stars, which is more pronounced
for higher luminosities. We argue that a declining star formation rate or a
steep initial mass function are unlikely to be the sole explanations for the
dearth of young bright stars. Instead, many of these stars might be embedded in
their birth clouds, although observational evidence for this is weak. We
discuss implications for cosmic reionization and the top end of the initial
mass function.

  Fractional vortices, $4e$ condensates or non-unitary pairing","9+2 pages, 1 Table",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When two graphene sheets are twisted relative to each other by a small angle,
enhanced correlations lead to superconductivity whose origin remains under
debate. Here, we derive some general constraints on superconductivity in
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), independent of its underlying mechanism.
Neglecting weak coupling between valleys, the global symmetry group of TBG
consists of independent spin rotations in each valley in addition to valley
charge rotations, $ {\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm U}_V(1) $. This
symmetry is further enhanced to a full ${\rm SU}(4)$ in the idealized chiral
limit. In both cases, we show that any charge $2e$ pairing must break the
global symmetry. Additionally, if the pairing is unitary the resulting
superconductor admits fractional vortices. This leads to the following general
statement: Any superconducting condensate in either symmetry class has to
satisfy one of three possibilities: (i) the superconducting pairing is
non-unitary, (ii) the superconducting condensate has charge $2e$ but admits at
least half quantum vortices which carry a flux of $h/4e$, or (iii) the
superconducting condensate has charge $2me$, $m>1$, with vortices carrying
$h/2me$ flux. The latter possibility can be realized by a symmetric charge $4e$
superconductor ($m=2$). Non-unitary pairing (i) is expected in TBG for
superconductors observed in the vicinity of flavor polarized states. On the
other hand, in the absence of flavor polarization, e.g. in the vicinity of
charge neutrality, one of the two exotic possibilities (ii) and (iii) is
expected. We sketch how all three scenarios can be realized in different limits
within a strong coupling theory of superconductivity based on skyrmions.
Finally we discuss the effect of symmetry lowering anisotropies and
experimental implications of these scenarios.

galaxy. Our model includes time-dependent gas chemistry, sink particles for
star formation and supernova feedback, meaning we are not reliant on star
formation recipes based on threshold densities and can follow the physics of
the cold molecular phase. We extract giant molecular clouds at a given timestep
of the simulations and analyse their properties. In the disc of our simulated
galaxies, spiral arms seem to act merely as snowplows, gathering gas and clouds
without dramatically affecting their properties. In the centre of the galaxy,
on the other hand, environmental conditions lead to larger, more massive
clouds. While the galaxy interaction has little effect on cloud masses and
sizes, it does promote the formation of counter-rotating clouds. We find that
the identified clouds seem to be largely gravitationally unbound at first
glance, but a closer analysis of the hierarchical structure of the molecular
interstellar medium shows that there is a large range of virial parameters with
a smooth transition from unbound to mostly bound for the densest structures.
The common observation that clouds appear to be virialised entities may
therefore be due to CO bright emission highlighting a specific level in this

rate, orbiting in the habitable zone close to a low-mass M dwarf. We take the

accelerated upon interaction with the wind, resulting in a diverse range of
planetary magnetosphere morphologies and plasma distributions as local stellar
wind conditions change. We consider the implications of the wind-outflow
interaction on potential hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) observations of the
planetary atmosphere during transits. The Lya observational signatures depend
strongly on the local wind conditions at the time of the observation and can be
subject to considerable variation on timescales as short as an hour. Our
results indicate that observed variations in exoplanet Lya transit signatures

currently developed for quantum computing are systems of coupled nonlinear
quantum resonators. A significant amount of intentional frequency detuning
(disorder) is required to protect individual qubit states against the
destabilizing effects of nonlinear resonator coupling. Here we investigate the
stability of this variant of a many-body localized (MBL) phase for system
parameters relevant to current quantum processors of two different types, those
using untunable qubits (IBM type) and those using tunable qubits (Delft/Google
type). Applying three independent diagnostics of localization theory -- a
Kullback-Leibler analysis of spectral statistics, statistics of many-body wave
functions (inverse participation ratios), and a Walsh transform of the
many-body spectrum -- we find that these computing platforms are dangerously
close to a phase of uncontrollable chaotic fluctuations.

Additionally, we reproduce a Herschel observation of the HD J=1-0 line flux,
the spectral energy distribution, and utilize a recent quantification of CO
radial depletion in TW Hya. These observations were modeled using the
thermochemical code RAC2D, and our best fit model reproduces all spatially
resolved CO surface brightness profiles. The resulting thermal profile finds a
disk mass of 0.025 Msun and a thin upper layer of gas depleted of small dust
with a thickness of approx 1.2% of the corresponding radius. Using our final
thermal structure, we find that CO alone is not a viable mass tracer as its
abundance is degenerate with the total H2 surface density. Different mass
models can readily match the spatially resolved CO line profiles with disparate
abundance assumptions. Mass determination requires additional knowledge and, in
this work, HD provides the additional constraint to derive the gas mass and
supports the inference of CO depletion in the TW Hya disk. Our final thermal
structure confirms the use of HD as a powerful probe of protoplanetary disk

fitting on all of our predefined performance metrics. In addition to accuracy,
the RF is extremely fast, able to compute joint PDFs for a million galaxies in
just under $6$ min with consumer computer hardware. Such speed enables PDFs to
be derived in real time within analysis codes, solving potential storage

  We design an algorithm for such a transition. We exploit the intimate
connection of separability and linear programming over bounded-shape partition
and transportation polytopes: separable clusterings lie on the boundary of
partition polytopes, form a subset of the vertices of the corresponding
transportation polytopes, and circuits of both polytopes are readily
interpreted as sequential or cyclical exchanges of items between clusters. This
allows for a natural approach to achieve the desired transition through a
combination of two walks: an edge walk between two so-called radial clusterings
in a transportation polytope, computed through an adaptation of classical tools
of sensitivity analysis and parametric programming; and a walk from a separable
clustering to a corresponding radial clustering, computed through a tailored,
iterative routine updating cluster sizes and re-optimizing the cluster
assignment of items.

the source of trace evidence, for instance, glass fragments found on a suspect

comparing the marginal distribution of measurements of trace evidence under two
competing propositions for whether or not the unknown source evidence
originated from a specific source. The obvious problem with such an approach is
the ability to tailor the prior distributions (placed on the
features/parameters of the statistical model for the measurements of trace
evidence) in favor of the defense or prosecution, which is further complicated
by the fact that the typical number of measurements of trace evidence is
typically sufficiently small that prior choice/specification has a strong

a peak of clustering pattern at ~250 pc scale compared to a Poisson process.
This clustering mainly occurs in regions where the galactocentric distance

allows us to resort to convex optimization to solve the convex conjugate for

solving an inverse-Hessian vector product using the conjugate gradient method.
The gradient estimator has constant-memory cost, and can be made effectively
unbiased by reducing the error tolerance level of the convex optimization

identify any desired protection logic without focusing on a specific syntactic
topology. The key is to leverage a well-trained graph neural network (GNN) to
identify all the gates in a given locked netlist that belong to the targeted
protection logic, without requiring an oracle. This approach fits perfectly
with the targeted problem since a circuit is a graph with an inherent structure
and the protection logic is a sub-graph of nodes (gates) with specific and
common characteristics. GNNs are powerful in capturing the nodes' neighborhood
properties, facilitating the detection of the protection logic. To rectify any
misclassifications induced by the GNN, we additionally propose a connectivity
analysis-based post-processing algorithm to successfully remove the predicted
protection logic, thereby retrieving the original design. Our extensive
experimental evaluation demonstrates that GNNUnlock is 99.24%-100% successful
in breaking various benchmarks locked using stripped-functionality logic
locking, tenacious and traceless logic locking, and Anti-SAT. Our proposed
post-processing enhances the detection accuracy, reaching 100% for all of our
tested locked benchmarks. Analysis of the results corroborates that GNNUnlock
is powerful enough to break the considered schemes under different parameters,
synthesis settings, and technology nodes. The evaluation further shows that
GNNUnlock successfully breaks corner cases where even the most advanced
state-of-the-art attacks fail.

$j=1,\ldots,\cal J$, where the distributions $G_j$ are assumed to form a random
sample generated by some common source. In particular, the $D_j$'s have a
common set of covariates and they are all labeled. The training set is used by
the analyst for selection of subsets of covariates denoted by ${P}^*(n)$, whose
role is described next. The multi-task problem we consider is as follows: given
a number of random labeled datasets (which may be in the training set or not)
$D_{J_k}$ of size $n_k$, $k=1,\ldots,K$, estimate separately for each dataset
the regression coefficients on the subset of covariates ${P}^*(n_k)$ and then
predict future dependent variables given their covariates. Naturally, a large
sample size $n_k$ of $D_{J_k}$ allows a larger subset of covariates, and the
dependence of the size of the selected covariate subsets on $n_k$ is needed in
order to achieve good prediction and avoid overfitting. Subset selection is
notoriously difficult and computationally demanding, and requires large
samples; using all the regression datasets in the training set together amounts
to borrowing strength toward better selection under suitable assumptions.
Furthermore, using common subsets for all regressions having a given sample
size standardizes and simplifies the data collection and avoids having to
select and use a different subset for each prediction task. Our approach is
efficient when the relevant covariates for prediction are common to the
different regressions, while the models' coefficients may vary between
different regressions.

superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerator cavities. Factors influencing
RSF value measurements were investigated with the aim of reliably attaining
better than 10% accuracy in N concentrations at various depths into the bulk.
This has been accomplished for materials typical of SRF cavities at the cost of
great attention to all aspects.

  Transactions on Signal Processing",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying the topology that underlies a set of time series is useful for
tasks such as prediction, denoising, and data completion. Vector autoregressive
(VAR) model-based topologies capture dependencies among time series, and are
often inferred from observed spatio-temporal data. When the data are affected
by noise and/or missing samples, the tasks of topology identification and
signal recovery (reconstruction) have to be performed jointly. Additional
challenges arise when i) the underlying topology is time-varying, ii) data
become available sequentially, and iii) no delay is tolerated. To overcome
these challenges, this paper proposes two online algorithms to estimate the VAR
model-based topologies. The proposed algorithms have constant complexity per
iteration, which makes them interesting for big data scenarios. They also enjoy
complementary merits in terms of complexity and performance. The inexact
proximal online gradient descent framework is used to derive a performance
guarantee for the most competitive proposed algorithm in the form of a dynamic
regret bound. Numerical tests are also presented, showcasing the ability of the
proposed algorithms to track the time-varying topologies with missing data in
an online fashion.

pore features have proven to be usable for fingerprint recognition. Although
features from minutiae and ridge patterns are quite attainable from
low-resolution images, using pore features is practical only if the fingerprint
image is of high resolution which necessitates a model that enhances the image
quality of the conventional 500 ppi legacy fingerprints preserving the fine
details. To find a solution for recovering pore information from low-resolution
fingerprints, we adopt a joint learning-based approach that combines both
super-resolution and pore detection networks. Our modified single image
Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) framework helps to
reliably reconstruct high-resolution fingerprint samples from low-resolution
ones assisting the pore detection network to identify pores with a high
accuracy. The network jointly learns a distinctive feature representation from
a real low-resolution fingerprint sample and successfully synthesizes a
high-resolution sample from it. To add discriminative information and
uniqueness for all the subjects, we have integrated features extracted from a
deep fingerprint verifier with the SRGAN quality discriminator. We also add
ridge reconstruction loss, utilizing ridge patterns to make the best use of
extracted features. Our proposed method solves the recognition problem by
improving the quality of fingerprint images. High recognition accuracy of the
synthesized samples that is close to the accuracy achieved using the original
high-resolution images validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

and includes a non-convex objective function which is a multivariate sixth
degree polynomial and a has convex feasibility set. It has a special importance
in data science, since it serves as a mathematical model for the fusion of
different data sources in data clustering.
  We develop four methods to solve the SNMTF. They are based on four
theoretical approaches known from the literature: the fixed point method (FPM),
the block-coordinate descent with projected gradient (BCD), the gradient method
with exact line search (GM-ELS) and the adaptive moment estimation method
(ADAM). For each of these methods we offer a software implementation: for the
former two methods we use Matlab and for the latter Python with the TensorFlow
library.
  We test these methods on three data-sets: the synthetic data-set we
generated, while the others represent real-life similarities between different
objects.
  Extensive numerical results show that with sufficient computing time all four
methods perform satisfactorily and ADAM most often yields the best mean square
error ($\mathrm{MSE}$). However, if the computation time is limited, FPM gives
the best $\mathrm{MSE}$ because it shows the fastest convergence at the
beginning.

sliding surface of the SMC are designed through the proposed tuning algorithm
to suppress the structural vibrations by minimizing either the top floor
displacement or the control force applied to the ATMD. Moreover, the tuning
algorithm selects the SMC parameters to guarantee the following closed-loop
characteristics: 1) the transient responses of the structure and the ATMD are
sufficiently fast and damped; and 2) the control force, as well as the
displacements and velocities of the building and ATMD are within acceptable
limits under the frequency band of the earthquake excitation. The proposed SMC
shows robustness against the unmodeled dynamics such as the friction of the
damper. Experimental results on a reduced scale structure permits demonstrating
the efficiency of the tuning algorithm for the SMC, which is compared with the
traditional Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and with the Optimal Sliding Mode
Controller (OSMC).

transforming as complete Pati-Salam multiplets. These can lower the scales of
Pati-Salam breaking through mass-mixing within the charged-lepton and
down-quark sectors, leading to a helicity suppression of the meson decay widths
which constrain Pati-Salam breaking. We find four multiplets with varying
degrees of viability for this purpose: an $SU(2)_{L/R}$ bidoublet, a pair of
$SU(4)$ decuplets and either a $SU(2)_L$ or $SU(2)_R$ triplet all of which
contain heavy exotic versions of the SM charged leptons. We find that the
Pati-Salam limits can be as low as $\mathcal{O}(5-150)$ TeV with the addition
of these four multiplets. We also identify an interesting possible connection
between the smallness of the neutrino masses and a helicity suppression of the
Pati-Salam limits for three of the four multiplets.

graph pooling neural networks (HGPNNs) which are effective graph representation
learning approaches for graph level tasks such as graph classification.
However, current HGPNNs do not take full advantage of the graph's intrinsic

new interpretable graph pooling framework - CommPOOL, that can capture and

inherent community structure of graphs in an interpretable manner. CommPOOL is
a general and flexible framework for hierarchical graph representation learning
that can further facilitate various graph-level tasks. Evaluations on five

pave the way for new experimental demonstrations of such hybrid
classical-quantum protocols allowing to evaluate the potential advantages over

providing a new diagnostic tool for classifying atypical heartbeats. The
algorithm is evaluated on a dataset retroactively collected from 14 patients.
Correlation coefficients calculated between the reconstructed and the actual

superior way to synthesize a 12-lead ECG. We can also achieve the same
reconstruction accuracy with only one EGM lead as input. We also tested the

EGM signals from a 12-lead ECG and found that the correlation was comparable to
the forward direction. Lastly, we analyzed the features learned in the model

neural networks (CNNs). Both architectures exploit weight sparsity and
compression to reduce computational complexity and bandwidth. The first
architecture uses multiply-accumulators (MACs) but avoids unnecessary
multiplications by skipping zero weights. The second architecture exploits
weight sparsity at the level of their bit representation by substituting
resource-intensive MACs with much smaller Bit Layer Multiply Accumulators
(BLMACs). The use of BLMACs also allows variable precision weights as variable
size integers and even floating points. Some details of an implementation of
the second architecture are given. Weight compression with arithmetic coding is
also discussed as well as bandwidth implications. Finally, some implementation
results for a pathfinder design and various technologies are presented.

mainly focus on pursuing high network accuracy. However, those methods overlook
the gap between network accuracy and prediction confidence, known as the
confidence uncalibration problem. Thus, state-of-the-art SOD networks are prone
to be overconfident. In other words, the predicted confidence of the networks
does not reflect the real probability of correctness of salient object
detection, which significantly hinder their real-world applicability. In this
paper, we introduce an uncertaintyaware deep SOD network, and propose two
strategies from different perspectives to prevent deep SOD networks from being
overconfident. The first strategy, namely Boundary Distribution Smoothing
(BDS), generates continuous labels by smoothing the original binary
ground-truth with respect to pixel-wise uncertainty. The second strategy,
namely Uncertainty-Aware Temperature Scaling (UATS), exploits a relaxed Sigmoid
function during both training and testing with spatially-variant temperature
scaling to produce softened output. Both strategies can be incorporated into
existing deep SOD networks with minimal efforts. Moreover, we propose a new
saliency evaluation metric, namely dense calibration measure C, to measure how
the model is calibrated on a given dataset. Extensive experimental results on
seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solutions can not only better
calibrate SOD models, but also improve the network accuracy.

multiple users on a shared pool of computing resources. This enables serverless
cloud providers to reduce their resource usage by transparently aggregate
similar tasks of a certain context (e.g., video processing) that share the
whole or part of their computation. To this end, it is crucial to know the
amount of time-saving achieved by aggregating the tasks. Lack of such knowledge
can lead to uninformed merging and scheduling decisions that, in turn, can
cause deadline violation of either the merged tasks or other following tasks.
Accordingly, in this paper, we study the problem of estimating execution-time
saving resulted from merging tasks with the example in the context of video
processing. To learn the execution-time saving in different forms of merging,
we first establish a set of benchmarking videos and examine a wide variety of
video processing tasks -- with and without merging in place. We observed that
although merging can save up to 44% in the execution-time, the number of
possible merging cases is intractable. Hence, in the second part, we leverage
the benchmarking results and develop a method based on Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree (GBDT) to estimate the time-saving for any given task merging
case. Experimental results show that the method can estimate the time-saving
with the error rate of 0.04, measured based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

enhance both the dexterity and payload capability of robotic manipulators. A
common way to manipulate heavy objects beyond the payload capability of a robot
is to use a sequence of pivoting motions, wherein, an object is moved while
some contact points between the object and a support surface are kept fixed.
The goal of this paper is to develop an algorithmic approach for automated plan
generation for object manipulation with a sequence of pivoting motions. A plan
for manipulating a heavy object consists of a sequence of joint angles of the
manipulator, the corresponding object poses, as well as the joint torques
required to move the object. The constraint of maintaining object contact with
the ground during manipulation results in nonlinear constraints in the
configuration space of the robot, which is challenging for motion planning
algorithms. Exploiting the fact that pivoting motion corresponds to movements
in a subgroup of the group of rigid body motions, SE(3), we present a novel
task-space based planning approach for computing a motion plan for both the
manipulator and the object while satisfying contact constraints. We also
combine our motion planning algorithm with a grasping force synthesis algorithm
to ensure that friction constraints at the contacts and actuator torque
constraints are satisfied. We present simulation results with a dual-armed
Baxter robot to demonstrate our approach.

outputs the weights of the c2g-network for a given input workspace. Both
networks are trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion using costs computed
from traditional motion planners. Once trained, c2g-HOF can generate a smooth
and continuous cost-to-go function directly from workspace sensor inputs
(represented as a point cloud in 3D or an image in 2D). At inference time, the
weights of the c2g-network are computed very efficiently and near-optimal
trajectories are generated by simply following the gradient of the cost-to-go
function. We compare c2g-HOF with traditional planning algorithms for various
robots and planning scenarios. The experimental results indicate that planning
with c2g-HOF is significantly faster than other motion planning algorithms,
resulting in orders of magnitude improvement when including collision checking.
Furthermore, despite being trained from sparsely sampled trajectories in
configuration space, c2g-HOF generalizes to generate smoother, and often lower

Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs), are a powerful class of adversarial attacks
which create adversarial perturbations that can generalize across a large set
of inputs. In this work, we analyze the effect of various compression
techniques to UAP attacks, including different forms of pruning and
quantization. We test the robustness of compressed models to white-box and
transfer attacks, comparing them with their uncompressed counterparts on
CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Our evaluations reveal clear differences between
pruning methods, including Soft Filter and Post-training Pruning. We observe
that UAP transfer attacks between pruned and full models are limited,
suggesting that the systemic vulnerabilities across these models are different.
This finding has practical implications as using different compression

that, in some scenarios, quantization can produce gradient-masking, giving a
false sense of security. Finally, our results suggest that conclusions about
the robustness of compressed models to UAP attacks is application dependent,

underpinning quantum batteries. Here we implement experimentally a paradigmatic

Unlike classical bits, which are susceptible to only one type of error, quantum
bits (""qubits"") are susceptible to two types of error, corresponding to flips
of the qubit state about the $X$- and $Z$-directions. While the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle precludes simultaneous monitoring of $X$- and $Z$-flips
on a single qubit, it is possible to encode quantum information in large arrays
of entangled qubits that enable accurate monitoring of all errors in the
system, provided the error rate is low. Another crucial requirement is that
errors cannot be correlated. Here, we characterize a superconducting multiqubit
circuit and find that charge fluctuations are highly correlated on a length
scale over 600~$\mu$m; moreover, discrete charge jumps are accompanied by a
strong transient suppression of qubit energy relaxation time across the
millimeter-scale chip. The resulting correlated errors are explained in terms
of the charging event and phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning associated
with absorption of gamma rays and cosmic-ray muons in the qubit substrate.
Robust quantum error correction will require the development of mitigation
strategies to protect multiqubit arrays from correlated errors due to particle
impacts.

error tend toward underestimation, so the true populations are likely larger.
We find the distribution of $H$ magnitudes steepens for NEOs fainter than $H
\sim 22.5$, making small asteroids more common than extrapolation from brighter
$H$ mags would predict. Our simulation indicates a strong bias against
detecting small but dangerous asteroids that encounter Earth with high relative
velocities -- i.e., asteroids in highly inclined and/or eccentric orbits.
Worldwide NEO discovery statistics indicate this bias affects global NEO
detection capability, to the point that an observational census of small
asteroids in such orbits is probably not currently feasible. Prompt and
aggressive followup of NEO candidates, combined with closer collaborations
between segments of the global NEO community, can increase detection rates for
these dangerous objects.

This lack of robustness also appears in the vulnerability of AI systems to

manifold learning is performed as an auxiliary task. The auxiliary task
constrains the weights of the network so it can be considered as a regularizer,
improving the main task and reducing over-fitting. Experimental results

problem of slow or failed worker nodes (called stragglers) which can dominate
the overall job execution time. Coded computation utilizes concepts from
erasure coding to mitigate the effect of stragglers by running 'coded' copies
of tasks comprising a job; stragglers are typically treated as erasures. While
this is useful, there are issues with applying, e.g., MDS codes in a
straightforward manner. Several practical matrix computation scenarios involve
sparse matrices. MDS codes typically require dense linear combinations of
submatrices of the original matrices which destroy their inherent sparsity.
This is problematic as it results in significantly higher worker computation
times. Moreover, treating slow nodes as erasures ignores the potentially useful
partial computations performed by them. Furthermore, some MDS techniques also
suffer from significant numerical stability issues. In this work we present
schemes that allow us to leverage partial computation by stragglers while
imposing constraints on the level of coding that is required in generating the

adaptive submodular meta-learning problem. The input of our problem is a set of
items, where each item has a random state which is initially unknown. The only
way to observe an item's state is to select that item. Our objective is to
adaptively select a group of items that achieve the best performance over a set
of tasks, where each task is represented as an adaptive submodular function
that maps sets of items and their states to a real number. To reduce the
computational cost while maintaining a personalized solution for each future

method (WST-LSPG) for model reduction of nonlinear parameterized dynamical

Petrov-Galerkin method (ST-LSPG). The main drawback of ST-LSPG is that it
requires solving a dense space-time system with a space-time basis that is
calculated over the entire global time domain, which can be unfeasible for
large-scale applications. Instead of using a temporally-global space-time trial
subspace and minimizing the discrete-in-time full-order model (FOM) residual
over an entire time domain, the proposed WST-LSPG approach addresses this
weakness by (1) dividing the time simulation into time windows, (2) devising a
unique low-dimensional space-time trial subspace for each window, and (3)
minimizing the discrete-in-time space-time residual of the dynamical system
over each window. This formulation yields a problem with coupling confined
within each window, but sequential across the windows. To enable high-fidelity
trial subspaces characterized by a relatively minimal number of basis vectors,
this work proposes constructing space-time bases using tensor decompositions
for each window. WST-LSPG is equipped with hyper-reduction techniques to
further reduce the computational cost. Numerical experiments for the
one-dimensional Burgers' equation and the two-dimensional compressible
Navier-Stokes equations for flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil demonstrate that
WST-LSPG is superior to ST-LSPG in terms of accuracy and computational gain.

states may exhibit either weak localization or antilocalization depending on
the strength of the spin-orbit coupling, which have finite return probability

task in computational science. Recently, machine learning with Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising tool for scientific computing, with
impressive results achieved on problems where the dimension of the data or
problem domain is large. This work broadens this perspective, focusing on
approximating functions that are Hilbert-valued, i.e. take values in a
separable, but typically infinite-dimensional, Hilbert space. This arises in
science and engineering problems, in particular those involving solution of
parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Such problems are
challenging: 1) pointwise samples are expensive to acquire, 2) the function
domain is high dimensional, and 3) the range lies in a Hilbert space. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we present a novel result on DNN training for
holomorphic functions with so-called hidden anisotropy. This result introduces
a DNN training procedure and full theoretical analysis with explicit guarantees
on error and sample complexity. The error bound is explicit in three key errors
occurring in the approximation procedure: the best approximation, measurement,
and physical discretization errors. Our result shows that there exists a
procedure (albeit non-standard) for learning Hilbert-valued functions via DNNs
that performs as well as, but no better than current best-in-class schemes. It
gives a benchmark lower bound for how well DNNs can perform on such problems.
Second, we examine whether better performance can be achieved in practice
through different types of architectures and training. We provide preliminary
numerical results illustrating practical performance of DNNs on parametric
PDEs. We consider different parameters, modifying the DNN architecture to
achieve better and competitive results, comparing these to current
best-in-class schemes.

orders of magnitude difference in the thermal Hall conductivity between

temperature ranges, the magnitude of thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$)
in $SrTi^{18}O_3$ is proportional to the magnitude of the longitudinal thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_{xx}$), which suggests a phonon-mediated thermal Hall
effect. However, they deviate in the temperature of their maxima, and the
thermal Hall angle ratio ($|\kappa_{xy}/\kappa_{xx}|$) shows anomalously
decreasing behavior below the ferroelectric Curie temperature $T_c$ ~$25 K$.
This observation suggests a new underlying mechanism, as the conventional
scenario cannot explain such differences within the slight change in phonon
spectrum. Notably, the difference in magnitude of thermal Hall conductivity and
rapidly decreasing thermal Hall angle ratio in $SrTi^{18}O_3$ is correlated
with the strength of quantum critical fluctuations in this displacive
ferroelectric. This relation points to a link between the quantum critical
physics of strontium titanate and its thermal Hall effect, a possible clue to
explain this example of an exotic phenomenon in non-magnetic insulating
systems.

building a correct crash-consistent program remains very challenging in the

bug detector for NVM software, that is (1) scalable -- does not suffer from
test space explosion, (2) automatic -- does not require manual source code
annotations, and (3) precise -- does not produce false positives. WITCHER first
infers a set of ""likely invariants"" that are believed to be true to be crash
consistent by analyzing source codes and NVM access traces. WITCHER
automatically composes NVM images that simulate those potentially inconsistent
(crashing) states violating the likely invariants. Then WITCHER performs
""output equivalence checking"" by comparing the output of program executions
with and without a simulated crash. It validates if a likely invariant
violation under test is a true crash consistency bug. Evaluation with ten
persistent data structures, two real-world servers, and five example codes in
Intel's PMDK library shows that WITCHER outperforms state-of-the-art tools.
WITCHER discovers 37 (32 new) crash consistency bugs, which were all confirmed.

there is an additional contribution to the energy loss due to induction of the

lose energy mostly in the form of the \emph{chiral} Cherenkov radiation. We
employ classical electrodynamics, adequate in a wide range of particle

causal inference about treatment effects is the ignorable treatment assignment.
Violations of the ignorability assumption may lead to biased treatment effect

altered in response to the potential magnitude of departure from the
ignorability assumption. However, sensitivity analysis approaches for
unmeasured confounding in the context of multiple treatments and binary
outcomes are scarce. We propose a flexible Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis

theoretical properties uniquely relevant to multiple treatments. We then
propose methods to encode the impact of unmeasured confounding on potential
outcomes and adjust the estimates of causal effects in which the presumed
unmeasured confounding is removed. Our proposed methods embed nested multiple
imputation within the Bayesian framework, which allow for seamless integration
of the uncertainty about the values of the sensitivity parameters and the
sampling variability, as well as use of the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
for modeling flexibility. Expansive simulations validate our methods and gain
insight into sensitivity analysis with multiple treatments. We use the
SEER-Medicare data to demonstrate sensitivity analysis using three treatments
for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The methods developed in this work
are readily available in the R package SAMTx.

linearization of the Monge-Ampere equation from the perspective of gradient
flows in measure spaces leads to a stochastic McKean-Vlasov equation. We use
the forward Euler method to solve this equation. The resulting forward Euler
map pushes forward a reference distribution to the target. This map is the
composition of a sequence of simple residual maps, which are computationally
stable and easy to train. The key task in training is the estimation of the
density ratios or differences that determine the residual maps. We estimate the
density ratios (differences) based on the Bregman divergence with a gradient
penalty using deep density-ratio (difference) fitting. We show that the
proposed density-ratio (difference) estimators do not suffer from the ""curse of

We show that after a short propagation distance, an asymmetric electron beam

QECD framework is based on a quantum feature map for representing classical
states by density operators on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, $\mathcal H

under the lifted action of Koopman evolution operators of the classical system.
Moreover, by virtue of the reproducing property of $\mathcal H$, the quantum
system is pointwise-consistent with the underlying classical dynamics. To
achieve an exponential quantum computational advantage, we project the state of
the quantum system to a density matrix on a $2^n$-dimensional tensor product
Hilbert space associated with $n$ qubits. By employing discrete Fourier-Walsh
transforms, the evolution operator of the finite-dimensional quantum system is
factorized into tensor product form, enabling implementation through a quantum

criterion for estimating the ideal strength and fracture strength of materials
depending on whether the materials contain cracks or not. A Griffith strength
limit of ~E/9 is the upper bound for ideal strengths of materials. With the
improved quality of fabricated samples and the power of computational modeling,
people have recently reported the possibility of exceeding the ideal strength
predicted by the Griffith theory. In this study, a new strength criterion was
established based on the stable analysis of thermodynamical systems; then
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) is used to study the ideal
strength of four materials (diamond, c-BN, Cu, and CeO2) under uniaxial tensile
loading along the [100], [110], and [111] low-index crystallographic
directions. By comparing the ideal strengths between DFT results and the
Griffith theory, it is found that the Griffith theory fails in all the four
materials. Further analysis of the fracture mechanism demonstrates that the
failure of the Griffith theory is because the ideal strength point does not
correspond to creating of new surfaces, which is against the Griffith
assumption that the crack intrinsically exists all the time; the failure point
corresponds to the crack at the start of propagation.

connectivity of communications due to its sensitivity to the presence of
blockages. In order to improve the robustness of the mmWave system under the
presence of the random blockages, multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) are deployed to enhance the spatial diversity gain, and robust
beamforming is then designed based on a stochastic optimization for minimizing
the maximum outage probability among multiple users to ensure the fairness.
Under the stochastic optimization framework, we adopt the stochastic
majorization--minimization (SMM) method and the stochastic successive convex
approximation (SSCA) method to construct deterministic surrogate problems at
each iteration for new channel realizations, and obtain the closed-form
solutions of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the passive
beamforming vectors at the RISs. Both stochastic optimization methods have been
proved to converge to the set of stationary points of the original stochastic
problems. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed robust beamforming
in the RIS-aided system can effectively compensate for the performance loss
caused by the presence of the random blockages, especially at high blockage
probability, compared with the benchmark solutions.

isolating these rhythms and the ability to differentiate between them,
indispensable. Computer aided diagnosis systems are ubiquitous nowadays in

adversarial perturbations. Such vulnerability to adversarial attacks
significantly decreases the stability of GCNs when being applied to
security-critical applications. Defense methods such as preprocessing,
attention mechanism and adversarial training have been discussed by various
studies. While being able to achieve desirable performance when the
perturbation rates are low, such methods are still vulnerable to high
perturbation rates. Meanwhile, some defending algorithms perform poorly when
the node features are not visible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
mechanism called influence mechanism, which is able to enhance the robustness
of the GCNs significantly. The influence mechanism divides the effect of each
node into two parts: introverted influence which tries to maintain its own
features and extroverted influence which exerts influences on other nodes.
Utilizing the influence mechanism, we propose the Influence GCN (I-GCN) model.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed model is able to achieve higher
accuracy rates than state-of-the-art methods when defending against

core for graph embeddings. Accordingly, a multi-self-supervised auto-encoder is
designed to fulfill two pretext tasks, to reconstruct the feature distribution
for respective pairs and their surrounding context. PairE has three major
advantages: 1) Informative, embedding beyond node-view are capable to preserve
richer information of the graph; 2) Simple, the solutions provided by PairE are
time-saving, storage-efficient, and require the fewer hyper-parameters; 3) High
adaptability, with the introduced translator operator to map pair embeddings to
the node embeddings, PairE can be effectively used in both the link-based and
the node-based graph analysis. Experiment results show that PairE consistently
outperforms the state of baselines in all four downstream tasks, especially

behaviors, such as decoherence, non-unitary evolution, dissipation, etc. It is
interesting but still challenging to study the open quantum gravitation system
interacting with the environments. In this work, we develop a general
parameterized theoretical framework for the open quantum gravitation system.
Under the Born-Markov approximation, we derived the quantum master equation
with a new method which determines the evolution for certain types of open
quantum gravitation system. Finally, we studied a specific model where the real
scalar field plays the role of the environment and the spacetime is assumed to
be homogeneous and isotropic. We quantize the spacetime through the loop
quantum gravity. We show that the scalar field can induce the quantum geometry
in the equilibrium state when the scalar field is under the thermal
equilibrium. For the non-steady state, the quantum geometry flux emerges. We
point out that the quantum geometry flux and the coherence can drive the
evolution of the spacetime geometry. This provides us a new view on the
evolution of the spacetime geometry. Our results shown that the coherence of
the spacetime monotonically decreases as the temperature of the bath decreases.
This indicates that a classical cold universe can emerge from an initial hot
quantum universe. We found in this model that the entanglement entropy of the
gravitation system is related to the average volume of the space. We take the
continuous limit for studying the loop quantum cosmology and approximately
obtain a tunneling probability of the spacetime from the zero volume state to
the finite volume state.

on certified lower bound and Jacobian norm bound. Then we search for robust
architectures by maximizing the robustness metrics. Different from previous
approaches which aim to improve architectures' robustness in an implicit way:
performing adversarial training and injecting random noise, our methods
explicitly and directly maximize robustness metrics to harvest robust
architectures. On CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MNIST, we perform game-based
evaluation and verification-based evaluation on the robustness of our methods.
The experimental results show that our methods 1) are more robust to various
norm-bound attacks than several robust NAS baselines; 2) are more accurate than
baselines when there are no attacks; 3) have significantly higher certified
lower bounds than baselines.

a new variational model that extends the recurrent network in two ways for the

modules including the recurrent model for future frame prediction, inputting
and outputting a sequence of video frames at each timestep. This enables us to
better exploit spatiotemporal information inside the variational recurrent
model, allowing us to generate high-quality predictions. Second, we enhance the
latent loss of the variational model by introducing a maximum likelihood
estimate in addition to the KL divergence that is commonly used in variational
models. This simple extension acts as a stronger regularizer in the variational
autoencoder loss function and lets us obtain better results and
generalizability. Experiments show that our model outperforms existing video

noise, uncorrelated in space and time, in the forcing terms of the coupled

topography and bathymetry, land cover classification, tidal potential

around five meters rushing at four meters per second near Tacloban City
downtown. Underestimation of simulated surge height is expected with use of
bare earth model and absence of fluid sources on the governing equations, while
overestimation of simulated peak height also occurs due to presence of concrete
barriers that reduced surge height and inundation extent. The stochastic model
is sensitive to random external forces during low tide and relatively higher
fluid speed. Low tide happens when the fluid speed is maximum and water
elevation is lowest, while higher fluid speed is brought by external forces
like storm surge. However, the difference of stochastic solutions from the
deterministic solution averages to zero and there is no significant improvement
of the storm surge model in general when it comes to additive noise. This is an
expected result since the noise used has zero mean. As $\alpha$ goes to zero
larger jumps occur more frequently so $\sigma$ needs to be as small as
$10^{-8}$ for simulation stability.

learns the dominant patterns from the decoded LBP is proposed for color images

represents the color similarity between image channels for describing a color

the LBP feature maps correspond to each color channel of RSS traditional RGB
spaces, is employed for feature extraction. Finally, a feature learning
strategy is employed to learn the dominant color-related patterns for reducing
the dimension of feature vector and further improving the discriminatively of
features. The theoretic analysis show that the proposed RSS can provide more
discriminative information, and has higher noise robustness as well as higher
illumination variation robustness than traditional RGB space. Experimental
results on four groups, totally twelve public color image datasets show that
the proposed method outperforms most of the LBP variants for color image
recognition in terms of dimension of features, recognition accuracy under

two key components. The first one is a new learning objective, which guides the

engineering fields. However, it remains difficult for a model to simultaneously
utilize domain knowledge and experimental observation data. The application of
knowledge-based symbolic AI represented by an expert system is limited by the
expressive ability of the model, and data-driven connectionism AI represented
by neural networks is prone to produce predictions that violate physical
mechanisms. In order to fully integrate domain knowledge with observations, and
make full use of the prior information and the strong fitting ability of neural
networks, this study proposes theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP).
This model converts physical constraints, such as governing equations, into a
form that is easy to handle through discretization, and then implements hard
constraint optimization through projection. Based on rigorous mathematical
proofs, theory-guided HCP can ensure that model predictions strictly conform to
physical mechanisms in the constraint patch. The performance of the
theory-guided HCP is verified by experiments based on the heterogeneous
subsurface flow problem. Due to the application of hard constraints, compared
with fully connected neural networks and soft constraint models, such as
theory-guided neural networks and physics-informed neural networks,
theory-guided HCP requires fewer data, and achieves higher prediction accuracy
and stronger robustness to noisy observations.

  Clustering","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Superpixel segmentation aims at dividing the input image into some
representative regions containing pixels with similar and consistent intrinsic
properties, without any prior knowledge about the shape and size of each
superpixel. In this paper, to alleviate the limitation of superpixel
segmentation applied in practical industrial tasks that detailed boundaries are
difficult to be kept, we regard each representative region with independent
semantic information as a subspace, and correspondingly formulate superpixel
segmentation as a subspace clustering problem to preserve more detailed content
boundaries. We show that a simple integration of superpixel segmentation with
the conventional subspace clustering does not effectively work due to the
spatial correlation of the pixels within a superpixel, which may lead to
boundary confusion and segmentation error when the correlation is ignored.
Consequently, we devise a spatial regularization and propose a novel convex
locality-constrained subspace clustering model that is able to constrain the
spatial adjacent pixels with similar attributes to be clustered into a
superpixel and generate the content-aware superpixels with more detailed
boundaries. Finally, the proposed model is solved by an efficient alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solver. Experiments on different
standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared with some
state-of-the-art methods.

teacher model to a small student model, has been widely used to compress the
BERT model recently. Besides the supervision in the output in the original KD,
recent works show that layer-level supervision is crucial to the performance of
the student BERT model. However, previous works designed the layer mapping
strategy heuristically (e.g., uniform or last-layer), which can lead to
inferior performance. In this paper, we propose to use the genetic algorithm
(GA) to search for the optimal layer mapping automatically. To accelerate the
search process, we further propose a proxy setting where a small portion of the
training corpus are sampled for distillation, and three representative tasks
are chosen for evaluation. After obtaining the optimal layer mapping, we
perform the task-agnostic BERT distillation with it on the whole corpus to
build a compact student model, which can be directly fine-tuned on downstream
tasks. Comprehensive experiments on the evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that
1) layer mapping strategy has a significant effect on task-agnostic BERT
distillation and different layer mappings can result in quite different
performances; 2) the optimal layer mapping strategy from the proposed search
process consistently outperforms the other heuristic ones; 3) with the optimal
layer mapping, our student model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the

connections, facial expressions etc.) which is essential for effectively
communicating information. We use this observation to formalize a novel

prediction based on these might result in unfair outcome). We incorporate the
HEM metric into the loss function of a neural network with the goal to reduce
unfairness in rating predictions with respect to race and gender. Our results
show that the modified loss function improves fairness in prediction without

of small/intermediate/large black hole (SBH/IBH/LBH) phase transition with one
tricritical and two critical points in the available parameter region for
\alpha and \beta. This behavior is reminiscent of the solid/liquid/gas phase
transition.

($\nu_\mu + A \to \nu_\mu +1\pi^0 / \gamma + X$) on carbon nucleus (A=12). Our
conclusion is based on experimental data for photon-nucleus interactions from
the A2 collaboration at the Mainz MAMI accelerator. We work in the
approximation that decays of the intermediate states (non-resonant N, $\Delta$
resonance, higher resonances) unaffected by its production channel, via photon
or Z boson. $1\pi^0+X$ production scales as A$^{2/3}$, the surface area of the
nucleus. Meanwhile the photons incoherently created in intermediate states
decays will leave the nucleus, and that cross section will be proportional to
the atomic number of the nucleus. We also took into account the coherent
emission of photons. We show that the new photon background can explain part of
the MiniBooNE low-energy excess, thus significantly lowering the number of
unexplained MiniBooNE electron-like events from $5.1\sigma$ to $3.6\sigma$.

Accelerated convergence with respect to the local fragment size can be observed

introduced embedding approach, we calculate adsorption energies of molecules on
a surface and in a chabazite crystal cage, as well as the formation energy of a

cross-entropy on the labeled support pixels; ii) the Shannon entropy of the
posteriors on the unlabeled query-image pixels; and iii) a global KL-divergence

both compounds with additional 3rd nearest-neighbor interaction. Our best-fit

is a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual

a saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining
features from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is
conceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does
not use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual
saliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and
six audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC,
SIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first
network to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by
augmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient
training, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same
output irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar
behaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \cite{tsiami2020stavis} for
audio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on
deep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue

principle risk measure in the objective function and a secondary risk measure
whose value is controlled in the constraints. This problem is of interest when
it is necessary to consider the risk preferences of two parties, such as a
portfolio manager and a regulator, at the same time. A special case of this
problem where the risk measures are assumed to be coherent (positively
homogeneous) is studied recently in a joint work of the author. The present
paper extends the analysis to a more general setting by assuming that the two
risk measures are only quasiconvex. First, we study the case where the
principal risk measure is convex. We introduce a dual problem, show that there
is zero duality gap between the portfolio optimization problem and the dual
problem, and finally identify a condition under which the Lagrange multiplier
associated to the dual problem at optimality gives an optimal portfolio. Next,
we study the general case without the convexity assumption and show that an
approximately optimal solution with prescribed optimality gap can be achieved
by using the well-known bisection algorithm combined with a duality result that
we prove.

(MMRs). In this work, we find out that the depletion and structures of gas disk
play crucial roles in driving planet pairs out of exact location of MMRs. Under
such scenario, planet pairs are trapped into exact MMRs during orbital
migration firstly and keep migrating in a same pace. The eccentricities can be
excited. Due to the existence of gas disk, eccentricities can be damped leading
to the change of orbital period. It will make planet pairs depart from the
exact location of MMRs. With depletion timescales larger than 1 Myr, near MMRs
configurations are formed easily. Planet pairs have higher possibilities to
escape from MMRs with higher disk aspect ratio. Additionally, with weaker
corotation torque, planet pairs can depart farther from exact location of MMRs.
The final location of the innermost planets in systems are directly related to
the transition radius from optically thick region to inner optically thin disk.
While the transition radius is smaller than 0.2 AU at the late stage of star
evolution process, the innermost planets can reach around 10 days. Our
formation scenario is a possible mechanism to explain the formation of near
MMRs configuration with the innermost planet farther than 0.1 AU.

  Voxel Super-Resolution and Learned Implicit Representation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The task of reconstructing detailed 3D human body models from images is
interesting but challenging in computer vision due to the high freedom of human
bodies. In order to tackle the problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine method to
reconstruct a detailed 3D human body from multi-view images combining voxel
super-resolution based on learning the implicit representation. Firstly, the
coarse 3D models are estimated by learning an implicit representation based on
multi-scale features which are extracted by multi-stage hourglass networks from
the multi-view images. Then, taking the low resolution voxel grids which are
generated by the coarse 3D models as input, the voxel super-resolution based on
an implicit representation is learned through a multi-stage 3D convolutional
neural network. Finally, the refined detailed 3D human body models can be
produced by the voxel super-resolution which can preserve the details and
reduce the false reconstruction of the coarse 3D models. Benefiting from the
implicit representation, the training process in our method is memory efficient
and the detailed 3D human body produced by our method from multi-view images is
the continuous decision boundary with high-resolution geometry. In addition,
the coarse-to-fine method based on voxel super-resolution can remove false
reconstructions and preserve the appearance details in the final
reconstruction, simultaneously. In the experiments, our method quantitatively
and qualitatively achieves the competitive 3D human body reconstructions from
images with various poses and shapes on both the real and synthetic datasets.

Accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa3700",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper uses statistical and $N$-body methods to explore a new mechanism
to form binary stars with extremely large separations ($> 0.1\,{\rm pc}$),
whose origin is poorly understood. Here, ultra-wide binaries arise via chance
entrapment of unrelated stars in tidal streams of disrupting clusters. It is
shown that (i) the formation of ultra-wide binaries is not limited to the
lifetime of a cluster, but continues after the progenitor is fully disrupted,
(ii) the formation rate is proportional to the local phase-space density of the
tidal tails, (iii) the semimajor axis distribution scales as $p(a)d a\sim
a^{1/2}d a$ at $a\ll D$, where $D$ is the mean interstellar distance, and (vi)
the eccentricity distribution is close to thermal, $p(e)d e= 2 e d e$. Owing to
their low binding energies, ultra-wide binaries can be disrupted by both the
smooth tidal field and passing substructures. The time-scale on which tidal
fluctuations dominate over the mean field is inversely proportional to the
local density of clumps. Monte-Carlo experiments show that binaries subject to
tidal evaporation follow $p(a)d a\sim a^{-1}d a$ at $a\gtrsim a_{\rm peak}$,
known as \""Opik's law, with a peak semi-major axis that contracts with time as
$a_{\rm peak}\sim t^{-3/4}$. In contrast, a smooth Galactic potential
introduces a sharp truncation at the tidal radius, $p(a)\sim 0$ at $a\gtrsim
r_t$. The scaling relations of young clusters suggest that most ultra-wide
binaries arise from the disruption of low-mass systems. Streams of globular
clusters may be the birthplace of hundreds of ultra-wide binaries, making them
ideal laboratories to probe clumpiness in the Galactic halo.

Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment, which aims to address these questions by
measuring the oscillation patterns of $\nu_\mu/\nu_e$ and
$\bar\nu_\mu/\bar\nu_e$ over a range of energies spanning the first and second
oscillation maxima. DUNE far detector modules are based on liquid argon TPC
(LArTPC) technology. A LArTPC offers excellent spatial resolution, high
neutrino detection efficiency, and superb background rejection, while
reconstruction in LArTPC is challenging. Deep learning methods, in particular,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated success in
classification problems such as particle identification in DUNE and other
neutrino experiments. However, reconstruction of neutrino energy and final
state particle momenta with deep learning methods is yet to be developed for a
full AI-based reconstruction chain. To precisely reconstruct these kinematic

particle masses with the kinetic energy and the direction reconstructed by our

show considerable improvements compared to the traditional methods for both
scenarios.

directly learn an embedding for individual input image patches. Subsequently,
generalized max-pooling technique is employed for the aggregation of embedded

introduced for the task of identification and retrieval based on $k$-reciprocal

  Homography","12 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image stitching is a classical and crucial technique in computer vision,
which aims to generate the image with a wide field of view. The traditional
methods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features
be dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting
effects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view
and input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other
real datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework,
which consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved
deformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module
to estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image
and the target image in different scales of features. After that, an
edge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of
image stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much
as possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images
of arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image
stitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images.
Experimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly
outperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes.
In image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and
shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.

doping CeO2 with transition metals is an effective way of tuning its
properties. However, each previous study on CeO2 doping has been limited to a
single or a few dopants. In this paper, we systematically study the formation
energies, structural stability and electronic properties of CeO2 doped with the
entire range of the ten 3d transition metals using density functional theory
(DFT) calculations at the hybrid level. The formation energies of oxygen
vacancies, and their effects on electronic properties, were also considered. It
is found that most of the 3d transition metal dopants can lower the band gap of
CeO2, with V and Co doping significantly reducing the band gap to less than 2.0
eV. Furthermore, all of the dopants can lower the formation energy of oxygen
vacancies, and those with higher atomic numbers, particularly Cu and Zn, are
most effective for this purpose. The electronic structures of doped CeO2
compensated by oxygen vacancies show that the presence of oxygen vacancies can
further lower the band gap for most of the dopants, with V-, Cr-, Fe-, Co-,
Ni-, and Cu-doped CeO2 all having band gaps of less than 2.0 eV. These results
suggest that doping CeO2 with 3d transition metals could enhance the
photocatalytic performance under visible light and increase the oxygen vacancy
concentration, and they could provide a meaningful guide for the design of
CeO2-based materials with improved photocatalytic and catalytic performance as
well as enhanced ionic conductivity.

throughout the last two decades. Network Creation Games are a promising
approach for this from a game-theoretic perspective. In these games, selfish
agents corresponding to nodes in a network strategically decide which links to
form to optimize their centrality. Many versions have been introduced and
analyzed, but none of them fits to modeling the evolution of social networks.
In real-world social networks, connections are often established by
recommendations from common acquaintances or by a chain of such
recommendations. Thus establishing and maintaining a contact with a friend of a
friend is easier than connecting to complete strangers. This explains the high
clustering, i.e., the abundance of triangles, in real-world social networks.
  We propose and analyze a network creation model inspired by real-world social
networks. Edges are formed in our model via bilateral consent of both endpoints
and the cost for establishing and maintaining an edge is proportional to the
distance of the endpoints before establishing the connection. We provide
results for generic cost functions, which essentially only must be convex
functions in the distance of the endpoints without the respective edge. For
this broad class of cost functions, we provide many structural properties of
equilibrium networks and prove (almost) tight bounds on the diameter, the Price
of Anarchy and the Price of Stability. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept we show
via experiments that the created equilibrium networks of our model indeed
closely mimics real-world social networks. We observe degree distributions that
seem to follow a power-law, high clustering, and low diameters. This can be
seen as a promising first step towards game-theoretic network creation models
that predict networks featuring all core real-world properties.

stresses the importance to further understand and predict harmful effects of

  initiation and elongation",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cells have evolved a metabolic control of DNA replication to respond to a
wide range of nutritional conditions. Accumulating data suggest that this
poorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon
Metabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA)
is intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises
a catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to
produce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.
Interestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is
homologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a
conserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and
catalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in
replication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown
in a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.
Measurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork
speed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit
replication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein
rather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and
PEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively
and negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a
process depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues
binding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and
belonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of
PykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication
enzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for
initiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus
connect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and
ADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and
the replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed
with a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling
metabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the
cellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication
initiation and elongation to metabolism. This defines a new type of replication
regulator proposed to be part of the metabolic control that gates replication
in the cell cycle.

problems in the field of nonlinear dynamics. Interest in the study of chaos
exists both in low-dimensional dynamical systems and in large ensembles of
coupled oscillators. In this paper, we study the emergence of spatio-temporal
chaos in chains of locally coupled identical pendulums with constant torque.
The study of the scenarios of the emergence (disappearance) and properties of
chaos is done as a result of changes in: (i) the individual properties of
elements due to the influence of dissipation in this problem, and (ii) the
properties of the entire ensemble under consideration, determined by the number
of interacting elements and the strength of the connection between them. It is
shown that an increase of dissipation in an ensemble with a fixed coupling
force and elements number can lead to the appearance of chaos as a result of a
cascade of period doubling bifurcations of periodic rotational motions or as a
result of invariant tori destruction bifurcation. Chaos and hyperchaos can
occur in an ensemble by adding or excluding one or more elements. Moreover,
chaos arises hard, since in this case the control parameter is discrete. The
influence of the coupling strength on the occurrence of chaos is specific. The
appearance of chaos occurs with small and intermediate coupling and is caused
by the overlap of the various out-of-phase rotational modes regions existence.
The boundaries of these areas are determined analytically and confirmed in a
numerical experiment. Chaotic regimes in the chain do not exist if the coupling
strength is strong enough.

energy transport into the chromosphere and the corona. In active regions, newly
emerging magnetic flux interacts with the pre-existent magnetic field, which
can lead to reconnection events that convert magnetic energy to thermal energy.
We aim to study the heating caused by a strong reconnection event that was
triggered by magnetic flux cancellation. We use imaging-spectropolarimetric
data in the Fe I 6301A, Fe I 6302A, Ca II 8542A and Ca II K obtained with the
CRISP and CHROMIS instruments at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. This data was
inverted using multi-atom, multi-line non-LTE inversions using the STiC code.
The inversion yielded a three-dimensional model of the reconnection event and
surrounding atmosphere, including temperature, velocity, microturbulence,
magnetic file configuration, and the radiative loss rate. The model atmosphere
shows the emergence of magnetic loops with a size of several arcsecs into a
pre-existing predominantly unipolar field. Where the reconnection region is
expected to be, we see an increase in the chromospheric temperature of roughly
2000 K as well as bidirectional flows of the order of 10 km s$^{-1}$ emanating
from the region. We see bright blobs of roughly 0.2 arcsec diameter in the Ca
II K moving at a plane-of-the-sky velocity of order 100 km s$^{-1}$ and a
blueshift of 100 km s$^{-1}$, which we interpret as plasmoids ejected from the
same region. This evidence is consistent with theoretical models of
reconnection and we thus conclude that reconnection is taking place. The
chromospheric radiative losses at the reconnection site in our inferred model
are as high as 160 kW m$^{-2}$, providing a quantitative constraint on
theoretical models that aim to simulate reconnection caused by flux emergence

PNS literature is scarce for MRI in this regime, where the resonant character
of MPI coils prevents studies of broad-band excitation pulses. We have
constructed an apparatus for PNS threshold determination on a subject's limb,
capable of narrow and broad-band magnetic excitation with pulse characteristic
times down to 40 us. From a first set of measurements on 51 volunteers, we
observe that PNS limits coincide for sinusoidal (biphasic narrow-band) and
triangular (biphasic broad-band) excitations, and are slightly lower for
trapezoidal (monophasic broad-band) pulses. We have also measured statistically
significant correlations of PNS sensitivity with arm size and body weight, and
no correlation with height or gender. As opposed to resonant systems, our setup
allows the execution of arbitrarily short pulse trains. We have confirmed
thresholds increase significantly as trains transition from tens to a few
pulses also in these fast timescales. By changing the polarity of the coils in

magnetic field strength on PNS effects. We find that thresholds are higher in
an approximately linearly inhomogeneous field (relevant to MRI) than in a
rather homogeneous distribution (as in MPI). Finally, given the large

influence of directed and elliptic flow, and vorticity on the observed effect

Consequently, it provides a quantitative description of the electromagnetic

Recently, researchers explained it by investigating the implicit regularization
effect of optimization algorithms. A remarkable progress is the work (Lyu&Li,

deep neural networks. Except GD, adaptive algorithms such as AdaGrad, RMSProp
and Adam are popular owing to their rapid training process. However,
theoretical guarantee for the generalization of adaptive optimization
algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we study the implicit
regularization of adaptive optimization algorithms when they are optimizing the
logistic loss on homogeneous deep neural networks. We prove that adaptive
algorithms that adopt exponential moving average strategy in conditioner (such
as Adam and RMSProp) can maximize the margin of the neural network, while
AdaGrad that directly sums historical squared gradients in conditioner can not.
It indicates superiority on generalization of exponential moving average
strategy in the design of the conditioner. Technically, we provide a unified
framework to analyze convergent direction of adaptive optimization algorithms
by constructing novel adaptive gradient flow and surrogate margin. Our
experiments can well support the theoretical findings on convergent direction
of adaptive optimization algorithms.

create spatial patterns of population densities in which highly populated

spatial niches for a weaker competitor to establish in the community and

describes the balance of the kinetic, thermal and gravitational energy of a
fluid element. We propose as well a method to obtain approximate solutions in a
power-law form which results in four solutions corresponding to different
density profiles, polytropic exponents and energy balance equations for a fluid
element. One of them, a density profile with slope $-3$ and polytropic exponent
$\Gamma=4/3$, matches with observations and numerical works and, in particular,
leads to a second power-law tail of the density distribution function in dense,
self-gravitating cloud regions.

remedy this issue, we shall modify the usual $H^k$ norm with certain
well-chosen mixed terms and with suitable coefficients which are constructed by
induction on $k$. In parallel, a similar strategy but with coefficients
depending on time (c.f. \cite{Herau}), usually referred as H\'erau's method,
can be employed to prove global hypoellipticity in $H^k$. The exponents in our
regularity estimates are optimal in short time. Moreover, as in our recent work

to get estimates independent of the dimension; in particular, an application to

the extrapolation of the $M \propto \sigma$ relation for more massive galaxies.
We argue that this is difficult to reconcile with suggestions that the scaling
relations between galaxies and their central black holes are simply a
statistical consequence of assembly through repeated mergers. This predicts
black hole masses significantly larger than those observed in dwarf galaxies
unless the initial distribution of uncorrelated seed black hole and stellar
masses is confined to much smaller masses than earlier assumed. It also
predicts a noticeable flattening of the $M \propto \sigma$ relation for dwarfs,
to $M \propto \sigma^2$ compared with the observed $M \propto \sigma^4$. In
contrast black hole feedback predicts that black hole masses tend towards a
universal $M \propto \sigma^4$ relation in all galaxies, and correctly gives
the properties of powerful outflows recently observed in dwarf galaxies. These
considerations emphasize once again that the fundamental physical black-hole --
galaxy scaling relation is between $M$ and $\sigma$. The relation of $M$ to the
bulge mass $M_b$ is acausal, and depends on the quite independent connection
between $M_b$ and $\sigma$ set by stellar feedback.

can support the new application with explosive requirements of the

for the path loss of high frequency, massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) can be utilized for high array gains by beamforming. However, since a
large number of analog phase shifters should be used to realize the analog
beamforming, the existing THz communication with massive MIMO has very high
energy consumption. To solve this problem, a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-based hybrid precoding architecture for THz communication is developed in
this paper, where the energy-hungry phased array is replaced by the
energy-efficient RIS to realize the analog beamforming of the hybrid precoding.
Then, based on the proposed RIS-based architecture, a sum-rate maximization
problem for hybrid precoding is investigated. Since the phase shifts
implemented by RIS in practice are often discrete, this sum-rate maximization
problem with a non-convex constraint is challenging. Next, the sum-rate
maximization problem is reformulated as a parallel deep neural network
(DNN)-based classification problem, which can be solved by the proposed
low-complexity deep learning-based multiple discrete classification (DL-MDC)
hybrid precoding scheme. Finally, we provide numerous simulation results to
show that the proposed DL-MDC scheme works well both in the theoretical
Saleh-Valenzuela channel model and practical 3GPP channel model. Compared with
existing iterative search algorithms, the can proposed DL-MDC scheme reduces
the runtime significantly with a negligible performance loss.

logarithmic roughness scaling, differing for EW and KPZ models (indicating that
even at $d=\infty$ the KPZ nonlinearity is still relevant); beyond
asymptotically rough EW surfaces above the upper critical dimension of the EW
class. Motivated by these strange findings, I revisit these growth models here
to show that such results are simple consequences of boundary effects, inherent
to systems defined on CTs. In fact, I demonstrate that the anomalous boundary
of the CT leads the growing surfaces to develop curved shapes, which explains
the strange behaviors previously found for these systems, once the global
""roughness"" were analyzed for non-flat surfaces in the study above.
Importantly, by measuring the height fluctuations at the central site of the

surfaces are found for both EW and KPZ classes, consistently with the behavior
expected for growing systems in dimensions $d \geqslant d_u$. Interesting

Testing its performance on the full sky against the Wishart distribution, which

the Gaussian likelihood returns accurate parameter constraints. This accuracy
is robust to the choices made in the likelihood analysis, including the choice
of fiducial cosmology, the range of scales included, and the random noise
level. We extend our results to the cut sky by evaluating the additional
non-Gaussianity of the joint cut-sky likelihood in both its marginal

more non-Gaussian than the full-sky likelihood, but at a level insufficient to
introduce significant inaccuracy into parameter constraints obtained using the
Gaussian likelihood. Our results should not be affected by the assumption of
Gaussian fields, as this approximation only becomes inaccurate on small scales,
which in turn corresponds to the limit in which any non-Gaussianity of the

application scenarios. In the era of big data, traditional decision tree
induction algorithms are not suitable for learning large-scale datasets due to
their stringent data storage requirement. Online decision tree learning
algorithms have been devised to tackle this problem by concurrently training
with incoming samples and providing inference results. However, even the most
up-to-date online tree learning algorithms still suffer from either high memory
usage or high computational intensity with dependency and long latency, making
them challenging to implement in hardware. To overcome these difficulties, we
introduce a new quantile-based algorithm to improve the induction of the
Hoeffding tree, one of the state-of-the-art online learning models. The
proposed algorithm is light-weight in terms of both memory and computational
demand, while still maintaining high generalization ability. A series of
optimization techniques dedicated to the proposed algorithm have been
investigated from the hardware perspective, including coarse-grained and
fine-grained parallelism, dynamic and memory-based resource sharing, pipelining
with data forwarding. Following this, we present Hard-ODT, a high-performance,
hardware-efficient and scalable online decision tree learning system on a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with system-level optimization techniques.
Performance and resource utilization are modeled for the complete learning
system for early and fast analysis of the trade-off between various design
metrics. Finally, we propose a design flow in which the proposed learning
system is applied to FPGA run-time power monitoring as a case study.

asymptotic stabilization, we propose a resilient dynamic quantizer in the sense
that it does not saturate in the presence of packet losses caused by DoS
attacks. A sufficient condition for stability is derived by restricting the
average DoS frequency and duration. In addition, because of the locality of
linearization, we explicitly investigate an estimate of the region of

DoS attacks. A simulation example is presented for demonstration of our

of coverage of distinct topic categories, and the analysis of the relationship

respiratory diseases. To reach accurate diagnoses, a device must be able to
recognize heart and lung sounds from various clinical situations. However, the
recorded chest sounds are mixed by heart and lung sounds. Thus, effectively
separating these two sounds is critical in the pre-processing stage. Recent
advances in machine learning have progressed on monaural source separations,
but most of the well-known techniques require paired mixed sounds and
individual pure sounds for model training. As the preparation of pure heart and
lung sounds is difficult, special designs must be considered to derive
effective heart and lung sound separation techniques. In this study, we
proposed a novel periodicity-coded deep auto-encoder (PC-DAE) approach to
separate mixed heart-lung sounds in an unsupervised manner via the assumption
of different periodicities between heart rate and respiration rate. The PC-DAE
benefits from deep-learning-based models by extracting representative features
and considers the periodicity of heart and lung sounds to carry out the
separation. We evaluated PC-DAE on two datasets. The first one includes sounds
from the Student Auscultation Manikin (SAM), and the second is prepared by
recording chest sounds in real-world conditions. Experimental results indicate
that PC-DAE outperforms several well-known separations works in terms of
standardized evaluation metrics. Moreover, waveforms and spectrograms
demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-DAE compared to existing approaches. It is
also confirmed that by using the proposed PC-DAE as a pre-processing stage, the
heart sound recognition accuracies can be notably boosted. The experimental
results confirmed the effectiveness of PC-DAE and its potential to be used in
clinical applications.

Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE), for a target at unknown
location in an unknown environment. Source localisation is to find sources of
atmospheric hazardous material release in a partially unknown environment. This
paper proposes a control theoretic approach to this autonomous search problem.
To cope with an unknown target location, at each step, the target location is
estimated by Bayesian inference. Then a control action is taken to minimise the
error between future robot position and the hypothesised future estimation of
the target location. The latter is generated by hypothesised measurements at
the corresponding future robot positions (due to the control action) with the
current estimation of the target location as a prior. It shows that this
approach can take into account both the error between the next robot position
and the estimate of the target location, and the uncertainty of the estimate.
This approach is further extended to the case with not only an unknown source
location, but also an unknown local environment (e.g. wind speed and
direction). Different from current information theoretic approaches, this new
control theoretic approach achieves the optimal trade-off between exploitation
and exploration in a unknown environment with an unknown target by driving the
robot moving towards estimated target location while reducing its estimation
uncertainty. This scheme is implemented using particle filtering on a mobile
robot. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate promising performance of
the proposed approach. The relationships between the proposed approach,
informative path planning, dual control, and classic model predictive control
are discussed and compared.

SlowVAE and propose a new term based on Brownian motion. We empirically
evaluate these slowness regularization terms with respect to their downstream

equal or better downstream task performance and data efficiency in different
experiment domains when compared to representations without slowness
regularization. Finally, we discuss how the Frechet Inception Distance (FID),

They result in huge losses of money
for businesses like the movie industry, as well as a loss of user privacy for
businesses dealing with user data like the pharmaceutical industry. Preventing
data exposures is challenging, because the causes for such events are various,
ranging from hacking to misconfigured databases. Alongside the surge in data
exposures, the recent rise of microservices as a paradigm brings the need to
not only secure traffic at the border of the network, but also internally,
pressing the adoption of new security models such as zero-trust to secure
business processes.
  Business processes can be modeled as workflows, where the owner of the data
at risk interacts with contractors to realize a sequence of tasks on this data.
In this paper, we show how those workflows can be enforced while preventing
data exposure. Following the principles of zero-trust, we develop an
infrastructure using the isolation provided by a microservice architecture, to
enforce owner policy. We show that our infrastructure is resilient to the set
of attacks considered in our security model. We implement a simple, yet

testing the deployment for policy violations, and estimate the overhead cost of

across countries. This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0
across the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore
social factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from
January to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that
provided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under
study and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated
per country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each
country with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable
Mobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status
were obtained from external sources.
  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies
provided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to
explain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and
14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.
  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the
estimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights
the spatial heterogeneity in R0. Higher values were recorded in more developed
countries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable mobility.
Countries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates. For most
regions, variability in R0 spiked initially before reducing and stabilising as
more estimates became available.

reconstruction, creates a loss of contrast in CT reconstructions and introduces
severe artifacts including cupping, shading, and streaks. Even when these
qualitative artifacts are not apparent, scatter can pose a major obstacle in
obtaining quantitatively accurate reconstructions. Our approach to estimating
scatter is, first, to generate a training set of 2D radiographs with and
without scatter using particle transport simulation software. To estimate
scatter for a new radiograph, we adaptively fit a scatter model to a small

compared local and global (fit on full data sets) versions of several X-ray

since the pioneering work of Anderson et al. in 1989. Biologically, the goal of
these models is to understand what governs the severity of infections, the
patterns of infectiousness, and the variation thereof across individual hosts.
Mathematically, these models are based on dynamical systems, with standard
approaches ranging from K-compartments ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
to delay differential equations (DDEs), to capture the relatively constant
duration of replication and bursting once a parasite infects a host red blood
cell. Using malariatherapy data, which offers fine-scale resolution on the
dynamics of infection across a number of individual hosts, we compare the fit
and robustness of one of these standard approaches (K-compartments ODE) with a
partial differential equations (PDEs) model, which explicitly tracks the ""age""
of an infected cell. While both models perform quite similarly in terms of
goodness-of-fit for suitably chosen K, the K-compartments ODE model
particularly overestimates parasite densities early on in infections when the
number of repeated compartments is not large enough. Finally, the
K-compartments ODE model (for suitably chosen K) and the PDE model highlight a
strong qualitative connection between the density of transmissible parasite
stages (i.e., gametocytes) and the density of host-damaging (and
asexually-replicating) parasite stages. This finding provides a simple tool for
predicting which hosts are most infectious to mosquitoes -- vectors of
\emph{Plasmodium} parasites -- which is a crucial component of global efforts
to control and eliminate malaria.

solar-wind observations far from the Sun, such as at 1 AU, to update and
improve the inner boundary conditions of the solar wind model (at 30 solar
radii). In this way, observational information can be used to improve estimates

downstream of the Earth. This allows improved initial conditions of the solar
wind to be passed into forecasting models. To this effect, we employ the HUXt

operational lifetime of STEREO-B (01 November 2007 - 30 September 2014). In
near-Earth space, we compare the accuracy of these DA forecasts with both
non-DA forecasts and simple corotation of STEREO-B observations. We find that
27-day root mean-square error (RMSE) for STEREO-B corotation and DA forecasts
are comparable and both are significantly lower than non-DA forecasts. However,
the DA forecast is shown to improve solar wind forecasts when STEREO-B's
latitude is offset from Earth, which is an issue for corotation forecasts. And
the DA scheme enables the representation of the solar wind in the whole model
domain between the Sun and the Earth to be improved, which will enable improved
forecasting of CME arrival time and speed.

quantum computation with Majorana zero modes (MZM) in a one-dimensional
topological superconductor (1DTS). One of the leading methods to realize
quantum gates in 1DTS is to use T-junctions, which allows one to maneuver MZMs
such as to achieve braiding. In this paper, we propose a scheme that is in a
purely one-dimensional geometry and does not require T-junctions, instead
replacing it with an auxiliary qubit. We show that this allows one to perform
one and two logical qubit $ Z $ rotations. We first design a topologically
protected logical $Z$-gate based entirely on local interactions within the
1DTS. Using an auxiliary qubit coupled to the topological superconductors, we
extend the $Z$-gate to single and multiqubit arbitrary rotations with partial
topological protection. Finally, to perform universal quantum computing, we
introduce a scheme for performing arbitrary unitary rotations, albeit without
topological protection. We develop a formalism based on unitary braids which
creates transitions between different topological phases of the 1DTS system.
The unitary formalism can be simply converted to an equivalent adiabatic
scheme, which we numerically simulate and show that high fidelity operations
should be possible with reasonable parameters.

this work, we point out two previously neglected aspects with respect to this

non-vanishing cross terms with the standard lensing convergence. This is
particularly relevant when the sources are averaged over a bin of width $\Delta
z\approx 0.1$, such as in Euclid's tomographic weak lensing survey. Secondly,
general relativistic potential terms slightly enhance the signal. We present

encouraging implementations of optical components including metalenses.
However, to date, a pending and fundamental problem of this approach has been
the low device efficiency that such resulting components suffer, an unwanted
side effect of large lattice constants used for preventing inter-coupling of

electromagnetic resonances found its use in constructing efficient narrow-band
designs, such structures fell short of providing high efficiency over a broad

architecture enables the scatterers to interact with the incoming wave
extremely efficiently. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we showed an
achromatic cylindrical metalens, constructed from strongly coupled dielectric
nanopillars of a single geometry as continuously-set phase elements in a
'meta-atomless' fashion, working in the entirety of 400-700 nm band. This
metalens achieves over 85 percent focusing efficiency across this whole
spectral range. To combat polarization sensitivity, we used hexagonally stacked
nanopillars to build up a polarization-independent scatterer library. Finally,
a circular metalens with polarization-independent operation and achromatic
focusing was obtained. This is a paradigm shift in making an achromatic
metasurface architecture by wovening identical nanopillars coupled into an

Different from conventional pricing schemes where the price is fully available

price prediction signal that can be different from the actual price incurred by
the agents. The resulting reliability issues are taken into account by
including trust dynamics in our model, implying that the agents will not
blindly follow the signal sent by the regulator, but rather follow it based on
the history of its accuracy, i.e, its deviation from the actual price. We
present several nudge mechanisms to generate suitable price prediction signals
that are able to steer the aggregative behavior of the agents to stationary as
well as temporal desired aggregative behaviors. We provide analytical
convergence guarantees for the resulting multi-components models. In
particular, we prove that the proposed nudge mechanisms earn and maintain full
trust of the agents, and the aggregative behavior converges to the desired one.

algorithms are prohibitively expensive to implement on real-time hardware
encoders due to their sequential nature and their need to frequently obtain
entropy coding costs. This work addresses this limitation using a neural
network-based approach, which learns to trade-off rate and distortion during
offline supervised training. As these networks are based solely on standard
arithmetic operations that can be executed on existing neural network hardware,
no additional area-on-chip needs to be reserved for dedicated RDOQ circuitry.
We train two classes of neural networks, a fully-convolutional network and an
auto-regressive network, and evaluate each as a post-quantization step designed
to refine cheap quantization schemes such as scalar quantization (SQ). Both

crashes from time to time on the more tricky input programs, not least because
of the complexity of its features and their interactions. This makes it a great
target for fuzzing, even the basic forms of which can find a significant number
of Kotlin compiler crashes.
  There is a problem with fuzzing, however, closely related to the cause of the
crashes: generating a random, non-trivial and semantically valid Kotlin program
is hard. In this paper, we talk about type-centric compiler fuzzing in the form
of type-centric enumeration, an approach inspired by skeletal program
enumeration and based on a combination of generative and mutation-based
fuzzing, which solves this problem by focusing on program types. After creating
the skeleton program, we fill the typed holes with fragments of suitable type,

  We implemented this approach in our Kotlin compiler fuzzing framework called
Backend Bug Finder (BBF) and did an extensive evaluation, not only testing the
real-world feasibility of our approach, but also comparing it to other compiler
fuzzing techniques. The results show our approach to be significantly better
compared to other fuzzing approaches at generating semantically valid Kotlin

be switched to low-conductive one at high currents due to the Joule heating of
the sample, which should be identified as $\alpha$-$Pnma$ -- $\beta$-$Cmcm$
diffusionless martensitic phase transition in SnSe. For highly-conductive
state, there is significant hysteresis in $dI/dV(V)$ curves at low biases, so
the sample conductance depends on the sign of the applied bias change. This
hysteretic behavior reflects slow relaxation due to additional polarization
current in the ferroelectric SnSe phase, which we confirm by direct measurement
of time-dependent relaxation curves. In contrast, we observe no noticeable
relaxation or low-bias hysteresis for the quenched $\beta$-$Cmcm$
low-conductive phase. Thus, ferroelectric behavior can be switched on or off in
transport through hybrid SnSe structure by controllable $\alpha$-$Pnma$ --
$\beta$-$Cmcm$ phase transition. This result can also be important for
nonvolatile memory development, e.g. phase change memory for neuromorphic
computations or other applications in artificial intelligence and modern
electronics.

wireless communication research. Nonetheless, the stochastic nature of
renewable energy sources has become one of the research problems, and energy
storage has been proposed as a solution to deal with it. Initially, researchers
regarded a perfect battery model without energy losses during storage because
of its simplicity and compatibility in wireless communication analysis.
However, a battery model that reflects practical concerns should include energy
losses. In this paper, we consider an energy harvesting wireless communication
model with a battery that has energy losses during charging and discharging. We
consider energy underflows (i.e., the energy level falls below a certain
threshold in a battery) as the energy management concern, and characterize the
energy underflow probability and provide a simple exponential formulation by
employing the large deviation principle and queueing theory. Specifically, we
benefit from the similarity between the battery and data buffer models. We
further coin the available space decay rate at a battery as a parameter to
indicate the energy consumption performance. We further outline an approach to
set the energy demand policy to meet the energy management requirements that
rule the energy underflow probability as a constraint. We finally substantiate
our analytical findings with numerical demonstrations, and compare the
transmission performance levels of a transmission system with a battery that
has energy losses and a transmission system that consumes the energy as soon as
it is harvested.

demonstrate that TARA significantly or fully debiases baseline models while
outperforming competing debiasing methods that have the same amount of

due to EVs' decisions. Thus, decision-making requires a model of several

a model is suggested for the electrical system in the context of commuting,

investigate the behavior of the scaling factors and the resulting scaled matrix

geometric scattering whose behavior is sensitive to the theoretically ambiguous
values of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature coefficients entering the
expression for the quantum Hamiltonian operator. This suggests using the
scattering data to settle the ambiguity in the definition of the Hamiltonian.
It has recently been shown that the inclusion of point defects on the surface
enhances the geometric scattering effects. We perform a detailed study of the
geometric scattering phenomenon in the presence of line defects for the case
that the particle is confined to move on a Gaussian bump and the defect(s) are
modeled by delta-function potentials supported on a line or a set of parallel
lines normal to the scattering axis. In contrast to a surface having point
defects, the scattering phenomenon associated with this system is generically
geometric in nature in the sense that for a flat surface the scattering
amplitude vanishes for all scattering angles $\theta$ except $\theta=\theta_0$
and $\pi-\theta_0$, where $\theta_0$ is the angle of incidence. We show that
the presence of the line defects amplifies the geometric scattering due to the
Gaussian bump. This amplification effect is particularly strong when the center
of the bump is placed between two line defects.

These methods take a closed-set view and train binary detectors, thus biasing

management, in order to select the best available motion planning approach for
the currently estimated perception uncertainty. We estimate the uncertainty in
visual inputs using a deep neural network (CovNet) that explicitly predicts the
covariance of the current measurements. Next, we train a high level machine

the current estimate of covariance as well as the UAV states. We demonstrate on
both real-life data and drone racing simulations that our approach, named
uncertainty driven motion planning switcher (UDS) yields the safest and fastest
trajectories among compared alternatives. Furthermore, we show that the
developed approach learns how to trade-off safety with agility by switching to
motion planners that leads to more agile trajectories when the estimated

enable deployment in a variety of different tasks. Proprioception refers to
sensing the robot's own state and is of crucial importance in order to deploy
soft robotic systems outside of laboratory environments, i.e. where no external
sensing, such as motion capture systems, is available.
  A vision-based sensing approach for a soft robotic arm made from fabric is
presented, leveraging the high-resolution sensory feedback provided by cameras.
No mechanical interaction between the sensor and the soft structure is required
and consequently, the compliance of the soft system is preserved. The
integration of a camera into an inflatable, fabric-based bellow actuator is
discussed. Three actuators, each featuring an integrated camera, are used to
control the spherical robotic arm and simultaneously provide sensory feedback
of the two rotational degrees of freedom. A convolutional neural network
architecture predicts the two angles describing the robot's orientation from
the camera images. Ground truth data is provided by a motion capture system
during the training phase of the supervised learning approach and its
evaluation thereafter.
  The camera-based sensing approach is able to provide estimates of the
orientation in real-time with an accuracy of about one degree. The reliability
of the sensing approach is demonstrated by using the sensory feedback to
control the orientation of the robotic arm in closed-loop.

on the morphological and colorimetric features of the seeds, and has made
significant contributions in systematic studies. However, in order to extract
the morphological and colorimetric features, it is necessary to segment the
image containing the samples to be analysed. This stage represents one of the
most challenging steps in image processing, as it is difficult to separate
uniform and homogeneous objects from the background. In this paper, we present
a new, open source plugin for the automatic segmentation of an image of a seed
sample. This plugin was written in Java to allow it to work with ImageJ open
source software. The new plugin was tested on a total of 3,386 seed samples
from 120 species belonging to the Fabaceae family. Digital images were acquired
using a flatbed scanner. In order to test the efficacy of this approach in
terms of identifying the edges of objects and separating them from the
background, each sample was scanned using four different hues of blue for the
background, and a total of 480 digital images were elaborated. The performance
of the new plugin was compared with a method based on double image acquisition
(with a black and white background) using the same seed samples, in which
images were manually segmented using the Core ImageJ plugin. The results showed
that the new plugin was able to segment all of the digital images without
generating any object detection errors. In addition, the new plugin was able to
segment images within an average of 0.02 s, while the average time for
execution with the manual method was 63 s. This new open source plugin is
proven to be able to work on a single image, and to be highly efficient in
terms of time and segmentation when working with large numbers of images and a
wide diversity of shapes.

retrieval aims to acquire the ingredients available to the users, and then
retrieve recipe candidates from a large-scale recipe dataset. User health
profiling is to characterize the health conditions of users by capturing the
textual health-related information crawled from social networks. Specifically,
to solve the issue that the health-related information is extremely sparse, we
incorporate a word-class interaction mechanism into the proposed deep model to
learn the fine-grained correlations between the textual tweets and pre-defined
health concepts. For the health-aware food recommendation, we present a novel

nanometer-thick epitaxial Co films intercalated between graphene (Gr) and a
heavy metal (HM) substrate, as a function of the Co thickness. High quality
epitaxial Gr/Co\n/HM(111) (HM=Pt,Ir) heterostructures are grown by
intercalation below graphene, which acts as a surfactant that kinetically
stabilizes the pseudomorphic growth of highly perfect Co face-centered
tetragonal ($fct$) films, with a reduced number of stacking faults as the only
structural defect observable by high resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HR-STEM). Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements show that
such heterostructures present PMA up to large Co critical thicknesses of about
4~nm (20~ML) and 2~nm (10~ML) for Pt and Ir substrates, respectively, while
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements show an inverse power law
of the anistropy of the orbital moment with Co thickness, reflecting its
interfacial nature, that changes sign at about the same critical values. First
principles calculations show that, regardless of the presence of graphene,
ideal Co $fct$ films on HM buffers do not sustain PMAs beyond around 6~MLs due
to the in-plane contribution of the inner bulk-like Co layers. The large
experimental critical thicknesses sustaining PMA can only be retrieved by the
inclusion of structural defects that promote a local $hcp$ stacking such as
twin boundaries or stacking faults. Remarkably, a layer resolved analysis of
the orbital momentum anisotropy reproduces its interfacial nature, and reveals
that the Gr/Co interface contribution is comparable to that of the Co/Pt(Ir).

clusters of detections that were all linked to the same physical light source

discarded. The remaining detections were then preliminarily associated with one

All candidate matches that directly or indirectly were associated with the same
source form a match candidate group. The detections from the same group were
then subject to a cluster analysis. Each cluster was assigned a source

aim to understand whether this sort of memorization is necessary for accurate

all the information about a large subset of its training examples. This remains
true even when the examples are high-dimensional and have entropy much higher

irrelevant to the task at hand. Further, our results do not depend on the
training algorithm or the class of models used for learning.

  transfer atom interferometry","24 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large scale atom interferometers promise unrivaled strain sensitivity to
midband (0.1 - 10 Hz) gravitational waves, and will probe a new parameter space
in the search for ultra-light scalar dark matter. These atom interferometers
require a momentum separation above 10^4 \hbar k between interferometer arms in
order to reach the target sensitivity. Prohibitively high optical intensity and
wavefront flatness requirements have thus far limited the maximum achievable
momentum splitting. We propose a scheme for optical cavity enhanced atom
interferometry, using circulating, spatially resolved pulses, and intracavity
frequency modulation to overcome these limitations and reach 10^4 \hbar k
momentum separation. We present parameters suitable for the experimental
realization of 10^4 \hbar k splitting in a 1 km interferometer using the 698 nm
clock transition in 87Sr, and describe performance enhancements in 10 m scale
devices operating on the 689 nm intercombination line in 87Sr. Although
technically challenging to implement, the laser and cloud requirements are
within the reach of upcoming cold-atom based interferometers. Our scheme
satisfies the most challenging requirements of these sensors and paves the way
for the next generation of high sensitivity, large momentum transfer atom
interferometers.

through a pipeline of modules such as detection, filtering, and control. In
this paper we frame active visual monitoring as an imitation learning problem
to be solved in a supervised manner using deep learning, to go directly from
visual information to camera movement in order to provide a satisfactory
solution by combining computer vision and control. A deep convolutional neural
network is trained end-to-end as the camera controller that learns the entire

also estimate their density from a single image. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed solution is robust to varying conditions and is able to
achieve better monitoring performance both in terms of number of targets
monitored as well as in monitoring time than traditional approaches, while
reaching up to 25 FPS. Thus making it a practical and affordable solution for
multi-target active monitoring in surveillance and smart-environment

seeking relevant training data from a data owner needs to appraise the data

not want to share data. The resulting Catch-22 prevents efficient data markets
from forming. This paper proposes adding a data appraisal stage that requires
no data sharing between data owners and model owners. Specifically, we use
multi-party computation to implement an appraisal function computed on private

transaction. We propose an efficient data appraisal method based on forward
influence functions that approximates data value through its first-order loss
reduction on the current model. The method requires no additional
hyper-parameters or re-training. We show that in private, forward influence

increase the variance and are difficult to interpret, since negative

network devices should support a plethora of tasks with highly heterogeneous

  This work addresses optimizing performance in heterogeneous and uncertain

uncertainty and show that uncertainty appears in all layers of network design,
including the time required to perform a task; the amount of available
resources; and the expected gain from successfully completing a task. Next, we
survey current solutions and show their limitations. Based on these insights we
develop general design concepts to tackle heterogeneity and uncertainty, and
then use these concepts to design practical algorithms. For each of our

on various input traces, thus obtaining further insights as to our algorithmic
design principles.

formulating a three-dimensional semi-classical model that fully accounts for
the Coulomb singularities and for magnetic field effects during time
propagation. Using this model, we identify a prominent signature of non-dipole
effects. Namely, we demonstrate that the recolliding electron back-scatters
along the direction of light propagation. Hence, this electron escapes opposite
to the direction of change in momentum due to the magnetic field. This is in
striking contrast to strongly-driven atoms where the recolliding electron
forward-scatters along the direction of light propagation. We attribute these
distinct signatures to the different gate that the magnetic field creates
jointly with a soft recollision in molecules compared to a hard recollision in
atoms. These two different gates give rise, shortly before recollision, to
different momenta and positions of the recolliding electron along the direction
of light propagation. As a result, we show that the Coulomb forces from the
nuclei act to back-scatter the recolliding electron in molecules and
forward-scatter it in atoms along the direction of light propagation.

for achieving better system intelligence. This paper considers the design and
implementation of a practical privacy-preserving collaborative learning scheme,
in which a curious learning coordinator trains a better machine learning model
based on the data samples contributed by a number of IoT objects, while the
confidentiality of the raw forms of the training data is protected against the
coordinator. Existing distributed machine learning and data encryption
approaches incur significant computation and communication overhead, rendering
them ill-suited for resource-constrained IoT objects. We study an approach that
applies independent random projection at each IoT object to obfuscate data and
trains a deep neural network at the coordinator based on the projected data
from the IoT objects. This approach introduces light computation overhead to
the IoT objects and moves most workload to the coordinator that can have
sufficient computing resources. Although the independent projections performed
by the IoT objects address the potential collusion between the curious
coordinator and some compromised IoT objects, they significantly increase the
complexity of the projected data. In this paper, we leverage the superior
learning capability of deep learning in capturing sophisticated patterns to
maintain good learning performance. The extensive comparative evaluation shows
that this approach outperforms other lightweight approaches that apply additive
noisification for differential privacy and/or support vector machines for
learning in the applications with light to moderate data pattern complexities.

elongates its shadow toward the rotational axis. Besides, black hole spin and

March 2020 by the World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral
infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia.
Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the
COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and
the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an
area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a
rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the
standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone,
alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this
study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning
(DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been
comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different
approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography
of the chest and X-ray images give a rich representation of the patient's lung
that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection
using the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing of these images
to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep
models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.).
Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide
whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease.
In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough
analysis to early screen the COVID-19, and human mobility estimation to limit
its spread.

Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data
can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in
the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total
of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841
employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020,
who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily
employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text
messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean
absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital
census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD
= 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120),
living in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19
patients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital
network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5
patients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the
number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional
employees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a
5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI:
(0.02, 0.07)). Conclusions: We found that a real-time employee health
attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to predict subsequent
hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in
New England.

only if switching components occur, namely, if and only if non-empty images
exist having null projections along all the directions in $U$. In order to
lower the number of allowed reconstructions, one tries to incorporate possible
extra geometric constraints in the tomographic problem. In particular, the
class $\mathbb{P}$ of horizontally and vertically convex connected sets
(briefly, $hv$-convex polyominoes) has been largely considered. In this paper
we introduce the class of $hv$-convex switching components, and prove some
preliminary results on their geometric structure. The class includes all
switching components arising when the tomographic problem is considered in
$\mathbb{P}$, which highly motivates the investigation of such configurations.
It turns out that the considered class can be partitioned in two disjointed
subclasses of closed patterns, called windows and curls, respectively. It
follows that all windows have a unique representation, while curls consist of
interlaced sequences of sub-patterns, called $Z$-paths, which leads to the
problem of understanding the combinatorial structure of such sequences. We
provide explicit constructions of families of curls associated to some special
sequences, and also give additional details on further allowed or forbidden
configurations by means of a number of illustrative examples.

multiphysical coupling. One of the key points in the development of the
constitutive laws of these materials, either at the local or at the global
scale, is to formulate a free energy density (or enthalpy) from vectors,
tensors, at a given order and for a class of given symmetry, depending on the
symmetry classes of the crystal constituting the material or the symmetry of
the representative volume element. This article takes as a support of study the
stress and magnetization couple ($\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of
magnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show
a non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction
of certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon
requires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free
energy density. A polynomial formulation in the two variables stress and
magnetization is preferred over a tensorial formulation. For a given material
symmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at
any bi-degree in $\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors order for the
so-called tensorial formulation). A rigorous and systematic method is essential
to obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free
energy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the
cubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in
Invariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic
nonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the
invariant algebra for the pair (m, $\sigma$), under the proper
(orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The
minimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60
invariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one
of interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These
invariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a
generalized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent
invariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\sigma$) is performed. It is shown
accordingly that it is possible to list without error all the material
parameters useful for the description of the coupled magnetoelastic behavior
from the integrity basis. The technique is applied to derive general
expressions $\Psi$ $\star$ ($\sigma$, m) of the free energy density at the
magnetic domains scale exhibiting cubic symmetry. The classic results for an
isotropic medium are recovered.

two fixed point attractors and two symmetrical chaotic strange attractors.
Dynamical properties of the system, viz. sensitive dependence on initial
conditions, Lyapunov spectrum, strangeness measure, attraction basin, including
the class and size of it, existence of strange attractor, bifurcation analysis,
multistability, electronic circuit design, and hardware implementation, are
rigorously treated. Numerical computations are used to compute the basin of
attraction and show that the system has a far-reaching composite basin of
attraction. Such a basin of attraction is vital for engineering applications.
Moreover, a circuit model of the system is realized using analog electronic
components. A procedure is detailed for converting the system parameters into
corresponding electronic component values such as the circuital resistances
while ensuring the dynamic ranges are bounded. Besides, the system is used as
the source of control inputs for independent navigation of a differential drive
mobile robot, which is subject to the Pfaffian velocity constraint. Due to the
properties of sensitivity on initial conditions and topological mixing, the
robot's path becomes unpredictable and guaranteed to scan the workspace,
respectively.

  Liu","""Let's Eat Grandma"": Does Punctuation Matter in Sentence Representation?",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural network-based embeddings have been the mainstream approach for
creating a vector representation of the text to capture lexical and semantic
similarities and dissimilarities. In general, existing encoding methods dismiss
the punctuation as insignificant information; consequently, they are routinely
treated as a predefined token/word or eliminated in the pre-processing phase.
However, punctuation could play a significant role in the semantics of the
sentences, as in ""Let's eat\hl{,} grandma"" and ""Let's eat grandma"". We
hypothesize that a punctuation-aware representation model would affect the
performance of the downstream tasks. Thereby, we propose a model-agnostic
method that incorporates both syntactic and contextual information to improve
the performance of the sentiment classification task. We corroborate our
findings by conducting experiments on publicly available datasets and provide
case studies that our model generates representations with respect to the
punctuation in the sentence.

  Intelligent Vehicles","7 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the development of intelligent vehicle systems, a high-precision road
map is increasingly needed in many aspects. The automatic lane lines extraction
and modeling are the most essential steps for the generation of a precise
lane-level road map. In this paper, an automatic lane-level road map generation
system is proposed. To extract the road markings on the ground, the
multi-region Otsu thresholding method is applied, which calculates the
intensity value of laser data that maximizes the variance between background
and road markings. The extracted road marking points are then projected to the
raster image and clustered using a two-stage clustering algorithm. Lane lines
are subsequently recognized from these clusters by the shape features of their
minimum bounding rectangle. To ensure the storage efficiency of the map, the
lane lines are approximated to cubic polynomial curves using a Bayesian
estimation approach. The proposed lane-level road map generation system has
been tested on urban and expressway conditions in Hefei, China. The
experimental results on the datasets show that our method can achieve excellent
extraction and clustering effect, and the fitted lines can reach a high
position accuracy with an error of less than 10 cm
