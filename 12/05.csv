  Charging","11 pages, 8 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe the architecture and algorithms of the Adaptive Charging Network
(ACN), which was first deployed on the Caltech campus in early 2016 and is
currently operating at over 100 other sites in the United States. The
architecture enables real-time monitoring and control and supports electric
vehicle (EV) charging at scale. The ACN adopts a flexible Adaptive Scheduling
Algorithm based on convex optimization and model predictive control and allows
for significant over-subscription of electrical infrastructure. We describe
some of the practical challenges in real-world charging systems, including
unbalanced three-phase infrastructure, non-ideal battery charging behavior, and
quantized control signals. We demonstrate how the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm
handles these challenges, and compare its performance against baseline
algorithms from the deadline scheduling literature using real workloads
recorded from the Caltech ACN and accurate system models. We find that in these
realistic settings, our scheduling algorithm can improve operator profit by 3.4
times over uncontrolled charging and consistently outperforms baseline
algorithms when delivering energy in highly congested systems.

  charging for LISA and future space interferometers","Accepted for publication in Classical and Quantum Gravity",,"10.1088/1361-6382/abd142",,"physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles charge gold-platinum,
free-falling test masses (TMs) on board interferometers for the detection of
gravitational waves in space. The charging process induces spurious forces on
the test masses that affect the sensitivity of these instruments mainly below
$10^{-3}$ Hz. Geant4 and FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to
study the TM charging process on board the LISA Pathfinder mission that
remained into orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L1 between 2016 and
2017. While a good agreement was observed between simulations and measurements
of the TMs net charging, the shot noise associated with charging fluctuations
of both positive and negative particles resulted 3-4 times higher that
predicted. The origin of this mismatch was attributed to the propagation of
electrons and photons only above 100 eV in the simulations. In this paper,
low-energy electromagnetic processes to be included in the future Monte Carlo
simulations for LISA and LISA-like space interferometers TM charging are
considered. {It is found that electrons and photons below 100 eV give a
contribution to the effective charging comparable to that of the whole sample
of particles above this energy. In particular, for incident protons ionization
contributes twice with respect to low energy kinetic emission and electron
backscattering. The other processes are found to play a negligible role. For
heavy nuclei only sputtering must be considered.

Applied 15, 034048 (2021)","10.1103/PhysRevApplied.15.034048",,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The negative capacitance (NC) stabilization of a ferroelectric (FE) material
can potentially provide an alternative way to further reduce the power
consumption in ultra-scaled devices and thus has been of great interest in
technology and science in the past decade. In this article, we present a
physical picture for a better understanding of the hysteresis-free charge boost
effect observed experimentally in metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM)
capacitors. By introducing the dielectric (DE) leakage and interfacial trapped
charges, our simulations of the hysteresis loops are in a strong agreement with
the experimental measurements, suggesting the existence of an interfacial oxide
layer at the FE-metal interface in metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitors.
Based on the pulse switching measurements, we find that the charge enhancement
and hysteresis are dominated by the FE domain viscosity and DE leakage,
respectively. Our simulation results show that the underlying mechanisms for
the observed hysteresis-free charge enhancement in MFIM may be physically
different from the alleged NC stabilization and capacitance matching. Moreover,
the link between Merz's law and the phenomenological kinetic coefficient is
discussed, and the possible cause of the residual charges observed after pulse
switching is explained by the trapped charge dynamics at the FE-DE interface.
The physical interpretation presented in this work can provide important
insights into the NC effect in MFIM capacitors and future studies of low-power
logic devices.

work primarily considers spatial language as goal specification for instruction
following tasks in fully observable domains, often paired with reference paths

spatial language as a form of stochastic observation. We propose SLOOP (Spatial

computed via an online POMDP planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Evaluation based on crowdsourced language data, collected over areas of five
cities in OpenStreetMap, shows that our approach achieves faster search and
higher success rate compared to baselines, with a wider margin as the spatial
language becomes more complex. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method in
AirSim, a realistic simulator where a drone is tasked to find cars in a

electrode using classical Density Functional Theory (DFT), and compare these
with the decay lengths of the corresponding two-body correlation functions in
bulk systems, obtained in previous Integral Equation Theory (IET) studies.
Extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to complement the
DFT and IET predictions. Our DFT calculations incorporate electrostatic
interactions between the ions using three different (existing) approaches: one
based on the simplest mean field treatment of Coulomb interactions (MFC),
whilst the other two employ the Mean Spherical approximation (MSA). The MSAc
invokes only the MSA bulk direct correlation function whereas the MSAu also
incorporates the MSA bulk internal energy. Although MSAu yields profiles that
agree best with MD simulations in the near field, in the far field we observe
that the decay lengths are consistent between IET, MSAc, and MD simulations,
whereas those from MFC and MSAu deviate significantly. Using DFT we calculated
the solvation force, which relates directly to surface force experiments. We
find that its decay length is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively close to
the large decay lengths measured in experiments and conclude that the latter
cannot be accounted for by the primitive model. The anomalously large decay
lengths found in surface force measurements require an explanation that lies

cuboid vessel (200 \times 200 \times 40 mm^3). Laboratory experiments are
performed for measuring temperature and flow field in the alloy GaInSn at
Prandtl number Pr = 0.03 and in a Rayleigh number range 2.3 \times 10^4 < Ra <
2.6 \times 10^5. The field strength is varied up to a maximum value of 320 mT
(Ha = 2470, Q = 6.11 \times 10^6). The magnetic field forces the flow to form
two-dimensional rolls parallel to the direction of the field lines. The
experiments confirm the predictions made by Busse and Clever (J. M\'ecanique
Th\'eorique et Appliqu\'ee, 1983) who showed that the application of the
horizontal magnetic field extends the range in which steady two-dimensional
roll structures exist (Busse balloon) towards higher Ra numbers. A transition
from the steady to a time-dependent oscillatory flow occurs when Ra exceeds a
critical value for a given Chandrasekhar number Q, which is also equivalent to
a reduction of the ratio Q/Ra. Our measurements reveal that the first
developing oscillations are clearly of two-dimensional nature, in particular a
mutual increase and decrease in the size of adjacent convection rolls is
observed without the formation of any detectable gradients in the velocity
field along the magnetic field direction. At a ratio of Q/Ra = 1, the first 3D
structures appear, which initially manifest themselves in a slight inclination
of the rolls with respect to the magnetic field direction. Immediately in the
course of this, there arise also disturbances in the spaces between adjacent
convection rolls, which are advected along the rolls due to the secondary flow
driven by Ekman pumping. The transition to fully-developed three-dimensional
structures and then to a turbulent regime takes place with further lowering
Q/Ra.

enables a user-space process to switch the domains in an efficient way. While
the efficiency of Intel MPK enables developers to leverage it for common use
cases such as Code-Pointer Integrity, the limited number of unique domains (16)
prohibits its use in cases such as OpenSSL where a large number of domains are
required. Moreover, Intel MPK suffers from the protection key use-after-free
vulnerability. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose an
efficient intra-process isolation technique for the RISC-V open ISA, called
SealPK, which supports up to 1024 unique domains. SealPK prevents the
protection key use-after-free problem by leveraging a lazy de-allocation
approach. To further strengthen SealPK, we devise three novel sealing features
to protect the allocated domains, their associated pages, and their permissions
from modifications or tampering by an attacker. To demonstrate the feasibility
of our design, we implement SealPK on a RISC-V Rocket processor, provide the OS
support for it, and prototype our design on an FPGA. We demonstrate the
efficiency of SealPK by leveraging it to implement an isolated shadow stack on
our FPGA prototype.

order to estimate mean optical extinctions to 143 PNe using ratios involving
their integrated Balmer line fluxes and their extinction-free radio fluxes.
Distances to the PNe were then estimated using three different 3D interstellar
dust extinction mapping methods, including the IPHAS-based H-MEAD algorithm of
Sale (2014). These methods were used to plot dust extinction versus distance
relationships for the lines of sight to the PNe; the intercepts with the
derived dust optical extinctions allowed distances to the PNe to be inferred.
For 17 of the PNe in our sample reliable Gaia DR2 distances were available and
these have been compared with the distances derived using three different
extinction mapping algorithms as well as with distances from the nebular radius
vs. H$\alpha$ surface brightness relation of Frew et al. (2016). That relation
and the H-MEAD extinction mapping algorithm yielded the closest agreement with

from the thermodynamic quantities describing matter fields. In the present
paper we investigate the effects of the quantum fluctuations on the spherically

from a variational principle, by assuming that the quantum correction tensor is
given by the coupling of a scalar field to the metric tensor. After
reformulating the field equations in a dimensionless form, and by introducing a
suitable independent radial coordinate, we obtain their solutions numerically.
We detect the formation of a black hole from the presence of a singularity in
the metric tensor components. Several models, corresponding to different
functional forms of the scalar field potential, are considered. The
thermodynamic properties of the black hole solutions (horizon temperature,
specific heat, entropy and evaporation time due to Hawking luminosity) are also
investigated.

the overall permeation of a given substance into the skin, as in vitro and in
vivo experimental results for skin permeation found in the literature provide
inconclusive information on this matter. Method - We use an in silico skin
permeation mechanistic model to simulate the dermal delivery of 30 small
molecules (molecular weight <500 Da) widely used in pharmacology. The model is
complemented with partition and diffusion properties computed from established
quantitative structure-property relationships. The simulations are run
considering two different scenarios: With the follicular route assumed to be
filled with sebum (lipophilic) and filled with water (hydrophilic). Results -
The simulation results show that the relationship between the contribution of
the follicular route on the permeation process and the lipophilicity of the
compounds follow a linear trend for both scenarios studied. A follicular gap
filled with sebum favours the permeation of lipophilic compounds, while the
permeation of hydrophilic compounds is favoured with a follicular gap filled
with water. The results obtained with the follicular gap filled with water give
satisfactory quantitative comparison with in vitro experimental data.
Conclusion - The results suggest that the substance filling the follicular gap
may undergo alterations prior to in vitro testing. Therefore, further
experimentation would be interesting to fully elucidate such alterations, which
are critical for improving the understanding of the role of the follicular
route in skin permeation.

distinguish them from all other images, has been verified effective for
representation learning. However, pushing away two images that are de facto
similar is suboptimal for general representation. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical semantic alignment strategy via expanding the views generated by a
single image to \textbf{Cross-samples and Multi-level} representation, and
models the invariance to semantically similar images in a hierarchical way.
This is achieved by extending the contrastive loss to allow for multiple
positives per anchor, and explicitly pulling semantically similar
images/patches together at different layers of the network. Our method, termed
as CsMl, has the ability to integrate multi-level visual representations across
samples in a robust way. CsMl is applicable to current contrastive learning
based methods and consistently improves the performance. Notably, using the
moco as an instantiation, CsMl achieves a \textbf{76.6\% }top-1 accuracy with
linear evaluation using ResNet-50 as backbone, and \textbf{66.7\%} and
\textbf{75.1\%} top-1 accuracy with only 1\% and 10\% labels, respectively.
\textbf{All these numbers set the new state-of-the-art.}

van der Waals molecules in buffer gas cells (1 K $\lesssim T \lesssim 10$ K) is
dominated by the long-range tail (distances larger than the LeRoy radius) of
the X-RG interaction. For higher temperatures, the short-range region of the
potential becomes more significant. Moreover, we notice that the rate of

boundary conditions, the wall induces the accumulation of negatively charged

topological boundary layer that polarizes the wall. While the dynamics of wall
and bulk defects are decoupled, we find that the active boundary layer
influences the overall dynamics of the system, to the point of fully
controlling the behavior of the active nematic in situations of strong
confinement. Finally, we show that wall defects exhibit behaviors that are
essentially different from those of their bulk counterparts, such as high
motility or the ability to recombine with another defect of like-sign
topological charge. These exotic behaviors result from a change of symmetry
induced by the wall in the director field around the defect. Finally, we show
that the collective dynamics of wall defects can be described in terms of a

We find that flat thick discs are created when MAPs barely flare or have low
surface density at the radius where they start flaring. When looking at the
vertical distribution of MAPs, these galaxies show a continuous thin/thick
structure. They also have radial age gradients and tend to have quiescent
merger histories. Those characteristics are consistent with what is observed in
the Milky Way. Flared thick discs, on the other hand, are created when the MAPs
that flare have a high surface density at the radius where they start flaring.
The thick discs' scale-heights can either be dominated by multiple MAPs or just
a few, depending on the mass and scale-height distribution of the MAPs. In a
large fraction of these galaxies, thin and thick discs are clearly distinct
structures. Finally, flared thick discs have diverse radial age gradients and
merger histories, with galaxies that are more massive or that have undergone
massive mergers showing flatter age radial gradients in their thick disc.

Novel approaches that can even predict both pose and shape from a single input
image have been introduced, often relying on a parametric model of the human
body such as SMPL. While qualitative results for such methods are often shown
for images captured in-the-wild, a proper benchmark in such conditions is still
missing, as it is cumbersome to obtain ground-truth 3D poses elsewhere than in
a motion capture room. This paper presents a pipeline to easily produce and
validate such a dataset with accurate ground-truth, with which we benchmark
recent 3D human pose estimation methods in-the-wild. We make use of the
recently introduced Mannequin Challenge dataset which contains in-the-wild
videos of people frozen in action like statues and leverage the fact that
people are static and the camera moving to accurately fit the SMPL model on the
sequences. A total of 24,428 frames with registered body models are then
selected from 567 scenes at almost no cost, using only online RGB videos. We
benchmark state-of-the-art SMPL-based human pose estimation methods on this

difficult poses or for scenes where the persons are partially truncated or

the same size as the input then some form of padding is required around the
image boundary, meaning that for each layer of convolution in a convolutional
neural network (CNN), a strip of pixels equal to the half-width of the kernel
size is produced with a non-veridical representation. Although most CNN kernels
are small to reduce the parameter load of a network, this non-veridical area
compounds with each convolutional layer. The tendency toward deeper and deeper
networks combined with stride-based down-sampling means that the propagation of
this region can end up covering a non-negligable portion of the image. Although
this issue with convolutions has been well acknowledged over the years, the
impact of this degraded peripheral representation on modern network behavior
has not been fully quantified. What are the limits of translation invariance?
Does image padding successfully mitigate the issue, or is performance affected
as an object moves between the image border and center? Using Mask R-CNN as an
experimental model, we design a dataset and methodology to quantify the spatial
dependency of network performance. Our dataset is constructed by inserting
objects into high resolution backgrounds, thereby allowing us to crop
sub-images which place target objects at specific locations relative to the
image border. By probing the behaviour of Mask R-CNN across a selection of
target locations, we see clear patterns of performance degredation near the
image boundary, and in particular in the image corners. Quantifying both the
extent and magnitude of this spatial anisotropy in network performance is
important for the deployment of deep networks into unconstrained and realistic
environments in which the location of objects or regions of interest are not
guaranteed to be well localized within a given image.

instances of the approximate control variates (ACV) framework [Gorodetsky et
al. 2020]. In that same work, it was also shown that hand-tailored ACV
estimators could outperform MLMC and MFMC for a variety of model scenarios.
Because there is no reason to believe that these hand-tailored estimators are
the best among a myriad of possible ACV estimators, a more general approach to
estimator construction is pursued in this work. First, a general form of the
ACV estimator variance is formulated. Then, the formulation is utilized to
generate parametrically-defined estimators. These parametrically-defined
estimators allow for an optimization to be pursued over a larger domain of
possible ACV estimators. The parametrically-defined estimators are tested on a
large set of model scenarios, and it is found that the broader search domain
enabled by parametrically-defined estimators leads to greater variance

low-pressure capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) discharge in the presence of a
weak magnetic field applied parallel to the electrodes. Our PIC-MCC simulations
show that the plasma density and ion flux values exhibit a sharp peak when the
electron cyclotron frequency equals half of the applied RF frequency. The
physical mechanism responsible for this behaviour is traced to a
synchronization between the oscillatory motion of the electrode sheath edge and
the motion of a set of electrons reflected by this sheath. These electrons gain
a substantial amount of energy that causes a concomitant higher ionisation
leading to a peak in the ion flux. Our theoretical findings should be easy to
verify experimentally in present day CCP devices and could provide useful
guidelines for enhancing the operational performance of CCP devices in
industrial applications.

map can provide the information at the equilibrium point (i.e., setpoint), it
cannot provide model-plant mismatch information during the transient state.
Moreover, the intrinsic model-plant mismatch can vary due to system
characteristics changes during operation. Therefore, we additionally apply a
supplementary disturbance variable which is updated from the disturbance
estimator based on the nominal offset-free MPC scheme. Then, the combined
disturbance signal is applied to the target problem and finite-horizon optimal
control problem of offset-free MPC to improve the prediction accuracy and
closed-loop performance of the controller. By this, we can exploit both the
learned model-plant mismatch information and the stabilizing property of the

demonstrate that the developed scheme can properly learn the intrinsic
model-plant mismatch and efficiently improve the model-plant mismatch

be difficult to analyze in nominal offset-free MPC, by exploiting the learned

reducing the problem of estimating the energy-constrained channel fidelity

Capturing the uncertainty of the predictions can be useful in deciding whether

we never know the ground truth segmentation, and therefore can never know the

space-time bases, the computation of the global approximation does not require
a time stepping method and is thus computationally efficient. Moreover, we
derive rigorous local and global a priori error bounds. In detail, we bound the

particle production is sufficiently efficient, the scalar power spectrum
exhibits $\mathcal{O}(1)$ oscillations periodic in $k$, characteristic of a
sharp feature, with an exponentially enhanced envelope. We systematically study
the properties of the induced spectrum of gravitational waves sourced after
inflation and find that this inherits the periodic structure in $k$, resulting
in a peak in the gravitational wave energy density spectrum with
$\mathcal{O}(10 \%)$ modulations. The frequency of the oscillation in the

inflation and in turn sets the frequency of modulations in the gravitational

framework of multifield inflation, in the form of a strong sharp turn in the
inflationary trajectory. The resulting stochastic background is potentially
detectable in future gravitational wave observatories, and considerations of

by a 30% fraction of X-ray luminous AGN with a black hole accretion rate per

to the success of CNNs in audio, image and video recognition tasks. In this
thesis, we extend equivariance to other kinds of transformations, such as
rotation and scaling. We propose equivariant models for different
transformations defined by groups of symmetries. The main contributions are (i)
polar transformer networks, achieving equivariance to the group of similarities
on the plane, (ii) equivariant multi-view networks, achieving equivariance to
the group of symmetries of the icosahedron, (iii) spherical CNNs, achieving
equivariance to the continuous 3D rotation group, (iv) cross-domain image
embeddings, achieving equivariance to 3D rotations for 2D inputs, and (v)
spin-weighted spherical CNNs, generalizing the spherical CNNs and achieving
equivariance to 3D rotations for spherical vector fields. Applications include
image classification, 3D shape classification and retrieval, panoramic image
classification and segmentation, shape alignment and pose estimation. What
these models have in common is that they leverage symmetries in the data to
reduce sample and model complexity and improve generalization performance. The
advantages are more significant on (but not limited to) challenging tasks where
data is limited or input perturbations such as arbitrary rotations are present.

visual tracking. Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a
depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation
information from the two feature maps (target and search region). However,
DW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily
be fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak
discrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted
parameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on
large-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric
convolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation
information in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr
and its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the
convolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a
concatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby
avoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and
height)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information,
such as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can
easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr.
To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three
representative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN. Our experiments reveal
the benefits of the proposed ACM, which outperforms existing methods on six
tracking benchmarks. On the LaSOT test set, our ACM-based tracker obtains a
significant improvement of 5.8% in terms of success (AUC), over the baseline.

precision, provides one of the tightest constraints on $S_8$ from the DES-Y1
weak lensing data. In our simulation-based method we determine the expected
DES-Y1 peak-count signal for a range of cosmologies sampled in four $w$CDM
parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $w_0$). We also determine the
joint covariance matrix with over 1000 realisations at our fiducial cosmology.
With mock DES-Y1 data we calibrate the impact of photometric redshift and shear
calibration uncertainty on the peak-count, marginalising over these
uncertainties in our cosmological analysis. Using dedicated training samples we
show that our measurements are unaffected by mass resolution limits in the
simulation, and that our constraints are robust against uncertainty in the
effect of baryon feedback. Accurate modelling for the impact of intrinsic
alignments on the tomographic peak-count remains a challenge, currently
limiting our exploitation of cross-correlated peak counts between high and low

We show that the rates are related to resource measures based on the channel

converged bounds when the channel robustness is finite and measures of the

normalization methods, Batch Normalization (BN) performs well at medium and

while its performance degrades significantly at small batch sizes. In this
paper, we find that BN saturates at extreme large batch sizes, i.e., 128 images

BN at small/extreme large batch sizes is caused by noisy/confused statistic
calculation. Hence without adding new trainable parameters, using
multiple-layer or multi-iteration information, or introducing extra
computation, Batch Group Normalization (BGN) is proposed to solve the
noisy/confused statistic calculation of BN at small/extreme large batch sizes
with introducing the channel, height and width dimension to compensate. The
group technique in Group Normalization (GN) is used and a hyper-parameter G is
used to control the number of feature instances used for statistic calculation,
hence to offer neither noisy nor confused statistic for different batch sizes.

decisions individually at each timestep in training, and hence, limits the
scalability to continuous, high-dimensional, and long-horizon tasks. In
contrast, research in classical robotics has, for a long time, exploited
dynamical systems as a policy representation to learn robot behaviors via
demonstrations. These techniques, however, lack the flexibility and
generalizability provided by deep learning or reinforcement learning and have
remained under-explored in such settings. In this work, we begin to close this
gap and embed the structure of a dynamical system into deep neural

differential equations. We propose Neural Dynamic Policies (NDPs) that make
predictions in trajectory distribution space as opposed to prior policy
learning methods where actions represent the raw control space. The embedded

Machine Learning (ML) and have achieved outstanding results in data-intensive
applications, such as recognition, classification, and segmentation. These
networks mostly use deep layers of convolution or fully connected layers with
many filters in each layer, demanding a large amount of data and tunable
hyperparameters to achieve competitive accuracy. As a result, storage,
communication, and computational costs of training (in particular training
time) become limiting factors to scale them up. In this paper, we propose a new
training methodology for ANNs that exploits the observation of improvement of
accuracy shows temporal variations which allow us to skip updating weights when
the variation is minuscule. During such time windows, we keep updating bias
which ensures the network still trains and avoids overfitting; however, we
selectively skip updating weights (and their time-consuming computations). Such
a training approach virtually achieves the same accuracy with considerably less
computational cost, thus lower training time. We propose two methods for
updating weights and evaluate them by analyzing four state-of-the-art models,
AlexNet, VGG-11, VGG-16, ResNet-18 on CIFAR datasets. On average, our two
proposed methods called WUS and WUS+LR reduced the training time (compared to

the six agriculture-dependent-economy countries such as Burkina Faso, Ivory
Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. We perform several tree-based

to build robust and noise-resistant approaches. Then we determine the important
features showing in which direction they are influencing the migration

  We find that (i) weather features improve the prediction performance although
socioeconomic characteristics have more influence on migration intentions, (ii)
country-specific model is necessary, and (iii) international move is influenced
more by the longer timescales of SPEIs while general move (which includes
internal move) by that of shorter timescales.

hydrodynamic scaling of the correlations is highly robust with respect to the
size of the Trotter step, which opens the door to reach nontrivial time scales
with a small number of gates. While errors within the random circuit are shown
to be irrelevant, we furthermore unveil that meaningful results can be obtained

BT-SETTL15 and Exo-REM using the ForMoSA tool yields Teff=1560 +/- 100K,
log(g)<4.40dex, [M/H]=0.05 +/- 0.22dex, and an upper limit on the C/O ratio

of the planet pseudo-continuum in the process degrades or modifies the
constraints on these parameters. The solar to sub-solar C/O ratio suggests an
enrichment by solids at formation if the planet was formed beyond the water
snowline (>20 au) by core-accretion. However, a formation by gravitational
instability can not be ruled out. The metallicity is compatible with the bulk
enrichment of massive Jovian planets from the Bern planet population models.
Finally, we measure a radial velocity of 26 +/- 15km/s compatible with our
revised measurement on the star. This is the fourth imaged exoplanet for which
a radial velocity can be evaluated, illustrating the potential of such
observations for assessing the coevolution of imaged systems belonging to star

on the baryonic and dark matter content of galaxies. It also serves as a
valuable cosmological probe by allowing us to measure the Hubble constant
independently of other methods. These applications all require the difficult
task of inverting the lens equation and simultaneously reconstructing the mass
profile of the lens along with the original light profile of the unlensed
source. As there is no reason for either the lens or the source to be simple,
we need methods that both invert the lens equation with a large number of
degrees of freedom and also enforce a well-controlled regularisation that
avoids the appearance of spurious structures. This can be beautifully
accomplished by representing signals in wavelet space. Building on the Sparse
Lens Inversion Technique (SLIT), in this work we present an improved
sparsity-based method that describes lensed sources using wavelets and
optimises over the parameters given an analytical lens mass profile. We apply
our technique on simulated HST and E-ELT data, as well as on real HST images of
lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample, assuming a lens model. We show
that wavelets allow us to reconstruct lensed sources containing detailed
substructures when using both present-day data and high-resolution images from
future thirty-meter-class telescopes. Wavelets moreover provide a much more
tractable solution in terms of quality and computation time compared to using a
source model that combines smooth analytical profiles and shapelets. Requiring
very little human interaction, our pixel-based technique fits into the effort
to devise automated modelling schemes. It can be incorporated in the standard
workflow of sampling analytical lens model parameters. The method, which we
call SLITronomy, is freely available as a new plug-in to the modelling software

expansions in power of the electron-electron interaction strength. In contrast
to conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, QQMC uses low-discrepancy
sequences for a more uniform sampling of the multi-dimensional integrals
involved and can potentially outperform Monte Carlo by several orders of
magnitudes. A core concept of QQMC is the a priori construction of a ""model
function"" that approximates the integrand and is used to optimize the sampling
distribution. In this paper, we show that the model function concept extends to
a kernel approach for the computation of Green functions. We illustrate the
approach on the Anderson impurity model and show that the scaling of the error
with the number of integrand evaluations $N$ is $\sim 1/N^{0.86}$ in the best
cases, and comparable to Monte Carlo scaling $\sim 1/N^{0.5}$ in the worst
cases. We find a systematic improvement over Monte Carlo sampling by at least
two orders of magnitude while using a basic form of model function. Finally, we
compare QQMC results with calculations performed with the Fork Tensor Product

impurity problems. Applying a simple Pad\'e approximant for the series
resummation, we find that QQMC matches the FTPS results beyond the perturbative

independently introduced by Lieutier et al. and by Wang et al. In particular,
in analogy with the non-persistent case, we first prove that the nullity of the
$q$-th persistent Laplacian $\Delta_q^{K,L}$ equals the $q$-th persistent Betti
number of the inclusion $(K \hookrightarrow L)$. We then present an initial
algorithm for finding a matrix representation of $\Delta_q^{K,L}$, which itself
helps interpret the persistent Laplacian. We exhibit a novel relationship
between the persistent Laplacian and the notion of Schur complement of a matrix
which has several important implications. In the graph case, it both uncovers a
link with the notion of effective resistance and leads to a persistent version
of the Cheeger inequality. This relationship also yields an additional, very
simple algorithm for finding (a matrix representation of) the $q$-th persistent
Laplacian which in turn leads to a novel and fundamentally different algorithm
for computing the $q$-th persistent Betti number for a pair $(K,L)$ which can
be significantly more efficient than standard algorithms. Finally, we study
persistent Laplacians for simplicial filtrations and present novel stability
results for their eigenvalues. Our work brings methods from spectral graph
theory, circuit theory, and persistent homology together with a topological

and, in scenarios such as committee or board elections, employing voting rules
that return multiple winners. In multi-winner approval voting (AV), an agent
submits a ballot consisting of approvals for as many candidates as they wish,
and winners are chosen by tallying up the votes and choosing the top-$k$
candidates receiving the most approvals. In many scenarios, an agent may
manipulate the ballot they submit in order to achieve a better outcome by
voting in a way that does not reflect their true preferences. In complex and
uncertain situations, agents may use heuristics instead of incurring the
additional effort required to compute the manipulation which most favors them.
In this paper, we examine voting behavior in single-winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with varying degrees of uncertainty using behavioral
data obtained from Mechanical Turk. We find that people generally manipulate
their vote to obtain a better outcome, but often do not identify the optimal
manipulation. There are a number of predictive models of agent behavior in the
COMSOC and psychology literature that are based on cognitively plausible
heuristic strategies. We show that the existing approaches do not adequately

this model is more effective at capturing real-world behaviors in multi-winner

learning, however, focuses primarily on problems where the same set of
modalities are present at train and test time, which makes learning in
low-resource modalities particularly difficult. In this work, we propose
algorithms for cross-modal generalization: a learning paradigm to train a model
that can (1) quickly perform new tasks in a target modality (i.e.
meta-learning) and (2) doing so while being trained on a different source
modality. We study a key research question: how can we ensure generalization
across modalities despite using separate encoders for different source and
target modalities? Our solution is based on meta-alignment, a novel method to
align representation spaces using strongly and weakly paired cross-modal data
while ensuring quick generalization to new tasks across different modalities.
We study this problem on 3 classification tasks: text to image, image to audio,
and text to speech. Our results demonstrate strong performance even when the
new target modality has only a few (1-10) labeled samples and in the presence
of noisy labels, a scenario particularly prevalent in low-resource modalities.

the latest Planck constraints at the cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales
and produces the whole dark matter energy density as primordial black holes
(PBHs), in the mass range $10^{-17}~M_{\odot}\lesssim M_{{}_{\rm PBH}}\lesssim
10^{-13}~M_{\odot}$. The PBHs can be produced after the end of slow-roll
inflation from the bubbles of true vacuum that nucleate during the course of
inflation. Obtaining PBHs in this mass range enforces the scale of inflation to
be extremely low, $10^{-7} \lesssim H \lesssim 10^{-3} ~{\rm GeV}$, which makes
the efforts to observe gravitational waves at the CMB scales futile, although
it is high enough to allow for a successful big bang nucleosynthesis. We will
show that the shape of the mass distribution of the PBHs is dependent on how
inflation ends and the Universe settles from the metastable direction to the
true one. End of inflation can also be probed by examining the gravitational
waves spectrum. In particular, we show that if exit from the rolling metastable
direction to the true vacuum of the potential happens through a first-order
phase transition after the end of slow-roll inflation, it leaves behind a
stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which is potentially
observable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Examining the mass
distribution of PBHs and possible SGWB from the end of inflation, we may be
able to gain invaluable information about the end of inflation.

directionality determination of respiratory signal in free-breathing, real-time
(RT) cardiac MRI.
  Methods: The respiratory signal is extracted by a principal component
analysis method from RT cine images. Then, a two-step procedure is used to
determine the directionality (sign) of the respiratory signal. First, the
signal polarity of all slices is made consistent with a reference slice.
Second, a global sign correction is performed by maximizing the correlation of
the respiratory signal with the zeroth-moment center curve. The proposed method
is evaluated in multi-slice RT cine from eleven volunteers and two patients.
The motion in a manually selected region-of-interest is used as reference.
  Results: The extracted respiratory signal using the proposed method exhibits
high, positive correlation with the reference in all cases and is more robust
compared to a recently proposed method. To demonstrate its clinical utility,
the method is used to identify heartbeats from inspiratory and expiratory
phases and, in turn, to account for respiration-induced changes in the cardiac
output.
  Conclusions: The proposed method enables fully automatic extraction and
directionality determinations of respiratory signal from RT cardiac cine
images, allowing accurate cardiac function quantification.

arrangement is designed optimally for the purpose of polarimetry with
broad-band focussing optics by matching the dispersion of the spectrometer
channels to laterally graded multilayers (LGMLs). The system can achieve
polarization modulation factors over 90%. For PiSoX, the optics are lightweight
Si mirrors in a one-bounce parabolic configuration. High efficiency, blazed
gratings from opposite sectors are oriented to disperse to a LGML forming a
channel covering the wavelength range from 35 to 75 Angstroms (165 - 350 eV).
Upon satellite rotation, the intensities of the dispersed spectra, after
reflection and polarizing by the LGMLs, give the three Stokes parameters needed
to determine a source's linear polarization fraction and orientation. The
design can be extended to higher energies as LGMLs are developed further. We
describe examples of the potential scientific return from instruments based on
this design.

we investigate the role of various stochastic processes affecting the outcome
of the deterministic coevolutionary models. Specifically, we assess 1) the
impact of genetic drift and mutation on the maintenance of polymorphism at the
interacting loci, and 2) the change in neutral allele frequencies across the
genome of both coevolving species due to co-demographic population size
changes. We find that genetic drift decreases the likelihood to observe classic
balancing selection signatures, and that for most realistic values of the
coevolutionary parameters, balancing selection signatures cannot be seen at the
host loci. Further, we reveal that contrary to classic expectations, fast
changes in parasite population size due to eco-evo feedbacks can be tracked by
the allelic site-frequency spectrum measured at several time points. Changes in
host population size are, however, less pronounced and thus not observable.
Finally, we also review several understudied stochastic processes occurring in
host-parasite coevolution which are of importance to predict maintenance of
polymorphism at the underlying loci and the genome-wide nucleotide diversity of
host and parasite populations.

consider detailed partitions of infected individuals according to the illness
severity, as well as data of local health resources, to bring these predictions
closer to the local reality. Tuning the corresponding epidemic parameters for
COVID-19, we study an alternating quarantine strategy, in which a part of the
population can circulate without restrictions at any time, while the rest is
equally divided into two groups and goes on successive periods of normal
activity and lockdown, each one with a duration of $\tau$ days. Besides, we
implement a random testing strategy over the population. We found that $\tau =
7$ is a good choice for the quarantine strategy since it matches with the
weekly cycle as it reduces the infected population. Focusing on the health
system, projecting from the situation as of September 30, we foresee a
difficulty to avoid saturation of ICU, given the extremely low levels of
mobility that would be required. In the worst case, our model estimates that
four thousand deaths would occur, of which 30\% could be avoided with proper

consumption in the presence of external disturbances. The leader and followers
are coupled in the dynamics and cost function. Two non-classical information
structures are considered: mean-field sharing and intermittent mean-field
sharing, where the mean-field refers to the aggregate state of the followers.
In mean-field sharing, every follower observes its local state, the state of
the leader and the mean field while in the intermittent mean-field sharing, the
mean-field is only observed at some (possibly no) time instants. A social
welfare cost function is defined, and it is shown that a unique saddle-point
strategy exists which minimizes the worst-case value of the cost function under
mean-field sharing information structure. The solution is obtained by two
scalable Riccati equations, which depend on a prescribed attenuation parameter,
serving as a robustness factor. For the intermittent mean-field sharing
information structure, an approximate saddle-point strategy is proposed, and
its converges to the saddle-point is analyzed. Two numerical examples are
provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the obtained results.

iterations. We address these limitations by using the fully nonlinear solver
OceanWave3D to establish the DeRisk database, a large dataset of extreme waves
kinematics in a two-dimensional domain. From the database, which is open and
freely available, a designer can extract fully-nonlinear wave kinematics for a
wave condition and water depth of interest by identifying a suitable
computation in the database and, if needed, by Froude-scaling the kinematics.
  The nonlinear solver is validated against the DeRisk model experiments at two
different water depths, $33.0 [m]$ and $20.0 [m]$, and an excellent agreement
is found for the analyzed cases. The experiments are used to calibrate
OceanWave3D's numerical breaking filter constant, and the best agreement is
found for $\beta=0.5$. We compare the experimental static force with

state-of-the-art industrial practices. For milder storms, we find a good
agreement in the predicted extreme force between the present methodology and

largest loads are given by slamming loads due to breaking waves. In this
condition, the database methodology is less accurate than the embedded stream

factor and receiver temperature, thus direct comparison of FOM values measured

the present study proposes a new metric called the receiver effectiveness

receiver effectiveness can be employed for comparing receiver performances
regardless of their operating conditions, and can be treated as more-like the
second law efficiency of thermodynamics. In addition, a theoretical limit of

Carnot efficiency for different concentration factors and receiver

in search of dissipationless spin and valley transport, topological
charge-neutral currents, hydrodynamic flows and helical edge modes. Monolayer,
bilayer, and few-layer graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and moire
superlattices were found to display pronounced nonlocal effects. However, the
origin of these effects is hotly debated. Graphene, in particular, exhibits
giant nonlocality at charge neutrality, a prominent behavior that attracted
competing explanations. Utilizing superconducting quantum interference device
on a tip (SQUID-on-tip) for nanoscale thermal and scanning gate imaging, we
demonstrate that the commonly-occurring charge accumulation at graphene edges
leads to giant nonlocality, producing narrow conductive channels that support
long-range currents. Unexpectedly, while the edge conductance has little impact
on the current flow in zero magnetic field, it leads to field-induced
decoupling between edge and bulk transport at moderate fields. The resulting
giant nonlocality both at charge neutrality and away from it produces exotic
flow patterns in which charges can flow against the global electric field. We
have visualized surprisingly intricate patterns of nonlocal currents, which are
sensitive to edge disorder. The observed one-dimensional edge transport, being
generic and nontopological, is expected to support nonlocal transport in many
electronic systems, offering insight into numerous controversies in the
literature and linking them to long-range guided electronic states at system

that evaluates the pretrial Public Safety Assessment (PSA) in the criminal
justice system. A goal of the PSA is to help judges decide which arrested
individuals should be released. On the basis of the preliminary data available,
we find that providing the PSA to the judge has little overall impact on the
judge's decisions and subsequent arrestee behavior. However, our analysis
yields some potentially suggestive evidence that the PSA may help avoid
unnecessarily harsh decisions for female arrestees regardless of their risk
levels while it encourages the judge to make stricter decisions for male
arrestees who are deemed to be risky. In terms of fairness, the PSA appears to
increase the gender bias against males while having little effect on any
existing racial differences in judges' decision. Finally, we find that the
PSA's recommendations might be unnecessarily severe unless the cost of a new
crime is sufficiently high.

of size N. We introduce a group testing approach that uses significantly fewer
than N tests when infection prevalence is low. The most common approach to
group testing, Dorfman testing, groups individuals randomly. However, as
communicable diseases spread from individual to individual through underlying
social networks, our approach utilizes network information to improve
performance. Network grouping, which groups individuals by community, weakly
dominates Dorfman testing in terms of the expected number of tests used.
Network grouping's outperformance is determined by the strength of community
structure in the network. When networks have strong community structure,
network grouping achieves the lower bound for two-stage testing procedures. As
an empirical example, we consider the scenario of a university testing its
population for COVID-19. Using social network data from a Danish university, we
demonstrate network grouping requires significantly fewer tests than Dorfman.
In contrast to many proposed group testing approaches, network grouping is
simple for practitioners to implement. In practice, individuals can be grouped
by family unit, social group, or work group.

diffuse material collapsing towards filaments, gas and galaxies falling into
clusters, and gas shock processes triggered by substructures. A simple scenario
that describes the large-scale tidal fields of the cosmic web is not able to
fully account for this variety, nor for the differences between gas and
collisionless dark matter. We have studied the filamentary structure in zoom-in
resimulations centred on 324 clusters from The ThreeHundred project, focusing
on differences between dark and baryonic matter. This paper describes the
properties of filaments around clusters out to five $R_{200}$, based on the
diffuse filament medium where haloes had been removed. For this, we stack the
remaining particles of all simulated volumes to calculate the average profiles
of dark matter and gas filaments. We find that filaments increase their
thickness closer to nodes and detect signatures of gas turbulence at a distance
of $\sim 2 h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$ from the cluster. These are absent in dark matter.
Both gas and dark matter collapse towards filament spines at a rate of $\sim
200 h^{-1} \rm{km ~ s^{-1}} $. We see that gas preferentially enters the
cluster as part of filaments, and leaves the cluster centre outside filaments.
We further see evidence for an accretion shock just outside the cluster. For
dark matter, this preference is less obvious. We argue that this difference is
related to the turbulent environment. This indicates that filaments act as
highways to fuel the inner regions of clusters with gas and galaxies.

supersonic turbulent channel flows over isothermal rough walls. The effect of
roughness was incorporated using a level-set/volume-of-fluid immersed boundary
method. Turbulence statistics of five channel flows are compared, including one
reference case with both walls smooth and four cases with smooth top walls and
bottom walls with two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) sinusoidal
roughnesses. Results reveal a strong dependence of the turbulence on the
roughness topography and the associated shock patterns. Specifically, the 2D
geometries generate strong oblique shock waves that propagate across the
channel and are reflected back to the rough-wall side. These strong shocks are
absent in the smooth-wall channel and are significantly weaker in cases with 3D
roughness geometries, replaced by weak shocklets. At the impingement locations
of the shocks on the top wall in the 2D roughness cases, localized
augmentations of turbulence shear production are observed. Such regions of
augmented production also exist for the 3D cases, at a much weaker level. The
oblique shock waves are thought to be responsible for a more significant
entropy generation for cases with 2D surfaces than those with 3D ones, leading
to a higher irreversible heat generation and consequently higher temperature
values in 2D roughness cases. In the present supersonic channels, the effects
of roughness extend beyond the near-wall layer due to the shocks. This suggests
that outer layer similarity may not fully apply to a rough-wall supersonic
turbulent flow.

Laplace exponent is explicit in terms of the branching mechanism. We provide an
interpretation in terms of the genealogy of the population. In particular, we
show that the inverse subordinator is partitioning the current population into
ancestral families with distinct common ancestors. When Grey's condition is
satisfied, the population comes from a discrete set of ancestors and the
ancestral families are i.i.d and distributed according to the quasi-stationary
distribution of the CSBP conditioned on non-extinction. When Grey's condition

from the prominent Mg II $\lambda1.0927\,\mu \rm{m}$ feature, which weakens

normal SN Ia and, along with iPTF13ebh, is the second member of the
transitional subclass to display prominent early-time NIR carbon absorption. We
find it unlikely that the C I feature is misidentified He I
$\lambda1.0830\,\mu\rm{m}$ because this feature grows weaker toward maximum
light, while the helium line produced in some double-detonation models grows
stronger at these times. Intrigued by these strong NIR carbon detections, but
lacking NIR data for other SNe Ia, we investigated the incidence of optical
carbon in the sample of nine transitional SNe Ia with early-time data ($t
\lesssim-$4 days). We find that four display C II $\lambda$6580A, while two
others show tentative detections, in line with the SN Ia population as a whole.
We conclude that at least $\sim$50% of transitional SNe Ia in our sample do not
come from sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions due to the clear presence of carbon
in their NIR and optical spectra.

Tortorelli [1] and aimed at reducing computational cost and circumventing
potential numerical instabilities of density-based topology optimization. The
design variables and the relative densities are both represented on a fixed,
uniform finite element grid, and linked through filtering and Heaviside
projection. The regions in the analysis domain where the relative density is
below a specified threshold are removed from the forward analysis and replaced
by fictitious nodal boundary conditions. This brings a progressive cut of the
computational cost as the optimization proceeds and helps to mitigate numerical
instabilities associated with low-density regions. Removed regions can be
readily reintroduced since all the design variables remain active and are
modeled in the formal sensitivity analysis. A key feature of the proposed
approach is that the Heaviside functions promote material reintroduction along
the structural boundaries by amplifying the magnitude of the sensitivities
inside the filter reach. Several 2D and 3D structural topology optimization
examples are presented, including linear and nonlinear compliance minimization,
the design of a force inverter, and frequency and buckling load maximization.
The approach is shown to be effective at producing optimized designs equivalent

weather conditions at the time of generation. Forecasting global solar
irradiance could address this problem by providing the power grid with the
capability of scheduling the storage and dispatch of energy. The occlusion of
the Sun by clouds is the main cause of instabilities in the generation of solar
energy. This investigation proposes a method to visualize the wind velocity
field in sequences of longwave infrared images of clouds when there are
multiple wind velocity fields in an image. This method can be used to forecast
the occlusion of the Sun by clouds, providing stability in the generation of
solar energy. Unsupervised learning is implemented to infer the distribution of
the clouds' velocity vectors and heights in multiple wind velocity fields in an
infrared image. A multi-output weighted support vector machine with flow
constraints is used to extrapolate the wind velocity fields to the entire
frame, visualizing the path of the clouds. The proposed method is capable of
approximating the wind velocity field in a small air parcel using the velocity
vectors and physical features of clouds extracted from infrared images.
Assuming that the streamlines are pathlines, the visualization of the wind
velocity field can be used for forecasting cloud occlusions of the Sun. This is

place, being a traditional d-band metal without additional f- bands. In this
paper we investigate the bulk electronic structure of LaB$_6$ using hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy, measuring both core-level and angle-resolved
valence-band spectra. By comparing La 3d core level spectra to cluster model
calculations, we identify well-screened peak residing at a lower binding energy
compared to the main poorly-screened peak; the relative intensity between these
peaks depends on how strong the hybridization is between La and B atoms. We
show that the recoil effect, negligible in the soft x-ray regime, becomes
prominent at higher kinetic energies for lighter elements, such as boron, but
is still negligible for heavy elements, such as lanthanum. In addition, we
report the bulk-like band structure of LaB$_6$ determined by hard x-ray
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (HARPES). We interpret HARPES
experimental results by the free-electron final-state calculations and by the
more precise one-step photoemission theory including matrix element and phonon
excitation effects. In addition, we consider the nature and the magnitude of
phonon excitations in HARPES experimental data measured at different
temperatures and excitation energies. We demonstrate that one step theory of
photoemission and HARPES experiments provide, at present, the only approach

sufficiently complex and specialized as to make it difficult to discern what

be distinct from accounts of other, likely downstream, ""configural"" or

crowding that may resist unification.) The new fundamental contrast energy

distribution systems. However, accurate outage location requires combining
massive evidence received from diverse data sources, including smart meter (SM)
last gasp signals, customer trouble calls, social media messages, weather data,
vegetation information, and physical parameters of the network. This is a
computationally complex task due to the high dimensionality of data in
distribution grids. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data fusion
approach to locate outage events in partially observable distribution systems
using Bayesian networks (BNs). A novel aspect of the proposed approach is that
it takes multi-source evidence and the complex structure of distribution
systems into account using a probabilistic graphical method. Our method can
radically reduce the computational complexity of outage location inference in
high-dimensional spaces. The graphical structure of the proposed BN is
established based on the network's topology and the causal relationship between
random variables, such as the states of branches/customers and evidence.
Utilizing this graphical model, accurate outage locations are obtained by
leveraging a Gibbs sampling (GS) method, to infer the probabilities of
de-energization for all branches. Compared with commonly-used exact inference
methods that have exponential complexity in the size of the BN, GS quantifies
the target conditional probability distributions in a timely manner. A case
study of several real-world distribution systems is presented to validate the
proposed method.

phenomena at planar liquid-vapor, wall-liquid, and wall-vapor interfaces are
studied analytically, using classical density functional theory in conjunction
with the sharp-kink approximation for the number density profiles of the A and
B particles. If in accordance with the so-called mixing rule the strength of
the A-B interaction is given by the geometric mean of the strengths of the A-A

values above the one from the mixing rule prescription. The range, within which

faster rates of electrochemical surface area loss, likely from fewer

resources, real-time monitoring of customers at the grid-edge has become a
critical task. However, this requires solving the distribution system state
estimation (DSSE) jointly for both primary and secondary levels of distribution
grids, which is computationally complex and lacks scalability to large systems.
To achieve near real-time solutions for DSSE, we present a novel hierarchical
reinforcement learning-aided framework: at the first layer, a weighted least
squares (WLS) algorithm solves the DSSE over primary medium-voltage feeders; at
the second layer, deep actor-critic (A-C) modules are trained for each
secondary transformer using measurement residuals to estimate the states of
low-voltage circuits and capture the impact of PVs at the grid-edge. While the
A-C parameter learning process takes place offline, the trained A-C modules are
deployed online for fast secondary grid state estimation; this is the key
factor in scalability and computational efficiency of the framework. To
maintain monitoring accuracy, the two levels exchange boundary information with
each other at the secondary nodes, including transformer voltages (first layer
to second layer) and active/reactive total power injection (second layer to
first layer). This interactive information passing strategy results in a
closed-loop structure that is able to track optimal solutions at both layers in
few iterations. Moreover, our model can handle the topology changes using the
Jacobian matrices of the first layer. We have performed numerical experiments

millimeter wave frequencies can be efficiently exploited by employing massive
MIMO technology with highly directive beamforming. Hybrid analog-digital
beamforming has been recognised as a promising approach for large-scale MIMO
implementations with a reduced number of costly and power-hungry RF chains. In
comparison to fully connected architecture, hybrid beamforming (HBF) with
partially connected RF architecture is particularly appealing for the practical
implementation due to less complex RF power division and combining networks. In
this paper, we first formulate single- and multi-user rate maximization
problems as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and derive solutions for
hybrid beamformers using alternating optimization. The algorithms are designed
for the full-array- and sub-array-based processing strategies of partially
connected HBF architecture. In addition to the rate maximizing WMMSE solutions,
we propose lower complexity sub-array-based zero-forcing algorithms. The
performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated in two different channel
models, i.e., a simple geometric model and a realistic statistical millimeter
wave model known as NYUSIM. The performance results of the WMMSE HBF algorithms
are meant to reveal the potential of partially connected HBF and serve as upper
bounds for lower complexity methods. Numerical results imply that properly
designed partially connected HBF has the potential to provide an good
compromise between hardware complexity and system performance in comparison to
fully digital beamforming.

  In this report we propose a Wireless Domain Specific Solution that takes a
Dataflow acceleration approach and addresses the need of the SoC to support
dataflows that change with use case and user activity, while maintaining the
Firm Real Time High Availability with low probability of Heisenbugs that is
required in cellular modems. We do this by developing a Domain Specific

Domain Specific language. A toolchain is described that automates translation
of those requirements in an efficient and robust manner and provides formal
guarantees against Heisenbugs. The dataflow native DSA supports the toolchain
output with specialized processing, data management and control features with
high performance and low power, and recovers rapidly from dropped dataflows
while continuing to achieve the real time requirements.
  This report focuses on the dataflow acceleration in the DSA and the part of
the automated toolchain that formally checks the performance and correctness of
software running on this dataflow hardware. Results are presented and a summary

partial differential equations, by combining the ideas of extreme learning
machines (ELM), domain decomposition and local neural networks. The field
solution on each sub-domain is represented by a local feed-forward neural
network, and $C^k$ continuity is imposed on the sub-domain boundaries. Each
local neural network consists of a small number of hidden layers, while its
last hidden layer can be wide. The weight/bias coefficients in all hidden
layers of the local neural networks are pre-set to random values and are fixed,
and only the weight coefficients in the output layers are training parameters.
The overall neural network is trained by a linear or nonlinear least squares
computation, not by the back-propagation type algorithms. We introduce a block
time-marching scheme together with the presented method for long-time dynamic
simulations. The current method exhibits a clear sense of convergence with
respect to the degrees of freedom in the neural network. Its numerical errors
typically decrease exponentially or nearly exponentially as the number of
degrees of freedom increases. Extensive numerical experiments have been
performed to demonstrate the computational performance of the presented method.
We compare the current method with the deep Galerkin method (DGM) and the
physics-informed neural network (PINN) in terms of the accuracy and
computational cost. The current method exhibits a clear superiority, with its
numerical errors and network training time considerably smaller (typically by
orders of magnitude) than those of DGM and PINN. We also compare the current
method with the classical finite element method (FEM). The computational
performance of the current method is on par with, and oftentimes exceeds, the
FEM performance.

way they define concepts are not inherently interpretable, and they assume that
concept labels either exist for individual instances or can easily be acquired

concepts that both align with users' intuitive sense of what a concept means,
and facilitate prediction of the downstream label by a transparent machine

and as predictive as possible given this constraint. We demonstrate with
simulated user feedback on real prediction problems, including one in a

hypotheses $\theta^*=\theta_0$ and $\theta^*=\theta_1$ for given

it in full generality, we first consider the case of a well-specified linear
model with squared loss. Here we provide matching upper and lower bounds on the
sample complexity as given by $\min\{1/\Delta^2,\sqrt{r}/\Delta\}$ up to a
constant factor; here $\Delta$ is a measure of separation between
$\mathbb{P}_0$ and $\mathbb{P}_1$ and $r$ is the rank of the design covariance
matrix. We then extend this result in two directions: (i) for general
parametric models in asymptotic regime; (ii) for generalized linear models in
small samples ($n\le r$) under weak moment assumptions. In both cases we derive
sample complexity bounds of a similar form while allowing for model
misspecification. In fact, our testing procedures only access $\theta^*$ via a
certain functional of empirical risk. In addition, the number of observations
that allows us to reach statistical confidence does not allow to ""resolve"" the
two models $-$ that is, recover $\theta_0,\theta_1$ up to $O(\Delta)$
prediction accuracy. These two properties allow to use our framework in applied
tasks where one would like to $\textit{identify}$ a prediction model, which can
be proprietary, while guaranteeing that the model cannot be actually

low-order models for broadband turbulent flows is explored. The choice of SPOD
modes as basis vectors is motivated by their optimality and space-time
coherence properties for statistically stationary flows. This work follows the
modeling paradigm that complex nonlinear fluid dynamics can be approximated as
stochastically forced linear systems. The proposed stochastic two-level
SPOD-Galerkin model governs a compound state consisting of the modal expansion
coefficients and forcing coefficients. In the first level, the modal expansion
coefficients are advanced by the forced linearized Navier-Stokes operator under
the linear time-invariant assumption. The second level governs the forcing
coefficients, which compensate for the offset between the linear approximation
and the true state. At this level, least squares regression is used to achieve
closure by modeling nonlinear interactions between modes. The statistics of the
remaining residue are used to construct a dewhitening filter that facilitates
the use of white noise to drive the model. If the data residue is used as the
sole input, the model accurately recovers the original flow trajectory for all
times. If the residue is modeled as stochastic input, then the model generates
surrogate data that accurately reproduces the second-order statistics and
dynamics of the original data. The stochastic model uncertainty,
predictability, and stability are quantified analytically and through Monte
Carlo simulations. The model is demonstrated on large eddy simulation data of a
turbulent jet at Mach number $M=0.9$ and Reynolds number of $Re_D\approx 10^6$.

representation and the generators of the sequence dynamics. In the first
approach, the image representations are learned using probabilistic PCA
\cite{tipping1999probabilistic}. The linear-Gaussian conditional distributions
allow for a closed form analytical description of the latent distributions but
assumes the underlying image manifold is a linear subspace. In the second
approach, the image representations are learned using probabilistic nonlinear
PCA which relieves the linear manifold assumption at the cost of requiring a
variational approximation of the latent distributions. In both approaches, the
underlying dynamics of the image sequence are modelled explicitly to
disentangle them from the image representations. The dynamics themselves are
modelled with Lie group structure which enforces the desirable properties of
smoothness and composability of inter-image transformations.

diamond anvil cell pressure measurements up to 88 GPa were performed on
explosively compressed A15 Nb$_3$Si material to trace Tc as a function of
pressure. Tc is suppressed to ~ 5.2 K at 88 GPa. Then, using these Tc (P) data
for A15 Nb$_3$Si, pressures up to 92 GPa were applied at room temperature
(which increased to 120 GPa at 5 K) on tetragonal Nb$_3$Si. Measurements of the
resistivity gave no indication of any A15 structure production, i.e., no
indications of the superconductivity characteristic of A15 Nb$_3$Si. This is in
contrast to the explosive compression (up to P~110 GPa) of tetragonal Nb$_3$Si,
which produced 50-70% A15 material, Tc = 18 K at ambient pressure, in a 1981
Los Alamos National Laboratory experiment. Our theoretical calculations show
that A15 Nb$_3$Si has an enthalpy vs the tetragonal structure that is 0.07
eV/atom smaller at 100 GPa, implying that the accompanying high temperature

the reaction kinetics of the tetragonal -> A15 Nb$_3$Si structural
transformation. Annealing experiments on the A15 explosively compressed

a U(1) spin-liquid insulator to a Landau Fermi-liquid metal, where there exist
massless degrees of freedom in addition to quantum critical fluctuations. Here,
the Mott quantum criticality is described by critical charge fluctuations, and
additional gapless excitations are U(1) gauge-field fluctuations coupled to a
spinon Fermi surface in the spin-liquid state, which turn out to play a central
role in the Mott transition. An interesting feature of this problem is that the
scaling dimension of effective leading local interactions between critical
charge fluctuations differs from that of the coupling constant between U(1)
gauge fields and matter-field fluctuations in the presence of a Fermi surface.
As a result, there appear dangerously irrelevant operators, which can cause
conceptual difficulty in the implementation of renormalization group (RG)
transformations. Indeed, we find that the curvature term along the angular
direction of the spinon Fermi surface is dangerously irrelevant at this
spin-liquid Mott quantum criticality, responsible for divergence of the
self-energy correction term in U(1) gauge-field fluctuations. Performing the RG
analysis in the one-loop level based on the dimensional regularization method,
we reveal that such extremely overdamped dynamics of U(1) gauge-field
fluctuations, which originates from the emergent one-dimensional dynamics of
spinons, does not cause any renormalization effects to the effective dynamics
of both critical charge fluctuations and spinon excitations. However, it turns
out that the coupling between U(1) gauge-field fluctuations and both
matter-field excitations still persists at this Mott transition, which results
in novel mean-field dynamics to explain the nature of the spin-liquid Mott
quantum criticality.

We define major pairs those with mass ratios of 0.5 $<$ $M_1$/$M_2$ $<$ 2,

impurities in metals and the Kondo effect gives rise to a rich quantum phase
diagram, the Doniach Diagram. In disordered metals, both the Kondo temperature
and the IEC are widely distributed due to the scattering of the conduction
electrons from the impurity potential. Therefore, it is a question of
fundamental importance, how this Doniach diagram is modified by the disorder,
and if one can still identify separate phases. Recently, it has been
investigated the effect of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) correlations on
the Kondo effect of two magnetic impurities, renormalizing the Kondo
interaction based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation and performing the poor men's
renormalization group (RG) analysis with the RKKY-renormalized Kondo coupling.
In the present study, we extend this theoretical framework, allowing for
different Kondo temperatures of two RKKY-coupled magnetic impurities due to
different local exchange couplings and density of states. As a result, we find
that the smaller one of the two Kondo temperatures is suppressed more strongly
by the RKKY interaction, thereby enhancing their initial inequality. In order
to find out if this relevance of inequalities between Kondo temperatures
modifies the distribution of the Kondo temperature in a system of a finite
density of randomly distributed magnetic impurities, we present an extension of
the RKKY coupled Kondo RG equations. We discuss the implication of these
results for the interplay between Kondo coupling and RKKY interaction in
disordered electron systems and the Doniach diagram in disordered electron
systems.

the study of interactive tasks: i) generation of high-quality virtual sensor
signals (RGB, depth, segmentation, LiDAR, flow and so on), ii) domain
randomization to change the materials of the objects (both visual and physical)
and/or their shapes, iii) integrated sampling-based motion planners to generate
collision-free trajectories for robot bases and arms, and iv) intuitive

different modalities (e.g., keyboard, digital ink, voice), there is still a
lack of understanding of the effect of the modality choice on learning. In this
paper, we compared two note-taking input modalities -- keyboard and voice -- to
study their effects on participants' learning. We conducted a study with 60
participants in which they were asked to take notes using voice or keyboard on
two independent digital text passages while also making a judgment about their
performance on an upcoming test. We built mixed-effects models to examine the
effect of the note-taking modality on learners' text comprehension, the content
of notes and their meta-comprehension judgement. Our findings suggest that
taking notes using voice leads to a higher conceptual understanding of the text
when compared to typing the notes. We also found that using voice also triggers
generative processes that result in learners taking more elaborate and
comprehensive notes. The findings of the study imply that note-taking tools

in consumer-focused products like Siri and Alexa or business-oriented
solutions. Deep learning underlies many recent breakthroughs in dialogue
systems but requires very large amounts of training data, often annotated by
experts. Trained with smaller data, these methods end up severely lacking
robustness (e.g. to disfluencies and out-of-domain input), and often just have
too little generalisation power. In this thesis, we address the above issues by
introducing a series of methods for training robust dialogue systems from
minimal data. Firstly, we study two orthogonal approaches to dialogue:
linguistically informed and machine learning-based - from the data efficiency
perspective. We outline the steps to obtain data-efficient solutions with
either approach. We then introduce two data-efficient models for dialogue
response generation: the Dialogue Knowledge Transfer Network based on latent
variable dialogue representations, and the hybrid Generative-Retrieval
Transformer model (ranked first at the DSTC 8 Fast Domain Adaptation task).
Next, we address the problem of robustness given minimal data. As such, propose
a multitask LSTM-based model for domain-general disfluency detection. For the
problem of out-of-domain input, we present Turn Dropout, a data augmentation
technique for anomaly detection only using in-domain data, and introduce
autoencoder-augmented models for efficient training with Turn Dropout. Finally,
we focus on social dialogue and introduce a neural model for response ranking
in social conversation used in Alana, the 3rd place winner in the Amazon Alexa
Prize 2017 and 2018. We employ a novel technique of predicting the dialogue
length as the main ranking objective and show that this approach improves upon
the ratings-based counterpart in terms of data efficiency while matching it in
performance.

either social welfare or revenue, and are not suitable for e-commerce
advertising with various, dynamic, difficult to estimate, and even conflicting
performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called Deep GSP
auction, which leverages deep learning to design new rank score functions
within the celebrated GSP auction framework. These new rank score functions are
implemented via deep neural network models under the constraints of monotone
allocation and smooth transition. The requirement of monotone allocation
ensures Deep GSP auction nice game theoretical properties, while the
requirement of smooth transition guarantees the advertiser utilities would not
fluctuate too much when the auction mechanism switches among candidate
mechanisms to achieve different optimization objectives. We deployed the
proposed mechanisms in a leading e-commerce ad platform and conducted
comprehensive experimental evaluations with both offline simulations and online
A/B tests. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the Deep GSP auction

of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is key for energy
efficiency and for complying with constrained fronthaul links. Processing
signals with few bits implies a significant performance loss and, therefore,
techniques that can compensate for quantization distortion are fundamental. In
wireless systems, an automatic gain control (AGC) precedes the ADCs to adjust
the input signal level in order to reduce the impact of quantization. In this
work, we propose the joint optimization of the AGC, which works in the remote
radio heads (RRHs), and a low-resolution aware (LRA) linear receive filter
based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE), which works in the cloud unit
(CU), for large-scale MU-MIMO systems with coarsely quantized signals. We
develop linear and successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers based
on the proposed joint AGC and LRA MMSE (AGC-LRA-MMSE) approach. An analysis of
the achievable sum rates along with a computational complexity study is also
carried out. Simulations show that the proposed AGC-LRA-MMSE design provides
substantial gains in bit error rates and achievable information rates over
existing techniques.

immune to systematic errors, i.e., laser parameter fluctuations and motional
dephasing, as the $N$ control atoms largely remain in the much stable qubit
space during the operation. We show that $C_N$-NOT gates can reach same level
of fidelity at a given gate time for $N\leq5$ under a suitable choice of

be further enhanced through optimal pulse engineering. In case of Rydberg

materials dynamics under ultrafast heating and quenching rates as well as in
complex electro-chemical environments. Electron-transparent sample preparation
for MEMS e-chips remains a challenge for this technology as the existing
methodologies can introduce contaminants, thus disrupting the experiments and
the analysis of results. Herein we introduce a methodology for simple and fast
electron-transparent sample preparation for MEMS e-chips without significant
contamination. The quality of the samples as well as their performance during a
MEMS e-chip experiment in situ within an electron-microscope are evaluated
during a heat treatment of a crossover AlMgZn(Cu) alloy.

Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon's algorithm, and Grover's algorithm can

operations (oracle operators). The problem of discriminating between two
unitary operations $U$ and $V$ can be described as: Given $X\in\{U, V\}$,
determine which one $X$ is. If $X$ is given with multiple copies, then one can
design an adaptive procedure that takes multiple queries to $X$ to output the
identification result of $X$. In this paper, we consider the problem: How many
queries are required for achieving a desired failure probability $\epsilon$ of
discrimination between $U$ and $V$. We prove in a uniform framework: (i) if $U$

queries $T$ must satisfy $T\geq
\left\lceil\frac{2\sqrt{1-4\epsilon(1-\epsilon)}}{\Theta (U^\dagger

transmission. Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro
car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the
transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and
avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on
the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel
demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the
perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic
difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes
are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike
sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies
sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly.
Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and
older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip
decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of
user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes.
This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19

capable of characterizing the impact of the following vehicle on the preceding
vehicle, which is generally neglected in existing models. A new string
stability criterion is defined for the considered multi-vehicle dynamics, and
stability analysis is performed on the system parameters and time delays. An
efficient online parameter identification algorithm, sequential recursive least

driving-related model parameters. These real-time estimated parameters can be
employed in advanced longitudinal control systems to enable accurate prediction
of vehicle trajectories for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The proposed
model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on NGSIM, a
naturalistic driving dataset, as well as our own connected vehicle driving

that our model is sample-efficient and can accurately predict depression 2-4

where updates are generated periodically and transmitted over a Gilbert-Elliott
fading channel. The goal is to minimize the long-run average age of information
(AoI) at the destination under an average energy constraint. We consider two
practical cases to obtain channel state information (CSI): (i) \emph{without
channel sensing} and (ii) \emph{with delayed channel sensing}. For case (i),
the channel state is revealed when an ACK/NACK is received at the transmitter
following a transmission, but when no transmission occurs, the channel state is
not revealed. Thus, we have to design schemes that balance tradeoffs across
energy, AoI, channel exploration, and channel exploitation. The problem is
formulated as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process
problem (POMDP). To reduce algorithm complexity, we show that the optimal
policy is a randomized mixture of no more than two stationary deterministic
policies each of which is of a threshold-type in the belief on the channel. For
case (ii), (delayed) CSI is available at the transmitter via channel sensing.
In this case, the tradeoff is only between the AoI and energy consumption and
the problem is formulated as a constrained MDP. The optimal policy is shown to
have a similar structure as in case (i) but with an AoI associated threshold.
Finally, the performance of the proposed structure-aware algorithms is
evaluated numerically and compared with a Greedy policy.

Our DFT+DMFT calculations for the bulk states have shown one extra hole pocket

the graph describing the relation of joints is mostly dependent on the physical
connection between joints. To appropriately describe the relations between
joints in the skeleton graph, we propose a multi-scale graph strategy, adopting
a full-scale graph, part-scale graph, and core-scale graph to capture the local

raised concerns for fairness implications, especially for racial minorities.
These concerns have generated considerable interest among machine learning and
artificial intelligence researchers, who have developed new methods and
established theoretical bounds for improving fairness, focusing on the source
data, regularization and model training, or post-hoc adjustments to model
scores. However, little work has studied the practical trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy in real-world settings to understand how these bounds and
methods translate into policy choices and impact on society. Our empirical
study fills this gap by investigating the impact of mitigating disparities on
accuracy, focusing on the common context of using machine learning to inform
benefit allocation in resource-constrained programs across education, mental
health, criminal justice, and housing safety. Here we describe applied work in
which we find fairness-accuracy trade-offs to be negligible in practice. In
each setting studied, explicitly focusing on achieving equity and using our
proposed post-hoc disparity mitigation methods, fairness was substantially
improved without sacrificing accuracy. This observation was robust across
policy contexts studied, scale of resources available for intervention, time,
and relative size of the protected groups. These empirical results challenge a
commonly held assumption that reducing disparities either requires accepting an
appreciable drop in accuracy or the development of novel, complex methods,
making reducing disparities in these applications more practical.

In MemPool's physical-aware design, we emphasized the exploration, design, and
optimization of the low-latency processor-to-L1-memory interconnect. We compare
three candidate topologies, analyzing them in terms of latency, throughput, and
back-end feasibility. The chosen topology keeps the average latency at fewer

also propose a lightweight addressing scheme that maps each core private data

of up to 20% in real-world signal processing benchmarks. The addressing scheme
is also highly efficient in terms of energy consumption since requests to local
banks consume only half of the energy required to access remote banks. Our
design achieves competitive performance with respect to an ideal,

flow and by the nematic orientation coupled with the flow shear rate. In the
overdamped and compressible limit, we recover the previously obtained active
self-propulsion of the +1/2 defects. Non-local hydrodynamic effects are
primarily significant for incompressible flows, for which it is not possible to
eliminate the fluid velocity in favor of the local defect polarization alone.
For the case of two defects with opposite charge, the non-local hydrodynamic
interaction is mediated by non-reciprocal pressure-gradient forces. Finally, we

classical parallel analysis is no longer effective. To do this, we rely on

better than the BGBW one overall, and the contrast is more prominent as the
collision energy increases as the degree of non-equilibrium of the produced

at the same centrality shows a weak dependence of collision energy between 7.7

preexisting AGN dusty tori a few years later after the TDE outburst. The
wind-torus interactions drive two kinds of shocks: the bow shocks at the
windward side of the torus clouds, and the cloud shocks inside the torus
clouds. In a previous work, we proved that the shocked clouds will give rise to
considerable X-ray emissions which can reach $10^{41-42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (so
called \emph{years delayed X-ray afterglows}). In this work, we focus on the
radiations of high energy particles accelerated at both shocks. Benefitting
from the strong radiation field at the inner edge of the torus, the inverse
Compton scatterings of AGN photons by relativistic electrons at bow shocks
dominate the overall gamma-ray radiation. The gamma-ray luminosity can reach
$10^{41}~{\rm erg s^{-1}} (L_{\rm kin}/10^{45}{\rm erg s^{-1}})$, where $L_{\rm

its ability to provide estimations of LAI even over cloudy periods using the
information shared with RVI, which guarantees the solution keeps always tied to
real measurements. Results demonstrate the advantage of MOGP especially for
long data gaps, where optical-based methods notoriously fail. The
leave-one-image-out assessment technique applied to the whole vegetation cover
shows MOGP predictions improve standard GP estimations over short-time gaps

to perform exact diagonalizations of the Hamiltonian provided one considers
only a small number of electrons in an appropriate geometry. Many insights have
been obtained in the past from considering electrons moving on a sphere or on a
torus. In the Landau gauge it is also natural to impose periodic boundary
conditions in only one direction, the cylinder geometry. The interacting
problem now looks formally like a one-dimensional problem that can be attacked
by the standard DMRG algorithm. We have studied the efficiency of this
algorithm to study the ground state properties of the electron liquid at lowest
Landau level filling factor $\nu=1/3$ when the interactions are truncated to
the two most important repulsive hard-core components. Use of finite-size DMRG
allows us to conclude that the ground state is a compressible two-electron

varied object scales, the complexity of backgrounds and various noises. The
skeleton is a highly compressing shape representation, which can bring some
essential advantages but cause the difficulties of detection. This skeleton
line occupies a rare proportion of an image and is overly sensitive to spatial
position. Inspired by these issues, we propose the ProMask, which is a novel
skeleton detection model. The ProMask includes the probability mask and vector
router. The skeleton probability mask representation explicitly encodes
skeletons with segmentation signals, which can provide more supervised
information to learn and pay more attention to ground-truth skeleton pixels.
Moreover, the vector router module possesses two sets of orthogonal basis
vectors in a two-dimensional space, which can dynamically adjust the predicted
skeleton position. We evaluate our method on the well-known skeleton datasets,
realizing the better performance than state-of-the-art approaches. Especially,
ProMask significantly outperforms the competitive DeepFlux by 6.2% on the
challenging SYM-PASCAL dataset. We consider that our proposed skeleton
probability mask could serve as a solid baseline for future skeleton detection,
since it is very effective and it requires about 10 lines of code.

which can effectively solve the problem that the numerical results of the QNMs

We make a careful analysis of the scalar QNM frequencies by using several
numerical methods, and find that the numerical results obtained by the new WKB

(P$\ddot{\text{o}}$schl-Teller potential method) are quite different from those
obtained by the asymptotic iterative method (AIM) and time-domain integration
method when the non-commutative parameter $\theta$ and coupling parameter
$\eta$ are large. The most obvious difference is that the numerical results
obtained by the AIM and the time-domain integration method appear a critical
value $\eta_c$ with an increase of $\eta$, which leads to the dynamical
instability. After carefully analyzing the numeral results, we conclude that
the numerical results obtained by the AIM and the time-domain integration
method are closer to the theoretical values than those obtained by the WKB

Moreover, through a numerical fitting, we obtain that the functional
relationship between the threshold $\eta_c$ and the non-commutative parameter
$\theta$ satisfies $\eta_{c}=a\theta^{b}+c$ for a fixed $l$ approximately. We
find that the stability of dynamics can be ensured in the $\eta<\eta_c(\theta,

contrast to the classic elastic Kendall's theory, there are conditions for
which the load for steady state peeling could be arbitrarily large in steady
state peeling, at low angles of peeling - what they call ""ultratough"" peeling.
It is here shown in fact that this occurs near critical speeds where the
elastic energy term of Kendall's equation is balanced by the viscoelastic
dissipation. Surprisingly, this seems to lead to toughness enhancement higher
than the limit value observed in a very large crack in a infinite viscoelastic
body, possibly even considering a limit on the stress transmitted. Kendall's
experiments in turn had considered viscoelastic tapes (rather than substrates),
and his viscoelastic findinds seem to lead to a much simpler picture. The
Afferrante-Carbone theory suggests the viscoelastic effect to be an on-off

primarily in massive, merging galaxy clusters. In smaller and/or relaxed
clusters, where no halos are detected, one can instead place upper limits to a
possible radio emission. Detections and upper limits are both crucial to
constrain theoretical models for the generation of radio halos. The upper
limits are model dependent for radio interferometers and thus the process of
obtaining these is tedious to perform manually. In this paper, we present a
Python based tool to automate this process of estimating the upper limits. The
tool allows users to create radio halos with defined parameters like physical
size, redshift and brightness model. A family of radio halo models with a range
of flux densities, decided based on the rms noise of the image, is then
injected into the parent visibility file and imaged. The halo injected image
and the original image are then compared to check for the radio halo detection
using a threshold on the detected excess flux density. Injections separated by
finer differences in the flux densities are carried out once the coarse range
where the upper limit is likely to be located has been identified. The code
recommends an upper limit and provides a range of images for manual inspection.
The user may then decide on the upper limit. We discuss the advantages and
limitations of this tool. A wider usage of this tool in the context of the
ongoing and upcoming all sky surveys with the LOFAR and SKA is proposed with
the aim of constraining the physics of radio halo formation. The tool is

machine learning (AutoML). However, due to the expensive evaluation cost of
models (e.g., training deep learning models or training models on large
datasets), vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) is typically computationally
infeasible. To alleviate this issue, Hyperband (HB) utilizes the early stopping
mechanism to speed up configuration evaluations by terminating those
badly-performing configurations in advance. This leads to two kinds of quality
measurements: (1) many low-fidelity measurements for configurations that get
early-stopped, and (2) few high-fidelity measurements for configurations that
are evaluated without being early stopped. The state-of-the-art HB-style
method, BOHB, aims to combine the benefits of both BO and HB. Instead of
sampling configurations randomly in HB, BOHB samples configurations based on a
BO surrogate model, which is constructed with the high-fidelity measurements
only. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements greatly hampers the
efficiency of BO to guide the configuration search. In this paper, we present
MFES-HB, an efficient Hyperband method that is capable of utilizing both the
high-fidelity and low-fidelity measurements to accelerate the convergence of
HPO tasks. Designing MFES-HB is not trivial as the low-fidelity measurements
can be biased yet informative to guide the configuration search. Thus we
propose to build a Multi- Fidelity Ensemble Surrogate (MFES) based on the
generalized Product of Experts framework, which can integrate useful
information from multi-fidelity measurements effectively. The empirical studies
on the real-world AutoML tasks demonstrate that MFES-HB can achieve 3.3-8.9x

crash that may continue for more than a day, termed as mainshock. The effect of
a mainshock in the form of aftershocks can be felt throughout the recovery
phase of stock price. As the market remains in stress during recovery, any
small perturbation leads to a relatively smaller aftershock. The duration of
the recovery phase has been estimated using structural break analysis. We have
carried out statistical analyses of the 1987 stock market crash, 2008 financial
crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic considering the actual crash-times of the
mainshock and aftershocks. Earlier, such analyses were done considering an
absolute one-day return, which cannot capture a crash properly. The results
show that the mainshock and aftershock in the stock market follow the
Gutenberg-Richter (GR) power law. Further, we obtained a higher $\beta$ value
for the COVID-19 crash compared to the financial-crisis-2008 from the GR law.
This implies that the recovery of stock price during COVID-19 may be faster
than the financial-crisis-2008. The result is consistent with the present
recovery of the market from the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis shows that the
high magnitude aftershocks are rare, and low magnitude aftershocks are frequent
during the recovery phase. The analysis also shows that the distribution
$P(\tau_i)$ follows the generalized Pareto distribution, i.e.,
$\displaystyle~P(\tau_i)\propto\frac{1}{\{1+\lambda(q-1)\tau_i\}^{\frac{1}{(q-1)}}}$,
where $\lambda$ and $q$ are constants and $\tau_i$ is the inter-occurrence

states (or the purified reduced density matrices) as images, and a CNN that
maps the images to the target physical parameters. By assuming certain
constraints on the training set for the sake of balance, QubismNet exhibits
impressive powers of learning and generalization on several quantum spin
models. While the training samples are restricted to the states from certain
ranges of the parameters, QubismNet can accurately estimate the parameters of
the states beyond such training regions. For instance, our results show that
QubismNet can estimate the magnetic fields near the critical point by learning
from the states away from the critical vicinity. Our work illuminates a
data-driven way to infer the Hamiltonians that give the designed ground states,
and therefore would benefit the existing and future generalizations of quantum
technologies such as Hamiltonian-based quantum simulations and state
tomography.

simulate flows laden with particles. Its accuracy, however, is known to
deteriorate as the ratio between the particle diameter~($\smash{d_\text{p}}$)
and the mesh spacing~($h$) increases, due to the impact of the momentum that is
fed back to the flow by the Lagrangian particles. Although the community
typically recommends particle diameters to be at least an order of magnitude
smaller than the mesh spacing, the errors corresponding to a given
$\smash{d_\text{p} / h}$ ratio and/or flow regime have not been systematically
studied. In~this paper, we provide an expression to estimate the magnitude of
the flow velocity disturbance resulting from the transport of a particle in the
PSIC-EL framework, based on the $\smash{d_\text{p} / h}$ ratio and the particle
Reynolds number, $\smash{\text{Re}_\text{p}}$. This, in turn, directly relates
to the error in the estimation of the undisturbed velocity, and therefore to
the error in the prediction of the particle motion. We show that the upper
bound of the relative error in the estimation of the undisturbed velocity, for
all particle Reynolds numbers, is approximated by $\smash{(6/5)\,d_\text{p} /

analyzing 2D images/videos, it is still non-trivial to apply the well-developed
2D techniques in regular domains to the irregular 3D point cloud data. To
bridge this gap, we propose ParaNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning
framework, for representing 3D point clouds in a completely regular and nearly
lossless manner. To be specific, ParaNet converts an irregular 3D point cloud
into a regular 2D color image, named point geometry image (PGI), where each
pixel encodes the spatial coordinates of a point. In contrast to conventional
regular representation modalities based on multi-view projection and
voxelization, the proposed representation is differentiable and reversible.
Technically, ParaNet is composed of a surface embedding module, which
parameterizes 3D surface points onto a unit square, and a grid resampling
module, which resamples the embedded 2D manifold over regular dense grids. Note
that ParaNet is unsupervised, i.e., the training simply relies on
reference-free geometry constraints. The PGIs can be seamlessly coupled with a
task network established upon standard and mature techniques for 2D
images/videos to realize a specific task for 3D point clouds. We evaluate
ParaNet over shape classification and point cloud upsampling, in which our
solutions perform favorably against the existing state-of-the-art methods. We
believe such a paradigm will open up many possibilities to advance the progress

projective measurements are needed, instead of the joint Bell measurements that

First, we propose a new computational
method to investigate the particularities of evolution. Second, we apply this
method to a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and explore the evolution
of mutational robustness and bistability. Living systems have developed their
functions through evolutionary processes. To understand the particularities of
this process theoretically, evolutionary simulation (ES) alone is insufficient
because the outcomes of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. We need a reference
system for comparison. An appropriate reference system for this purpose is an
ensemble of the randomly sampled genotypes. However, generating high-fitness
genotypes by simple random sampling is difficult because such genotypes are
rare. In this study, we used the multicanonical Monte Carlo method developed in
statistical physics to construct a reference ensemble of GRNs and compared it
with the outcomes of ES. We obtained the following results. First, mutational
robustness was significantly higher in ES than in the reference ensemble at the
same fitness level. Second, the emergence of a new phenotype, bistability, was
delayed in evolution. Third, the bistable group of GRNs contains many
mutationally fragile GRNs compared with those in the non-bistable group. This
suggests that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the
mutation-selection mechanism.

system, where the D2D transmitters (DTs) act as relays to assist the densified
cellular network users (CUs) for transmission quality of service (QoS)
improvement. The proposed system achieves a win-win situation, i.e. improving
the spectrum efficiency of the CUs that cannot meet their rate requirement
while providing spectrum access for D2D pairs. Unlike previous works, to reduce
the overhead, we design a novel two-timescale resource allocation scheme, in
which the pairing between CUs and D2D pairs is decided at a long timescale and
transmission time for CU and D2D pair is determined at a short timescale.
Specifically, to characterize the long-term payoff of each potential CU-D2D
pair, we investigate the optimal cooperation policy to decide the transmission
time based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We prove that
the optimal policy is a threshold policy which can be achieved via binary
search. Since CUs and D2D pairs are self-interested, they are paired only when
they agree to cooperate mutually. Therefore, to study the cooperation behaviors
of CUs and D2D pairs, we formulate the pairing problem as a matching game,
based on the long-term payoff achieved by the optimal cooperation policy of
each possible pairing. Furthermore, unlike most previous matching models in D2D
networks, we allow transfer between CUs and D2D pairs to improve the
performance. To solve the pairing problem, a distributed algorithm is proposed,
which converges to an \epsilon-stable matching. We show that there is a
tradeoff between the optimality and the computational complexity of the
algorithm. We also analyze the algorithm in terms of the robustness to the
unilateral deviation of D2D pairs. Finally, the simulation results verify the
efficiency of the proposed matching algorithm.

Moreover, these studies have ignored one electrophysiological aspect of the

the excitable regime, the asymptotic matching of the Levy timescale (that
follows a power law, unlike Gaussian noise that follows Kramers law) and the
deterministic timescale (controlled by the singular parameter) can also induce

noise is not always higher than that of Gaussian noise. Second, we show that,
for both types of noises, the two memristive properties of the neuron have
opposite effects on the degree of SISR: the stronger the feedback gain

saturation of the magnetic flux, the higher the degree of SISR. Finally, we

evolution. In particular, the emission properties vary from pulse to pulse in
multipulse bursts. Here we present a time-resolved Bayesian spectral analysis
of a compilation of GRB pulses observed by the {\it Fermi}/Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor. The pulses are selected to have at least four timebins with a high
statistical significance, which ensures that the spectral fits are well
determined and that spectral correlations can be established. The sample
consists of 39 bursts, 117 pulses, and 1228 spectra. We confirm the general
trend that pulses become softer over time, with mainly the low-energy power-law
index $\alpha$ becoming smaller. A few exceptions to this trend exist, with the
hardest pulse occurring at late times. The first pulse in a burst is clearly
different from the later pulses; three-fourths of them violate the synchrotron
line of death, while around half of them significantly prefer photospheric
emission. These fractions decrease for subsequent pulses. We also find that in
two-thirds of the pulses, the spectral parameters ($\alpha$ and peak energy)
track the light-curve variations. This is a larger fraction compared to what is
found in previous samples. In conclusion, emission compatible with the GRB
photosphere is typically found close to the trigger time, while the chance of
detecting synchrotron emission is greatest at late times. This allows for the
coexistence of emission mechanisms at late times.

flares in a magnetized electron-positron plasma, with weak and strong radiative
cooling. Such flares can be generated around neutron stars and accreting black
holes. We focus on the magnetically-dominated regime where tension of the
background magnetic field lines exceeds the plasma rest mass by a factor
$\sigma_0 > 1$. In the simulations, turbulence is excited on a macroscopic
scale $l_0$, and we observe that it develops by forming thin, dynamic current
sheets on various scales. The deposited macroscopic energy dissipates by
energizing thermal and nonthermal particles. The particle energy distribution
is shaped by impulsive acceleration in reconnecting current sheets, gradual
stochastic acceleration, and radiative losses. We parameterize radiative
cooling by the ratio $A$ of light-crossing time $l_0/c$ to a cooling timescale,
and study the effect of increasing $A$ on the flare. When radiative losses are
sufficiently weak, $A<\sigma_0^{-1}$, the produced emission is dominated by
stochastically accelerated particles, and the radiative power depends
logarithmically on $A$. The resulting flare radiation spectrum is broad and
anisotropic. In the strong-cooling regime, $A>\sigma_0^{-1}$, stochastic
acceleration is suppressed while impulsive acceleration in the current sheets
continues to operate. As $A$ increases further, the emission becomes dominated
by thermal particles. Our simulations offer a new tool to study particle
acceleration by turbulence, especially at high energies, where cooling competes
with acceleration. We find that the particle distribution is influenced by
strong intermittency of dissipation, and stochastic acceleration cannot be
described by a universal diffusion coefficient.

that the magnetic shielding contributions mainly originate from the studied

reflects the real state of urban density distribution. The parameters of these

Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes equations implemented in the OpenFOAM
framework. The sediment is simulated with the help of a Bingham model, which
basically models a solid sediment behavior by introducing a very high
viscosity. The relative pressure used by the Bingham model is estimated with a
new approach based on the solution of a Poisson equation. The position of the
sediment surface is calculated with the Volume-of-Fluid approach using a
high-resolution scheme. To keep the typical wall characteristics without
demanding a fine grid, the common wall functions are transferred to the domain
internal sediment walls. Furthermore, additional modifications are applied to
model a solid sediment wall inside the solution domain. The new internal wall
function implementation is validated with a 2D test case. The results show a
very good agreement to common wall functions and a significant improvement
compared to its negligence. Furthermore the solver is used to simulate the
scour downstream of an apron and the scour around a vertical cylinder in
current. The results are compared to experiments presented in the literature
and show good agreement. The applicability onto arbitrary structures is
demonstrated by applying the solver onto a vertical cylinder with a mudplate.
The current development state is able to resolve all important physical flow
and scour phenomena. The results also unveil that modeling of the suspension
and the treatment of the internal wall need additional attention.

differential-operator equation are discussed. A fundamental feature of the
problem under study is that the equation includes a fractional power of the
self-adjoint positive operator. In computational practice, rational
approximations of the fractional power operator are widely used in various
versions. The purpose of this work is to construct special approximations in
time when the transition to a new level in time provided a set of standard
problems for the operator and not for the fractional power operator. Stable
splitting schemes with weights parameters are proposed for the additive
representation of rational approximation for a fractional power operator.
Possibilities of using similar time approximations for other problems are
noted. The numerical solution of a two-dimensional non-stationary problem with
a fractional power of the Laplace operator is also presented.

their ability to memorize noisy labels during training, reducing their

goal of OD to spot rare, minority samples in a given population. However, when
being a minority (as defined by protected variables, such as
race/ethnicity/sex/age) does not reflect positive-class membership (such as
criminal/fraud), OD produces unjust outcomes. Surprisingly, fairness-aware OD
has been almost untouched in prior work, as fair machine learning literature
mainly focuses on supervised settings. Our work aims to bridge this gap.
Specifically, we develop desiderata capturing well-motivated fairness criteria
for OD, and systematically formalize the fair OD problem. Further, guided by
our desiderata, we propose FairOD, a fairness-aware outlier detector that has
the following desirable properties: FairOD (1) exhibits treatment parity at
test time, (2) aims to flag equal proportions of samples from all groups (i.e.
obtain group fairness, via statistical parity), and (3) strives to flag truly
high-risk samples within each group. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of
synthetic and real world datasets show that FairOD produces outcomes that are
fair with respect to protected variables, while performing comparable to (and
in some cases, even better than) fairness-agnostic detectors in terms of
detection performance.

to its applications in mobile health monitoring, activity recognition, and
patient rehabilitation. The typical approach is training a HAR classifier
offline with known users and then using the same classifier for new users.
However, the accuracy for new users can be low with this approach if their
activity patterns are different than those in the training data. At the same
time, training from scratch for new users is not feasible for mobile
applications due to the high computational cost and training time. To address
this issue, we propose a HAR transfer learning framework with two components.
First, a representational analysis reveals common features that can transfer
across users and user-specific features that need to be customized. Using this
insight, we transfer the reusable portion of the offline classifier to new
users and fine-tune only the rest. Our experiments with five datasets show up
to 43% accuracy improvement and 66% training time reduction when compared to
the baseline without using transfer learning. Furthermore, measurements on the
Nvidia Jetson Xavier-NX hardware platform reveal that the power and energy
consumption decrease by 43% and 68%, respectively, while achieving the same or

improving, their runtime performance still suffers, especially under this

calculations using hybrid functionals of several types. This procedure should
allow much better insight into how to obtain acceptable materials.

  of a University Dormitory Using Weather Normalization",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
electricity consumption of a university dormitory building in the southern U.S.
The historical electricity consumption data of this university dormitory
building and weather data of an on-campus weather station, which were collected
from January 1st, 2017 to July 31st, 2020, were used for analysis. Four inverse
data-driven prediction models, i.e., Artificial Neural Network, Long Short-Term
Memory Recurrent Neural Network, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient
Boosting Machine, were exploited to account for the influence of the weather
conditions. The results suggested that the total electricity consumption of the
objective building decreased by nearly 41% (about 276,000 kWh (942 MMBtu))
compared with the prediction value during the campus shutdown due to the
COVID-19. Besides, the daily load ratio (DLR) varied significantly as well. In
general, the DLR decreased gradually from 80% to nearly 40% in the second half
of March 2020, maintained on a relatively stable level between 30% to 60% in
April, May, and June 2020, and then slowly recovered to 80% of the normal
capacity in July 2020.

  system","http://airccse.org/csit/V10N16.html",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate detection of the feature points of the projected pattern plays an
extremely important role in one-shot 3D reconstruction systems, especially for
the ones using a grid pattern. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a
grid-point detection method based on U-net. A specific dataset is designed that
includes the images captured with the two-shot imaging method and the ones
acquired with the one-shot imaging method. Among them, the images in the first
group after labeled as the ground truth images and the images captured at the
same pose with the one-shot method are cut into small patches with the size of
64x64 pixels then feed to the training set. The remaining of the images in the
second group is the test set. The experimental results show that our method can
achieve a better detecting performance with higher accuracy in comparison with
the previous methods.

framework combined traditional pathfinding algorithm and reinforcement
learning. In our approach, the agents learn whether to be navigated or to take
simple actions to avoid their partners via a deep neural network trained by
reinforcement learning at each time step. This framework makes it possible for
agents to arrive terminal points in abstract new scenarios. In our experiments,
we use Unity3D and Tensorflow to build the model and environment for our
scenarios. We analyze the results and modify the parameters to approach a
well-behaved strategy for our agents. Our strategy could be attached in
different environments under different cases, especially when the scale is
large.

models, i.e., ""a simulation model for pedestrian crowd evacuation based on
various AI techniques"", developed in late 2019. This study adds a new feature
to the developed model by proposing a new method and integrating it with the
model. This method enables the developed model to find a more appropriate
evacuation area design, among others regarding safety due to selecting the best
exit door location among many suggested locations. This method is completely
dependent on the selected model's output, i.e., the evacuation time for each
individual within the evacuation process. The new method finds an average of
the evacuees' evacuation times of each exit door location; then, based on the
average evacuation time, it decides which exit door location would be the best
exit door to be used for evacuation by the evacuees. To validate the method,
various designs for the evacuation area with various written scenarios were
used. The results showed that the model with this new method could predict a
proper exit door location among many suggested locations. Lastly, from the
results of this research using the integration of this newly proposed method, a
new capability for the selected model in terms of safety allowed the right
decision in selecting the finest design for the evacuation area among other
designs.

critical flaw in their methodological design that is a common issue in
Astronomy, namely ""selection biases"". An effect that if not treated properly
may lead to unwarranted causality claims. In their analysis, selection biases
seem to be present in the response rate of their survey (8.35%), the choice of
database, success criterion, and the overlook of the numerous drawbacks female
researchers face in academia. We discuss these issues and their implications --
one of them being the potential increase in obstacles for women in academia.
Finally, we reinforce the dangers of not considering selection bias effects in
studies aimed at retrieving causal relations.
