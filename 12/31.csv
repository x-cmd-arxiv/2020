scientific interest and practical importance for their applications in a broad
range. In this work, thermal conductivity of one-dimensional heterostructure
consisting of carbon and boron nitride nanotubes is systematically investigated
via molecular dynamics simulations. Thermal conductivity is found to have
strong dependences on temperature, length and diameter. In addition, the axial
strain and intensity of van der Waals interaction are demonstrated to be able
to modulate thermal conductivity up to about 43% and 37%, respectively.
Moreover, the dependence of thermal conductivity on the chirality of
componential nanotubes is studied. These results are explained based on lattice
dynamics insights. This work not only provides feasible strategies to modulate
thermal conductivity, but also enhances the understanding of the fundamental
physics of phonon transport in one-dimensional heterostructure.

the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental

that we adopt in the general scenario, turns out to be strictly weaker than the

theory, where the proposed notion of causal influence determines a redefinition
of the neighbourhood of a cell in cellular automata. We stress that, according
to our definition, it is impossible anyway to have causal influence in the
absence of an interaction, e.g.~in a Bell-like scenario. We study various
conditions for causal influence, and introduce the feature that we call no
interaction without disturbance, under which we prove that signalling and
causal influence coincide. The proposed definition has interesting consequences
on the analysis of causal networks, and leads to a revision of the notion of
neighbourhood for classical cellular automata, clarifying a puzzle regarding
their quantisation that apparently makes the neighbourhood larger than the
original one.

the solid state where their linearly dispersing Dirac bands cross at continuous

degeneracy, however, has been vulnerable to suppression by the ubiquitous
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Despite the current effort to discover 3D DNLSs that
are robust to SOC by theory, positive experimental evidence is yet to emerge.
In 2D DNLSs, because of the decreased total density of states as compared with
their 3D counterparts, it is anticipated that their physical properties would
be dominated by the electronic states defined by the DNL. It has been even more
challenging, however, to discover robust 2D DNLSs against SOC because of their
lowered symmetry; no such materials have yet been predicted by theory. By
combining molecular beam epitaxy growth, STM, nc-AFM characterisation, with DFT

symmetry protection and thermal stability are imparted by the compressive vdW

below the zero-point uncertainty. When this happens, the measurement leaves the
resonator in a quantum squeezed state. The squeezed state so generated is
however conditional on the measurement outcomes, while for most applications it
is desirable to have a deterministic, i.e., unconditional, squeezed state with
the desired properties. In this work we apply feedback control to achieve
deterministic manipulation of mechanical squeezing in an optomechanical system
subject to a continuous BAE measurement. We study in details two strategies,
direct (Markovian) and state-based (Bayesian) feedback. We show that both are
capable to achieve optimal performances, i.e., a vanishing noise added by the
feedback loop. Moreover, even when the feedback is restricted to be a
time-varying mechanical force (experimentally friendly scenario) and an
imperfect BAE regime is considered, the ensuing non-optimal feedback may still
obtain significant amount of squeezing. In particular, we show that Bayesian
feedback control is nearly optimal for a wide range of sideband resolution. Our
analysis is of direct relevance for ultra-sensitive measurements and quantum

relies on a machine learned surrogate model of energies and forces, trained
on-the-fly, to explore configuration space, eliminating the need for expensive
relaxations of all candidate structures using first-principles methods. In this
paper we elaborate on the importance of the use of a Gaussian kernel with two
length scales in the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate model. We
further explore the role of the use in GOFEE of the lower confidence bound for
relaxation and selection of candidate structures. In addition, we present two
improvements to the method: 1) the population generation now relies on a
clustering of all low-energy structures evaluated with DFT, with the lowest
energy member of each cluster making up the population. 2) the very final
relaxations in well-sampled basins of the energy landscape, the final
exploitation steps, are now performed as continued relaxation paths within the
first-principles method, to allow for arbitrarily fine relaxations of the best
structures, independently of the predictive resolution of the surrogate model.
The versatility of the GOFEE method is demonstrated by applying it to identify
the low-energy structures of gas-phase fullerene-type 24-atom carbon clusters

equilibrium of the crust that minimizes deviatoric stresses, or as a dynamic
process resulting from the viscous relaxation of the non-hydrostatic crustal
shape. Paper I gave a general formulation of Airy isostasy as an elastic
loading problem solved with Love numbers, and applied it to the case of minimum
stress isostasy. In this sequel, the same framework is used to study Airy
isostasy as the long-time evolution of a viscoelastic shell submitted to
surface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of
time-dependent deviatoric Love numbers. Dynamic isostasy depends on the loading
history, two examples of which are the constant load applied on the surface in
the far past and the constant shape maintained by addition or removal of
material at the compensation depth. The former model results in a shape
decreasing exponentially with time and has no elastic analog, whereas the
latter (stationary) model is equivalent to a form of elastic isostasy.
Viscoelastic and viscous approaches are completely equivalent. If both load and
shape vary slowly with time, isostatic ratios look like those of the stationary
model. Isostatic models thus belong to two independent groups: the
elastic/stationary approaches and the time-dependent approaches. If the shell
is homogeneous, all models predict a similar compensation of large-scale
gravity perturbations. If the shell rheology depends on depth, stationary
models predict more compensation at long wavelengths, whereas time-dependent
models result in negligible compensation. Mathematica and Fortran codes are
available for computing the isostatic ratios of an incompressible body with
three homogeneous layers.

the spring mechanism is characterized to ensure sufficient stabilizing force

method is suggested for power considerations for our robot that calculates
minimum battery capacity and operation duration in the extreme operating

Standard ML is the canonical representative of the ML family of functional

identify a hidden local symmetry, whose explicit consideration and
factorization utilizing of a Fujikawa prescription, leads to the construction
of relativistic propagators that satisfy the Chapman-Kolmogorov identity. By
means of a detailed topological analysis, we find three different relativistic
propagators (orthochronous, space-like, and Feynman) which are obtained from
the exclusive integration of paths within different sectors in Minkowski space.
Finally, the connection of this approach to the Feynman checkerboard

an important natural language processing problem. Most previous work has been
heavily relying on labor-intensive and domain-specific annotations while
ignoring the semantic meaning contained in the labels of the event types. As a
result, the learned models cannot effectively generalize to new domains, where
new event types could be introduced. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
event extraction pipeline, which first identifies events with available tools
(e.g., SRL) and then automatically maps them to pre-defined event types with
our proposed unsupervised classification model. Rather than relying on
annotated data, our model matches the semantics of identified events with those
of event type labels. Specifically, we leverage pre-trained language models to
contextually represent pre-defined types for both event triggers and arguments.
After we map identified events to the target types via representation
similarity, we use the event ontology (e.g., argument type ""Victim"" can only
appear as the argument of event type ""Attack"") as global constraints to
regularize the prediction. The proposed approach is shown to be very effective
when tested on the ACE-2005 dataset, which has 33 trigger and 22 argument
types. Without using any annotation, we successfully map 83% of the triggers
and 54% of the arguments to the correct types, almost doubling the performance
of previous zero-shot approaches.

$\sim$ $-$21.84 $\pm$ 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak
decaying rates. The bolometric light curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak
luminosity ($L_{max}$) of $\sim$(3.9 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$

that of fast-evolving SN 2010gx. The absorption features of SN 2020ank are
blueshifted compared to Gaia16apd, suggesting a higher expansion velocity. The

generalizes the recording technique of Zhandry (Crypto'19). As an application,
we revisit the formal treatment of security of the core of the Bitcoin
consensus protocol, the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt'15), against quantum
adversaries, while honest parties are classical and show that protocol's
security holds under a quantum analogue of the classical ``honest majority''

guaranteed provided the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so
that each quantum query is worth $O(p^{-1/2})$ classical ones, where $p$ is the
success probability of a single classical query to the protocol's underlying

field (photons) and quantized mechanical vibrations (phonons) produces hybrid
quasi-particle states, known as phonon-polaritons. Their typical signature is
the avoided crossing between the eigenfrequencies of the coupled system, as
paradigmatically illustrated by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, and observed
in quantum electrodynamics experiments where cavity photons are coupled to
atoms, ions, excitons, spin ensambles and superconducting qubits. In this work,
we demonstrate the generation of phonon-polaritons in the quantum motion of an
optically-levitated nanosphere. The particle is trapped in high vacuum by an
optical tweezer and strongly coupled to a single cavity mode by coherent
scattering of the tweezer photons. The two-dimensional motion splits into two
nearly-degenerate components that, together with the optical cavity mode,
define an optomechanical system with three degrees-of-freedom. As such, when
entering the strong coupling regime, we observe hybrid light-mechanical states
with a dispersion law typical of tripartite quantum systems. Remarkably, the
independent components of motion here identify a physical vibration direction
on a plane that, similarly to the polarization of light, confers a vectorial
nature to the polariton field. Our results pave the way to novel protocols for
quantum information transfer between photonic and phononic components and
represent a key-step towards the demonstration of optomechanical entangled
states at room temperature.

work is to introduce the novel graph matching techniques using the
representational power of the graph and apply it to structural pattern
recognition applications. We present an extensive survey of various exact and
inexact graph matching techniques. Graph matching using the concept of
homeomorphism is presented. A category of graph matching algorithms is
presented, which reduces the graph size by removing the less important nodes
using some measure of relevance. We present an approach to error-tolerant graph
matching using node contraction where the given graph is transformed into
another graph by contracting smaller degree nodes. We use this scheme to extend
the notion of graph edit distance, which can be used as a trade-off between
execution time and accuracy. We describe an approach to graph matching by
utilizing the various node centrality information, which reduces the graph size
by removing a fraction of nodes from both graphs based on a given centrality
measure. The graph matching problem is inherently linked to the geometry and
topology of graphs. We introduce a novel approach to measure graph similarity
using geometric graphs. We define the vertex distance between two geometric
graphs using the position of their vertices and show it to be a metric over the
set of all graphs with vertices only. We define edge distance between two

optical images, digital elevation maps (DEMs), and slope maps for automatic
crater detection on the lunar surface. Mask R-CNN, tuned for the crater
detection task, is utilized in this paper. Two catalogs, namely, Head-LROC and
Robbins, are used for the performance evaluation. Exhaustive analysis of the
detection results on the lunar surface has been performed with respect to both
Head-LROC and Robbins catalog. With the Head-LROC catalog, which has relatively
strict crater markings and larger possibility of missing craters, recall value
of 94.28\% has been obtained as compared to 88.03\% for the baseline method.
However, with respect to a manually marked exhaustive crater catalog based on
relatively liberal marking, significant precision and recall values are
obtained for different crater size ranges. The generalization capability of the
proposed method in terms of crater detection on a different terrain with
different input data type is also evaluated. We show that the proposed model
trained on the lunar surface with optical images, DEMs and corresponding slope
maps can be used to detect craters on the Martian surface even with entirely
different input data type, such as thermal IR images from the Martian surface.

We extend the formulation of the Eisenhart lift to quantum systems, and show
that the lifted manifold recreates not only the classical effects of the
potential, but also its quantum mechanical effects. In particular, we find that
the solutions of the Schrodinger equations of the lifted system reduce to those
of the original system after projecting out the new degrees of freedom. In this

lifted momentum of the classical system. We further apply the Eisenhart lift to
Quantum Field Theory (QFT). We show that a lifted field space manifold is able
to recreate both the classical and quantum effects of a scalar field potential.
We find that, in the case of QFT, the analogue of the lifted momentum is a
quantum charge that is conserved not only in time, but also in space. The
different possible values for this charge label an ensemble of Fock spaces that
are all disjoint from one another. The relevance of these extended Fock spaces
to the cosmological constant and gauge hierarchy problems is considered.

others a multitude of times, with consequences of cratering, erosion, spin
increments, fragmentation, and occasional catastrophic disruption and
dispersion. Extensive information for asteroid orbits, sizes, shapes,
composition, and rotation rates of those asteroids is now available. Those are
a result of their history, but to interpret them requires understanding the
processes. That understanding can be improved by simulations of the history. A
simulation needs robust models of the dynamical and collisional events. Such
models have evolved substantially in the last few decades. Here I present
current models, a method, and a code ""SSAH"" for stochastic simulations of the
history of the main belt. That code gives a framework upon which existing and

investigated over the past two decades. The predictive performance of tree
based machine learning methods, in general, improves with a decreasing rate as
the size of training data increases. We investigate this in optimal trees
ensemble (OTE) where the method fails to learn from some of the training
observations due to internal validation. Modified tree selection methods are
thus proposed for OTE to cater for the loss of training observations in
internal validation. In the first method, corresponding out-of-bag (OOB)
observations are used in both individual and collective performance assessment
for each tree. Trees are ranked based on their individual performance on the
OOB observations. A certain number of top ranked trees is selected and starting
from the most accurate tree, subsequent trees are added one by one and their
impact is recorded by using the OOB observations left out from the bootstrap
sample taken for the tree being added. A tree is selected if it improves
predictive accuracy of the ensemble. In the second approach, trees are grown on
random subsets, taken without replacement-known as sub-bagging, of the training
data instead of bootstrap samples (taken with replacement). The remaining
observations from each sample are used in both individual and collective
assessments for each corresponding tree similar to the first method. Analysis
on 21 benchmark datasets and simulations studies show improved performance of
the modified methods in comparison to OTE and other state-of-the-art methods.

approximate groups, extending work of Bj\""orklund and the second-named author.
Our theory is based on the notion of a quasi-isometric quasi-action (qiqac) of
an approximate group on a metric space.
  More specifically, we introduce a geometric notion of finite generation for
approximate group and prove that every geometrically finitely-generated
approximate group admits a geometric qiqac on a proper geodesic metric space.
We then show that all such spaces are quasi-isometric, hence can be used to
associate a canonical QI type with every geometrically finitely-generated
approximate group. This in turn allows us to define geometric invariants of
approximate groups using QI invariants of metric spaces. Among the invariants
we consider are asymptotic dimension, finiteness properties, numbers of ends
and growth type. For geometrically finitely-generated approximate groups of
polynomial growth we derive a version of Gromov's polynomial growth theorem,
based on work of Hrushovski and Breuillard--Green--Tao.
  A particular focus is on qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Our strongest results
are obtained for approximate groups which admit a geometric qiqac on a proper
geodesic hyperbolic space. For such ""hyperbolic approximate groups"" we
establish a number of fundamental properties in analogy with the case of
hyperbolic groups. For example, we show that their asymptotic dimension is one
larger than the topological dimension of their Gromov boundary and that - under
some mild assumption of being ""non-elementary"" - they have exponential growth
and act minimally on their Gromov boundary. We also study convex cocompact
qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Using the theory of Morse boundaries, we extend
some of our results concerning qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces to qiqacs on proper
geodesic metric spaces with non-trivial Morse boundary.

develop a constrained likelihood formulation where this matrix is constrained

fabricated on a lithium niobate substrate. Each of the nanostrip is 250-nm wide
and is made of 680-nm-thick SiO2 layer stacking on 50-nm Al metal electrodes.
Finite element analysis reveals that the device operates in a vertically
polarized (compression) mode with substantial acoustic energy confined in the
nanostrips, leading to a local resonance at low acoustic velocity. Due to the
nonlinearity, the resonance frequency of the device decreases quadratically
with the increase of stimulation power from 10 to 30 dBm. The underlying
mechanism of the nonlinearity is found to be the power-dependent coupling of
the adjacent nanostrips. This coupling induces softening of the substrate
surface region, which reduces the acoustic velocity and hence the bulk
radiation. As a result, the quality factor of the NPM resonator is found to
improve with the increase of stimulation power. The power-dependent coupling of
nanostrips in the NPM resonator demonstrates a reliable method for the
realization of nonlinearity in phononic metasurfaces, which would significantly
enrich the mechanisms for the manipulation of surface acoustic waves at high
frequencies.

and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM
counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the
relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic

sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via
the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW

learning to predict credit risk are driven by gradient boosted decision tree

outperformed the benchmark non-sequential tree-based model, achieving
significant financial savings and earlier detection of credit risk. We also

supposes to be. The dynamical source of these complications has been identified
with the tadpole/seagull term, which renormalized version called, the mass gap.
Its true dynamical role is hidden in the QCD ground state, but it is explicitly
present in the full gluon self-energy. To disclose it the splintering between
the transverse conditions for the full gluon self-energy and its subtracted
counterpart has been derived. The equation of motion for the full gluon
propagator on account of the mass gap was given, which allows to fix the
dynamical and gauge structures by a newly-introduced generalized gauge. A novel
non-perturbative analytical method, the mass gap approach was developed for QCD
and its groud state as well. We have discovered a general, non-perturbative
singular solution for the full gluon propagator valid in the whole gluon
momentum range, while dominating at large distances over all the other possible
solutions. It accommodates all the severe infrared singularities, which may
appear in the QCD ground state due to the self-interaction of massless gluon
modes. A corresponding non-pertubative multiplicative infrared renormalization
program has been formulated. The resulting full gluon propagator prevents
gluons to appear at large distances as physical states (confinement of color
gluons). Our approach also explains the scale violation in the asymptotic
freedom regime, and why the rising potential between heavy quarks is only
linear one.

demanding. For example, in the case of local likelihood estimation, even
fitting covariance models on modest size windows can overwhelm typical

of using neural network (NN) methods to approximate ML estimates. We train NNs
to take moderate size spatial fields or variograms as input and return the
range and noise-to-signal covariance parameters. Once trained, the NNs provide
estimates with a similar accuracy compared to ML estimation and at a speedup by
a factor of 100 or more. Although we focus on a specific covariance estimation

As the astronomical community prepares for the coming of a number of new
facilities able to survey the non-thermal sky at unprecedented depths, from
radio to gamma-rays, machine learning techniques for fast and reliable source
identification are ever more relevant. The purpose of this work was to develop
a deep learning architecture to identify blazar within a population of AGN
based solely on non-contemporaneous spectral energy distribution information,
collected from publicly available multi-frequency catalogues. This study uses
an unprecedented amount of data, with SEDs for $\approx 14,000$ sources
collected with the Open Universe VOU-Blazars tool. It uses a convolutional
long-short term memory neural network purposefully built for the problem of SED
classification, which we describe in detail and validate. The network was able
to distinguish blazars from other types of AGNs to a satisfying degree
(achieving a ROC area under curve of $0.98$), even when trained on a reduced
subset of the whole sample. This initial study does not attempt to classify
blazars among their different sub-classes, or quantify the likelihood of any
multi-frequency or multi-messenger association, but is presented as a step
towards these more practically-oriented applications.

arguably being one of the most well-known ones. Since 2007, it has been a
frequent target of the research community, conducting empirical studies and
building dedicated methods and tools for analyzing, configuring, testing,
optimizing, and maintaining the kernel in the light of its vast configuration
space. However, despite a large body of work, mainly bug fixes that were the
result of such research made it back into the kernel's source tree.
Unfortunately, Linux users still struggle with kernel configuration and
resolving configuration conflicts, since the kernel largely lacks automated
support. Additionally, there are technical and community requirements for
supporting automated conflict resolution in the kernel, such as, for example,
using a pure C-based solution that uses only compatible third-party libraries
(if any). With the aim of contributing back to the Linux community, we present
CONFIGFIX, a tooling that we integrated with the kernel configurator, that is
purely implemented in C, and that is finally a working solution able to produce
fixes for configuration conflicts. In this experience report, we describe our
experiences ranging over a decade of building upon the large body of work from
research on the Linux kernel configuration mechanisms as well as how we
designed and realized CONFIGFIX while adhering to the Linux kernel's community
requirements and standards. While CONFIGFIX helps Linux kernel users obtaining
their desired configuration, the sound semantic abstraction we implement
provides the basis for many of the above techniques supporting kernel
configuration, helping researchers and kernel developers.

reconstructed scene. However, fully automated registration of such long-range
pairs is (i) challenging when the registration of images itself is difficult;
and (ii) computationally expensive for long sequences due to the large number
of candidate pairs for registration. In this paper, we introduce an efficient
framework for the active annotation of long-range pairwise correspondences in a
sequence. Our framework suggests pairs of images that are sought to be
informative to an oracle agent (e.g., a human user, or a reliable matching
algorithm) who provides visual correspondences on each suggested pair.
Informative pairs are retrieved according to an iterative strategy based on a
principled annotation reward coupled with two complementary and online
adaptable models of frame overlap. In addition to the efficient construction of
a mosaic, our framework provides, as a by-product, ground truth landmark
correspondences which can be used for evaluation or learning purposes. We
evaluate our approach in both automated and interactive scenarios via
experiments on synthetic sequences, on a publicly available dataset for aerial
imaging and on a clinical dataset for placenta mosaicking during fetal surgery.

results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art fracture

curve (AUROC) of 0.9318 and a free-response receiver operating characteristic
(FROC) score of 0.8914 on the rib fractures, significantly outperforming
previous approaches by an AUROC gap of 1.63% and an FROC improvement by 3.74%.

attracting increasing interest in mechanical metamaterials due to their strong

studies the band topology and scattering behaviors near EPs, using discrete
models of metamaterial (MM) systems. The questions of existence of EPs and
their physical manifestations will be addressed with particular focus on
symmetry considerations and scattering behavior. Discrete mass-spring models
with adjustable parameters are used here to elucidate the EP-related phenomena
in a fundamental form. The transfer and scattering matrices are analyzed to
provide practical insights on the restrictions associated with reciprocity and
fundamental symmetries. By including complex stiffness in frequency domain as a
representation of non-conservative mechanical loss or gain, the MM arrays can
be tuned to achieve bi-directional transparency or one-way reflection when
operating at the EPs. This analytical study will contribute to the
understandings of EPs in mechanical context and the design of micro-structured

convex optimization problems appearing in structured statistical learning.
However, the traditional Frank-Wolfe method can only be applied when the
feasible region is bounded, which limits its applicability in practice.
Motivated by two applications in statistical learning, the $\ell_1$ trend
filtering problem and matrix optimization problems with generalized nuclear
norm constraints, we study a family of convex optimization problems where the
unbounded feasible region is the direct sum of an unbounded linear subspace and
a bounded constraint set. We propose two new Frank-Wolfe methods: unbounded
Frank-Wolfe method (uFW) and unbounded Away-Step Frank-Wolfe method (uAFW), for
solving a family of convex optimization problems with this class of unbounded
feasible regions. We show that under proper regularity conditions, the
unbounded Frank-Wolfe method has a $O(1/k)$ sublinear convergence rate, and
unbounded Away-Step Frank-Wolfe method has a linear convergence rate, matching
the best-known results for the Frank-Wolfe method when the feasible region is
bounded. Furthermore, computational experiments indicate that our proposed
methods appear to outperform alternative solvers.

we demonstrate that using per capita rates to rank cities can produce
substantially different rankings from rankings adjusted for population size. We
analyze the population-crime relationship in cities across 12 countries and
assess the impact of per capita measurements on crime analyses, depending on

high-velocity jets in SiO (5-4) are detected in 67% of the sources (for the
first time in IRAS4B2, IRAS4B1, L1448-NB, SerpS-MM18a), and 77% of these also
show jet/outflow emission in SO ($5_6-4_5$). In 5 sources (24% of the sample)
SO ($5_6-4_5$) probes the inner envelope and/or the disk. The CALYPSO survey
shows that the outflow phenomenon is ubiquitous and that the detection rate of
high-velocity jets increases with protostellar accretion, with at least 80% of
the sources with Lint>1 Lsun driving a jet. The protostellar flows exhibit an
onion-like structure, where the SiO jet (opening angle ~10$^o$) is nested into
a wider angle SO (~15$^o$) and CO (~25$^o$) outflow. On scales >300 au the SiO
jets are less collimated than atomic jets from Class II sources (~3$^o$).
Velocity asymmetry between the two jet lobes are detected in one third of the
sources, similarly to Class II atomic jets, suggesting that the same launching
mechanism is at work. Most of the jets are SiO rich (SiO/H2 from >2.4e-7 to
>5e-6), which indicates efficient release of >1%-10% of silicon in gas phase
likely in dust-free winds, launched from inside the dust sublimation radius.
The mass-loss rates (from ~7e-8 to ~3e-6 Msun/yr) are larger than what was
measured for Class II jets. Similarly to Class II sources, the mass-loss rates
are ~1%-50% of the mass accretion rates suggesting that the correlation between
ejection and accretion in young stars holds from 1e4 yr up to a few Myr.

satisfies the constraints of recent direct searches and indirect detection for
dark matter as well as the effective number of neutrinos and the observed

derive the temperature of the source regions from the extreme ultraviolet

temperature distribution peaks at 2.0-2.5 MK that is surprisingly consistent
with earlier findings based on in-situ elemental abundance or charge state
measurements. We have found a significant anti-correlation between 3He/4He

caused by non-charge-stripping processes, as both isotopes would be fully
ionized in the inferred temperature range. This study shows that the elemental

temperature as expected from abundance enhancement calculations at ionization

images in some of the coronal EUV channels show the outskirts of the AR as a
dark moat surrounding the AR. Here we present seven specific examples, selected
from time periods when there was only a single AR present on the disk.
Visually, we observe the moat to be most prominent in the AIA 171 Angstrom
band, which has the most sensitivity to emission from plasma at log10 T = 5.8.
By examining the 1D line-of-sight emission measure temperature distribution
found from six AIA EUV channels, we find the intensity of the moat to be most
depressed over the temperature range log10 T ~ 5.7 - 6.2 for most of the cases.
We argue that the dark moat exists because the pressure from the strong
magnetic field that splays out from the AR presses down on underlying magnetic
loops, flattening those loops -- along with the lowest of the AR's own loops
over the moat -- to a low altitude. Those loops, which would normally emit the
bulk of the 171 Angstrom emission, are restricted to heights above the surface
that are too low to have 171 Angstrom-emitting plasmas sustained in them,
according to Antiochos & Noci (1986), while hotter EUV-emitting plasmas are
sustained in the overlying higher-altitude long AR-rooted coronal loops. This
potentially explains the low-coronal-temperature dark moats surrounding the
ARs.

benefited from graph theory. As a result, novel methods ranging from asset
network estimation to hierarchical asset selection and portfolio allocation are
now part of practitioners' toolboxes. In this paper, we investigate the
fundamental problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian
structural constraints from the point of view of financial market times series
data. In particular, we present natural justifications, supported by empirical
evidence, for the usage of the Laplacian matrix as a model for the precision
matrix of financial assets, while also establishing a direct link that reveals
how Laplacian constraints are coupled to meaningful physical interpretations
related to the market index factor and to conditional correlations between
stocks. Those interpretations lead to a set of guidelines that practitioners
should be aware of when estimating graphs in financial markets. In addition, we
design numerical algorithms based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers to learn undirected, weighted graphs that take into account
stylized facts that are intrinsic to financial data such as heavy tails and
modularity. We illustrate how to leverage the learned graphs into practical
scenarios such as stock time series clustering and foreign exchange network
estimation. The proposed graph learning algorithms outperform the
state-of-the-art methods in an extensive set of practical experiments.
Furthermore, we obtain theoretical and empirical convergence results for the

  is a proximal gradient method that can also be applied to the composite
optimization problem min f(x) + h(x), where f is stochastic and h is convex
(but not necessarily differentiable). Adaptive sampling methods employ a
mechanism for gradually improving the quality of the gradient approximation so
as to keep computational cost to a minimum. The mechanism commonly employed in
unconstrained optimization is no longer reliable in the constrained or
composite optimization settings because it is based on pointwise decisions that
cannot correctly predict the quality of the proximal gradient step. The method
proposed in this paper measures the result of a complete step to determine if
the gradient approximation is accurate enough; otherwise a more accurate

  Hybrid features and Communicative learning","7 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables",,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) regulate the expression of specific
genes in cells, and EPIs are important for understanding gene regulation, cell
differentiation and disease mechanisms. EPI identification through the wet
experiments is costly and time-consuming, and computational methods are in
demand. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based method EPIHC
based on sequence-derived features and genomic features for the EPI prediction.
EPIHC extracts features from enhancer and promoter sequences respectively using
convolutional neural networks (CNN), and then design a communicative learning
module to captures the communicative information between enhancer and promoter
sequences. EPIHC also take the genomic features of enhancers and promoters into
account. At last, EPIHC combines sequence-derived features and genomic features
to predict EPIs. The computational experiments show that EPIHC outperforms the
existing state-of-the-art EPI prediction methods on the benchmark datasets and
chromosome-split datasets, and the study reveal that the communicative learning
module can bring explicit information about EPIs, which is ignore by CNN.
Moreover, we consider two strategies to improve performances of EPIHC in the
cross-cell line prediction, and experimental results show that EPIHC
constructed on training cell lines exhibit improved performances for the other
cell lines.

hurricanes to wild fires. A fundamental problem is whether and how recovery
guided by government policies is able to meet the challenge of a wide range of

large-scale granular data at the operational energy grid, stigma of revealing
limitations of services, and complex recovery coupled with policies and
customers. As such, both quantification and firsthand information are lacking
on capabilities and fundamental limitation of energy services in response to
extreme events. Furthermore, government policies that guide recovery are often
sidelined by prior study. This work studies the fundamental problem through the
lens of recovery guided by two commonly adopted policies. We develop data
analysis on unsupervised learning from non-stationary data. The data span
failure events, from moderate to extreme, at the operational distribution grid
during the past nine years in two service regions at the state of New York and

failures, recovery exhibits a surprising scaling property which counteracts
failure scaling on the infrastructure vulnerability. However, heterogeneous
recovery widens with the severity of failure events: large failures that cannot
be prioritized increase customer interruption time by 47 folds. And, prolonged
small failures dominate the entire temporal evolution of recovery.

investigate whether injecting explicit information on verbs' semantic-syntactic

paramount. Concretely, we impart the verb knowledge from curated lexical
resources into dedicated adapter modules (dubbed verb adapters), allowing it to
complement, in downstream tasks, the language knowledge obtained during
LM-pretraining. We first demonstrate that injecting verb knowledge leads to
performance gains in English event extraction. We then explore the utility of
verb adapters for event extraction in other languages: we investigate (1)
zero-shot language transfer with multilingual Transformers as well as (2)
transfer via (noisy automatic) translation of English verb-based lexical
constraints. Our results show that the benefits of verb knowledge injection
indeed extend to other languages, even when verb adapters are trained on

motion remained Brownian. In this work, we compare different experimental

experimental design recovers the 3-fold enhancement in enzyme diffusion in the

by replacing the bulky polymers used in the prior chamber design with a
SLB-coated surface and glycerol. Using this newly-designed SLB/glycerol

modeling solar photospheric waveguides with a cylindrical inhomogeneity
comprising a uniform interior, a uniform exterior, and a continuous transition
layer (TL) in between. Performing an eigen-mode analysis in linear, resistive,
gravity-free MHD, our approach is idealized in that, among other things, our
equilibrium is structured only in the radial direction. We can nonetheless
address two damping mechanisms simultaneously, one being the Ohmic resistivity,
and the other being the resonant absorption of SSKMs in the cusp and
Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n continua. We find that the relative importance of the two
mechanisms depends sensitively on the magnetic Reynolds number ($R_{\rm m}$).
Resonant absorption is the sole damping mechanism for realistically large
values of $R_{\rm m}$, and the cusp resonance in general dominates the
Alfv$\acute{\rm e}$n one unless the axial wavenumbers are at the lower end of
the observationally relevant range. We also find that the thin-boundary
approximation holds only when the TL-width-to-radius ratios are much smaller
than nominally expected. The Ohmic resistivity is far more important for
realistically small $R_{\rm m}$. Even in this case, SSKMs are only marginally
damped, with damping-time-to-period-ratios reaching $\sim 10$ in the parameter
range we examine.

Distillation (SID). In addition, a novel evaluation metric is proposed to
better assess the performance of detectors under incremental learning
conditions. By selective distilling at the proper locations and further
transferring additional instance relation knowledge, our method demonstrates
significant advantages on the benchmark datasets PASCAL VOC and COCO.

target detection to overcome prior uncertainty of interference covariance. The
contamination of the empirical covariance matrix by the useful signal leads to
significant degradation of performance of this class of adaptive algorithms.
Regularization, also known in radar literature as sample covariance loading,
can be used to combat both ill conditioning of the original problem and
contamination of the empirical covariance by the desired signal for the
adaptive algorithms based on sample covariance matrix inversion. However, the
optimum value of loading factor cannot be derived unless strong assumptions are
made regarding the structure of covariance matrix and useful signal penetration
model. Similarly, least mean square algorithm with linear constraint or without
constraint, is also sensitive to the contamination of the learning sample with
the target signal. We synthesize two approaches to improve the convergence of
adaptive algorithms and protect them from the contamination of the learning
sample with the signal from the target. The proposed approach is based on the
maximization of empirical signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Its
effectiveness is demonstrated using simulated data.

tasks without hands on the steering wheels for a prolonged period.
Nevertheless, automated vehicles may still need to occasionally hand the
control back to drivers due to technology limitations and legal requirements.
While some systems determine the need for driver takeover using driver context
and road condition to initiate a takeover request, studies show that the driver
may not react to it. We present DeepTake, a novel deep neural network-based
framework that predicts multiple aspects of takeover behavior to ensure that
the driver is able to safely take over the control when engaged in non-driving
tasks. Using features from vehicle data, driver biometrics, and subjective
measurements, DeepTake predicts the driver's intention, time, and quality of
takeover. We evaluate DeepTake performance using multiple evaluation metrics.
Results show that DeepTake reliably predicts the takeover intention, time, and
quality, with an accuracy of 96%, 93%, and 83%, respectively. Results also
indicate that DeepTake outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on
predicting driver takeover time and quality. Our findings have implications for

streamwise vortex pair. The unsteady dynamics of these vortices are examined
with a spatio-temporally resolved Large-Eddy Simulation dataset on a
representative configuration consisting of a cylinder with an upswept basal
surface. Emphasis is placed on understanding the meandering motion of the
vortices in the pair, including vortex core displacement, spectral content,
stability mechanisms and overall rank-behavior. The first two energy-ranked
modes obtained through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition(POD) of the
time-resolved vorticity field reveals a pair of vortex dipoles aligned
relatively perpendicularly to each other. The dynamics is successfully mapped
to a matched Batchelor vortex pair whose spatial and temporal stability
analyses indicate similar dipole structures associated with an |m|=1 elliptic
mode pair. This short-wave elliptic instability dominates the meandering
motion, with strain due to axial velocity playing a key role in breakdown. The
low frequency of the unstable mode (Strouhal number StD =0.3 based on cylinder
diameter) is consistent with spectral analysis of meandering in the LES. The
wake is examined for its rank behavior; the number of modes required to
reproduce the flow to given degree of accuracy diminishes rapidly outside of
the immediate vicinity of the base. Beyond two diameters downstream, only two
leading POD modes are required to reconstruct the dominant meandering motion
and spatial structure in the LES data with < 15% performance loss, while ten
modes nearly completely recover the flow field. This low-rank behavior may hold
promise in constructing a reduced-order model for control purposes.

condensed matter. For instance, the construction of nuclear energy density
functionals involves properties of infinite matter, while neutron drops are
used to test nuclear interactions and approximations to the nuclear many-body
problem. In condensed matter, quantum rings are also used to study properties
of electron systems. Purpose: To investigate the possibility to use quantum
rings with systems of nucleons including many-body correlations. Methods: A
quantum ring model of a finite number of same spin fermions is developed.
Several attractive and repulsive interactions with finite and infinite ranges
are considered. Quantum Monte Carlo calculations are used to provide exact
ground-state energies. Comparisons with analytical Hartree-Fock solutions are
used to get an insight into the role of correlations. Results: Hartree-Fock
results with no breaking of space translational symmetry are able to describe
many systems. However, additional spatial correlations are required in the case
of dense systems with a strong short-range repulsion, or with attractive
interactions in large rings. Conclusions: Self-bound systems of fermions with
spatial correlations produced by basic features of the nuclear interactions can
be described on a quantum ring, encouraging applications with realistic
interactions, as well as investigations with higher dimensional geometries such
as spherium.

outperform traditional codecs. However, most existing methods train multiple

In this paper, we propose a new variable-rate image compression framework,
which employs generalized octave convolutions (GoConv) and generalized octave
transposed-convolutions (GoTConv) with built-in generalized divisive
normalization (GDN) and inverse GDN (IGDN) layers. Novel GoConv- and
GoTConv-based residual blocks are also developed in the encoder and decoder
networks. Our scheme also uses a stochastic rounding-based scalar quantization.
To further improve the performance, we encode the residual between the input
and the reconstructed image from the decoder network as an enhancement layer.
To enable a single model to operate with different bit rates and to learn
multi-rate image features, a new objective function is introduced. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework trained with variable-rate objective
function outperforms the standard codecs such as H.265/HEVC-based BPG and
state-of-the-art learning-based variable-rate methods.

our global analysis. The first one is a rank-1 matrix recovery problem. The
second one is a generalization of the Gaussian phase retrieval problem. It only
satisfies the weak isometry property, but has behavior similar to that of the

algorithm that uses the potential function and anisotropy as inputs. For three
other choices of input function pairs (any two of the potential function,

which is very efficient in generating regular anisotropic solutions. This is
because the equivalency of the three pairs in this algorithm arises precisely
from the same algebraic relation that made the different equivalent sets of

algorithm very suitable for finding particular solutions that admit other
desirable physical properties; we construct three examples. This algorithm does
not admit an isotropic limit although all isotropic solutions are produced as

pairs (anisotropy with the radial pressure or density) lead to the old barriers

eliminate explanation fabrication by encouraging extractive generation, 2)
using the fusion-in-decoder architecture to handle long input contexts, and 3)
intermediate fine-tuning on re-structured open domain QA datasets to improve
few-shot performance. FiD-Ex significantly improves over prior work in terms of
explanation metrics and task accuracy, on multiple tasks from the ERASER
explainability benchmark, both in the fully supervised and in the few-shot

trend: accuracies of models on one data distribution are approximately linear
functions of the accuracies on another distribution. We explain this trend
under an intuitive assumption on model similarity, which was verified
empirically in prior work. More precisely, we assume the probability that two
models agree in their predictions is higher than what we can infer from their
accuracy levels alone. Then, we show that a linear trend must occur when
evaluating models on two distributions unless the size of the distribution

requires a QA-system to include facts from a diverse knowledge graph (KG) in
its reasoning process to produce an answer. Large KGs, especially common-sense
KGs, are known to be incomplete, i.e., not all non-existent facts are always
incorrect. Therefore, being able to reason over incomplete KGs for QA is a
critical requirement in real-world applications that has not been addressed
extensively in the literature. We develop a novel QA architecture that allows
us to reason over incomplete KGs, something current FVQA state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches lack due to their critical reliance on fact retrieval. We use
KG Embeddings, a technique widely used for KG completion, for the downstream
task of FVQA. We also employ a new image representation technique we call
'Image-as-Knowledge' to enable this capability, alongside a simple one-step
CoAttention mechanism to attend to text and image during QA. Our FVQA
architecture is faster during inference time, being O(m), as opposed to
existing FVQA SOTA methods which are O(N log N), where m = number of vertices,
N = number of edges = O(m^2). KG embeddings are shown to hold complementary
information to word embeddings: a combination of both metrics permits
performance comparable to SOTA methods in the standard answer retrieval task,
and significantly better (26% absolute) in the proposed missing-edge reasoning
task.

Consequently, the resulting objective function can only partially capture the

the true specifications. Motivated by this challenge, we formulate a problem,
called diverse stochastic planning, that aims to generate a set of
representative -- small and diverse -- behaviors that are near-optimal with

set of diverse and near-optimal policies for systems modeled by a Markov

  Communications",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning is a privacy-preserving and distributed training method
using heterogeneous data sets stored at local devices. Federated learning over
wireless networks requires aggregating locally computed gradients at a server
where the mobile devices send statistically distinct gradient information over
heterogenous communication links. This paper proposes a Bayesian federated
learning (BFL) algorithm to aggregate the heterogeneous quantized gradient
information optimally in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE).
The idea of BFL is to aggregate the one-bit quantized local gradients at the
server by jointly exploiting i) the prior distributions of the local gradients,
ii) the gradient quantizer function, and iii) channel distributions.
Implementing BFL requires high communication and computational costs as the
number of mobile devices increases. To address this challenge, we also present
an efficient modified BFL algorithm called scalable-BFL (SBFL). In SBFL, we
assume a simplified distribution on the local gradient. Each mobile device
sends its one-bit quantized local gradient together with two scalar parameters
representing this distribution. The server then aggregates the noisy and faded
quantized gradients to minimize the MSE. We provide a convergence analysis of
SBFL for a class of non-convex loss functions. Our analysis elucidates how the
parameters of communication channels and the gradient priors affect
convergence. From simulations, we demonstrate that SBFL considerably
outperforms the conventional sign stochastic gradient descent algorithm when
training and testing neural networks using MNIST data sets over heterogeneous
wireless networks.

these methods perform unsatisfactorily when applied into real-world situations.
The reason of this phenomenon is that learning new tasks leads the trained
model quickly forget the knowledge of old tasks, which is referred to as
catastrophic forgetting. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods
tackle catastrophic forgetting problem in traditional classification networks
and ignore the problem existing in embedding networks, which are the basic

Then, we try to learn a unified representation for two adjacent tasks in

combined with existing regularization-based incremental learning methods to

networks (DNNs), their transferability is still unsatisfactory, especially for
targeted attacks. There are two problems behind that have been long overlooked:
1) the conventional setting of $T$ iterations with the step size of
$\epsilon/T$ to comply with the $\epsilon$-constraint. In this case, most of
the pixels are allowed to add very small noise, much less than $\epsilon$; and
2) usually manipulating pixel-wise noise. However, features of a pixel
extracted by DNNs are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs
generally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. To tackle
these issues, our previous work proposes a patch-wise iterative method (PIM)
aimed at crafting adversarial examples with high transferability. Specifically,
we introduce an amplification factor to the step size in each iteration, and
one pixel's overall gradient overflowing the $\epsilon$-constraint is properly
assigned to its surrounding regions by a project kernel. But targeted attacks
aim to push the adversarial examples into the territory of a specific class,
and the amplification factor may lead to underfitting. Thus, we introduce the
temperature and propose a patch-wise++ iterative method (PIM++) to further
improve transferability without significantly sacrificing the performance of
the white-box attack. Our method can be generally integrated to any
gradient-based attack methods. Compared with the current state-of-the-art
attack methods, we significantly improve the success rate by 33.1\% for defense
models and 31.4\% for normally trained models on average.

guided mode of an optical waveguide can also be a BIC, if there is a lateral

this paper, we show (analytically and numerically) that a typical BIC in

(RL) algorithms is a key enabler of the tremendous success of modern RL. Among
many asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is
the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Although A3C is
becoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not
well-understood, including its non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain
of parallelism (a.k.a. linear speedup). This paper revisits the A3C algorithm
and establishes its non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Under both i.i.d.
and Markovian sampling, we establish the local convergence guarantee for A3C in
the general policy approximation case and the global convergence guarantee in
softmax policy parameterization. Under i.i.d. sampling, A3C obtains sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)$ per worker to achieve $\epsilon$
accuracy, where $N$ is the number of workers. Compared to the best-known sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ for two-timescale AC, A3C achieves
\emph{linear speedup}, which justifies the advantage of parallelism and
asynchrony in AC algorithms theoretically for the first time. Numerical tests

ALPs, then the fluxes of distant extragalactic sources will be enhanced at

extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) spectrum. In this work, we have
investigated the ALP modulation on the EGB spectrum at TeV energies. Our
results show that in the most optimistic case, the existence of ALPs can cause
the EGB spectrum to greatly deviate from the prediction of a pure
extragalactic-background-light (EBL) absorption scenario. The deviation occurs
at approximately $\gtrsim$1 TeV, and the current EGB measurements by Fermi-LAT
cannot identify such an effect. We also find that most of the sensitive ALP
parameters have been ruled out by existing constraints, leaving only a small
region of unrestricted parameters that can be probed using the EGB effect
investigated in this work. Observations from forthcoming very-high-energy

inducing superconductivity on the helical channel through proximity effect will
create Majorana zero energy modes (MZMs) at the ends of the cut. In this

insulating gap of the QAHI to create MZMs as in the two-dimensional

by multiple conducting channels is avoided such that the MZMs can be well
separated from other in-gap excitations in energy. This simple but practical
approach allows the creation of a large number of MZMs in devices with

In
this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for the WordPiece tokenization used
in BERT, from single-word tokenization to general text (e.g., sentence)
tokenization. When tokenizing a single word, WordPiece uses a
longest-match-first strategy, known as maximum matching. The best known
algorithms so far are O(n^2) (where n is the input length) or O(nm) (where m is
the maximum vocabulary token length). We propose a novel algorithm whose
tokenization complexity is strictly O(n). Our method is inspired by the
Aho-Corasick algorithm. We introduce additional linkages on top of the trie
built from the vocabulary, allowing smart transitions when the trie matching
cannot continue. For general text, we further propose an algorithm that
combines pre-tokenization (splitting the text into words) and our linear-time
WordPiece method into a single pass. Experimental results show that our method
is 8.2x faster than HuggingFace Tokenizers and 5.1x faster than TensorFlow Text
on average for general text tokenization.

task, which has received a lot of attention. Manually annotating polyp region

target model by using labeled images and infer on colonoscopy videos. However,
there are several issues between the image-based training and video-based
inference, including domain differences, lack of positive samples, and temporal
smoothness. To address these issues, we propose an Image-video-joint polyp
detection network (Ivy-Net) to address the domain gap between colonoscopy
images from historical medical reports and real-time videos. In our Ivy-Net, a
modified mixup is utilized to generate training data by combining the positive

domain adaptive representations and augment the positive samples.
Simultaneously, a temporal coherence regularization (TCR) is proposed to
introduce the smooth constraint on feature-level in adjacent frames and improve
polyp detection by unlabeled colonoscopy videos. For evaluation, a new large
colonoscopy polyp dataset is collected, which contains 3056 images from
historical medical reports of 889 positive patients and 7.5-hour videos of 69
patients (28 positive). The experiments on the collected dataset demonstrate
that our Ivy-Net achieves the state-of-the-art result on colonoscopy video.

  comments",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC cs.MA cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Efficient data offloading plays a pivotal role in computational-intensive
platforms as data rate over wireless channels is fundamentally limited. On top
of that, high mobility adds an extra burden in vehicular edge networks (VENs),
bolstering the desire for efficient user-centric solutions. Therefore, unlike
the legacy inflexible network-centric approach, this paper exploits a
software-defined flexible, open, and programmable networking platform for an
efficient user-centric, fast, reliable, and deadline-constrained offloading
solution in VENs. In the proposed model, each active vehicle user (VU) is
served from multiple low-powered access points (APs) by creating a noble
virtual cell (VC). A joint node association, power allocation, and distributed
resource allocation problem is formulated. As centralized learning is not
practical in many real-world problems, following the distributed nature of
autonomous VUs, each VU is considered an edge learning agent. To that end,
considering practical location-aware node associations, a joint radio and power
resource allocation non-cooperative stochastic game is formulated. Leveraging
reinforcement learning's (RL) efficacy, a multi-agent RL (MARL) solution is
proposed where the edge learners aim to learn the Nash equilibrium (NE)
strategies to solve the game efficiently. Besides, real-world map data, with a
practical microscopic mobility model, are used for the simulation. Results
suggest that the proposed user-centric approach can deliver remarkable
performances in VENs. Moreover, the proposed MARL solution delivers
near-optimal performances with approximately 3% collision probabilities in case
of distributed random access in the uplink.

local mirror order parameter shows the intriguing recovering phenomenon of the
mirror symmetry in very low-temperatures, which could be understood from the
nature of the ground and excited states of the finite-size systems. We expect
that this recovering feature disappears; instead, a saturated behavior appears
in the local mirror order parameter in the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the

superconductor via the magnetic proximity effect. This manifests as
spin-splitting of the BCS density of states of the superconductor, an important
ingredient for numerous superconducting spintronics applications and the
realization of Majorana fermions. A crucial parameter that determines the
magnitude of the induced spin-splitting in FI/S bilayers is the thickness of
the S layer $d$: In very thin samples, the superconductivity is suppressed by
the strong magnetism. By contrast, in very thick samples, the spin splitting is
absent at distances away from the interface. In this work, we calculate the
density of states and critical field of FI/S bilayers of arbitrary thickness.
From here, we determine the range of parameters of interest for applications,
where the exchange field and superconductivity coexist. We compare our theory
with the tunneling spectroscopy measurements in several EuS/Al/AlO$_x$/Al
samples. If the Al film in contact with the EuS is thinner than a certain
critical value, we do not observe superconductivity, whereas, in thicker
samples, we find evidence of a first-order phase transition induced by an
external field. The complete transition is preceded by a regime in which normal
and superconducting regions coexist. We attribute this mixed phase to
inhomogeneities of the Al film thickness and the presence of superparamagnetic
grains at the EuS/Al interface with different switching fields. Our results
demonstrate on the one hand, the important role of the S layer thickness, which
is particularly relevant for the fabrication of high-quality samples suitable
for applications. On the other hand, the agreement between theory and
experiment demonstrates the accuracy of our theory, which, originally developed
for homogeneous situations, is generalized to highly inhomogeneous systems.

and high-dimensional probability distributions. The Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
algorithm, the workhorse of MCMC, provides a simple recipe to construct
reversible Markov kernels. Reversibility is a tractable property that implies a
less tractable but essential property here, invariance. Reversibility is
however not necessarily desirable when considering performance. This has
prompted recent interest in designing kernels breaking this property. At the
same time, an active stream of research has focused on the design of novel
versions of the MH kernel, some nonreversible, relying on the use of complex
invertible deterministic transforms. While standard implementations of the MH
kernel are well understood, the aforementioned developments have not received
the same systematic treatment to ensure their validity. This paper fills the
gap by developing general tools to ensure that a class of nonreversible Markov
kernels, possibly relying on complex transforms, has the desired invariance
property and leads to convergent algorithms. This leads to a set of simple and
practically verifiable conditions.

differential rotation and meridional circulation. The pattern of torsional
oscillations, or latitudinal belts of alternating `fast' and `slow' zonal flows
migrating from high latitudes towards the equator, is found to extend in the
time--latitude diagrams over the whole time interval. The oscillation period is
comparable with a doubled solar-activity-cycle and can be described as an
extended solar cycle. The zonal-velocity variations are related to the
solar-activity level, the local-velocity increases corresponding to the
sunspot-number increases and being localized at latitudes where the strongest
magnetic fields are recorded. The dramatic growth of the zonal velocities in
2018 appears to be a precursor of the beginning of activity Cycle 25. The
strong symmetrization of the zonal-velocity field by 2020 can be considered
another precursor. The general pattern of poleward meridional flows is
modulated by latitudinal variations that are similar to the
extended-solar-cycle behavior of the zonal flows. During the activity maximum,
these variations are superposed with a higher harmonic corresponding to
meridional flows converging to the spot-formation latitudes. Our results
indicate that variations of both the zonal and meridional flows exhibit the
extended solar-cycle behavior, which is an intrinsic feature of the solar

state-of-the-art cross-lingual transfer performance on a range of NLP tasks.
However, due to limited capacity and large differences in pretraining data
sizes, there is a profound performance gap between resource-rich and
resource-poor target languages. The ultimate challenge is dealing with
under-resourced languages not covered at all by the models and written in
scripts unseen during pretraining. In this work, we propose a series of novel
data-efficient methods that enable quick and effective adaptation of pretrained
multilingual models to such low-resource languages and unseen scripts. Relying
on matrix factorization, our methods capitalize on the existing latent
knowledge about multiple languages already available in the pretrained model's
embedding matrix. Furthermore, we show that learning of the new dedicated
embedding matrix in the target language can be improved by leveraging a small
number of vocabulary items (i.e., the so-called lexically overlapping tokens)
shared between mBERT's and target language vocabulary. Our adaptation
techniques offer substantial performance gains for languages with unseen
scripts. We also demonstrate that they can yield improvements for low-resource
languages written in scripts covered by the pretrained model.

spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions
for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model
consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on
multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific
features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel
encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a
collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency
of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative
representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID
lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in
dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. Our proposed
method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for
COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world
applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient
high-quality annotations.

was carried out during 2018--2019 with the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope. The

The rest frame time lags of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ are
$\tau_{\rm{H}\alpha}=7.56^{+4.42}_{-2.10}$ days and
$\tau_{\rm{H}\beta}=7.50^{+2.05}_{-0.77}$ days, respectively. From a RMS
H$\beta$ line dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm{line}} = 1713.3 \pm 46.7$ $\rm{km}$

structures for automated retinal quality assessment. One is the large-size
salient structures including optic disc region and exudates in large-size. The
other is the tiny-size salient structures which mainly include vessels. Then we
incorporate the proposed two salient structure priors with deep convolutional

and one is guided by large-size salient structures while the other is guided by
tiny-size salient structures. Single-branch SalStructIQA contains one CNN

one-parameter family of integrable R-matrices, the whole boundary represents
integrable theories. We also consider R-matrices which are analytic in an
extended region beyond the physical cuts, thus forbidding poles (resonances) in
that region. In certain models, this drastically reduces the allowed space of
R-matrices leading to new vertices that again correspond to integrable
theories. We also work out the dual problem, in particular in the case of
extended analyticity, the dual function has cuts on the physical line whenever
unitarity is saturated. For the periodic Yang-Baxter solution that has zero

exterior calculus (FEEC). The aim of this essay is the exposition of a simple,
efficiently-implementable framework for general hp-adaptivity applicable to the
FEEC on higher-dimensional manifolds. A problem-independent spectral
error-indicator is developed which estimates the error and the spectral decay
of polynomial coefficients. The spectral decay rate is taken as an
admissibility indicator on the polynomial order distribution. Finally, by
elementary computational examples, it is attempted to demonstrate the power of
the method as an engineering tool.

studied. This setting is characterized by an underlying mesh unfitted with the

been extensively studied in theoretical computer science and operations

commonly assumed that parameters such as edge weights are exactly known as
inputs. However, this assumption may not be fulfilled since input parameters
are often uncertain or initially unknown in many applications such as
recommender systems, crowdsourcing, communication networks, and online
advertisement. To resolve such uncertainty, the problem of combinatorial pure
exploration of multi-armed bandits (CPE) and its variants have recieved
increasing attention. Earlier work on CPE has studied the semi-bandit feedback
or assumed that the outcome from each individual edge is always accessible at
all rounds. However, due to practical constraints such as a budget ceiling or
privacy concern, such strong feedback is not always available in recent
applications. In this article, we review recently proposed techniques for
combinatorial pure exploration problems with limited feedback.

that avoids data sharing among training nodes so as to protect data privacy.
Under coordination of the FL server, each client conducts model training using
its own computing resource and private data set. The global model can be
created by aggregating the training results of clients. To cope with highly
non-IID data distributions, personalized federated learning (PFL) has been
proposed to improve overall performance by allowing each client to learn a
personalized model. However, one major drawback of a personalized model is the
loss of generalization. To achieve model personalization while maintaining
generalization, in this paper, we propose a new approach, named PFL-MoE, which
mixes outputs of the personalized model and global model via the MoE
architecture. PFL-MoE is a generic approach and can be instantiated by
integrating existing PFL algorithms. Particularly, we propose the PFL-MF
algorithm which is an instance of PFL-MoE based on the freeze-base PFL
algorithm. We further improve PFL-MF by enhancing the decision-making ability
of MoE gating network and propose a variant algorithm PFL-MFE. We demonstrate

the experimental observations of the surface gap remain controversial. Here, we
report the observation of the surface gap via the point contact tunneling
spectroscopy. In agreement with theoretical calculations, the gap size is
around 50 meV, which vanishes as the sample becomes paramagnetic with
increasing temperature. The magnetoresistance hysteresis is detected through
the point contact junction on the sample surface with an out-of-plane magnetic
field, substantiating the surface ferromagnetism. Furthermore, the non-zero
transport spin polarization coming from the ferromagnetism is determined by the
point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. Combining these results, the
magnetism-induced gap in topological surface states of MnBi2Te4 is revealed.

overall complex experiment design, starting with the selection of the right

extends Bloom-Filters with range query support and may replace them. The core
idea is to employ a dyadic interval scheme to determine the set of dyadic
intervals covering a data point, which are then encoded and inserted. bloomRF
introduces Dyadic Trace-Trees as novel data structure that represents those
covering intervals implicitly. A Trace-Tree encoding scheme represents the set
of covering intervals efficiently, in a compact bit representation.
Furthermore, bloomRF introduces novel piecewise-monotone hash functions that
are locally order-preserving and thus support range querying. We present an
efficient membership computation method for range-queries. Although, bloomRF is
designed for integers it also supports string and floating-point data types. It
can also handle multiple attributes and serve as multi-attribute filter.
  We evaluate bloomRF in RocksDB and in a standalone library. bloomRF is more

between three objects) expressed either in terms of `equal temperature' (ET),
or `in equilibrium' (EQ) conditions. In conventional thermodynamics conditional
on vanishingly weak system-bath coupling these two conditions are commonly
regarded as equivalent. In this work we show that for thermodynamics at strong
coupling they are inequivalent: namely, two systems can be in equilibrium and
yet have different effective temperatures. A recent result \cite{NEqFE} for
Gaussian quantum systems shows that an effective temperature $T^{*}$ can be
defined at all times during a system's nonequilibrium evolution, but because of
the inclusion of interaction energy, after equilibration the system's $T^*$ is
slightly higher than the bath temperature $T_{\textsc{b}}$, with the deviation
depending on the coupling. A second object coupled with a different strength
with an identical bath at temperature $T_{\textsc{b}}$ will not have the same
equilibrated temperature as the first object. Thus $ET \neq EQ $ for strong
coupling thermodynamics. We then investigate the conditions for dynamical
equilibration for two objects 1 and 2 strongly coupled with a common bath $B$,
each with a different equilibrated effective temperature. We show this is
possible, and prove the existence of a generalized fluctuation-dissipation
relation under this configuration. This affirms that `in equilibrium' is a
valid and perhaps more fundamental notion which the zeroth law for quantum
thermodynamics at strong coupling should be based on. Only when the system-bath
coupling becomes vanishingly weak that `temperature' appearing in thermodynamic
relations becomes universally defined and makes better physical sense.

We consider the intermediate scale of several dozens of components at which

built from an initial imprinted cluster state created via Gaussian entangling
operations according to a complex network structure. We then engender
non-Gaussian statistics via multiple photon subtraction operations acting on a
single node. We replicate in the quantum regime some of the models that mimic
real-world complex networks in order to test their structural properties under
local operations. We then go beyond the already known single-mode effects, by
studying the emergent network of photon-number correlations via complex
networks measures. We analytically prove that the imprinted network structure
defines a vicinity of nodes, at a distance of four steps from the
photon-subtracted node, in which the emergent network changes due to photon
subtraction. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the emergent structure
is greatly influenced by the structure of the imprinted network. Indeed, while
the mean and the variance of the degree and clustering distribution of the
emergent network always increase, the higher moments of the distributions are
governed by the specific structure of the imprinted network. Finally, we show
that the behaviour of nearest neighbours of the subtraction node depends on how
they are connected to each other in the imprinted structure.

couple of advantages: 1) high photon flux provides high production rate for low
mass LQs; 2) the background contamination is much lower than that in $p$-$p$
collisions. The analysis strategy permits a leptoquark to decay to all possible
lepton-plus-quark modes. Taking the scalar LQ, $S_3$, with an electric charge
$|q|=\frac{4}{3}e$, as example, the mass point of 100 GeV can be excluded at
the 95~\% confidence level using a dataset of 4~pb$^{-1}$ Pb-Pb
ultra-peripheral collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and the performance of the
ATLAS detector in Run~2. The proposed method also applies to searching for
high-mass LQs in $p$-$p$ collisions as long as the LQ pair production mechanism

play essential roles in the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect

higher moments of Berry curvatures at the Fermi energy) can induce higher-order
nonlinear anomalous Hall (NLAH) effect. Specifically, an AC Hall voltage
perpendicular to the current direction emerges, where the frequency is an
integer multiple of the frequency of the applied current. Importantly, by
analyzing the symmetry properties of all the 3D and 2D magnetic point groups,
we note that the quadrupole, hexapole and even higher Berry curvature moments
can cause the leading-order frequency multiplication in certain materials. To
provide concrete examples, we point out that the third-order NLAH voltage can
be the leading-order Hall response in certain antiferromagnets due to Berry
curvature quadrupoles, and the fourth-order NLAH voltage can be the leading
response in the surface states of topological insulators induced by Berry
curvature hexapoles. Our results are established by symmetry analysis,
effective Hamiltonian and first-principles calculations. Other materials which
support the higher-order NLAH effect are further proposed, including 2D
antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, Weyl semimetals and twisted bilayer graphene
near the quantum anomalous Hall phase.

low saturation intensities is not the ultra-strong coupling regime, but is
instead at the onset of the strong light-matter coupling. We further derive
explicit conditions for the emergence of bistability. This work sets the path
towards yet unexisting ultrafast mid-infrared semiconductor saturable

graphs weighted with integer lengths associated to the edges provide tilings of

subgraphs.
  In this part, we describe the arrangements of toric varieties associated to
these tilings. Roughly speaking, the normal fan to each polytope in the tiling
corresponds to a toric variety, and these toric varieties are glued together in
an arrangement according to how the polytopes meet. We provide a thorough
description of these toric arrangements from different perspectives: by using
normal fans, as unions of torus orbits, by describing the (infinitely many)
polynomial equations defining them in products of doubly infinite chains of
projective lines, and as degenerations of algebraic tori.

two novel modules called correspondence indicator and symmetric deformer.
Feeding a pair of raw point clouds, our model first learns the pointwise

correspondence matrix used to permute the input pair. The symmetric deformer,
with an additional regularized loss, transforms the two permuted point clouds
to each other to drive the unsupervised learning of the correspondence. The

crystals have been identified and similar structures incorporated with optical
gain have been reported to exhibit lasing. However, no explicit control over
the type of lasing BIC has been reported. In this work, we utilize all four
fundamental BICs related to the lowest energy Gamma-point of a square photonic
crystal lattice. We identify the associated topological charges from
experimentally obtained dispersions, finite element method simulations, as well
as from spherical decomposition method based on the microscopic polarization
currents in the photonic crystal plane. By tailoring the periodicity and the
hole diameter of the photonic crystal slab, we selectively bring each of the
four BIC resonances to a wavelength regime, where fluorescent IR702 molecules
overlaid with the photonic crystal provide sufficient gain for the onset of
lasing. We experimentally analyze all four observed lasing BICs by imaging
their far-field polarization vortices and their associated topological charges.
The results correspond excellently with the transmission results as well as the
simulation results in the absence of gain. Finally, we experimentally present a
case where the lasing signal reveals the coexistence of two BICs with opposite
topological charges, resulting in a unique polarization pattern. We believe our
results enable tailoring the properties, such as polarization winding and
topological charge of BICs, by a priori design and thus pave the way for a more
general utilization of their appealing properties.

breath test (EBT): a small dose of radio-labeled drug is injected and the
subsequent content of radio-labeled CO$_2$ is measured repeatedly in exhaled
breath; the resulting time series is analyzed. To model EBT we developed a
14-variable non-linear reduced order dynamical model that describes the
behavior of the drug and its metabolites in the human body well enough to
capture all biological phenomena of interest. Based on this system of coupled
non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we treat the measurement
problem as inverse problem: we estimate the ODE parameters of individual
patients from the measured EBT time series. These estimates then provide a
measurement of the liver activity of interest. The parameters are hard to
estimate as the ODEs are stiff and the problem needs to be regularized to
ensure stable convergence. We develop a formal operator framework to capture
and treat the specific non-linearities present, and perform perturbation
analysis to establish properties of the estimation procedure and its solution.
Development of the method required 150,000 CPU hours at a supercomputing

analyze the method in the context of future precision dosing of drugs for
vulnerable patients (e.g., oncology, nephrology, or pediatrics) to eventually

underpinning a broad science and technology area, including topological
magnets, axion physics, dissipationless Hall currents, or spintronic memories.
A best known conventional model of macroscopic T-symmetry breaking is a
ferromagnetic order of itinerant Bloch electrons with an isotropic spin
interaction in momentum space. Anisotropic electron interactions, on the other
hand, have been a domain of correlated quantum phases, such as the T-invariant
nematics or unconventional superconductors. Here we report discovery of a
broken-T phase of itinerant Bloch electrons with an unconventional anisotropic
spin-momentum interaction, whose staggered nature leads to the formation of two
ferromagnetic-like valleys in the momentum space with opposite spin splittings.
We describe qualitatively the effect by deriving a non-relativistic
single-particle Hamiltonian model. Next, we identify the unconventional
staggered spin-momentum interaction by first-principles electronic structure
calculations in a four-sublattice antiferromagnet Mn5Si3 with a collinear
checkerboard magnetic order. We show that the staggered spin-momentum
interaction is set by nonrelativistic spin-symmetries which were previously
omitted in relativistic physics classifications of spin interactions and
topological quasiparticles. Our measurements of a spontaneous Hall effect in
epilayers of antiferromagnetic Mn5Si3 with vanishing magnetization are
consistent with our theory predictions. Bloch electrons with the unconventional
staggered spin interaction, compatible with abundant low atomic-number
materials, strong spin-coherence, and collinear antiferromagnetic order open
unparalleled possibilities for realizing T-symmetry broken spin and topological
quantum phases.

  First, we give a didactic review of classical expansions for formal linear
differential equations, including the celebrated Magnus expansion (associated
with coordinates of the first kind) and Sussmann's infinite product expansion
(associated with coordinates of the second kind). Inspired by quantum
mechanics, we introduce a new mixed expansion, designed to isolate the role of
a time-invariant drift from the role of a time-varying perturbation.
  Second, in the context of nonlinear ordinary differential equations driven by
regular vector fields, we give rigorous proofs of error estimates between the
exact solution and finite approximations of the formal expansions. In
particular, we derive new estimates focusing on the role of time-varying
perturbations. For scalar-input systems, we derive new estimates involving only
a weak Sobolev norm of the input.
  Third, we investigate the local convergence of these expansions. We recall
known positive results for nilpotent dynamics and for linear dynamics.
Nevertheless, we also exhibit arbitrarily small analytic vector fields for
which the convergence of the Magnus expansion fails, even in very weak senses.
We state an open problem concerning the convergence of Sussmann's infinite
product expansion.

extended to the fixed points, they can generate the chiral nature of the theory

convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have achieved great successes in
numerous applications. Due to the complex data dependency and the increase in
the amount of model samples, the convolution suffers from high overhead on data
movement (i.e., memory access). This work provides comprehensive analysis and
methodologies to minimize the communication for the convolution in CNNs. With
an in-depth analysis of the recent I/O complexity theory under the red-blue
game model, we develop a general I/O lower bound theory for a composite
algorithm which consists of several different sub-computations. Based on the
proposed theory, we establish the data movement lower bound results of two
representative convolution algorithms in CNNs, namely the direct convolution
and Winograd algorithm. Next, derived from I/O lower bound results, we design
the near I/O-optimal dataflow strategies for the two main convolution
algorithms by fully exploiting the data reuse. Furthermore, in order to push
the envelope of performance of the near I/O-optimal dataflow strategies
further, an aggressive design of auto-tuning based on I/O lower bounds, is
proposed to search an optimal parameter configuration for the direct
convolution and Winograd algorithm on GPU, such as the number of threads and
the size of shared memory used in each thread block. Finally, experiment
evaluation results on the direct convolution and Winograd algorithm show that
our dataflow strategies with the auto-tuning approach can achieve about 3.32x
performance speedup on average over cuDNN. In addition, compared with TVM,
which represents the state-of-the-art technique for auto-tuning, not only our

The new detections of CH$_{3}$NCO and HOCH$_{2}$CN are additional evidence for
a large interstellar reservoir of prebiotic molecules that can contribute to
the formation of biomolecules on terrestrial planets. A plausible formation
pathway for HOCH$_{2}$CN is the thermal Strecker-like reaction of CN$^{-}$ with

species either are chemically related or their formation is affected by
physical conditions in the same way. The relatively high abundances of
HOCH$_{2}$CN and HNCO in SMM1-a may be explained by a prolonged stage of
relatively warm ice mantles, where thermal and energetic processing of HCN in
the ice results in the efficient formation of both species.

complexity of $O(n^{o(1)}(\sqrt{n}+D))$, and thus almost matches the lower
bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n}+D)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in
the network and $D$ is its diameter.
  We show that our distributed solver yields new sublinear round algorithms for
several cornerstone problems in combinatorial optimization. This is achieved by
leveraging the powerful algorithmic framework of Interior Point Methods (IPMs)
and the Laplacian paradigm in the context of distributed graph algorithms,
which entails numerically solving optimization problems on graphs via a series
of Laplacian systems. Problems that benefit from our distributed algorithmic
paradigm include exact mincost flow, negative weight shortest paths, maxflow,
and bipartite matching on sparse directed graphs. For the maxflow problem, this
is the first exact distributed algorithm that applies to directed graphs, while
the previous work by [Ghaffari et al. SICOMP'18] considered the approximate
setting and works only for undirected graphs. For the mincost flow and the
negative weight shortest path problems, our results constitute the first exact
distributed algorithms running in a sublinear number of rounds. Given that the
hybrid between IPMs and the Laplacian paradigm has proven useful for tackling
numerous optimization problems in the centralized setting, we believe that our

focus on limiting behaviors, this study employs a non-asymptotic approach,
establishes abstract Gaussian approximation results for maximizers of empirical
criteria, and proposes a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap approximation method.
Our developments can be considered as extensions of the seminal works
(Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato (2013, 2014, 2015)) on the approximation
theory for distributions of suprema of empirical processes toward their
maximizers. Through this work, we shed new lights on the statistical theory of
M-estimators. Our theory covers not only regular estimators, such as the least
absolute deviations, but also some non-regular cases where it is difficult to
derive or to approximate numerically the limiting distributions such as
non-Donsker classes and cube root estimators.

provide novel evidence that complicates this claim: we find that
state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI) models assign the same labels
to permuted examples as they do to the original, i.e. they are largely
invariant to random word-order permutations. This behavior notably differs from
that of humans; we struggle with ungrammatical sentences. To measure the
severity of this issue, we propose a suite of metrics and investigate which
properties of particular permutations lead models to be word-order invariant.
In the MNLI dataset, for example, we find almost all (98.7%) examples contain
at least one permutation which elicits the gold label. Models are sometimes
even able to assign gold labels to permutations that they originally failed to
predict correctly. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of this
phenomenon, and further show that this issue exists for both Transformers and

  with Voltage Underscaling","To appear at DATE 2021 conference",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Modern computing devices employ High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to meet their
memory bandwidth requirements. An HBM-enabled device consists of multiple DRAM
layers stacked on top of one another next to a compute chip (e.g. CPU, GPU, and
FPGA) in the same package. Although such HBM structures provide high bandwidth
at a small form factor, the stacked memory layers consume a substantial portion
of the package's power budget. Therefore, power-saving techniques that preserve
the performance of HBM are desirable. Undervolting is one such technique: it
reduces the supply voltage to decrease power consumption without reducing the
device's operating frequency to avoid performance loss. Undervolting takes
advantage of voltage guardbands put in place by manufacturers to ensure correct
operation under all environmental conditions. However, reducing voltage without
changing frequency can lead to reliability issues manifested as unwanted bit
flips. In this paper, we provide the first experimental study of real HBM chips
under reduced-voltage conditions. We show that the guardband regions for our
HBM chips constitute 19% of the nominal voltage. Pushing the supply voltage
down within the guardband region reduces power consumption by a factor of 1.5X
for all bandwidth utilization rates. Pushing the voltage down further by 11%
leads to a total of2.3X power savings at the cost of unwanted bit flips. We
explore and characterize the rate and types of these reduced-voltage-induced
bit flips and present a fault map that enables the possibility of a
three-factor trade-off among power, memory capacity, and fault rate.

significantly compromise the system stability; we demonstrated CFO compensation

nonholonomic mechanics, which relies on the standard method of Lagrange
multipliers in the d'Alembert-Lagrange formulation of the classical equations
of motion. For the rolling coin on an inclined plane, it is proved that no
nontrivial solution to the equations of motion of nonholonomic mechanics can be
obtained in the framework of vakonomic mechanics. This completes previous
investigations that managed to show only that, for certain mechanical systems,
some but not necessarily all nonholonomic motions are beyond the reach of
