Extended Abstract to appear in ITCS 2021",,,,"math.PR cs.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theory of majorizing measures, extensively developed by Fernique,
Talagrand and many others, provides one of the most general frameworks for
controlling the behavior of stochastic processes. In particular, it can be
applied to derive quantitative bounds on the expected suprema and the degree of
continuity of sample paths for many processes.
  One of the crowning achievements of the theory is Talagrand's tight
alternative characterization of the suprema of Gaussian processes in terms of
majorizing measures. The proof of this theorem was difficult, and thus
considerable effort was put into the task of developing both shorter and easier
to understand proofs. A major reason for this difficulty was considered to be
theory of majorizing measures itself, which had the reputation of being opaque
and mysterious. As a consequence, most recent treatments of the theory
(including by Talagrand himself) have eschewed the use of majorizing measures
in favor of a purely combinatorial approach (the generic chaining) where
objects based on sequences of partitions provide roughly matching upper and
lower bounds on the desired expected supremum.
  In this paper, we return to majorizing measures as a primary object of study,
and give a viewpoint that we think is natural and clarifying from an
optimization perspective. As our main contribution, we give an algorithmic
proof of the majorizing measures theorem based on two parts: (1) We make the
simple (but apparently new) observation that finding the best majorizing
measure can be cast as a convex program. This also allows for efficiently
computing the measure using off-the-shelf methods from convex optimization. (2)
We obtain tree-based upper and lower bound certificates by rounding, in a
series of steps, the primal and dual solutions to this convex program.

appropriate model from a set of candidate models. Large models tend to inflate
the variance (or overfitting), while small models tend to cause biases (or
underfitting) for a given fixed dataset. In this work, we address the critical
challenge of model selection to strike a balance between model fitting and
model complexity, thus gaining reliable predictive power. We consider the task
of approaching the theoretical limit of statistical learning, meaning that the
selected model has the predictive performance that is as good as the best
possible model given a class of potentially misspecified candidate models. We
propose a generalized notion of Takeuchi's information criterion and prove that
the proposed method can asymptotically achieve the optimal out-sample
prediction loss under reasonable assumptions. It is the first proof of the
asymptotic property of Takeuchi's information criterion to our best knowledge.
Our proof applies to a wide variety of nonlinear models, loss functions, and
high dimensionality (in the sense that the models' complexity can grow with
sample size). The proposed method can be used as a computationally efficient
surrogate for leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, for modeling streaming
data, we propose an online algorithm that sequentially expands the model
complexity to enhance selection stability and reduce computation cost.
Experimental studies show that the proposed method has desirable predictive
power and significantly less computational cost than some popular methods.

an empirical success due to its simplicity and intuitiveness. However, despite
its ubiquitous role, CV often falls into the following notorious dilemmas. On
the one hand, for small data cases, CV suffers a conservatively biased
estimation, since some part of the limited data has to hold out for validation.
On the other hand, for large data cases, CV tends to be extremely cumbersome,
e.g., intolerant time-consuming, due to the repeated training procedures.
Naturally, a straightforward ambition for CV is to validate the models with far
less computational cost, while making full use of the entire given data-set for
training. Thus, instead of holding out the given data, a cheap and
theoretically guaranteed auxiliary/augmented validation is derived
strategically in this paper. Such an embarrassingly simple strategy only needs
to train models on the entire given data-set once, making the model-selection
considerably efficient. In addition, the proposed validation approach is
suitable for a wide range of learning settings due to the independence of both
augmentation and out-of-sample estimation on learning process. In the end, we
demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of our proposed method by
extensive evaluation on multiple data-sets, models and tasks.

the complexity of the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering and

here we present theoretical and experimental investigations of the highly

N\'eel temperature $T_N$ ~21 K, followed by a cubic ($Fd{\bar 3}m$) to
tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$) structural phase transition at $T_S$ ~16 K. Our
density-functional theory (DFT+U) calculations reveal that one needs to
consider magnetic-exchange interactions up to the third nearest neighbors to
get an accurate description of the low-temperature AFM order in GeCo$_2$O$_4$.
At room temperature three distinct IR-active modes ($T_{1u}$) are observed at
frequencies 680, 413, and 325 cm$^{-1}$ along with four Raman-active modes
$A_{1g}$, $T_{2g}(1)$, $T_{2g}(2)$, and $E_{g}$ at frequencies 760, 647, 550,

calculated values. All the IR-active and Raman-active phonon modes exhibit
signatures of moderate spin-phonon coupling. The temperature dependence of
various parameters, such as the shift, width, and intensity, of the
Raman-active modes, is also discussed. Noticeable changes around $T_N$ and
$T_S$ are observed in the Raman line parameters of the $E_{g}$ and $T_{2g}$
modes, which are associated with the modulation of the Co-O bonds in CoO$_6$
octahedra during the excitations of these modes.

emission. We present a comparative analysis on the SSC emission of GRB
afterglows in the homogeneous and wind environment in the framework of the
forward shock model. The $\gamma\gamma$ absorption of very high-energy photons
due to pair production within the source and the Klein-Nishina effect on the
inverse-Compton scattering are considered. Generally a higher SSC flux is
expected for a larger circum-burst density due to a larger Compton parameter,
but meanwhile the internal $\gamma\gamma$ absorption is more severer for
sub-TeV emission. The flux ratio between the SSC component and the synchrotron
component decreases more quickly with time in the wind medium case than that in
the homogenous-density medium case. The light curves of the SSC emission are
also different for the two types of media. We also calculate the cascade
emission resulted from the absorbed high-energy photons. In the ISM environment
with $n> 1\,\rm cm^{-3}$, the cascade synchrotron emission could be comparable
to the synchrotron emission of the primary electrons in the optical band, which
may flatten the optical afterglow light curve at early time ($t<1$ h). In the
wind medium with $A_{\ast}> 0.1$, the cascade emission in the eV-GeV band is
comparable or even larger than the emission of the primary electrons at early
time.

laminar-to-turbulent transition that can be mitigated with feedback control.
Linear quadratic optimal control strategies have shown some success in reducing

performance can be difficult to achieve using sensor-based output feedback
control. In this study, we investigate static output feedback controllers for
reducing transient energy growth of flow perturbations within linear and
nonlinear simulations of a sub-critical channel flow. A static output feedback
linear quadratic regulator~(SOF-LQR) is designed to reduce the worst-case
transient energy growth due to flow perturbations. The controller directly uses
wall-based measurements to optimally regulate the flow with wall-normal blowing
and suction from the upper and lower channel walls. Optimal static output
feedback gains are computed using a modified Anderson-Moore algorithm that
accelerates the iterative solution of the synthesis problem by leveraging
Armijo-type adaptations. We show that SOF-LQR controllers can reduce the
worst-case transient energy growth due to flow perturbations. Our results also
indicate that SOF-LQR controllers exhibit robustness to Reynolds number
variations. Further, direct numerical simulations show that the designed
SOF-LQR controllers increase laminar-to-turbulent transition thresholds under
streamwise disturbances and delay transition under spanwise disturbances. The
results of this study highlight the advantages of SOF-LQR controllers and
create opportunities for realizing improved transition control strategies in
the future.

the portfolio and the algorithm selector are chosen using a training set of
typical problem instances from the application domain at hand. In this paper,
we provide the first provable guarantees for portfolio-based algorithm

resulting algorithm selector's average performance over the training set is
close to its future (expected) performance. This involves analyzing three key
reasons why these two quantities may diverge: 1) the learning-theoretic
complexity of the algorithm selector, 2) the size of the portfolio, and 3) the
learning-theoretic complexity of the algorithm's performance as a function of

optimization, named Tr-GO. The idea is to initialize a high-quality population
by using the technique of transfer learning, so any kind of population-based
optimization algorithms can be seamlessly integrated into this framework. The
advantage is that the generated gait can not only dynamically adapt to
different environments and tasks, but also simultaneously satisfy multiple
design specifications (e.g., speed, stability). The experimental results show
the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the gait optimization problem
based on three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: NSGA-II, RM-MEDA and
MOPSO. When transferring the pre-acquired knowledge from the plain terrain to
various inclined and rugged ones, the proposed Tr-GO framework accelerates the
evolution process by a minimum of 3-4 times compared with non-transferred
scenarios.

  segment MRI brain tumors with very small training sets",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Lesion segmentation in medical imaging is key to evaluating
treatment response. We have recently shown that reinforcement learning can be
applied to radiological images for lesion localization. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that reinforcement learning addresses important limitations of
supervised deep learning; namely, it can eliminate the requirement for large
amounts of annotated training data and can provide valuable intuition lacking
in supervised approaches. However, we did not address the fundamental task of
lesion/structure-of-interest segmentation. Here we introduce a method combining
unsupervised deep learning clustering with reinforcement learning to segment
brain lesions on MRI.
  Materials and Methods: We initially clustered images using unsupervised deep
learning clustering to generate candidate lesion masks for each MRI image. The
user then selected the best mask for each of 10 training images. We then
trained a reinforcement learning algorithm to select the masks. We tested the
corresponding trained deep Q network on a separate testing set of 10 images.
For comparison, we also trained and tested a U-net supervised deep learning
network on the same set of training/testing images.
  Results: Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data
and predictably performed poorly on the testing set (16% average Dice score),
the unsupervised deep clustering and reinforcement learning achieved an average
Dice score of 83%.
  Conclusion: We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle application of
unsupervised deep clustering and reinforcement learning to segment brain
tumors. The approach represents human-allied AI that requires minimal input
from the radiologist without the need for hand-traced annotation.

Specifically, our network contains two parts: an edge auxiliary module that

as large in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern, the effects there
are predicted to be roughly twice the amplitude. Hemispheric differences have
previously been discussed in terms of polar ionospheric conductivities, effects
which we allow for by studying the dipole tilt effect on time-of-year
variations of the indices. The electric field induced in a geocentric frame is
shown to also be a significant factor and gives a modulation of the voltage
applied by the solar wind flow in the southern hemisphere of typically a 30%
diurnal modulation for disturbed intervals rising to 76% in quiet times. Motion
towards/away from the Sun reduces/enhances the directly-driven ionospheric
voltages and reduces/enhances the magnetic energy stored in the near-Earth
tail: 10% of the effect being directly-driven and 90% being in tail energy
storage/release. Combined with the effect of solar wind dynamic pressure and
dipole tilt on the pressure balance in the near-Earth tail, the effect provides
an excellent explanation of how the observed Russell-McPherron pattern in the
driving power input into the magnetosphere is converted into the equinoctial
pattern in average geomagnetic activity (after correction is made for dipole
tilt effects on ionospheric conductivity), added to a pronounced UT variation

winning quantum correlation for the $G$-automorphism game that cannot be
produced classically. Recent connections between quantum group theory and
quantum information show that quantum correlations for this game correspond to
tracial states on $C(\text{Qut}(G))$ -- the algebra of functions on the quantum
automorphism group of $G$. This allows us to also define nonlocal symmetry for
any quantum permutation group. We investigate the differences and similarities
between this and the notion of quantum symmetry, defined as non-commutativity
of $C(\text{Qut}(G))$. Roughly speaking, quantum symmetry vs nonlocal symmetry
can be viewed respectively as non-classicality of our model of reality vs
non-classicality of our observation of reality.
  We show that quantum symmetry is necessary but not sufficient for nonlocal
symmetry. In particular, we show that the complete graph on five vertices is
the only connected graph on five or fewer vertices with nonlocal symmetry,
despite a dozen others having quantum symmetry. In particular this shows that
the quantum symmetric group on four points, $S_4^+$, does not exhibit nonlocal
symmetry, answering a question from the literature. In contrast to quantum
symmetry, we show that two disjoint classical automorphisms do not guarantee
nonlocal symmetry. However, three disjoint automorphisms do suffice. We also
give a construction of quantum permutation matrices built from a finite abelian
group $\Gamma$ and a permutation $\pi$ on $|\Gamma|$ elements. Computational
evidence suggests that for cyclic groups of increasing size almost all
permutations $\pi$ result in nonlocal symmetry. Surprisingly, the construction
never results in nonlocal symmetry when $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ is used. We also
investigate under what conditions nonlocal symmetry arises when taking unions

scans are designed for data with near-isotropic voxels at approximately 1 mm
resolution, and frequently have contrast constraints as well - typically
requiring T1 scans (e.g., MP-RAGE). This limitation prevents the analysis of
millions of MRI scans acquired with large inter-slice spacing (""thick slice"")
in clinical settings every year. The inability to quantitatively analyze these
scans hinders the adoption of quantitative neuroimaging in healthcare, and
precludes research studies that could attain huge sample sizes and hence
greatly improve our understanding of the human brain. Recent advances in CNNs
are producing outstanding results in super-resolution and contrast synthesis of
MRI. However, these approaches are very sensitive to the contrast, resolution
and orientation of the input images, and thus do not generalize to diverse
clinical acquisition protocols - even within sites. Here we present SynthSR, a
method to train a CNN that receives one or more thick-slice scans with
different contrast, resolution and orientation, and produces an isotropic scan
of canonical contrast (typically a 1 mm MP-RAGE). The presented method does not
require any preprocessing, e.g., skull stripping or bias field correction.
Crucially, SynthSR trains on synthetic input images generated from 3D
segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of
contrasts, resolutions and orientations without high-resolution training data.
We test the images generated with SynthSR in an array of common downstream
analyses, and show that they can be reliably used for subcortical segmentation
and volumetry, image registration (e.g., for tensor-based morphometry), and, if
some image quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.

investigate the extent to which human-generated explanations of models'
inference decisions align with how models actually make these decisions. More
specifically, we define three alignment metrics that quantify how well natural
language explanations align with model sensitivity to input words, as measured
by integrated gradients. Then, we evaluate eight different models (the base and
large versions of BERT, RoBERTa and ELECTRA, as well as anRNN and bag-of-words
model), and find that the BERT-base model has the highest alignment with
human-generated explanations, for all alignment metrics. Focusing in on
transformers, we find that the base versions tend to have higher alignment with
human-generated explanations than their larger counterparts, suggesting that
increasing the number of model parameters leads, in some cases, to worse
alignment with human explanations. Finally, we find that a model's alignment
with human explanations is not predicted by the model's accuracy, suggesting
that accuracy and alignment are complementary ways to evaluate models.

confronted with a genuine second-order in derivatives field theory. In our
geometric approach, we consider the embedding functions as the field variables
and, even though the highly non-linear dependence of the action on these
variables, we are able to complete the classical analysis of the emerging
constraints for which, after implementing a Dirac bracket, we are able to
identify both the gauge transformations and the proper physical degrees of
freedom of the model. The Ostrogradski-Hamilton framework is thus considerable
robust as one may recover in a straightforward and consistent manner some

achieved by manual contouring of the endo- and epicardial. However, this
process subjected to inter and intra-observer variability, and it is a

multi-task learning approach to obtain a complete set of measurements
quantifying cardiac LV morphology, regional-wall thickness (RWT), and
additionally detecting the cardiac phase cycle (systole and diastole) for a
given 3D Cine-magnetic resonance (MR) image sequence. We first segment cardiac
LVs using an encoder-decoder network and then introduce a multitask framework
to regress 11 LV indices and classify the cardiac phase, as parallel tasks
during model optimization. The proposed deep learning model is based on the 3D
spatio-temporal convolutions, which extract spatial and temporal features from
MR images. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using cine-MR
sequences of 145 subjects and comparing the performance with other
state-of-the-art quantification methods. The proposed method obtained high
prediction accuracy, with an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 129 $mm^2$,

highlight the robustness of the proposed method, despite varying degrees of
cardiac morphology, image appearance, and low contrast in the cardiac MR

it to be applied at multiple layers of a backbone network to form a global

interpret traffic phenomena observed in the real-world but may not fully

other hand, have demonstrated their power in capturing observed traffic

to develop a family of neural network based car-following models that are
informed by physics-based models, which leverage the advantage of both
physics-based (being data-efficient and interpretable) and deep learning based
(being generalizable) models. We design physics-informed deep learning
car-following (PIDL-CF) architectures encoded with two popular physics-based
models - IDM and OVM, on which acceleration is predicted for four traffic
regimes: acceleration, deceleration, cruising, and emergency braking. Two types
of PIDL-CFM problems are studied, one to predict acceleration only and the
other to jointly predict acceleration and discover model parameters. We also
demonstrate the superior performance of PIDL with the Next Generation
SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset over baselines, especially when the training data is

informed by physics over those without. The developed PIDL-CF framework holds
the potential for system identification of driving models and for the

limit for the estimation of unknown parameters. The optimal control, however,
typically depends on the actual values of the parameters and thus needs to be
designed adaptively with the updated estimations of those parameters.
Traditional methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), need to
be rerun for each new set of parameters encountered, making the optimization
costly, especially when many parameters are involved. Here we study the
generalizability of optimal control, namely, optimal controls that can be
systematically updated across a range of parameters with minimal cost. In cases
where control channels can completely reverse the shift in the Hamiltonian due
to a change in parameters, we provide an analytical method which efficiently
generates optimal controls for any parameter starting from an initial optimal
control found by either GRAPE or reinforcement learning. When the control
channels are restricted, the analytical scheme is invalid, but reinforcement
learning still retains a level of generalizability, albeit in a narrower range.
In cases where the shift in the Hamiltonian is impossible to decompose to
available control channels, no generalizability is found for either the
reinforcement learning or the analytical scheme. We argue that the
generalization of reinforcement learning is through a mechanism similar to the
analytical scheme. Our results provide insights into when and how the optimal
control in multiparameter quantum metrology can be generalized, thereby
facilitating efficient implementation of optimal quantum estimation of multiple
parameters, particularly for an ensemble of systems with ranges of parameters.

  Decoding of Polar Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper characterizes the latency of the simplified
successive-cancellation (SSC) decoding scheme for polar codes under hardware
resource constraints. In particular, when the number of processing elements $P$
that can perform SSC decoding operations in parallel is limited, as is the case
in practice, the latency of SSC decoding is
$O\left(N^{1-1/\mu}+\frac{N}{P}\log_2\log_2\frac{N}{P}\right)$, where $N$ is
the block length of the code and $\mu$ is the scaling exponent of the channel.
Three direct consequences of this bound are presented. First, in a
fully-parallel implementation where $P=\frac{N}{2}$, the latency of SSC
decoding is $O\left(N^{1-1/\mu}\right)$, which is sublinear in the block
length. This recovers a result from our earlier work. Second, in a fully-serial
implementation where $P=1$, the latency of SSC decoding scales as
$O\left(N\log_2\log_2 N\right)$. The multiplicative constant is also
calculated: we show that the latency of SSC decoding when $P=1$ is given by
$\left(2+o(1)\right) N\log_2\log_2 N$. Third, in a semi-parallel
implementation, the smallest $P$ that gives the same latency as that of the
fully-parallel implementation is $P=N^{1/\mu}$. The tightness of our bound on
SSC decoding latency and the applicability of the foregoing results is
validated through extensive simulations.

strategies for sequential decision-making problems. Recently, the notion of
fairness has attracted a lot of attention in the machine learning community.
One can impose the fairness condition that at any given point of time, even
during the learning phase, a poorly performing candidate should not be
preferred over a better candidate. This fairness constraint is known to be one
of the most stringent and has been studied in the stochastic multi-armed
bandits' framework in a stationary setting for which regret bounds have been
established. The main aim of this paper is to study this problem in a
non-stationary setting. We present a new algorithm called Fair Upper Confidence
Bound with Exploration Fair-UCBe algorithm for solving a slowly varying
stochastic $k$-armed bandit problem. With this we present two results: (i)
Fair-UCBe indeed satisfies the above mentioned fairness condition, and (ii) it
achieves a regret bound of $O\left(k^{\frac{3}{2}} T^{1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}}
\sqrt{\log T}\right)$, for some suitable $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, where $T$ is the
time horizon. This is the first fair algorithm with a sublinear regret bound
applicable to non-stationary bandits to the best of our knowledge. We show that
the performance of our algorithm in the non-stationary case approaches that of
its stationary counterpart as the variation in the environment tends to zero.

Ann.~Probab.~43~(2015), no.~6, 3494--3513, where the author proved the Parisi
formula under \emph{positive-definite} assumption on the disorder covariance
matrix $\Delta^2$.
  First, we prove exponential overlap concentration at high temperature for
both \indf~and \emph{positive-definite} $\Delta^2$ MSK model. We also prove a
central limit theorem for the free energy using overlap concentration.
Furthermore, in the zero external field case, we use a quadratic coupling
argument to prove overlap concentration up to $\beta_c$, which is expected to
be the critical inverse temperature. The argument holds for both
\emph{positive-definite} and emph{indefinite} $\Delta^2$, and $\beta_c$ has the
same expression in two different cases.
  Second, we develop a species-wise cavity approach to study the overlap
fluctuation, and the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of overlap is
obtained as the solution to a matrix-valued linear system. The asymptotic
variance also suggests the de Almeida--Thouless (AT) line condition from the
Replica Symmetry (RS) side. Our species-wise cavity approach does not require
the positive-definiteness of $\Delta^2$. However, it seems that the AT line
conditions in \emph{positive-definite} and \emph{indefinite} cases are
different.
  Finally, in the case of \emph{positive-definite} $\Delta^2$, we prove that
above the AT line, the MSK model is in Replica Symmetry Breaking phase under
some natural assumption. This generalizes the results of J.~Stat.~Phys.~174

modeling because of its role in both severe weather and in model construction.
Extreme levels of CAPE ($>$ 2000 J/kg) are associated with high-impact weather
events, and CAPE is widely used in convective parametrizations to help
determine the strength and timing of convection. However, to date no study has
systematically evaluated CAPE biases in models in a climatological context, in
an assessment large enough to characterize the high tail of the CAPE
distribution. This work compares CAPE distributions in over 200,000 summertime
proximity soundings from four sources: the observational radiosonde network
(IGRA), 0.125 degree reanalysis (ERA-Interim and ERA5), and a 4 km
convection-permitting regional WRF simulation driven by ERA-Interim. Both
reanalyses and model consistently show too-narrow distributions of CAPE, with
the high tail ($>$ 95th percentile) systematically biased low by up to 10% in
surface-based CAPE and 20% at the most unstable layer. This ""missing tail""
corresponds to the most impacts-relevant conditions. CAPE bias in all datasets
is driven by bias in surface temperature and humidity: reanalyses and model
undersample observed cases of extreme heat and moisture. These results suggest
that reducing inaccuracies in land surface and boundary layer models is
critical for accurately reproducing CAPE.

similar to answering a complicated question, is challenging with many
real-world application scenarios. In this context, automatic summarization has
substantial importance as it will provide the foundation for big data analytic.
Traditional summarization approaches optimize the system to produce a short
static summary that fits all users that do not consider the subjectivity aspect
of summarization, i.e., what is deemed valuable for different users, making
these approaches impractical in real-world use cases. This paper proposes an
interactive concept-based summarization model, called Adaptive Summaries, that
helps users make their desired summary instead of producing a single inflexible
summary. The system learns from users' provided information gradually while
interacting with the system by giving feedback in an iterative loop. Users can
choose either reject or accept action for selecting a concept being included in
the summary with the importance of that concept from users' perspectives and
confidence level of their feedback. The proposed approach can guarantee
interactive speed to keep the user engaged in the process. Furthermore, it
eliminates the need for reference summaries, which is a challenging issue for
summarization tasks. Evaluations show that Adaptive Summaries helps users make
high-quality summaries based on their preferences by maximizing the
user-desired content in the generated summaries.

motion analysis, augmented reality, and virtual reality. Although the recently
developed deep learning-based solutions have achieved high performance in human
pose estimation, there still remain challenges due to insufficient training

provide a comprehensive review of recent deep learning-based solutions for both
2D and 3D pose estimation via a systematic analysis and comparison of these
solutions based on their input data and inference procedures. More than 250
research papers since 2014 are covered in this survey. Furthermore, 2D and 3D
human pose estimation datasets and evaluation metrics are included.
Quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on popular

individuals in a population. In this work, a health care provider wants to
detect infected people as well as people who recovered from the disease as
quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking
process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection
status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider
based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression
for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and
recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based
algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total
test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally,
only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and
recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track
the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size
increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates,
which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby
improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care
provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either
the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.

show that the undeformed entanglement entropy due to cutting these Wilson loops
reproduces the bulk generalized entropy and therefore captures the entanglement
underlying the bulk spacetime. Finally, we show that under the Gopakumar-Vafa

topological D-branes, and the non-local entanglement boundary condition in the

suggests that the geometric transition underlying the gauge-string duality may
also be responsible for the emergence of entanglement branes.

a tiny amount, but has a dramatic impact on the electronic properties of the

induces an increase of the interlayer distance between CuO$_2$ planes in the

oxygens in apical positions, and since oxygen content cannot substantially
increase during annealing, our experiments indicate that the superconducting
phase transition has to be ascribed to a migration of oxygen ions to apical
positions during annealing. Moreover, as we confirm via first-principles
density functional theory calculations, the changes in the structural and
transport properties of the films can be theoretically described by a specific
redistribution of the existing oxygen ions at apical positions with respect to
CuO$_2$ planes, which remodulates the electronic band structure and suppresses
the antiferromagnetic order, allowing the emergence of hole superconductivity.

studies are focused on energies above the $h\,Z$ threshold. However, there are
proposals to run these colliders at the lower $WW$ threshold and $Z$-pole

$WW$ threshold, i.e. energies below the $h\,Z$ threshold where exotic Higgs
decays can be searched for in earnest. Additionally, due to very good angular
and energy resolution at future electron-positron colliders, these searches
will be sensitive to $Z_d$ masses below 1 GeV, which is lower than the current
direct LHC searches. We will show that at $\sqrt{s}=160$ GeV with 10 ab$^{-1}$,
a search for $e^+e^-\rightarrow h\,Z_d$ is sensitive to $h-Z-Z_d$ couplings of

limits where the segregation is perfectly asymmetric (asymmetry $a$ = 1) and
when the asymmetry is small ($0 \leq a \ll 1$). We generalize the model by

iteratively and analytically by expanding moments of the distribution. With

corpuscular picture, where the oscillon is identified with a bound state of a
large number of field quanta, allows to understand lifetimes of order of $10^3$
cycles in generic potentials. At the non-perturbative level, two properties of
the scalar potential can substantially boost the lifetime: the flattening of
$V(\phi)$ and the positivity of $V''(\phi)$. These properties are realized in
the axion monodromy family of potentials. Moreover, this class of models
connects continuously with an exceptional potential that admits eternal
oscillon solutions. We check these results with a new fast-forward numerical
method that allows to evolve in time to stages that cannot be otherwise
simulated on a computer. The method exploits the attractor properties of the
oscillons and fully accounts for nonlinearities. We find lifetimes up to
$10^{14}$ cycles, but larger values are possible. Our work shows that oscillons

that supergravity can be formulated in an O(D,D) covariant way, and remarkably
this remains true to the first order in $\alpha'$. We set up a systematic way
to analyze O(D,D) invariants, working order by order in fields, which we carry
out up to order $\alpha'^3$. At order $\alpha'$ we recover the known Riemann
squared invariant, while at order $\alpha'^2$ we find no independent invariant.
This is compatible with the $\alpha'$ expansion in string theory. However, at
order $\alpha'^3$ we show that there is again no O(D,D) invariant, in
contradiction to the fact that all string theories have a quartic Riemann
invariant with coefficient proportional to $\zeta(3)$. We conclude that DFT and
similar frameworks cannot capture the full $\alpha'$ expansion in string

in the context of upcoming cosmological surveys. We show that, compared to the

characterised by a simple 3D model and is more robust against fluctuations.
Perturbations in the gas density distribution can have a substantial influence
on the derived thermodynamic properties, while cluster potentials are smooth
and well-approximated by a spheroidal model. We use a statistical sample of 85
galaxy clusters from a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to
investigate cluster shapes as a function of radius. In particular, we examine
the shape of isodensity and isopotential shells and analyze how it is affected
by the choice of component (gas vs. potential), substructure removal (for the
gas density) and the definition of the computation domain (interior vs.
shells). We find that the orientation and axis ratios of gas isodensity
contours are degenerate with the presence of substructures and unstable against
fluctuations. We observe that, as the derived cluster shape depends on the
method used for removing the substructures, thermodynamic properties extracted
from e.g. X-ray emissivity profiles suffer from this additional, often
underestimated bias. In contrast, the shape reconstruction of the potential is
largely unaffected by these factors and converges towards simple geometric
models for both relaxed and dynamically active clusters. The observation that
cluster potentials are better represented by simple geometrical models and
reconstructed with a low level of systematics for both dynamically active and
relaxed clusters suggests that by characterising galaxy clusters by their
potential rather than by their mass, dynamically active and relaxed clusters
could be combined in cosmological studies, improving statistics and lowering

the Coriolis force mimicking the local region of the accretion disk. For plane
Couette flow, the Coriolis term drops. Subsequently we solve the equations by
WKB approximation method. We investigate the dispersion relation for the
Keplerian flow and plane Couette flow for all possible combinations of wave

are unstable for a certain range of wave vectors. However, the nature of
instability between the flows is different. We also study the Argand diagrams

scales corresponding to the perturbations as well as accretion. We ultimately
conclude with this formalism that fluid gets enough time to be unstable and

approximation spaces are constructed using a semi-analytical approach. They are
based on partitions of the computational domain by polygonal/polyhedral

by imposing a starlike scaling requirement on the subregions, the
representation of local SBFEM shape functions in radial and surface directions
are obtained from eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an ODE system, whose
coefficients are determined by the element geometry and the trace polynomial
spaces. The aim of this paper is to derive a priori error estimates for SBFEM's
solutions of harmonic test problems. For that, the SBFEM spaces are
characterized in the context of Duffy's approximations for which a
gradient-orthogonality constraint is imposed. As a consequence, the scaled
boundary functions are gradient-orthogonal to any function in Duffy's spaces
vanishing at the mesh skeleton, a mimetic version of a well-known property
valid for harmonic functions. This orthogonality property is applied to provide
a priori SBFEM error estimates in terms of known finite element interpolant
errors of the exact solution. Similarities with virtual harmonic approximations
are also explored for the understanding of SBFEM convergence properties.
Numerical experiments with 2D and 3D polytopal meshes confirm optimal SBFEM
convergence rates for two test problems with smooth solutions. Attention is
also paid to the approximation of a point singular solution by using SBFEM
close to the singularity and finite element approximations elsewhere, revealing
optimal accuracy rates of standard regular contexts.

potentials suitable for these models. Through the development of an autonomous
dynamical system, the critical points and their stability analysis is
performed. It has been observed that these stable critical points are satisfied
by power law solutions. Moving on towards the analysis we can predict the fate

quantum mechanics. One is derived from Copenhagen quantum mechanics using the
projection postulate and is the basis of the ""consistent histories""
interpretation; the other is based on a proposal by Bell, originally for the
""pilot state"" theory but here applied to pure unitary quantum mechanics. The
first can be used for a wider class of histories but depends on the projection
postulate, or ""collapse"", which is widely held to be an unsatisfactory feature
of the theory; the second can be used in a theory of the universal state vector
without collapse. We examine a simple model based on Wigner's friend, in which
Bell's model and the projection postulate give different probabilities for the
histories of a sentient system. We also examine the Frauchiger-Renner extension
of this model, in which comparison of the two calculations of histories throws
light on the contradiction found by Frauchiger and Renner. By extending the
model to equip the observer with a memory, we reduce the probability of
histories to the use of the Born rule at a single time, and show that the Born
rule, with the memory, gives the same result as applying projection in the
course of the history, because of entanglement with the memory: entanglement
implements collapse. We discuss the implications of this for the use of
histories in quantum cosmology.

conceptually simple, we show that working in this setting significantly
improves the accuracy and guarantees of forgetting methods applied to vision

the weights with minimal loss in performance. We achieve these results by
replacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With
opportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show
that such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original
network and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved
efficiently even for large models. Unlike previous forgetting methods on deep

accuracy increases initially and drops in the later stages. To find an early
stopping point at the maximum obtainable test accuracy (MOTA), recent studies
assume either that i) a clean validation set is available or ii) the noise

boundary, the dual picture describes a CFT at a temperature different from that
of the cosmological horizon. We determine minimal surfaces that allow us to
compute the entanglement entropy of a boundary region, as well as the
temperature affecting the energy associated with a probe quark on the boundary.
For an entangling surface that coincides with the horizon, we study the
relation between entanglement and gravitational entropy through an appropriate

contribution to the entropy is proportional to the horizon area, with a
coefficient that accounts for the degrees of freedom of a CFT thermalized above

cavitation in soft materials requires higher tensile pressure than pure water.
The extra tensile pressure is required since the cavitating bubble needs to
overcome the elastic energy in soft materials. In this manuscript, we have
developed two models to study and quantify the extra tensile pressure. In the
first approach, we proposed a strain energy based random fiber network (RFN)
failure criteria in which interaction between the cavitating bubble and RFN is
considered. Gelatin samples are prepared for different concentrations, and SEM
images are used to study the microstructural properties of the RFN. A unit-cell
model is introduced to evaluate the geometrical and mechanical properties of
the RFN. The network strain energy formulation is then coupled with the bubble
growth, and the critical condition is set as the fibers ultimate failure
strain. We considered soft materials as homogeneous hyper-elastic Ogden
material, and fracture-based failure criteria are proposed in the second
approach. The critical energy release rate is considered for quantifying the
extra tensile pressure. Both the models are then compared with the existing
cavitation onset criteria of rubber like materials. The validation is done with
the experimental results of threshold tensile pressure for different gelatin
concentrations. We have found that due to the large distribution of the pore
size in the network, the nucleation pressure is similar to water. Both models
can moderately predict the extra tensile pressure within the intermediate range
of gelatin concentrations. For low concentration, the network's non-affinity
plays a significant role and must be incorporated. On the other hand, for
higher concentrations, the entropic deformation dominates, and strain energy
formulation is not adequate.

energy market are typically made in advance when little information is
obtainable about wind availability and market prices. Much research has been
published recommending various frameworks for addressing this issue. However,
these frameworks are limited as they do not consider all markets a producer can

for uncertainty data to be updated as more accurate information becomes
available. This work proposes two decision-making frameworks for a wind energy
generator participating in day-ahead, intraday, reserve, and balancing markets.
The first framework is a two-stage stochastic convex optimization approach,
where both scenario-independent and scenario-dependent decisions are made
concurrently. The second framework is a series of four two-stage stochastic
optimization models wherein the results from each model feed into each
subsequent model allowing for scenarios to be updated as more information
becomes available to the decision-maker. In the simulation experiments, the
multi-phase framework performs better than the single-phase in every run, and
results in an average profit increase of 7%. The proposed optimization
frameworks aid in better decision-making while addressing uncertainty related
to variable resource generators and maximize the return on investment.

quantization and propagated via a diffusion Monte Carlo approach. Our method is
tested on the one- and two-dimensional Holstein and Hubbard-Holstein models.
With a simple semiclassical trial wavefunction, our approach is remarkably
accurate for $\omega/(2\text{d}t\lambda) < 1$ for all parameters in the
Holstein model considered in this study. In addition, we empirically show that
the autocorrelation time scales as $1/\omega$ for $\omega/t \lesssim 1$, which
is an improvement over the $1/\omega^2$ scaling of the conventional determinant
quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. In the Hubbard-Holstein model, the accuracy of
our algorithm is found to be consistent with that of standard CP-AFQMC for the
Hubbard model when the Hubbard $U$ term dominates the physics of the model, and
is nearly exact when the ground state is dominated by the electron-phonon

valuable for understanding the complex physics arising from the interplay

prediction is a level above freeway traffic prediction. Many existing studies
on arterial traffic prediction only consider temporal measurements of flow and
occupancy from loop sensors and neglect the rich spatial relationships between
upstream and downstream detectors. As a result, they often suffer large
prediction errors, especially for long horizons. We fill this gap by enhancing
a deep learning approach, Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network,
with spatial information generated from signal timing plans at targeted
intersections. Traffic at signalized intersections is modeled as a diffusion
process with a transition matrix constructed from the phase splits of the
signal phase timing plan. We apply this novel method to predict traffic flow
from loop sensor measurements and signal timing plans at an arterial
intersection in Arcadia, CA. We demonstrate that our proposed method yields
superior forecasts; for a prediction horizon of 30 minutes, we cut the MAPE
down to 16% for morning peaks, 10% for off peaks, and even 8% for afternoon
peaks. In addition, we exemplify the robustness of our model through a number
of experiments with various settings in detector coverage, detector type, and

extract the proper correlation function. We apply this method to infer the
amplitude of motion of a flexible marine riser in cross-flow, subject to
vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). VIV are driven by an absolute instability in
the flow, which imposes a frequency (Strouhal) law that requires a matching
with the impedance of the structure; this matching is easily achieved because
of the rapid parametric variation of the added mass force. As a result, the
wavenumber of the riser spatial response is within narrow bands of uncertainty.
Hence, an error in wavenumber prediction can cause significant phase-related
errors in the shape of the amplitude of response along the riser, rendering
correlation between low- and high-fidelity data very complex. Working in modal
space as outlined herein, dense data from low-fidelity data, provided by the
semi-empirical computer code VIVA, can correlate in modal space with few
high-fidelity data, obtained from experiments or fully-resolved CFD
simulations, to correct both phase and amplitude and provide predictions that
agree very well overall with the correct shape of the amplitude response. We
also quantify the uncertainty in the prediction using Bayesian modeling and
exploit this uncertainty to formulate an active learning strategy for the best
possible location of the sensors providing the high fidelity measurements.

non-equilibrium quantum dynamics by introducing the concept of high-order
topological charges, with novel phenomena being predicted. Through a dimension
reduction approach, we can characterize a $d$-dimensional ($d$D)
integer-invariant topological phase with lower-dimensional topological number
quantified by high-order topological charges, of which the $s$th-order
topological charges denote the monopoles confined on the $(s-1)$th-order band
inversion surfaces (BISs) that are $(d-s+1)$D momentum subspaces. The bulk
topology is determined by the $s$th order topological charges enclosed by the
$s$th-order BISs. By quenching the system from trivial phase to topological
regime, we show that the bulk topology of post-quench Hamiltonian can be
detected through a high-order dynamical bulk-surface correspondence, in which
both the high-order topological charges and high-order BISs are identified from
quench dynamics. This characterization theory has essential advantages in two
aspects. First, the highest ($d$th) order topological charges are characterized
by only discrete signs of spin-polarization in zero dimension (i.e. the $0$th
Chern numbers), whose measurement is much easier than the $1$st-order
topological charges that are characterized by the continuous charge-related
spin texture in higher dimensional space. Secondly, a more striking result is
that a first-order high integer-valued topological charge always reduces to
multiple highest-order topological charges with unit charge value, and the
latter can be readily detected in experiment. The two fundamental features
greatly simplify the characterization and detection of the topological charges
and also topological phases, which shall advance the experimental studies in
the near future.

head impact is a crucial global public health problem, but the physics of mTBI
is still unclear. During the impact, the rapid movement of the head injures the
brain, so researchers have been endeavoring to investigate the relationship
between head kinematic parameters (e.g., linear acceleration, angular velocity,
angular acceleration) and brain strain, which is associated with the injury of
the brain tissue. Although previous studies have shown that linear acceleration
had a limited contribution to brain strain, whether angular velocity or angular
acceleration causes brain strain is still unclear because of their
interdependency (acceleration being the velocity time-derivative). By reframing
the problem through the lens of inertial forces, we propose to use the skull
frame of reference instead of the ground frame of reference to describe brain
deformation during head impact. Based on the rigid-body rotation of the brain,
we present a theoretical framework of mechanical analysis about how the
inertial forces cause brain strain. In this way, we theoretically show that
angular acceleration determines brain strain, and we validate this by numerical
simulations using a finite element head model. We also provide an explanation
of why previous studies based on peak values found the opposite: that angular
velocity determined brain strain in certain situations. Furthermore, we use the
same framework to show that linear acceleration causes brain strain in a
different mechanism from angular acceleration. However, because of the brain's
different resistances to compressing and shearing, the brain strain caused by
linear acceleration is small compared with angular acceleration.

to examine if non-monetary interventions, particularly, social recognition can
be used to change the gender norms associated with such tasks. We design three
treatments, where a) a volunteer receives positive social recognition, b) a
non-volunteer receives negative social recognition, and c) a volunteer receives
positive, but a non-volunteer receives negative social recognition. Our results
indicate that competition for social recognition increases the overall
likelihood that someone in a group has volunteered. Positive social recognition
closes the gender gap observed in the baseline treatment, so does the
combination of positive and negative social recognition. Our results,
consistent with the prior literature on gender differences in competition,
suggest that public recognition of volunteering can change the default gender
norms in organizations and increase efficiency at the same time.

hardware-efficient passive elements, is deemed as a potential technique for
future wireless communications since it can adaptively enhance the propagation
environment. In order to effectively utilize IRS to achieve promising
beamforming gains, the problem of channel state information (CSI) acquisition
needs to be carefully considered. However, most recent works assume to employ
an ideal IRS, i.e., each reflecting element has constant amplitude, variable
phase shifts, as well as the same response for the signals with different
frequencies, which will cause severe estimation error due to the mismatch
between the ideal IRS and the practical one. In this paper, we study channel
estimation in practical IRS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) systems with discrete phase shifts. Different from the prior works which
assume that IRS has an ideal reflection model, we perform channel estimation by
considering amplitude-phase shift-frequency relationship for the response of
practical IRS. Aiming at minimizing normalized-mean-square-error (NMSE) of the
estimated channel, a novel IRS time-varying reflection pattern is designed by
leveraging the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for the case of using
low-resolution phase shifters. Moreover, for the high-resolution IRS cases, we
provide another practical reflection pattern scheme to further reduce the
complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of considering
practical IRS model for channel estimation and the effectiveness of our
proposed channel estimation methods.

benefits of the proposed model are six-fold: first, unlike GANs and VAEs, the
model training does not rely on any auxiliary models; second, the model can
synthesize realistic 3D shapes by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); third, the
conditional model can be applied to 3D object recovery and super resolution;
fourth, the model can serve as a building block in a multi-grid modeling and
sampling framework for high resolution 3D shape synthesis; fifth, the model can
be used to train a 3D generator via MCMC teaching; sixth, the unsupervisedly
trained model provides a powerful feature extractor for 3D data, which is
useful for 3D object classification. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed

sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is required to support grant-free random
access of a massive number of sporadic traffic devices. In particular, at the
beginning of each time slot, the base station (BS) performs joint activity
detection and channel estimation (JADCE) based on the received pilot sequences
sent from active devices. Due to the deployment of a large-scale antenna array
and the existence of a massive number of IoT devices, conventional JADCE
approaches usually have high computational complexity and need long pilot
sequences. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning
framework for JADCE in 6G wireless networks, which contains a dimension
reduction module, a deep learning network module, an active device detection
module, and a channel estimation module. Then, prior-feature learning followed
by an adaptive-tuning strategy is proposed, where an inner network composed of
the Expectation-maximization (EM) and back-propagation is introduced to jointly
tune the precision and learn the distribution parameters of the device state
matrix. Finally, by designing the inner layer-by-layer and outer layer-by-layer
training method, a feature-aided adaptive-tuning deep learning network is
built. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm that the

respectively. The disformal transformation maps a solution in a class of the
scalar-tensor or vector-tensor theories to that in another class, and hence it
can be a useful tool to construct a new nontrivial solution from the known one.
First, we investigate how the stationary and axisymmetric solutions in the
vector-tensor theories without and with the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry are
disformally transformed. We start from a stationary and axisymmetric solution
satisfying the circularity conditions, and show that in both the cases the
metric of the disformed solution in general does not satisfy the circularity
conditions. Using the fact that a solution in a class of the vector-tensor
theories with the vanishing field strength is mapped to that in a class of the
shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories, we derive the disformed stationary and
axisymmetric solutions in a class of these theories, and show that the metric
of the disformed solutions does not satisfy the circularity conditions if the
scalar field depends on the time or azimuthal coordinate. We also confirm that
in the scalar-tensor theories without the shift symmetry, the disformed
stationary and axisymmetric solutions satisfy the circularity conditions.
Second, we investigate the disformal transformations of the stationary and
axisymmetric black hole solutions in the generalized Proca theory with the
nonminimal coupling to the Einstein tensor, the shift-symmetric scalar-tensor
theory with the nonminimal derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor, the
Einstein-Maxwell theory, and the Einstein-conformally coupled scalar field

thermal background subtraction residuals. Our aim is to either remove or at
least minimise the need for nodding in order to increase the observing
efficiency for METIS. To this end we need to improve our knowledge about the
origin of chop residuals and devise observing methods to remove them most
efficiently, i.e. with the slowest possible nodding frequency. Thanks to
dedicated observations with VLT/VISIR and GranTeCan/CanariCam, we have
successfully traced the origin of three kinds of chopping residuals to (1) the
entrance window, (2) the spiders and (3) other warm emitters in the pupil, in
particular the VLT M3 mirror cell in its parking position. We conclude that, in
order to keep chopping residuals stable over a long time (and therefore allow
for slower nodding cycles), the pupil illumination needs to be kept constant,
i.e. (imaging) observations should be performed in pupil-stabilised, rather
than field-stabilised mode, with image de-rotation in the post-processing
pipeline. This is now foreseen as the default observing concept for all METIS

computing (MEC) provides a natural platform for AI applications since it is
with rich computation resources to train machine learning (ML) models, as well
as low-latency access to the data generated by mobile and internet of things

at an MEC server with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS). In contrast to conventional communication systems where the principal
criterions are to maximize the throughput, we aim at maximizing the learning
performance. Specifically, we minimize the maximum learning error of all
participating users by jointly optimizing transmit power of mobile users,
beamforming vectors of the base station (BS), and the phase-shift matrix of the
RIS. An alternating optimization (AO)-based framework is proposed to optimize
the three terms iteratively, where a successive convex approximation
(SCA)-based algorithm is developed to solve the power allocation problem,
closed-form expressions of the beamforming vectors are derived, and an
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm is designed
together with an error level searching (ELS) framework to effectively solve the
challenging nonconvex optimization problem of the phase-shift matrix.
Simulation results demonstrate significant gains of deploying an RIS and
validate the advantages of our proposed algorithms over various benchmarks.
Lastly, a unified communication-training-inference platform is developed based
on the CARLA platform and the SECOND network, and a use case (3D object
detection in autonomous driving) for the proposed scheme is demonstrated on the
developed platform.

proposed to support diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements in 6G

ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) devices coexist. In the
proposed LSTMH-RA scheme, mMTC devices access the network via a timing advance
(TA)-aided four-step procedure to meet massive access requirement, while the
access procedure of the URLLC devices is completed in two steps coupled with
the mMTC devices' access procedure to reduce latency. Furthermore, we propose
an attention-based LSTM prediction model to predict the number of active URLLC
devices, thereby determining the parameters of the multi-user detection
algorithm to guarantee the latency and reliability access requirements of URLLC
devices. We analyze the successful access probability of the LSTMH-RA scheme.
Numerical results show that, compared with the benchmark schemes, the proposed
LSTMH-RA scheme can significantly improve the successful access probability,

  Unsupervised Cross-modal Hashing",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has become a hot topic recently.
Current UCMH focuses on exploring data similarities. However, current UCMH
methods calculate the similarity between two data, mainly relying on the two
data's cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity
problems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space, because the
cross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the
complex data relationships, such as situations where two data have different
feature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper, we
devise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN).
Specifically, DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor
coherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors.
DGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three
types of data similarities (i.e., the graph-neighbor coherence, the coexistent
similarity, and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a
half-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization
errors during hashing. Essentially, DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity
problem by exploring and exploiting the data's intrinsic relationships in a
graph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN, e.g., by improving
the mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit
hashing codes to retrieve texts from images. We will release the source code
package and the trained model on https://github.com/Atmegal/DGCPN.

systems, it is usually at the cost of large data requirements. This makes many
successful algorithms from machine learning unsuitable for human-machine

samples that can be provided by a user within a reasonable time frame.
Fortunately, the user can tailor the training data they create to be as useful
as possible, severely limiting its necessary size -- as long as they know about
the machine's requirements and limitations. Of course, acquiring this knowledge
can in turn be cumbersome and costly. This raises the question of how easy
machine learning algorithms are to interact with. In this work, we address this
issue by analyzing the intuitiveness of certain algorithms when they are
actively taught by users. After developing a theoretical framework of
intuitiveness as a property of algorithms, we introduce an active teaching
paradigm involving a prototypical two-dimensional spatial learning task as a
method to judge the efficacy of human-machine interactions. Finally, we present

focusing on moderately inertial regimes in which the path of an isolated bubble

configurations of the bubble pair are determined as a function of the
buoyancy-to-viscous and buoyancy-to-capillary force ratios which define the
Galilei ($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, respectively. The
three-dimensional solutions reveal that this axisymmetric equilibrium is
actually never reached. Instead, provided $Bo$ stands below a critical
$Ga$-dependent threshold determining the onset of coalescence, two markedly
different evolutions are observed. At the lower end of the explored
$(Ga,\,Bo)$-range, the tandem follows a Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling scenario
which eventually yields a planar side-by-side motion. For larger $Ga$, the
trailing bubble drifts laterally and gets out of the wake of the leading
bubble, barely altering the path of the latter. In this second scenario, the
late configuration is characterized by a significant inclination of the tandem
ranging from $30^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ with respect to the vertical. Bubble
deformation has a major influence on the evolution of the system. It controls
the magnitude of vortical effects in the wake of the leading bubble, hence the
strength of the attractive force acting on the trailing bubble. It also governs
the strength and even the sign of the lateral force acting on this bubble, a
mechanism of particular importance when the tandem is released with a small
angular deviation.

scenario with implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, purchases). State-of-the-art
methods in this direction usually cast the problem as to learn a personalized
ranking on a set of items (e.g., webpages, products). The top-N results are
then provided to users as recommendations, where the N is usually a fixed
number pre-defined by the system according to some heuristic criteria (e.g.,
page size, screen size). There is one major assumption underlying this
fixed-number recommendation scheme, i.e., there are always sufficient relevant
items to users' preferences. Unfortunately, this assumption may not always hold
in real-world scenarios. In some applications, there might be very limited
candidate items to recommend, and some users may have very high relevance
requirement in recommendation. In this way, even the top-1 ranked item may not
be relevant to a user's preference. Therefore, we argue that it is critical to
provide a dynamic-K recommendation, where the K should be different with
respect to the candidate item set and the target user. We formulate this
dynamic-K recommendation task as a joint learning problem with both ranking and
classification objectives. The ranking objective is the same as existing
methods, i.e., to create a ranking list of items according to users' interests.
The classification objective is unique in this work, which aims to learn a
personalized decision boundary to differentiate the relevant items from
irrelevant items. Based on these ideas, we extend two state-of-the-art
ranking-based recommendation methods, i.e., BPRMF and HRM, to the corresponding
dynamic-K versions, namely DK-BPRMF and DK-HRM. Our experimental results on two
datasets show that the dynamic-K models are more effective than the original
fixed-N recommendation methods.

disjoint classes: generative or discriminative. It depends on the posterior
probability computation of the label $x$ given the observation $y$, $p(x | y)$.
On the one hand, generative classifiers, like the Naive Bayes or the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM), need the computation of the joint probability p(x,y),
before using the Bayes rule to compute $p(x | y)$. On the other hand,
discriminative classifiers compute $p(x | y)$ directly, regardless of the
observations' law. They are intensively used nowadays, with models as Logistic
Regression, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and Artificial Neural Networks.
However, the recent Entropic Forward-Backward algorithm shows that the HMM,
considered as a generative model, can also match the discriminative one's
definition. This example leads to question if it is the case for other
generative models. In this paper, we show that the Naive Bayes classifier can
also match the discriminative classifier definition, so it can be used in
either a generative or a discriminative way. Moreover, this observation also
discusses the notion of Generative-Discriminative pairs, linking, for example,
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, or HMM and CRF. Related to this point, we

resist adversarial attacks. However, some works suggested that adversarial
training might comprise the privacy-preserving and generalization abilities.
This paper establishes and quantifies the privacy-robustness trade-off and
generalization-robustness trade-off in adversarial training from both
theoretical and empirical aspects. We first define a notion, {\it robustified
intensity} to measure the robustness of an adversarial training algorithm. This
measure can be approximate empirically by an asymptotically consistent
empirical estimator, {\it empirical robustified intensity}. Based on the
robustified intensity, we prove that (1) adversarial training is $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private, where the magnitude of the differential
privacy has a positive correlation with the robustified intensity; and (2) the
generalization error of adversarial training can be upper bounded by an
$\mathcal O(\sqrt{\log N}/N)$ on-average bound and an $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{N})$
high-probability bound, both of which have positive correlations with the
robustified intensity. Additionally, our generalization bounds do not
explicitly rely on the parameter size which would be prohibitively large in
deep learning. Systematic experiments on standard datasets, CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100, are in full agreement with our theories. The source code package is

modified, and the scalar field may be trapped for a long time in a different
location than the current vacuum. The trapping effect can increase or decrease
the scalar abundance. For instance, in thermal inflation, a scalar field is
trapped at the top of the potential by a thermal effect and dominates the
universe to drive inflation for a short period of time. On the other hand, a
scalar abundance can be exponentially suppressed in the adiabatic suppression
mechanism, where a scalar field moves adiabatically by a time-dependent
trapping potential. In this study, we investigate such a trapping effect on the
abundance of scalar fields. Specifically, we investigate how the abundance of a
scalar field depends on its initial position in the case of a double well
potential and identify the physical quantity that controls the abundance. Then,
we study the QCD axion abundance for various values of the misalignment angle,

practice for almost a millennium although the anatomical structures and
functions remain to be clarified. It has recently been reported that a
long-distance interstitial fluid (ISF) circulatory pathway may originate from
the acupoints in the extremities. As observed in living human subjects,
cadavers and animals using magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescent tracers,
the ISF flow pathways include at least 4 types of anatomical structures: the
cutaneous-, perivenous-, periarterial-, and neural-pathways. Unlike the blood
or lymphatic vessels, these ISF flow pathways are composed of highly ordered
and topologically connected interstitial fibrous connective tissues that may
work as guiderails for the ISF to flow actively over long distance under
certain driving forces. Our experimental results demonstrated that most
acupoints in the extremity endings connect with one or more ISF flow pathways
and comprise a complex network of acupoint-ISF-pathways. We also found that
this acupoint-ISF-pathway network can connect to visceral organs or tissues
such as the pericardium and epicardium, even though the topographical geometry
in human extremities does not totally match the meridian lines on the atlas
that is currently used in traditional Chinese medicine. Based on our
experimental data, the following working hypotheses are proposed. A
comprehensive atlas will be constructed to systemically reveal the detailed
anatomical structures of the acupoints-originated ISF circulation. Such an
atlas may shed light on the mysteries shrouding the visceral correlations of
acupoints and meridians, and inaugurate a new frontier for innovative medical

detailed expectations regarding future experiments. A model-based approach also
allows one to evaluate inferences and predicted outcomes, by calibrating (or
measuring) the consequences incurred when certain results are reported. We
present procedures for calibrating predictions of an experiment's sensitivity
to both continuous and discrete parameters. Using these procedures and a new
Bayesian model of the $\beta$-decay spectrum, we assess a high-precision
$\beta$-decay experiment's sensitivity to the neutrino mass scale and ordering,
for one assumed design scenario. We find that such an experiment could measure
the electron-weighted neutrino mass within $\sim40\,$meV after 1 year (90$\%$
credibility). Neutrino masses $>500\,$meV could be measured within
$\approx5\,$meV. Using only $\beta$-decay and external reactor neutrino data,
we find that next-generation $\beta$-decay experiments could potentially
constrain the mass ordering using a two-neutrino spectral model analysis. By
calibrating mass ordering results, we identify reporting criteria that can be
tuned to suppress false ordering claims. In some cases, a two-neutrino analysis
can reveal that the mass ordering is inverted, an unobtainable result for the
traditional one-neutrino analysis approach.

the equation $x^2+1=0$ is solvable, without specifying the field in which we
want the solutions to be lie. The equation $x^2+1=0$ has no solutions in
$\mathbb{R}$, which is to say, there are no real numbers satisfying this
equation. On the other hand, there are complex numbers which do satisfy this
equation in the field $\mathbb{C}$ of all complex numbers. How about if we
extend the same idea to other two normed division algebras quaternions and
octonions. Liping Huang and Wasin So derive explicit formulas for computing the
roots of quaternionic quadratic equations. We extend their work to octonionic
case and solve monic left octonionic quadratic equation of the form
$x^2+bx+c=0$, where $a,b$ are octonions in general.[ We called this form of
quadratic equation as left octonion quadratic equation because we can consider

Finally, we represent the left spectrum of $2\times2$ octonionic matrix as a
set of solutions to a corresponding octonionic quadratic equation, which is an
application of deriving explicit formulas for computing the roots of octonionic

physical-phenomenological approach by utilizing existing work on the physics of
classical box-representations of the cochlea, and behavior of recent
data-derived wavenumber estimates. Spatial variation is incorporated through a
single independent variable that combines space and frequency. We arrive at
closed-form expressions for the organ of Corti velocity, its impedance, the
pressure difference across the organ of Corti, and its wavenumber. We perform
model tests using real and imaginary parts of chinchilla data from multiple
locations and for multiple variables. The model also predicts impedances that
are qualitatively consistent with current literature. For implementation, the
model can leverage existing efforts for both filter bank and filter cascade
models that target improved algorithmic or analog circuit efficiencies. The
simplicity of the cochlear model, its small number of model constants, its
ability to capture the variation of tuning, its closed-form expressions for
physically-interrelated variables, and the form of these expressions that
allows for easily determining one variable from another make the model
appropriate for analytic and digital auditory filter implementations as
discussed here, as well as for extracting macromechanical insights regarding
how the cochlea works.

a challenging and time-consuming task that requires high computing resources.
To this end, an appropriate summarization technique is of great importance,
where it can be a substitute for the original data. However, the summarized
data is under the threat of removing anomalies. Therefore, it is vital to
create a summary that can reflect the same pattern as the original data.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose an INtelligent Summarization approach for
IDENTifying hidden anomalies, called INSIDENT. The proposed approach guarantees
to keep the original data distribution in summarized data. Our approach is a
clustering-based algorithm that dynamically maps original feature space to a
new feature space by locally weighting features in each cluster. Therefore, in
new feature space, similar samples are closer, and consequently, outliers are
more detectable. Besides, selecting representatives based on cluster size keeps
the same distribution as the original data in summarized data. INSIDENT can be
used both as the preprocess approach before performing anomaly detection
algorithms and anomaly detection algorithm. The experimental results on
benchmark datasets prove a summary of the data can be a substitute for original
data in the anomaly detection task.
