  Possible implications for the physics of ""dark energy"" and ""dark matter""","33 pages, 4 figures",,,"DESY 20-144","physics.gen-ph physics.atom-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Replacing the canonical pair q and p of the harmonic oscillator (HO) by the
locally and symplectically equivalent pair angle phi and action variable I
implies a qualitative change of the global topological structure of the
associated phase spaces: the pair (q,p) is an element of a topologically
trivial plane R^2 whereas the pair (phi,I>0) is an element of a topologically
non-trivial, infinitely connected, punctured plane R^2-{0}, which has the group
SO(1,2) as its ""canonical"" group. Due to its infinitely many covering groups
the resulting (""symplectic"") spectrum of the associated quantum Hamiltonian is
given by {hbar omega (n+b), n =0,1,...; b in (0,1]}, in contrast to the
""orthodox"" spectrum {hbar omega (n+1/2)}.
  The potentially most important implications concern the vibrations of
diatomic molecules in the infrared, e.g. those of molecular hydrogen H_2. Those
symplectic spectra of the HO may provide a simultaneous key to two outstanding
astrophysical puzzles, namely the nature of dark (vacuum) energy and that of
dark matter: To the former because the zero-point energy b hbar omega of free
electromagnetic wave oscillator modes can be extremely small > 0 (b ca.
exp(-35) for the measured dark energy density). And a key to the dark matter
problem because the quantum zero-point energies of the Born-Oppenheimer
potentials in which the two nuclei of H_2 or the nuclei of other primordial
diatomic molecules vibrate can be lower, too, and, therefore, may lead to
spectrally detuned ""dark"" H_2 molecules during the ""Dark Ages"" of the universe
and forming WIMPs in the hypothesized sense. All results appear to be in
surprisingly good agreement with the LambdaCDM model of the universe. Besides
laboratory experiments the search for 21-cm radio signals from the Dark Ages of
the universe and other astrophysical observations can help to explore those
hypothetical implications.

software engineering tasks. However, ML outcomes may be sensitive to
randomization in data sampling mechanisms and learning procedures. To
understand whether and how researchers in SE address these threats, we surveyed
45 recent papers related to three predictive tasks: defect prediction (DP),
predictive mutation testing (PMT), and code smell detection (CSD). We found
that less than 50% of the surveyed papers address the threats related to
randomized data sampling (via multiple repetitions); only 8% of the papers
address the random nature of ML; and parameter values are rarely reported (only
18% of the papers). To assess the severity of these threats, we conducted an
empirical study using 26 real-world datasets commonly considered for the three
predictive tasks of interest, considering eight common supervised ML
classifiers. We show that different data resamplings for 10-fold
cross-validation lead to extreme variability in observed performance results.
Furthermore, randomized ML methods also show non-negligible variability for
different choices of random seeds. More worryingly, performance and variability
are inconsistent for different implementations of the conceptually same ML
method in different libraries, as also shown through multi-dataset pairwise
comparison. To cope with these critical threats, we provide practical
guidelines on how to validate, assess, and report the results of predictive

decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles (AVs), including dynamical
selection of driving velocity and route choices on a transportation network.
Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been widely used to model travelers's
route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow
evolution in the short term. However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly
describe one's selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity
choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is
a must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a
game-theoretic model to solve for AVs's optimal driving strategies of velocity
control in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To
this end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential
game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field
game-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve
because of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the
complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is
developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are
illustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination.
On the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the
proposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with
overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the
middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain
conditions. We also test our proposed model and solution algorithm on the OW
network.

further defines a constructive procedure by which the LRT ROC can be generated

phases of interacting electrons, produced by the Coulomb attraction between a
small and equal number of electrons and holes, leading to the spontaneous
formation of exciton pairs in narrow-gap semiconductors/semimetals. The layered
chalcogenide Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been recently discussed as such an excitonic

demonstrate a drastic collapse of the excitation gap in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and the
realization of a zero-gap state by moving the tip of a cryogenic scanning
tunneling microscope towards the sample surface by a few angstroms. The
collapse strongly suggests the many-body nature of the gap in the insulating
state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, consistent with the formation of an excitonic state.
We argue that the collapse of the gap is driven predominantly by the
electrostatic charge accumulation at the surface induced by the proximity of
the tip and the resultant carrier doping of the excitonic insulator. Our
results establish a novel phase-change function based on excitonic insulators.

microbes' reaction to the environment and interactions among microbes. While a
multiresponse linear regression model seems like a straight-forward solution,
we argue that treating it as a graphical model is flawed given that the
regression coefficient matrix does not encode the conditional dependence
structure between response and predictor nodes as it does not represent the
adjacency matrix. This observation is especially important in biological
settings when we have prior knowledge on the edges from specific experimental
interventions that can only be properly encoded under a conditional dependence
model. Here, we propose a chain graph model with two sets of nodes (predictors
and responses) whose solution yields a graph with edges that indeed represent
conditional dependence and thus, agrees with the experimenter's intuition on
the average behavior of nodes under treatment. The solution to our model is
sparse via Bayesian LASSO. In addition, we propose an adaptive extension so
that different shrinkage can be applied to different edges to incorporate
edge-specific prior knowledge. Our model is computationally inexpensive through
an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and can account for binary, counting and
compositional responses via appropriate hierarchical structure. We apply our
model to a human gut and a soil microbial compositional datasets and we

auxiliary class for classifying OoD samples. We utilize mixup in two ways to
implement Vicinal Risk Minimization. First, we perform mixup within the same
class and second, we perform mixup with Gaussian noise when training the
auxiliary class. Our method achieves near competitive performance with
significantly less compute and memory overhead when compared to existing OoD

computers. There are quantum algorithms which require both superposition and
entanglement (e.g. Shor algorithm). But neither the Grover algorithm nor the

possible to utilize classical wave superposition to speedup database search?
This interesting question was analyzed by S. Lloyd. It was concluded that
classical devices that rely on wave interference may provide the same speedup
over classical digital devices as quantum devices. There were several
experimental works using optical beam superposition for emulating Grover
algorithm. It was concluded that the use of classical wave superposition comes
with the cost of exponential increase of the resources. Since then, it is
widely believed that the use of classical wave superposition for quantum
algorithms is inevitably leading to an exponential resources overhead (number
of devices, power consumption, precision requirements). In this work, we
describe a classical Oracle machine which utilizes classical wave superposition
for database search and data processing. We present experimental data on
magnetic database search using spin wave superposition. The data show a
fundamental speedup over the digital computers without any exponential resource
overhead. We argue that in some cases the classical wave-based approach may

classical statistical modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize
mathematical formulations that represent the underlying physics, prior
information and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical models are useful
but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real
systems display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely
data-driven approaches that are model-agnostic are becoming increasingly
popular as datasets become abundant and the power of modern deep learning
pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures
which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance,
especially for supervised problems. However, DNNs typically require massive
amounts of data and immense computational resources, limiting their
applicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid
techniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems
to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep
learning methods exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical
structures designed for specific problems, as well as learning from limited
data. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and
designing model-based deep learning systems. We divide hybrid
model-based/data-driven systems into categories based on their inference
mechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for
combining model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner,
along with concrete guidelines and detailed signal processing oriented examples
from recent literature. Our aim is to facilitate the design and study of future
systems on the intersection of signal processing and machine learning that

tightly-focussed circularly-polarized light and by monitoring the intensity and
circular polarization spectrum as a function of distance from the excitation
spot. The spin-polarized photoelectrons give rise to a well-defined feature in
the nearbandgap spectrum, distinct from the main line due to recombination of
the spin-unpolarized electrons of the Fermi sea with the same minority
photoholes. At a distance of 2 (micro)m, only the main line remains, implying
that photoelectrons have reached a charge thermodynamic equilibrium with the

materials is one of the main reasons for their large phonon anharmonicity and
intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa$. However, the $\kappa$
of GeTe increases at the ferroelectric phase transition near $700$ K. Using
first-principles calculations with the temperature dependent effective
potential method, we show that this rise in $\kappa$ is the consequence of
negative thermal expansion in the rhombohedral phase and increase in the phonon
lifetimes in the high-symmetry phase. Negative thermal expansion increases
phonon group velocities, which counteracts enhanced anharmonicity of phonon
modes and boosts $\kappa$ close to the phase transition in the rhombohedral
phase. A drastic decrease in the anharmonic force constants in the cubic phase
increases the phonon lifetimes and $\kappa$. Strong anharmonicity near the
phase transition induces non-Lorentzian shapes of the phonon power spectra. To
account for these effects, we implement a novel method of calculating $\kappa$
based on the Green-Kubo approach and find that the Boltzmann transport equation
underestimates $\kappa$ near the phase transition. Our findings elucidate the
influence of structural phase transitions on $\kappa$ and provide guidance for
design of better thermoelectric materials.

carries important information for understanding the wind mass transfer to their
white dwarf companions and its fuelling. Aims. In this paper, we indicate a
non-spherical distribution of the neutral wind zone around the red giant (RG)
in the symbiotic binary star, EG And. Methods. We achieved this aim by
analysing the periodic orbital variations of fluxes and radial velocities of
individual components of the H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines observed
on our high-cadence medium (R $\sim$ 11 000) and high-resolution (R $\sim$ 38
000) spectra. Results. The asymmetric shaping of the neutral wind zone at the
near-orbital-plane region is indicated by: (i) the asymmetric course of the
H$\alpha$ core emission fluxes along the orbit; (ii) the presence of their
secondary maximum around the orbital phase $\varphi = 0.1$, which is possibly
caused by the refraction effect; and (iii) the properties of the H$\alpha$
broad wing emission originating by Raman scattering on H$^0$ atoms. The wind is
substantially compressed from polar directions to the orbital plane as
constrained by the location of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line emission zones in
the vicinity of the RG at/around its poles. The corresponding mass-loss rate
from the polar regions of $\lesssim 10 ^{-8}$ Msun/yr is a factor of $\gtrsim
10$ lower than the average rate of $\approx 10^{-7}$Msun/yr derived from
nebular emission of the ionised wind from the RG. Furthermore, it is two orders
of magnitude lower than that measured in the near-orbital-plane region from
Rayleigh scattering. Conclusions. The startling properties of the nebular
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 line in EG And provides an independent indication of the
wind focusing towards the orbital plane.

Many offline tracking approaches reason about occluded objects post-hoc, by
linking together tracklets after the object re-appears, making use of
reidentification (ReID). However, online tracking in embodied robotic agents
(such as a self-driving vehicle) fundamentally requires object permanence,
which is the ability to reason about occluded objects before they re-appear. In
this work, we re-purpose tracking benchmarks and propose new metrics for the

dynamic sequence prediction. Second, we build dynamic models that explicitly

learning models and as such is an increasingly popular research topic. An
important practical aspect that is not addressed in the current literature is
how to analyze and fix fail cases where the use of quantization results in
excessive degradation. In this paper, we present a simple analytic framework
that breaks down overall degradation to its per layer contributions. We analyze
many common networks and observe that a layer's contribution is determined by
both intrinsic (local) factors - the distribution of the layer's weights and
activations - and extrinsic (global) factors having to do with the the
interaction with the rest of the layers. Layer-wise analysis of existing
quantization schemes reveals local fail-cases of existing techniques which are
not reflected when inspecting their overall performance. As an example, we
consider ResNext26 on which SoTA post-training quantization methods perform
poorly. We show that almost all of the degradation stems from a single layer.
The same analysis also allows for local fixes - applying a common weight
clipping heuristic only to this layer reduces degradation to a minimum while
applying the same heuristic globally results in high degradation. More
generally, layer-wise analysis allows for a more nuanced examination of how
quantization affects the network, enabling the design of better performing
schemes.

the spatial distribution of photoelectrons, minority photoholes and electrons

analysis shows that charge can be transported over record distances larger than
25 (micro)m at 6K, in spite of the expected localization of minority holes in
the potential fluctuations generated by statistical fluctuations of the donor
concentration. It is shown that transport is little affected by the
fluctuations because of the build up of large internal electric fields which
strongly increase the hole and electron mobilities and therefore enable
transport. Comparison of the spatial profiles of the emissions due to hot
electrons and to the Fermi sea gives evidence for at least three spatial zones,
including a zone of excess intrinsic electrons near the excitation spot and a
zone of depletion of these electrons at a distance larger than 2-10 (micro)m

the kinetic energy of photoholes in the fluctuations so that after a given

perpendicular modulation vectors in the $ab$ plane this anisotropy has mutually
perpendicular easy axes and collinear middle axes, what leads to double-Q
modulated spin structure stabilization. The latter turns out to be a square
skyrmion lattice in the large part of its stability region with the topological
charge $\pm 1$ per magnetic unit cell, which is determined by the frustrated
exchange coupling, and, thus, nanometer-sized. In the presence of additional
single-ion easy-axis anisotropy, easy and middle axes can be swapped, which
leads to different phase diagram. It is argued that the latter case is relevant
to GdRu$_2$Si$_2$.

contrast ratio between these planets and their host star at separations
narrower than 100 mas. Large segmented aperture space telescopes enable the
sensitivity needed to observe a large number of planets. Combined with
coronagraphs with wavefront control, they present a promising avenue to
generate a high-contrast region in the image of an observed star.
  Another key aspect is the required stability in telescope pointing, focusing,
and co-phasing of the segments of the telescope primary mirror for
long-exposure observations of rocky planets for several hours to a few days.
These wavefront errors should be stable down to a few tens of picometers RMS,
requiring a permanent active correction of these errors during the observing
sequence. To calibrate these pointing errors and other critical low-order
aberrations, we propose a wavefront sensing path based on Zernike
phase-contrast methods to analyze the starlight that is filtered out by the
coronagraph at the telescope focus. In this work we present the analytical
retrieval of the incoming low order aberrations in the starlight beam that is
filtered out by an Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph, one of the leading
coronagraph types for starlight suppression. We implement this approach
numerically for the active control of these aberrations and present an
application with our first experimental results on the High-contrast imager for
Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, the STScI testbed for Earth-twin
observations with future large space observatories, such as LUVOIR and HabEx,

absolute brightness of the asteroid in the V and R filters was 9.1 mag and 8.8
mag, respectively. The mean value of the asteroid diameter was 119 km. The mean
values of the color indices B-V=0.72 mag, V-R=0.29 mag, and R-I=0.31 mag agree
well with the values for asteroids of the P and D types and its averages. The

elements in the early universe. Even if the overall agreement with the
experimental data is good, still some discrepancies exist on the relic
abundances of ${}^7$Li and ${}^6$Li. In order to exclude or confirm these
scenarios, the BBN model needs precise input parameters, in particular the
cross-sections of the BBN nuclear reaction network. However, the suppression of
the cross-sections due to the Coulomb barrier makes the measurement very
difficult and so affected by large systematic errors. Therefore, reliable
theoretical calculations result fundamental in order to reduce the
uncertainties. In this work we present a theoretical study of two nuclear
reactions connected to ${}^6$Li abundance and recently the
$\alpha$+d$\rightarrow$ ${}^6$Li + $\gamma$ and the
p+${}^6$Li$\rightarrow$${}^7$Be+$\gamma$ radiative captures. For the first
reaction we use a so-called ab-initio approach in which we solve the full
six-body problem by using realistic nuclear potentials to describe the nucleon
interactions. In particular we concentrate on the calculation and
characterization of the final state of the reaction, the ${}^6$Li ground state,
focusing on the electromagnetic static structure and the quantities relevant
from the astrophysical point of view such as the asymptotic normalization
coefficient. For doing this we use the Hyperspherical Harmonic approach
developed by the Pisa group providing for the first time the possibility of
using this approach beyond A = 4 nuclear systems. The second reaction is
instead studied by using a two-body cluster approach where the proton and
${}^6$Li are considered as structureless particles. The angular distribution of
the emitted photon obtained in this work were used by the LUNA Collaboration to
determine the efficiency of the detector used in the measurement of the
reaction.

three-body systems are stabilized via the interaction of an unbound two-body
sub-systems. A hypothetical state in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at 7.458 MeV excitation
energy, comprising of a loose structure of three $\alpha$-particles in mutual
two-body resonance, has been suggested in the literature to correspond to an
Efimov state in nuclear physics. The existence of such a state has not been
demonstrated experimentally. Method: Using the combined data sets from two
recent experiments, one with the TexAT TPC to measure $\alpha$-decay and the
other with Gammasphere to measure $\gamma$-decay of states in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$
populated by $^{12}\mathrm{N}$ and $^{12}\mathrm{B}$ $\beta$-decay
respectively, we achieve high sensitivity to states in close-proximity to the
$\alpha$-threshold in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Results: No evidence of a state at
7.458 MeV is seen in either data set. Using a likelihood method, the 95\% C.L.
$\gamma$-decay branching ratio is determined as a function of the $\beta$-decay
feeding strength relative to the Hoyle state. In parallel, calculations of the
triple-alpha reaction rate show the inclusion of the Efimov corresponds to a
large increase in the reaction rate around $5 \times 10^{7}$ K. Conclusion:
From decay spectroscopy - at the 95\% C.L., the Efimov state cannot exist at
7.458 MeV with any $\gamma$-decay branching ratio unless the $\beta$-strength
is less than 0.7\% of the Hoyle state. This limit is evaluated for a range of
different excitation energies and the results are not favorable for existence
of the hypothetical Efimov state in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, the
triple-alpha reaction rate with the inclusion of a state between 7.43 and 7.53
MeV exceeds the rate required for stars to undergo the red giant phase.

$V\varGamma$ of the Hamming graph $\varGamma=H(m,q)$, gives rise to a natural
distance partition $\{C,C_1,\ldots,C_\rho\}$, where $\rho$ is the covering
radius of $C$. Such a code $C$ is called completely transitive if the
automorphism group $\rm{Aut}(C)$ acts transitively on each of the sets $C$,
$C_1$, \ldots, $C_\rho$. A code $C$ is called $2$-neighbour-transitive if
$\rho\geq 2$ and $\rm{Aut}(C)$ acts transitively on each of $C$, $C_1$ and

  Let $C$ be a completely transitive code in a binary ($q=2$) Hamming graph

$2$-neighbour-transitive but not completely transitive. Moreover, new proofs of
the complete transitivity of several codes are given. Additionally, we answer
the question of the existence of distance-regular graphs related to the
completely transitive codes appearing in our main result.

state at 7.65 MeV in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$, has long been the subject of debate.
Understanding if the system comprises of three weakly-interacting
$\alpha$-particles in the 0s orbital, known as an $\alpha$-condensate state, is
possible by studying the decay branches of the Hoyle state. Purpose: The direct
decay of the Hoyle state into three $\alpha$-particles, rather than through the
$^{8}\mathrm{Be}$ ground state, can be identified by studying the energy
partition of the 3 $\alpha$-particles arising from the decay. This paper
provides details on the break-up mechanism of the Hoyle stating using a new
experimental technique. Method: By using beta-delayed charged-particle
spectroscopy of $^{12}\mathrm{N}$ using the TexAT (Texas Active Target) TPC, a
high-sensitivity measurement of the direct 3 $\alpha$ decay ratio can be
performed without contributions from pile-up events. Results: A Bayesian
approach to understanding the contribution of the direct components via a
likelihood function shows that the direct component is $<0.043\%$ at the 95\%
confidence level (C.L.). This value is in agreement with several other studies
and here we can demonstrate that a small non-sequential component with a decay
fraction of about $10^{-4}$ is most likely. Conclusion: The measurement of the
non-sequential component of the Hoyle state decay is performed in an almost
medium-free reaction for the first time. The derived upper-limit is in
agreement with previous studies and demonstrates sensitivity to the absolute
branching ratio. Further experimental studies would need to be combined with
robust microscopic theoretical understanding of the decay dynamics to provide
additional insight into the idea of the Hoyle state as an $\alpha$-condensate.

data that are collected through sensible sensors can be anomalous due to
different reasons such as systems breakdown, malfunctioning of sensor
detectors, and more. Regardless of their root causes, such data severely affect
the results of the subsequent analysis. This paper demonstrates data cleaning
and preparation for time-series data and further proposes cost-sensitive
machine learning algorithms as a solution to detect anomalous data points in
time-series data. The following models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
Support Vector Machines have been modified to support the cost-sensitive
learning which penalizes misclassified samples thereby minimizing the total
misclassification cost. Our results showed that Random Forest outperformed the
rest of the models at predicting the positive class (i.e anomalies). Applying
predictive model improvement techniques like data oversampling seems to provide
little or no improvement to the Random Forest model. Interestingly, with
recursive feature elimination, we achieved a better model performance thereby
reducing the dimensions in the data. Finally, with Influxdb and Kapacitor the
data was ingested and streamed to generate new data points to further evaluate
the model performance on unseen data, this will allow for early recognition of
undesirable changes in the drinking water quality and will enable the water
supply companies to rectify on a timely basis whatever undesirable changes
abound.

particles are introduced, leading to a multi-scale system with widely separated
energy scales. In this setting the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential, which
describes the vacuum of the theory at the quantum level, has to be supplemented
with a prescription to handle the hierarchy in mass scales. In any quantum
field theory involving scalar fields and multiple, highly differing mass
scales, it is in general not possible to choose a single renormalization scale
that will remove all the large logarithms in the effective potential. In this
paper, we focus on the so-called decoupling method, which freezes the effects
of heavy particles on the renormalization group running of the light degrees of
freedom at low energies. We study this for a simple two-scalar theory and find
that, while the decoupling method leads to an acceptable and convergent
effective potential, the method does not solve the fine-tuning problem that is
inherent to the hierarchy problem of multi-scale theories. We also consider an
alternative implementation of the decoupling approach, which gives different
results for the shape of the potential, but still leads to similar conclusions
on the amount of fine-tuning in the model. We suggest a way to avoid running
into this fine-tuning problem by adopting a prescription on how to fix
parameters in such decoupling approaches.

learning models that expand upon key architectures such as ChemProp and Schnet,
adding elements such as multiple-conformer inputs and conformer attention. We
then benchmark the performance trade-offs of these models on 2D, 3D and 4D
representations in the prediction of drug activity using a large training set

significantly better than 2D models, but their performance is often just as
strong with a single conformer as with many. We also find that 4D deep learning

complex domains, such as correlated electron wavefunctions or the underlying
distribution of a complex dataset. Such states need to be verified in view of
algorithmic approximations and device imperfections. As quantum computers grow
in size, however, verifying the states they produce becomes increasingly
problematic. Relatively efficient methods have been devised for verifying
sparse quantum states, but dense quantum states have remained costly to verify.
Here I present a novel method for estimating the fidelity $F(\mu,\tau)$ between
a preparable quantum state $\mu$ and a classically specified target state
$\tau$, using simple quantum circuits and on-the-fly classical calculation (or
lookup) of selected amplitudes of $\tau$. Notably, in the targeted regime the
method demonstrates an exponential quantum advantage in sample efficiency over
any classical method. The simplest version of the method is efficient for
anticoncentrated quantum states (including many states that are hard to
simulate classically), with a sample cost of approximately
$4\epsilon^{-2}(1-F)dp_{\text{coll}}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired precision
of the estimate, $d$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space in which $\mu$ and
$\tau$ reside, and $p_{\text{coll}}$ is the collision probability of the target
distribution. I also present a more sophisticated version of the method, which
uses any efficiently preparable and well-characterized quantum state as an
importance sampler to further reduce the number of copies of $\mu$ needed.
Though some challenges remain, this work takes a significant step toward
scalable verification of complex states produced by quantum processors.

Real and synthetic galaxy data, from the Kilo Degree Survey's (KiDS)
4$^{\rm{th}}$ Data Release (KiDS-$1000$) and the Full-sky Lognormal
Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK) package respectively, are used to train
self-organising maps (SOMs) to learn the multivariate relationships between
observed galaxy number density and up to six systematic-tracer variables,
including seeing, Galactic dust extinction, and Galactic stellar density. We
then create `organised' randoms, i.e. random galaxy catalogues with spatially
variable number densities, mimicking the learnt systematic density modes in the
data. Using realistically biased mock data, we show that these organised
randoms consistently subtract spurious density modes from the two-point angular
correlation function $w(\vartheta)$, correcting biases of up to $12\sigma$ in
the mean clustering amplitude to as low as $0.1\sigma$, over a high
signal-to-noise angular range of 7-100 arcmin. Their performance is also
validated for angular clustering cross-correlations in a bright, flux-limited
subset of KiDS-$1000$, comparing against an analogous sample constructed from
highly-complete spectroscopic redshift data. Each organised random catalogue
object is a `clone' carrying the properties of a real galaxy, and is
distributed throughout the survey footprint according to the parent galaxy's
position in systematics-space. Thus, sub-sample randoms are readily derived
from a single master random catalogue via the same selection as applied to the
real galaxies. Our method is expected to improve in performance with increased
survey area, galaxy number density, and systematic contamination, making
organised randoms extremely promising for current and future clustering
analyses of faint samples.

the fact that usual star-formation rate (SFR) indicators -- emission-line
luminosities based on the assumption of photoionisation by young stars --
cannot be used for active galaxies as the ionising source is the AGN. We thus
investigate the use of SFR derived from the stellar population and its relation
with that derived from the gas for a sample of 170 AGN hosts and a matched
control sample of 291 galaxies. We compare the values of SFR densities obtained
via the Ha emission line (SFRg) for regions ionised by hot stars according to
diagnostic diagrams with those obtained from stellar population synthesis
(SFRstars) over the last 1 to 100~Myr. We find that the SFRstars over the last
20~Myrs closely reproduces the SFRg, although a better match is obtained via
the transformation: log(SFRstars) = (0.872+/-0.004) log(SFRg) -(0.075+/-0.006),
which is valid for both AGN hosts and non-active galaxies. We also compare the
reddening obtained via the gas Ha/Hb ratio with that derived via the full
spectral fitting in the stellar population synthesis. We find that the ratio
between the gas and stellar extinction is in the range 2.64 < A_Vgas/A_Vstar} <
2.85, in approximate agreement with previous results from the literature,
obtained for smaller samples. We interpret the difference as being due to the
fact that the reddening of the stars is dominated by that affecting the less
obscured underlying older population, while the reddening of the gas is larger
as it is associated to a younger stellar population buried deeper in the dust.

entangled states from minimal assumptions -- in a device-independent manner.
Finding BIs tailored to many-body correlations as prepared in present-day
quantum computers and simulators is however a highly challenging endeavour. In
this work, we focus on BIs violated by very coarse-grain features of the
system: two-body correlations averaged over all permutations of the parties.
For two-outcomes measurements, specific BIs of this form have been
theoretically and experimentally studied in the past, but it is practically
impossible to explicitly test all such BIs. Data-driven methods --
reconstructing a violated BI from the data themselves -- have therefore been
considered. Here, inspired by statistical physics, we develop a novel
data-driven approach specifically tailored to such coarse-grain data. Our
approach offers two main improvements over the existing literature: 1) it is
directly designed for any number of outcomes and settings; 2) the obtained BIs
are quadratic in the data, offering a fundamental scaling advantage for the
precision required in experiments. This very flexible method, whose complexity
does not scale with the system size, allows us to systematically improve over
all previously-known Bell's inequalities robustly violated by ensembles of
quantum spin-$1/2$; and to discover novel families of Bell's inequalities,
tailored to spin-squeezed states and many-body spin singlets of arbitrary
spin-$j$ ensembles.

18.5 MHz, with no measurable impact on qubit coherence. We quantify gate error
statistics on a tuned 65-qubit processor, with median two-qubit gate fidelity
of 98.7%. Baseline tuning statistics yield a frequency-equivalent resistance

$\sum a_n n^{-s}$ due to J.~Bonet, we study topological and geometrical
properties of certain scales of Fr\'echet spaces of general Dirichlet spaces
$\sum a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}$. More precisely, fixing a frequency $\lambda =
(\lambda_n)$, we focus on the Fr\'echet space of $\lambda$-Dirichlet series
which have limit functions bounded on all half planes strictly smaller than the
right half plane $[\mathrm{Re} >0]$. We develop an abstract setting of
pre-Fr\'echet spaces of $\lambda$-Dirichlet series generated by certain
admissible normed spaces of $\lambda$-Dirichlet series and the abscissas of
convergence they generate, which allows also to define Fr\'echet spaces of
$\lambda$-Dirichlet series for which $a_n e^{-\lambda_n/k}$ for each $k$ equals
the Fourier coefficients of a function on an appropriate $\lambda$-Dirichlet
group.

processing. However, the widely-used sequence labeling framework is difficult
to detect entities with nested structures. In this work, we view nested NER as
constituency parsing with partially-observed trees and model it with
partially-observed TreeCRFs. Specifically, we view all labeled entity spans as
observed nodes in a constituency tree, and other spans as latent nodes. With
the TreeCRF we achieve a uniform way to jointly model the observed and the
latent nodes. To compute the probability of partial trees with partial
marginalization, we propose a variant of the Inside algorithm, the
\textsc{Masked Inside} algorithm, that supports different inference operations
for different nodes (evaluation for the observed, marginalization for the
latent, and rejection for nodes incompatible with the observed) with efficient
parallelized implementation, thus significantly speeding up training and
inference. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) F1 scores on the ACE2004, ACE2005 dataset, and shows comparable
performance to SOTA models on the GENIA dataset. Our approach is implemented

aggregation function (LAF) for sets of arbitrary cardinality. LAF can
approximate several extensively used aggregators (such as average, sum,
maximum) as well as more complex functions (e.g., variance and skewness). We
report experiments on semi-synthetic and real data showing that LAF outperforms

growing range of applications, including criminal justice, hiring, and
medicine. Since these decisions impact human lives, it is important that the AI
systems act in ways which align with human values. Techniques for preference
modeling and social choice help researchers learn and aggregate peoples'
preferences, which are used to guide AI behavior; thus, it is imperative that
these learned preferences are accurate. These techniques often assume that
people are willing to express strict preferences over alternatives; which is
not true in practice. People are often indecisive, and especially so when their
decision has moral implications. The philosophy and psychology literature shows
that indecision is a measurable and nuanced behavior -- and that there are
several different reasons people are indecisive. This complicates the task of
both learning and aggregating preferences, since most of the relevant
literature makes restrictive assumptions on the meaning of indecision. We begin
to close this gap by formalizing several mathematical \emph{indecision} models
based on theories from philosophy, psychology, and economics; these models can
be used to describe (indecisive) agent decisions, both when they are allowed to
express indecision and when they are not. We test these models using data
collected from an online survey where participants choose how to
(hypothetically) allocate organs to patients waiting for a transplant.

detected. For the ""Northern Clump,"" we provide evidence that it is falling
towards A3391 from the hot gas morphology and radio lobe structure of its
central AGN. Many of the extended sources in the field detected by eROSITA are
known clusters or new clusters in the background, including a known SZ cluster
at redshift z=1. We discover an emission filament north of the virial radius,
$r_{100}$, of A3391 connecting to the Northern Clump and extending south of
A3395 towards another galaxy cluster. The total projected length of this
continuous warm-hot emission filament is 15 Mpc, running almost 4 degrees

galaxy overdensities in the same regions. The new datasets provide impressive
confirmation of the theoretically expected structure formation processes on the

for extracting information from massive, noisy and incomplete data. In a
nutshell, spectral methods refer to a collection of algorithms built upon the
eigenvalues (resp. singular values) and eigenvectors (resp. singular vectors)
of some properly designed matrices constructed from data. A diverse array of
applications have been found in machine learning, data science, and signal
processing. Due to their simplicity and effectiveness, spectral methods are not
only used as a stand-alone estimator, but also frequently employed to
initialize other more sophisticated algorithms to improve performance.
  While the studies of spectral methods can be traced back to classical matrix
perturbation theory and methods of moments, the past decade has witnessed
tremendous theoretical advances in demystifying their efficacy through the lens
of statistical modeling, with the aid of non-asymptotic random matrix theory.
This monograph aims to present a systematic, comprehensive, yet accessible
introduction to spectral methods from a modern statistical perspective,
highlighting their algorithmic implications in diverse large-scale
applications. In particular, our exposition gravitates around several central
questions that span various applications: how to characterize the sample
efficiency of spectral methods in reaching a target level of statistical
accuracy, and how to assess their stability in the face of random noise,
missing data, and adversarial corruptions? In addition to conventional $\ell_2$
perturbation analysis, we present a systematic $\ell_{\infty}$ and
$\ell_{2,\infty}$ perturbation theory for eigenspace and singular subspaces,
which has only recently become available owing to a powerful ""leave-one-out""
analysis framework.

helium white dwarf is evidence of previous mass transfer by a red giant.
Detailed models of the system evolution from a progenitor main-sequence binary,
including mass transfer, are made using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA). Both of the progenitor stars are evolved in the
simulation. WOCS 5379 is well reproduced with a primary star of initial mass
1.19 $M_{\odot}$, whose core becomes the white dwarf. The secondary star
initially is 1.01 $M_{\odot}$. 300 Myr ago, the secondary finished receiving
mass from the donor, having moved beyond the NGC 188 turnoff as a 1.20
$M_{\odot}$ blue straggler. The successful model has a mass transfer efficiency
of 22\%. This non-conservative mass transfer is key to expanding the orbit fast
enough to permit stable mass transfer. Even so, the mass transfer begins with a
short unstable phase, during which half of the accreted mass is transferred.
With increasing mass, the secondary evolves from a radiative core to a
convective core. The final blue straggler interior is remarkably similar to a
2.1 Gyr-old 1.21 $M_{\odot}$ main-sequence star at the same location in the HR
diagram. The white dwarf effective temperature is also reproduced, but the

hard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangements
of objects. Instead of learning a scene radiance field as a NeRF does, we
propose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), a
representation that models per-object light transport implicitly using a
lighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes even
when objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetric
path tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- and

components, both of which are expected to follow Random Matrix Theory
predictions. While level spacing statistics are close to the Gaussian
Orthogonal Ensemble as expected, on the contrary, the eigenvector components
follow a distribution markedly different from the expected Gaussian. Unlike in
the typical quantum chaos scenario, the transition of level spacing statistics

We first demonstrate that the entangled modeling of spatio-temporal information
by flattening all pixels is sub-optimal, failing to capture temporal
relationships among frames explicitly. To this end, we introduce Global
Temporal Attention (GTA), which performs global temporal attention on top of
spatial attention in a decoupled manner. We apply GTA on both pixels and
semantically similar regions to capture temporal relationships at different
levels of spatial granularity. Unlike conventional self-attention that computes
an instance-specific attention matrix, GTA directly learns a global attention
matrix that is intended to encode temporal structures that generalize across
different samples. We further augment GTA with a cross-channel multi-head
fashion to exploit channel interactions for better temporal modeling. Extensive
experiments on 2D and 3D networks demonstrate that our approach consistently
enhances temporal modeling and provides state-of-the-art performance on three

liquid with a spinorial hybridization that breaks both single and double
time-reversal symmetry. Hastatic order is the first spinorial, rather than
vectorial order in materials, but previous work has not yet found direct
consequences of the spinorial nature. In this paper, we revisit the hastatic
proposal within Landau-Ginzburg theory. Rather than a single spinorial order
parameter breaking double-time-reversal symmetry, we find two gauge invariant
vectorial orders: the expected composite order with on-site moments, and a new
quantity capturing symmetries broken solely by the spinorial nature. We address
the effect of fluctuations and disorder on the tetragonal symmetry breaking,
explaining the absence of in-plane moments in URu$_2$Si$_2$ and predicting a

reason about non-linear motions, complex occlusions and temporal abstractions,
resulting in improved performance on video interpolation, while requiring no
additional inputs in the form of optical flow or depth maps. Due to its
simplicity, FLAVR can deliver 3x faster inference speed compared to the current

processes lead to strong deviations from Ohm's law. Depending on the length
scales of momentum conserving ($l_{MC}$) and relaxing ($l_{MR}$) electron
scattering, and the device size ($d$), current flows may shift from ohmic to
ballistic to hydrodynamic regimes and more exotic mixtures thereof. So far, an
in situ, in-operando methodology to obtain these parameters self-consistently
within a micro/nanodevice, and thereby identify its conduction regime, is
critically lacking. In this context, we exploit Sondheimer oscillations,
semi-classical magnetoresistance oscillations due to helical electronic motion,
as a method to obtain $l_{MR}$ in micro-devices even when $l_{MR}\gg d$. This
gives information on the bulk $l_{MR}$ complementary to quantum oscillations,
which are sensitive to all scattering processes. We extract $l_{MR}$ from the
Sondheimer amplitude in the topological semi-metal WP$_2$, at elevated
temperatures up to $T\sim 50$~K, in a range most relevant for hydrodynamic
transport phenomena. Our data on micrometer-sized devices are in excellent
agreement with experimental reports of the large bulk $l_{MR}$ and thus confirm
that WP$_2$ can be microfabricated without degradation. Indeed, the measured
scattering rates match well with those of theoretically predicted
electron-phonon scattering, thus supporting the notion of strong momentum
exchange between electrons and phonons in WP$_2$ at these temperatures. These
results conclusively establish Sondheimer oscillations as a quantitative probe
of $l_{MR}$ in micro-devices in studying non-ohmic electron flow.

implementation of an accurate method for estimating the MFs of

triangulated isodensity surfaces that are constructed from the Delaunay
tessellation of the input point sample. Contrary to previous methods, MEDUSA
can account for periodic boundary conditions, which is crucial for the analysis
of N-body simulations. We validate our code against several test samples with
known MFs, including Gaussian random fields with a ${\Lambda}$CDM power
spectrum, and find excellent agreement with the theory predictions. We use
MEDUSA to measure the MFs of synthetic galaxy catalogues constructed from
N-body simulations. Our results show clearly non-Gaussian signatures that arise
from the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field. We find that,
although redshift-space distortions significantly change our MFs estimates,
their impact is considerably reduced if these measurements are expressed as a
function of the volume-filling fraction. We also show that the effect of
Alcock-Paczynski (AP) distortions on the MFs can be described by scaling them
with different powers of the isotropic AP parameter $q$ defined in terms of the
volume-averaged distance $D_{\rm V}(z)$. Thus the MFs estimates by MEDUSA are
useful probes of non-linearities in the density field, and the expansion and
growth of structure histories of the Universe.

in the Magellanic Clouds points to a value between 15-30%, with the majority of
the companions being un-evolved B-type stars as dictated by stellar evolution.
Here I extend this research to the Local Group galaxies M31 and M33, and
investigate the RSG binary fraction as a function of metallicity. Recent
near-IR photometric surveys of M31 and M33 have lead to the identification of a
complete sample of RSGs down to a limiting $\log L/L_{\odot} \geq 4.2$. To
determine the binary fraction of these M31 and M33 RSGs, I used a combination
of newly obtained spectroscopy to identify single RSGs and RSG+OB binaries as
well as archival UV, visible and near-IR photometry to probabilistically
classify RSGs as either single or binary based on their colors. I then adjusted
the observed RSG+OB binary fraction to account for observational biases. The
resulting RSG binary fraction in M33 shows a strong dependence on
galactocentric distance with the inner regions having a much higher binary
fraction ($41.2^{+12.0}_{-7.3}$%) than the outer regions
($15.9^{+12.4}_{-1.9}$%). Such a trend is not seen in M31; instead, the binary
fraction in lightly reddened regions remains constant at $33.5^{+8.6}_{-5.0}$%.
I conclude the changing RSG binary fraction in M33 is due to a metallicity
dependence with higher metallicity environments having higher RSG binary
fractions. This dependence most likely stems not from changes in the physical
properties of RSGs due to metallicity, but changes in the parent distribution
of OB binaries.

approach BPS bounds. These limits result in non-relativistic near-BPS theories
that describe the effective dynamics near the BPS bounds and upon quantization
are known as Spin Matrix theories. The near-BPS theories can be obtained by
reducing $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on a three-sphere and integrating out the fields
that become non-dynamical in the limits. We perform the sphere reduction for
the near-BPS limit with $\mathrm{SU}(1,2|2)$ symmetry, which has several new
features compared to the previously considered cases with $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$
symmetry, including a dynamical gauge field. We discover a new structure in the
classical limit of the interaction term. We show that the interaction term is
built from certain blocks that comprise an irreducible representation of the
$\mathrm{SU}(1,2|2)$ algebra. Moreover, the full interaction term can be
interpreted as a norm in the linear space of this representation, explaining
its features including the positive definiteness. This means one can think of
the interaction term as a distance squared from saturating the BPS bound. The
$\mathrm{SU}(1,1|1)$ near-BPS theory, and its subcases, is seen to inherit
these features. These observations point to a way to solve the strong coupling
dynamics of these near-BPS theories.

and filters (F555W, F814W, F160W) used for imaging of extragalactic Cepheids in
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) hosts. The HST observations used the WFC3 spatial
scanning mode to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration
errors, reaching a mean photometric error of 5 millimags per observation. We
use new Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, vastly improved since DR2, and the
Period-Luminosity (PL) relation of these Cepheids to simultaneously calibrate
the extragalactic distance ladder and to refine the determination of the Gaia
EDR3 parallax offset. The resulting geometric calibration of Cepheid
luminosities has 1.0% precision, better than any alternative geometric anchor.
Applied to the calibration of SNe~Ia, it results in a measurement of the Hubble
constant of 73.0 +/- 1.4 km/sec/Mpc, in good agreement with conclusions based
on earlier Gaia data releases. We also find the slope of the Cepheid PL

be in good agreement with the mean values derived from other galaxies. In
combination with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, we
reach 1.8% precision and find H_0=73.2 +/- 1.3 km/sec/Mpc, a 4.2 sigma
difference with the prediction from Planck CMB observations under LambdaCDM. We

finds that this configuration occurs by chance about $6\%$ of the time,
suggesting that several globular clusters with positive radial velocities
remain undiscovered. We evaluate the expected number of undiscovered clusters
at large distances under the assumption that the cluster population has a
smooth radial distribution and is in equilibrium within the Milky Way's virial
radius. By comparing the present day kinematic properties of outer clusters to
random orbital configurations of the Galactic globular cluster system through
orbit averaging, we estimate a likelihood of $73\%$ of there being at least one
undiscovered globular cluster within the Milky Way. This estimate assumes the
current population is complete out to 50 kpc, and increases to $91\%$ if the
population is complete out to 150 kpc. The likelihood of there being two
undiscovered clusters is between $60\%$ and $70\%$, with the likelihood of
there being three undiscovered clusters being on the order of $50\%$. The most
likely scenario is that the undiscovered clusters are moving outwards, which

quantum many-body scars (high-energy eigenstates that violate the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis) in a constrained Hilbert space. Many-body dynamics
with local constraints has attracted much attention due to the recent discovery
of non-ergodic behavior in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms. Lattice
gauge theories provide natural examples of constrained systems since physical
states must be gauge-invariant. In our case, the Hamiltonian $H={\cal O}_{\rm

mid-spectrum zero modes at $\lambda=0$ whose number grows exponentially with
system size. This massive degeneracy is lifted at any non-zero $\lambda$ but
some special linear combinations that simultaneously diagonalize ${\cal O}_{\rm

an ``order-by-disorder'' mechanism in the Hilbert space. We give evidence for
such scars and show their dynamical consequences on two-leg ladders with up to

Interestingly, the gravitational field equations derived from this action is

this approach. In fact, the derivation of the field equations demands the
existence of a non-zero cosmological constant, thereby providing the raison

that gravity is an emergent phenomenon and, in this perspective, our action
principle could have a possible origin in the microstructure of the spacetime.

and the disjointed optimization of representation and classifier might lead to
suboptimal results. However, end-to-end training methods, like equalization
loss (EQL), still perform worse than decoupled training methods. In this paper,
we reveal the main issue in long-tailed object detection is the imbalanced
gradients between positives and negatives, and find that EQL does not solve it
well. To address the problem of imbalanced gradients, we introduce a new
version of equalization loss, called equalization loss v2 (EQL v2), a novel

each category independently and equally. Extensive experiments are performed on
the challenging LVIS benchmark. EQL v2 outperforms origin EQL by about 4 points
overall AP with 14-18 points improvements on the rare categories. More
importantly, it also surpasses decoupled training methods. Without further

goes directly from speech to a hypothesis is a more attractive option. These
systems were shown to be smaller, faster, and better optimized. However, they
require massive amounts of end-to-end training data and in addition, don't take
advantage of the already available ASR and NLU training data.
  In this work, we propose an E2E system that is designed to jointly train on
multiple speech-to-text tasks, such as ASR (speech-transcription) and SLU
(speech-hypothesis), and text-to-text tasks, such as NLU (text-hypothesis). We
call this the Audio-Text All-Task (AT-AT) Model and we show that it beats the
performance of E2E models trained on individual tasks, especially ones trained
on limited data. We show this result on an internal music dataset and two
public datasets, FluentSpeech and SNIPS Audio, where we achieve
state-of-the-art results. Since our model can process both speech and text
input sequences and learn to predict a target sequence, it also allows us to do
zero-shot E2E SLU by training on only text-hypothesis data (without any speech)
from a new domain. We evaluate this ability of our model on the Facebook TOP
dataset and set a new benchmark for zeroshot E2E performance. We will soon
release the audio data collected for the TOP dataset for future research.

Motivated by the trace no-hair theorem, we assume the Ricci scalar to be
constant throughout a spacetime. Furthermore, we employ the conformal-to-Kundt
metric ansatz that is valid for all static spherically symmetric spacetimes and
leads to a considerable simplification of the field equations. We arrive at a
set of two ordinary differential equations and study its solutions using the
Frobenius-like approach of (infinite) power series expansions. While the
indicial equations considerably restrict the set of possible leading powers,
careful analysis of higher-order terms is necessary to establish the existence
of the corresponding classes of solutions. We thus obtain various non-Einstein
generalizations of the Schwarzschild, (anti-)de Sitter [or (A)dS for short],
Nariai, and Pleba\'{n}ski-Hacyan spacetimes. Interestingly, some classes of
solutions allow for an arbitrary value of $\Lambda$, while other classes admit
only discrete values of $\Lambda$. For most of these classes, we give recurrent
formulas for all series coefficients. We determine which classes contain the
Schwarzschild-(A)dS black hole as a special case and briefly discuss the
physical interpretation of the spacetimes. In the discussion of physical
properties, we naturally focus on the generalization of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS
black hole, namely the Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS black hole, which possesses one
additional Bach parameter. We also study its basic thermodynamical properties
and observable effects on test particles caused by the presence of the Bach

  Published in JHEP",,"10.1007/JHEP07(2021)196",,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using the dipole picture for electron-nucleus deep inelastic scattering at
small Bjorken $x$, we study the effects of gluon saturation in the nuclear
target on the cross-section for SIDIS (single inclusive hadron, or jet,
production). We argue that the sensitivity of this process to gluon saturation
can be enhanced by tagging on a hadron (or jet) which carries a large fraction
$z \simeq 1$ of the longitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. This opens the
possibility to study gluon saturation in relatively hard processes, where the
virtuality $Q^2$ is (much) larger than the target saturation momentum $Q_s^2$,
but such that $z(1-z)Q^2\lesssim Q_s^2$. Working in the limit $z(1-z)Q^2\ll
Q_s^2$, we predict new phenomena which would signal saturation in the SIDIS
cross-section. For sufficiently low transverse momenta $k_\perp\ll Q_s$ of the
produced particle, the dominant contribution comes from elastic scattering in
the black disk limit, which exposes the unintegrated quark distribution in the
virtual photon. For larger momenta $k_\perp\gtrsim Q_s$, inelastic collisions
take the leading role. They explore gluon saturation via multiple scattering,
leading to a Gaussian distribution in $k_\perp$ centred around $Q_s$. When
$z(1-z)Q^2\ll Q^2$, this results in a Cronin peak in the nuclear modification
factor (the $R_{pA}$ ratio) at moderate values of $x$. With decreasing $x$,
this peak is washed out by the high-energy evolution and replaced by nuclear
suppression ($R_{pA}<1$) up to large momenta $k_\perp\gg Q_s$. Still for
$z(1-z)Q^2\ll Q_s^2$, we also compute SIDIS cross-sections integrated over
$k_\perp$. We find that both elastic and inelastic scattering are controlled by
the black disk limit, so they yield similar contributions, of zeroth order in
the QCD coupling.

assumptions made apply to the DES Y3 weak lensing source galaxies and develop a
full treatment of systematic uncertainties. Our method consists of combining
information from three independent likelihood functions: Self-Organizing Map
$p(z)$ (SOMPZ), a method for constraining redshifts from galaxy photometry;
clustering redshifts (WZ), constraints on redshifts from cross-correlations of
galaxy density functions; and shear ratios (SR), which provide constraints on
redshifts from the ratios of the galaxy-shear correlation functions at small
scales. Finally, we describe how these independent probes are combined to yield
an ensemble of redshift distributions encapsulating our full uncertainty. We
calibrate redshifts with combined effective uncertainties of $\sigma_{\langle z
\rangle}\sim 0.01$ on the mean redshift in each tomographic bin.

precision, large, realistic and robust simulations are required to calibrate
observational systematics, especially given the increased importance of object
blending as survey depths increase. To capture the coupled effects of blending
in both shear and photometric redshift calibration, we define the effective
redshift distribution for lensing, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, and describe how to
estimate it using image simulations. We use an extensive suite of tailored
image simulations to characterize the performance of the shear estimation
pipeline applied to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 dataset. We describe
the multi-band, multi-epoch simulations, and demonstrate their high level of
realism through comparisons to the real DES data. We isolate the effects that
generate shear calibration biases by running variations on our fiducial
simulation, and find that blending-related effects are the dominant
contribution to the mean multiplicative bias of approximately $-2\%$. By
generating simulations with input shear signals that vary with redshift, we
calibrate biases in our estimation of the effective redshfit distribution, and
demonstrate the importance of this approach when blending is present. We
provide corrected effective redshift distributions that incorporate statistical
and systematic uncertainties, ready for use in DES Year 3 weak lensing
analyses.

2-point function analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) dataset.
Using a variety of new ansatzes for covariance modelling and testing we
validate the assumptions and approximations of this model. These include the
assumption of a Gaussian likelihood, the trispectrum contribution to the
covariance, the impact of evaluating the model at a wrong set of parameters,
the impact of masking and survey geometry, deviations from Poissonian
shot-noise, galaxy weighting schemes and other, sub-dominant effects. We find
that our covariance model is robust and that its approximations have little
impact on goodness-of-fit and parameter estimation. The largest impact on
best-fit figure-of-merit arises from the so-called $f_{\mathrm{sky}}$
approximation for dealing with finite survey area, which on average increases
the $\chi^2$ between maximum posterior model and measurement by $3.7\%$
($\Delta \chi^2 \approx 18.9$). Standard methods to go beyond this
approximation fail for DES-Y3, but we derive an approximate scheme to deal with
these features. For parameter estimation, our ignorance of the exact parameters
at which to evaluate our covariance model causes the dominant effect. We find
that it increases the scatter of maximum posterior values for $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$ by about $3\%$ and for the dark energy equation of state parameter
by about $5\%$.

galaxies sample with redMaGiC galaxies (luminous red galaxies with secure
photometric redshifts) and a spectroscopic sample from BOSS/eBOSS to estimate
the redshift distribution of the DES sources sample. Two distinct methods for
using the clustering statistics are described. The first uses the clustering
information independently to estimate the mean redshift of the source galaxies
within a redshift window, as done in the DES Y1 analysis. The second method
establishes a likelihood of the clustering data as a function of $n(z)$, which
can be incorporated into schemes for generating samples of $n(z)$ subject to
combined clustering and photometric constraints. Both methods incorporate
marginalisation over various astrophysical systematics, including magnification
and redshift-dependent galaxy-matter bias. We characterise the uncertainties of
the methods in simulations; the first method recovers the mean $z$ of
tomographic bins to RMS (precision) of $\sim 0.014$. Use of the second method
is shown to vastly improve the accuracy of the shape of $n(z)$ derived from
photometric data. The two methods are then applied to the DES Y3 data.

gives rise to an ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transient (a kilonova). We

the jet disruption to the density structure of the ejecta does change the light
curves. The jet carves a channel into the otherwise spheroidal ejecta,
revealing the hot, inner regions. As seen from near ($\lesssim 30 \deg$) the
jet axis, the kilonova is brighter by a factor of a few and bluer. The strength
of this effect depends on the jet parameters, since the light curves of more

water vapor erupting from cracks on the icy surface of the satellite Enceladus.
This moon has a global ocean in contact with a rocky core beneath its icy
exterior, making it a promising location to search for evidence of
extraterrestrial life in the solar system. The previous detection of H$_2$ in
the plume indicates that there is free energy available for methanogenesis, the
metabolic reaction of H$_2$ with CO$_2$ to form methane and water. Additional
metabolic pathways could provide sources of energy in Enceladus' ocean, but
require the use of other oxidants that have not been detected in the plume.
Here, we perform chemical modeling to determine how the production of
radiolytic O$_2$ and H$_2$O$_2$, and abiotic redox chemistry in the ocean and
rocky core, contribute to chemical disequilibria that could support metabolic
processes in Enceladus' ocean. We consider three possible cases for ocean redox
chemistry: Case I in which reductants are not present in appreciable amounts
and oxidants accumulate over time, and Cases II and III in which aqueous
reductants or seafloor minerals, respectively, convert O$_2$ and H$_2$O$_2$ to
SO$_4^{2-}$ and ferric oxyhydroxides. We calculate the upper limits on the
concentrations of oxidants and chemical energy available for metabolic
reactions in all three cases, neglecting additional abiotic reactions. For all
three cases, we find that many aerobic and anaerobic metabolic reactions used
by microbes on Earth could meet the minimum free energy threshold required for
terrestrial life to convert ADP to ATP, as well as sustain positive cell
density values within the Enceladus seafloor and/or ocean. These findings
indicate that oxidant production and oxidation chemistry could contribute to
supporting possible life and a metabolically diverse microbial community on
Enceladus.

formulation with the three unknown physical quantities of interest being the
displacement $\boldsymbol{u}$ of the solid matrix, the seepage velocity
$\boldsymbol{v}$ of the fluid and the pore pressure $p$. As conservation of
fluid mass is a leading physical principle in poromechanics, we preserve this
property using an $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{div})$-conforming ansatz for
$\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$ together with an appropriate pressure
space. This results in Stokes and Darcy stability and exact, that is, pointwise
mass conservation of the discrete model.
  The proposed discretization technique combines a hybridized discontinuous
Galerkin method for the elasticity subproblem with a mixed method for the flow
subproblem, also handled by hybridization. The latter allows for a static
condensation step to eliminate the seepage velocity from the system while
preserving mass conservation. The system to be solved finally only contains
degrees of freedom related to $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $p$ resulting from the
hybridization process and thus provides, especially for higher-order
approximations, a very cost-efficient family of physics-oriented space
discretizations for poroelasticity problems.
  We present the construction of the discrete model, theoretical results
related to its uniform well-posedness along with optimal error estimates and
parameter-robust preconditioners as a key tool for developing uniformly
convergent iterative solvers. Finally, the cost-efficiency of the proposed
approach is illustrated in a series of numerical tests for three-dimensional

environment (log$_{10}$M$_{200}$[M$_{\odot}$]$\geq$13.5). At low redshift,
regardless of the final cluster mass, galaxies appear to reach their quenching
state in low mass clusters. Moreover, galaxies quenched inside the cluster that
they reside in at $z=0$ are the dominant population in low-mass clusters, while
galaxies quenched in a different halo dominate in the most massive clusters.
When looking at clusters at $z>0.5$, their in-situ quenched population
dominates at all cluster masses. This suggests that galaxies are quenched
inside the first cluster they fall into. After galaxies cross the cluster's
$r_{200}$ they rapidly become quenched ($\lesssim$ 1Gyr). Just a small fraction
of galaxies ($\lesssim 15\%$) is capable of retaining their gas for a longer
period of time, but after 4Gyr, almost all galaxies are quenched. This
phenomenon is related to ram pressure stripping and is produced when the
density of the intracluster medium reaches a threshold of $\rho_{\rm ICM}$
$\sim 3 \times 10 ^{-5}$ n$_{\rm H}$ (cm$^{-3}$). These results suggest that
galaxies start a rapid-quenching phase shortly after their first infall inside

particles in the formulation of anisotropic kappa distributions, we generalize
these distributions within the framework of nonextensive statistical mechanics

from a depot to a customer by solving what we call the Mission-Feasibility
Problem (MFP). Due to payload constraints, the drone can serve only one
customer at a time. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on
time-dependent cost graphs to properly model the MFP and tackle the delivery
dynamics. When the drone moves in the delivery area, the global wind may change
thereby affecting the drone's energy consumption, which in turn can increase or
decrease. This issue is addressed by designing three algorithms, namely: (i)
compute the route of minimum energy once, at the beginning of the mission, (ii)
dynamically reconsider the most convenient trip towards the destination, and
(iii) dynamically select only the best local choice. We evaluate the
performance of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data. The
changes in the drone's energy consumption are reflected by changes in the cost
of the edges of the graphs. The algorithms receive the new costs every time the
drone flies over a new vertex, and they have no full knowledge in advance of
the weights. We compare them in terms of the percentage of missions that are
completed with success (the drone delivers the goods and comes back to the
depot), with delivered (the drone delivers the goods but cannot come back to
the depot), and with failure (the drone neither delivers the goods nor comes
back to the depot).

a periodic grating into a material supporting propagating polaritons or
dielectric modes. However, the emission angle and frequency cannot be defined
simultaneously and uniquely, resulting in emission at unusable angles or
frequencies. Here, we explore superstructure gratings (SSGs) to control the
spatial and spectral properties of thermal emitters. SSGs have long-range
periodicity, but a unit cell that provides tailorable Bragg components to
interact with light. These Bragg components allow simultaneous launching of
polaritons with different frequencies/wavevectors in a single grating,
manifesting as additional spatial and spectral bands upon the emission profile.
As the unit cell period approaches the spatial coherence length, the coherence
properties of the superstructure will be lost. Whilst the 1D k-space
representation of the grating provides insights into the emission, the etch
depth of the grating can result in strong polariton-polariton interactions. An
emergent effect of these interactions is the creation of polaritonic band gaps,
and defect states that can have a well-defined frequency and emission angle. In
all, our results show experimentally how even in simple 1D gratings there is
significant design flexibility for engineering the profile of thermal emitters,
bound by finite coherence length.

regions where light acquires the required angle-dependent phase delay for a
certain functionality. Very recently, flat-optics structures have been proposed
to compress these large free-space volumes and miniaturize the overall optical
system. However, these early designs can only replace free-space volumes of
limited length, or operate in a very narrow angular range, or require a
high-index background. These issues raise questions about the applicability of
these devices in practical scenarios. Here, we first derive a fundamental
trade-off between the length of compressed free space and the operating angular
range, which explains some of the limitations of earlier designs, and we then
propose a solution to relax this trade-off using nonlocal metasurface
structures composed of suitably coupled resonant layers. This strategy,
inspired by coupled-resonator-based band-pass filters, allows replacing
free-space volumes of arbitrary length over wide angular ranges, and with very
high transmittance. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate, for the first time,
the potential of combining local and nonlocal metasurfaces to realize compact,
fully solid-state, planar structures for focusing, imaging, and magnification,
in which the focal length of the lens (and hence its magnifying power) does not
dictate the actual distance at which focusing is achieved. Our findings are

the master uses stale gradients to update the optimization parameters. We
analyze AMB-DG in terms of its regret bound and convergence rate. We prove that

AMB, workers stay idle after each gradient transmission to the master until
they receive the updated parameters from the master while in AMB-DG workers
never idle. We also extend AMB-DG to the fully distributed setting. We compare
AMB-DG with AMB when the communication delay is long and observe that AMB-DG

a flat lossy spectra, AC (from two manufacturers) exhibited two distinct
absorption bands: one in the blue (~ 400 nm) and the other one in the near IR
(~ 840 nm). The n-Si material accentuated the absorption in the blue and
bleached the IR absorption. Both bands contributed to capacitance increase: (a)
when using aqueous solution and a PMMA binder, the optical related increased
capacitance was 20% at low n-Si concentration and more than 100% for a high

lattice gauge theories in table-top experiments. However, the realization of
non-Abelian models remains challenging. Here, we employ a coherent quantum
control scheme to enforce non-Abelian gauge invariance, and discuss this idea
in detail for a one dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge system. Finally, we comment
on how to extend our scheme to other non-Abelian gauge symmetries and higher
spatial dimensions, which summarized, provides a promising route for the
quantum simulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.

with inevitable contamination of main sequence stars at the blue end. After
applying modified magnitude and color cuts based on previous studies, we
identify and rank 2,974 RSG, 508 YSG, and 4,786 BSG candidates in the LMC in
six CMDs. The comparison between the CMDs of the LMC and SMC indicates that the
most distinct difference appears at the bright red end of the optical and
near-infrared CMDs, where the cool evolved stars (e.g., RSGs, AGB, and RGs) are
located, which is likely due to the effect of metallicity and SFH. Further
quantitative comparison of colors of massive star candidates in equal absolute
magnitude bins suggests that, there is basically no difference for the BSG
candidates, but large discrepancy for the RSG candidates as LMC targets are
redder than the SMC ones, which may be due to the combined effect of
metallicity on both spectral type and mass-loss rate, and also the age effect.
The $T_{\rm eff}$ of massive star populations are also derived from
reddening-free color of $(J-K_{\rm S})_0$. The $T_{\rm eff}$ ranges are
$3500<T_{\rm eff}<5000$ K for RSG population, $5000<T_{\rm eff}<8000$ K for YSG

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) propose the idea of programming distributed
systems by focussing on their global behaviour across space and time. In this
view, a potentially vast and heterogeneous set of devices is considered as an
""aggregate"" to be programmed as a whole, while abstracting away the details of
individual behaviour and exchange of messages, which are expressed
declaratively. One such a paradigm, known as aggregate programming, builds on
computational models inspired by field-based coordination. Existing models such
as the field calculus capture interaction with neighbours by a so-called
""neighbouring field"" (a map from neighbours to values). This requires ad-hoc
mechanisms to smoothly compose with standard values, thus complicating
programming and introducing clutter in aggregate programs, libraries and
domain-specific languages (DSLs). To address this key issue we introduce the
novel notion of ""computation against a neighbour"", whereby the evaluation of
certain subexpressions of the aggregate program are affected by recent
corresponding evaluations in neighbours. We capture this notion in the
neighbours calculus (NC), a new field calculus variant which is shown to
smoothly support declarative specification of interaction with neighbours, and
correspondingly facilitate the embedding of field computations as internal DSLs
in common general-purpose programming languages -- as exemplified by a Scala
implementation, called ScaFi. This paper formalises NC, thoroughly compares it
with respect to the classic field calculus, and shows its expressiveness by
means of a case study in edge computing, developed in ScaFi.

two equal-halo mass subsamples by their BCG stellar mass $M_*$. The weak

comprehensive Bayesian modelling of the two $\Delta\Sigma$ profiles by
including different levels of miscentring effects between the two subsamples as
informed by X-ray observations. We find that the two subsamples have the same
average halo mass of $1.74 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h$, but the concentration

Furthermore, both cluster weak lensing and cluster-galaxy cross-correlations

galaxies in the SAMI galaxy survey. We characterize the dynamical state of the
groups using the luminosity gap between the two most luminous galaxies and the
BGG offset from the luminosity centroid of the group. We find that the
misalignment between the rotation axis of gas and stellar components is more
frequent in the BGGs in unrelaxed groups, although with quite low statistical
significance. Meanwhile galaxies whose stellar dynamics would be classified as
`regular rotators' based on their kinemetry are more common in relaxed groups.
We confirm that this dependency on group dynamical state remains valid at fixed
stellar mass and Sersic index. The observed trend could potentially originate
from a differing BGG accretion history in virialised and evolving groups.
Amongst the halo relaxation probes, the group BGG offset appears to play a
stronger role than the luminosity gap on the stellar kinematic differences of
the BGGs. However, both the group BGG offset and luminosity gap appear to
roughly equally drive the misalignment between the gas and stellar component of
the BGGs in one direction. This study offers the first evidence that the
dynamical state of galaxy groups may influence the BGG's stellar and gas
kinematics and calls for further studies using a larger sample with higher
signal-to-noise.

consideration the effects of magnetic and AB flux fields within the
non-relativistic regime using the factorization method. The energy equation and
wave function of the system are obtained in close form. We find that the
all-encompassing effects result in a strongly attractive system and
consequently there is a significant upward shift in the bound state energy of
the system. We also find that to achieve a low-energy medium for the Yukawa
potential, weak magnetic field is required, however the AB flux field can be
used as a controller. The magnetic and AB fields eliminates the degeneracy from
the spectra. From our findings, it could be concluded that to manipulate the
energy spectra of this system, the AB-flux and magnetic field will do so
greatly. The results from this study can be applied in condensed matter
physics, atomic and molecular physics.

exploratory spatial data analysis. Many such measures exist including Moran's
$I$, Geary's $C$, and the Getis-Ord $G$ and $G^*$ statistics. A parametric
approach to testing for significance relies on strong assumptions, which are
often not met by real world data. Alternatively, the most popular nonparametric
approach, the permutation test, imposes a large computational burden especially
for massive graphical networks. Hence, we propose a computation-free approach
to nonparametric permutation testing for local and global measures of spatial
autocorrelation stemming from generalizations of the Khintchine inequality from
functional analysis and the theory of $L^p$ spaces. Our methodology is
demonstrated on the results of the 2019 federal Canadian election in the
province of Alberta. We recorded the percentage of the vote gained by the
conservative candidate in each riding. This data is not normal, and the sample
size is fixed at $n=34$ ridings making the parametric approach invalid. In
contrast, running a classic permutation test for every riding, for multiple
test statistics, with various neighbourhood structures, and multiple testing
correction would require the simulation of millions of permutations. We are
able to achieve similar statistical power on this dataset to the permutation
test without the need for tedious simulation. We also consider data simulated
across the entire electoral map of Canada.

observables in a fluid in a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) are
extraordinarily long-ranged, extending, in a well-defined sense, over the size
of the system. This is to be contrasted with correlations in an equilibrium
fluid, whose range is typically just a few particle diameters. These NESS
correlations were later confirmed by numerous experimental studies. Unlike
long-ranged correlations at critical points, these correlations are generic in
the sense that they exist for any temperature as long as the system is in a
NESS. In equilibrium systems, generic long-ranged correlations are caused by
spontaneously broken continuous symmetries and are associated with a
generalized rigidity, which in turn leads to a new propagating excitation or
mode. For example, in a solid, spatial rigidity leads to transverse sound
waves, while in a superfluid, phase rigidity leads to temperature waves known
as second sound at finite temperatures, and phonons at zero temperature. More
generally, long-ranged spatial correlations imply rigidity irrespective of
their physical origin. This implies that a fluid in a NESS should also display
a type of rigidity and related anomalous transport behavior. Here we show that
this is indeed the case. For the particular case of a simple fluid in a
constant temperature gradient, the anomalous transport behavior takes the form
of a super-diffusive spread of a constant-pressure temperature perturbation. We
also discuss the case of an elastic solid, where we predict a spread that is
faster than ballistic.

sites with incomplete records is how to effectively and efficiently select
reference or donor gauges from an existing gauge network to infer the missing
data. While research on estimating missing streamflow time series is not new,
the existing approaches either use a single reference streamflow gauge or
employ a set of ""ad-hoc"" reference gauges, leaving a systematic selection of
reference gauges as a long-standing open question. In this work, a novel method
is introduced that facilitates systematical selection of multiple reference
gauges from any given streamflow network. The idea is to mathematically
characterize the network-wise correlation structure of a streamflow network via
graphical Markov modeling, and further transforms a dense network into a
sparsely connected one. The resulted underlying sparse graph from the graphical
model encodes conditional independence conditions among all reference gauges
from the streamflow network, allowing determination of an optimum subset of the
donor gauges. The sparsity is discovered by using the Graphical Lasso algorithm
with an L1-norm regularization parameter and a thresholding parameter. These
two parameters are determined by a multi-objective optimization process.
Furthermore, the graphical modeling approach is employed to solve another open
problem in gauge removal planning decision (e.g., due to operation budget
constraints): which gauges to remove would statistically guarantee the least
loss of information by estimations from the remaining gauges? Our graphical
model-based method is demonstrated with daily streamflow data from a network of
34 gauges over the Ohio River basin.

using ML for such applications by implementing an adaptive ML-accelerated
search process that can discover unexpected lattice thermal conductivity
($\kappa_l$) enhancement instead of reduction in aperiodic superlattices (SLs)
as compared to periodic superlattices. We use non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics (NEMD) simulations for high-fidelity calculations of $\kappa_l$ for a
small fraction of SLs in the search space, along with a convolutional neural
network (CNN) which can rapidly predict $\kappa_l$ for a large number of
structures. To ensure accurate prediction by the CNN for the target unknown
structures, we iteratively identify aperiodic SLs containing structural
features which lead to locally enhanced thermal transport, and include them as
additional training data for the CNN in each iteration. As a result, our CNN
can accurately predict the high $\kappa_l$ of aperiodic SLs that are absent
from the initial training dataset, which allows us to identify the previously
unseen exceptional structures. The identified RML structures exhibit increased
coherent phonon contribution to thermal conductivity owing to the presence of
closely spaced interfaces. Our work describes a general purpose machine

intelligence in the IoT ecosystem. Nevertheless, to learn a good meta-model for
within-task fast adaptation, a single agent alone has to learn over many tasks,
and this is the so-called 'cold-start' problem. Observing that in a multi-agent
network the learning tasks across different agents often share some model
similarity, we ask the following fundamental question: ""Is it possible to
accelerate the online meta-learning across agents via limited communication and
if yes how much benefit can be achieved? "" To answer this question, we propose
a multi-agent online meta-learning framework and cast it as an equivalent
two-level nested online convex optimization (OCO) problem. By characterizing
the upper bound of the agent-task-averaged regret, we show that the performance
of multi-agent online meta-learning depends heavily on how much an agent can
benefit from the distributed network-level OCO for meta-model updates via
limited communication, which however is not well understood. To tackle this
challenge, we devise a distributed online gradient descent algorithm with
gradient tracking where each agent tracks the global gradient using only one
communication step with its neighbors per iteration, and it results in an
average regret $O(\sqrt{T/N})$ per agent, indicating that a factor of
$\sqrt{1/N}$ speedup over the optimal single-agent regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ after
$T$ iterations, where $N$ is the number of agents. Building on this sharp
performance speedup, we next develop a multi-agent online meta-learning
algorithm and show that it can achieve the optimal task-average regret at a
faster rate of $O(1/\sqrt{NT})$ via limited communication, compared to
single-agent online meta-learning. Extensive experiments corroborate the
theoretic results.

fundamentally changes the structure of the wave-particle resonance, breaking
its symmetry and leading to the shifting and splitting of resonance lines. In
contrast, scattering broadens the resonance in a symmetric fashion. Comparison
with fully nonlinear simulations shows that the proposed quasilinear system
preserves the exact instability saturation amplitude and the corresponding
particle redistribution of the fully nonlinear theory. Even in situations in
which drag leads to a relatively small resonance shift, it still underpins
major changes in the redistribution of resonant particles. This novel influence
of drag is equally important in plasmas and gravitational systems. In fusion
plasmas, the effects are especially pronounced for fast-ion-driven

on assessing motor function in children by analyzing their gait movements.
Although there has been a lot of research on designing automated assessment
systems for gait analysis, most of these efforts use obtrusive wearable sensors
for measuring body movements. We have devised a computer vision-based
assessment system that only requires a camera which makes it easier to employ
in school or home environments. A dataset has been created with 27 children
performing the test. Furthermore in order to improve the accuracy of the
system, a deep learning based model was pre-trained on NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset
and then it was fine-tuned on our gait dataset. The results highlight the
efficacy of proposed work for automating the assessment of children's
performances by achieving 76.61% classification accuracy.

trains from multiple neuronal units is a key topic in neuroscience. However, an
optimal approach of assessing these interactions has not been established, as
existing methods either do not consider the inherent point process nature of
spike trains or are based on parametric assumptions that may lead to wrong
inferences if not met. This work presents a framework, grounded in the field of
information dynamics, for the model-free, continuous-time estimation of both
undirected (symmetric) and directed (causal) interactions between pairs of
spike trains. The framework decomposes the overall information exchanged
dynamically between two point processes X and Y as the sum of the dynamic
mutual information (dMI) between the histories of X and Y, plus the transfer
entropy (TE) along the directions X->Y and Y->X. Building on recent work which
derived theoretical expressions and consistent estimators for the TE in
continuous time, we develop algorithms for estimating efficiently all measures
in our framework through nearest neighbor statistics. These algorithms are
validated in simulations of independent and coupled spike train processes,
showing the accuracy of dMI and TE in the assessment of undirected and directed
interactions even for weakly coupled and short realizations, and proving the
superiority of the continuous-time estimator over the discrete-time method.
Then, the usefulness of the framework is illustrated in a real data scenario of
recordings from in-vitro preparations of spontaneously-growing cultures of
cortical neurons, where we show the ability of dMI and TE to identify how the
networks of undirected and directed spike train interactions change their
topology through maturation of the neuronal cultures.

We propose a framework through which we can compute the bias of a particular

synthesizing model outputs that have the same statistics as common neural
architectures on popular data sets. We find that binning-based estimators with
bins of equal mass (number of instances) have lower bias than estimators with
bins of equal width. Our results indicate two reliable calibration-error
estimators: the debiased estimator (Brocker, 2012; Ferro and Fricker, 2012) and
a method we propose, ECE_sweep, which uses equal-mass bins and chooses the
number of bins to be as large as possible while preserving monotonicity in the

genomics data sets have become ubiquitous. The emergence of large-scale data
sets provides great opportunities for better understanding of genomics,
especially gene regulation. Although each cell in the human body contains the
same set of DNA information, gene expression controls the functions of these
cells by either turning genes on or off, known as gene expression levels. There
are two important factors that control the expression level of each gene: (1)
Gene regulation such as histone modifications can directly regulate gene
expression. (2) Neighboring genes that are functionally related to or interact
with each other that can also affect gene expression level. Previous efforts
have tried to address the former using Attention-based model. However,
addressing the second problem requires the incorporation of all potentially
related gene information into the model. Though modern machine learning and
deep learning models have been able to capture gene expression signals when
applied to moderately sized data, they have struggled to recover the underlying
signals of the data due to the nature of the data's higher dimensionality. To
remedy this issue, we present SimpleChrome, a deep learning model that learns
the latent histone modification representations of genes. The features learned
from the model allow us to better understand the combinatorial effects of
cross-gene interactions and direct gene regulation on the target gene
expression. The results of this paper show outstanding improvements on the
predictive capabilities of downstream models and greatly relaxes the need for a
large data set to learn a robust, generalized neural network. These results
have immediate downstream effects in epigenomics research and drug development.

rollout behaviours. When policies are parameterised as neural networks, i.e.
Neuroevolution, QD tends to not scale well with parameter space dimensionality.
Our hypothesis is that there exists a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the
policy parameter space, containing a high density of diverse and feasible
policies. We propose a novel approach to diversity-based policy search via
Neuroevolution, that leverages learned latent representations of the policy
parameters which capture the local structure of the data. Our approach
iteratively collects policies according to the QD framework, in order to (i)
build a collection of diverse policies, (ii) use it to learn a latent
representation of the policy parameters, (iii) perform policy search in the
learned latent space. We use the Jacobian of the inverse transformation

ensures that the generated samples remain in the high-density regions of the
original space, after reconstruction. We evaluate our contributions on three

needs to decide how to migrate user services for maintaining the
Quality-of-Service when users roam between MEC servers with limited coverage

to the dynamic MEC environment and user mobility. Many existing studies make
centralized migration decisions based on complete system-level information,

  Similarity",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting semantically similar functions -- a crucial analysis capability
with broad real-world security usages including vulnerability detection,
malware lineage, and forensics -- requires understanding function behaviors and
intentions. This task is challenging as semantically similar functions can be
implemented differently, run on different architectures, and compiled with
diverse compiler optimizations or obfuscations. Most existing approaches match
functions based on syntactic features without understanding the functions'
execution semantics.
  We present Trex, a transfer-learning-based framework, to automate learning
execution semantics explicitly from functions' micro-traces and transfer the
learned knowledge to match semantically similar functions. Our key insight is
that these traces can be used to teach an ML model the execution semantics of
different sequences of instructions. We thus train the model to learn execution
semantics from the functions' micro-traces, without any manual labeling effort.
We then develop a novel neural architecture to learn execution semantics from
micro-traces, and we finetune the pretrained model to match semantically
similar functions.
  We evaluate Trex on 1,472,066 function binaries from 13 popular software
projects. These functions are from different architectures and compiled with
various optimizations and obfuscations. Trex outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems by 7.8%, 7.2%, and 14.3% in cross-architecture, optimization, and
obfuscation function matching, respectively. Ablation studies show that the
pretraining significantly boosts the function matching performance,
underscoring the importance of learning execution semantics.

time-sensitive information to the destination over multiple unreliable
channels. Packets from each source are generated according to a stochastic
process with known statistics and the state of each wireless channel (ON/OFF)
varies according to a stochastic process with unknown statistics. The
reliability of the wireless channels is to be learned through observation. At
every time slot, the learning algorithm selects a single pair (source, channel)
and the selected source attempts to transmit its packet via the selected

depends on the reliability of the selected channel. The goal of the learning
algorithm is to minimize the Age-of-Information (AoI) in the network over $T$

the notion of AoI regret, which is the difference between the expected
cumulative AoI of the learning algorithm under consideration and the expected
cumulative AoI of a genie algorithm that knows the reliability of the channels
a priori. The AoI regret captures the penalty incurred by having to learn the

first, we consider learning algorithms that employ well-known solutions to the

convective core during the main-sequence: the dynamo process triggered by this
convection could be the origin of a strong magnetic field inside the core of
the star, trapped when it becomes stably stratified and for the rest of its
evolution. The presence of highly magnetized white dwarfs strengthens the
hypothesis of buried fossil magnetic fields inside the core of evolved low-mass
stars. If such a fossil field exists, it should affect the mixed modes of red
giants as they are sensitive to processes affecting the deepest layers of these
stars. The impact of a magnetic field on dipolar oscillations modes was one of
Pr. Michael J. Thompson's research topics during the 90s when preparing the
helioseismic SoHO space mission. As the detection of gravity modes in the Sun
is still controversial, the investigation of the solar oscillation modes did
not provide any hint of the existence of a magnetic field in the solar
radiative core. Today we have access to the core of evolved stars thanks to the
asteroseismic observation of mixed modes from CoRoT, Kepler, K2 and TESS
missions. The idea of applying and generalizing the work done for the Sun came
from discussions with Pr. Michael Thompson in early 2018 before we loss him.
Following the path we drew together, we theoretically investigate the effect of
a stable axisymmetric mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic field, aligned with
the rotation axis of the star, on the mixed modes frequencies of a typical
evolved low-mass star. This enables us to estimate the magnetic perturbations
to the eigenfrequencies of mixed dipolar modes, depending on the magnetic field
strength and the evolutionary state of the star. We conclude that strong
magnetic fields of $\sim$ 1MG should perturbe the mixed-mode frequency pattern
enough for its effects to be detectable inside current asteroseismic data.

891 obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space

circumgalactic medium (halo) and spatially resolve a dusty superbubble and a
dust spur (filament). The dust temperature of the halo component is lower than
that of the disk but increases across a region of diameter ~8.0 kpc extending
at least 7.7 kpc vertically from one side of the disk, a region we call a
superbubble because of its association with thermal X-ray emission and a
minimum in the synchrotron scaleheight. This outflow is breaking through the
thick disk and developing into a galactic wind, which is of particular interest
because NGC 891 is not considered a starburst galaxy; the star formation rate
surface density, 0.03 Msun/year per square kiloparsec, and gas fraction, just
10% in the inner disk, indicate the threshold for wind formation is lower than
previous work has suggested. We conclude that the star formation surface
density is sufficient for superbubble blowout into the halo, but the cosmic ray
electrons may play a critical role in determining whether this outflow develops
into a fountain or escapes from the gravitational potential. The high
dust-to-gas ratio in the dust spur suggests the material was pulled out of NGC
891 through the collision of a minihalo with the disk of NGC 891. We conclude
that NGC 891 offers an example of both feedback and satellite interactions

collapse issue, which significantly degrades the diversity and quality of

capture the key mode information of Chinese characters and then incorporate it
into CycleGAN, a popular deep generative model for Chinese font generation. As
a result we propose an efficient method called StrokeGAN, mainly motivated by
the observation that the stroke encoding contains amount of mode information of
Chinese characters. In order to reconstruct the one-bit stroke encoding of the
associated generated characters, we introduce a stroke-encoding reconstruction
loss imposed on the discriminator. Equipped with such one-bit stroke encoding
and stroke-encoding reconstruction loss, the mode collapse issue of CycleGAN
can be significantly alleviated, with an improved preservation of strokes and
diversity of generated characters. The effectiveness of StrokeGAN is
demonstrated by a series of generation tasks over nine datasets with different
fonts. The numerical results demonstrate that StrokeGAN generally outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods in terms of content and recognition accuracies, as
well as certain stroke error, and also generates more realistic characters.

have been developed rapidly. However, there are two issues that need to be
resolved urgently. Firstly, numerous methods reduce the distributional shifts
only by aligning all the feature between the source and target domain, while
ignoring the private information of each domain. Secondly, DAOD should consider
the feature alignment on object existing regions in images. But redundancy of
the region proposals and background noise could reduce the domain
transferability. Therefore, we establish a Feature Separation and Alignment
Network (FSANet) which consists of a gray-scale feature separation (GSFS)
module, a local-global feature alignment (LGFA) module and a
region-instance-level alignment (RILA) module. The GSFS module decomposes the
distractive/shared information which is useless/useful for detection by a
dual-stream framework, to focus on intrinsic feature of objects and resolve the
first issue. Then, LGFA and RILA modules reduce the distributional shifts of
the multi-level features. Notably, scale-space filtering is exploited to
implement adaptive searching for regions to be aligned, and instance-level
features in each region are refined to reduce redundancy and noise mentioned in
the second issue. Various experiments on multiple benchmark datasets prove that
our FSANet achieves better performance on the target domain detection and
surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.

are incorporated to enrich spatial information and leverage hierarchical
features. Spatial attention is built on self-correlation to reinforce the
ability to find appearance similar regions. In the second stage, Proposal
SuperGlue is proposed to remove false-alarmed regions and remedy incomplete
regions. Specifically, a proposal selection strategy is designed to enclose
highly suspected regions based on proposal generation and backbone score maps.
Then, pairwise matching is conducted among candidate proposals by deep learning
based keypoint extraction and matching, i.e., SuperPoint and SuperGlue.
Integrated score map generation and refinement methods are designed to
integrate results of both stages and obtain optimized results. Our two-stage
framework unifies end-to-end deep matching and keypoint matching by obtaining
highly suspected proposals, and opens a new gate for deep learning research in
copy-move forgery detection. Experiments on publicly available datasets

hypercubes, simplices, or closely related polytopes), numerical interpolation
procedures (usually orthonormal polynomial bases), and numerical integration
procedures (usually quadrature rules). It is well known that each of these
areas has yet to be fully explored, and in the present article, we attempt to
directly address this issue. We begin by developing a concrete, sequential
procedure for constructing generic four-dimensional elements (4-polytopes).
Thereafter, we review the key numerical properties of several canonical
elements: the tesseract, tetrahedral prism, and pentatope. Here, we provide
explicit expressions for orthonormal polynomial bases on these elements. Next,
we construct fully symmetric quadrature rules with positive weights that are
capable of exactly integrating high-degree polynomials, e.g. up to degree 17 on
the tesseract. Finally, the quadrature rules are successfully tested using a

learning or variable estimation. In the context of autonomous vehicles, KF
constitutes the core component of many Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), such as Forward Collision Warning (FCW). It tracks the states
(distance, velocity etc.) of relevant traffic objects based on sensor
measurements. The tracking output of KF is often fed into downstream logic to
produce alerts, which will then be used by human drivers to make driving
decisions in near-collision scenarios. In this paper, we study adversarial
attacks on KF as part of the more complex machine-human hybrid system of
Forward Collision Warning. Our attack goal is to negatively affect human
braking decisions by causing KF to output incorrect state estimations that lead
to false or delayed alerts. We accomplish this by sequentially manipulating
measure ments fed into the KF, and propose a novel Model Predictive Control
(MPC) approach to compute the optimal manipulation. Via experiments conducted
in a simulated driving environment, we show that the attacker is able to
successfully change FCW alert signals through planned manipulation over
measurements prior to the desired target time. These results demonstrate that
our attack can stealthily mislead a distracted human driver and cause vehicle

electron-electron scattering is negligible at room temperature but becomes
dominant at low temperatures for spin relaxation in n-type GaAs. We further
examine ultrafast dynamics in novel spin-valleytronic materials - monolayer and

runtime performance by recovering the final computation result through the
first $k$ (out of the total $n$) workers who finish computation. While existing

proper incentives to encourage worker participation is still under-explored.
This paper studies the platform's optimal incentive mechanism for motivating
proper workers' participation in coded machine learning, despite the incomplete

key contribution of this work is to summarize workers' multi-dimensional
heterogeneity as a one-dimensional metric, which guides the platform's

offloading policy design as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) to maximize
the total discounted reward over the time horizon. However, the formulated RMAB
is related to a PSPACE-hard sequential decision-making problem, which is
intractable. To address this issue, by exploiting the Whittle index (WI)
theory, we rigorously establish the WI indexability and derive a scalable

ratio becomes the focus, the shorter slack time less remaining workload (STLW)
priority rule is introduced into the WI policy for performance improvement.
When the knowledge of user offloading energy consumption is not available prior
to the offloading, we develop Bayesian learning-enabled WI policies, including
maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian learning with conjugate prior, and
prior-swapping techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed policies

clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of pelvic bone diseases. Existing
methods for pelvic bone segmentation are either hand-crafted or semi-automatic
and achieve limited accuracy when dealing with image appearance variations due
to the multi-site domain shift, the presence of contrasted vessels, coprolith
and chyme, bone fractures, low dose, metal artifacts, etc. Due to the lack of a
large-scale pelvic CT dataset with annotations, deep learning methods are not
fully explored. Methods: In this paper, we aim to bridge the data gap by
curating a large pelvic CT dataset pooled from multiple sources and different
manufacturers, including 1, 184 CT volumes and over 320, 000 slices with
different resolutions and a variety of the above-mentioned appearance
variations. Then we propose for the first time, to the best of our knowledge,
to learn a deep multi-class network for segmenting lumbar spine, sacrum, left
hip, and right hip, from multiple-domain images simultaneously to obtain more
effective and robust feature representations. Finally, we introduce a
post-processing tool based on the signed distance function (SDF) to eliminate
false predictions while retaining correctly predicted bone fragments. Results:
Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
automatic method, achieving an average Dice of 0.987 for a metal-free volume.
SDF post-processor yields a decrease of 10.5% in hausdorff distance by
maintaining important bone fragments in post-processing phase. Conclusion: We
believe this large-scale dataset will promote the development of the whole
community and plan to open source the images, annotations, codes, and trained
baseline models at https://github.com/ICT-MIRACLE-lab/CTPelvic1K.

extensive research. However, the relationship between the ubiquitous disorder

experimental studies on two kagom\'{e}-lattice QSL candidates,
Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ and Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$, which are
isostructural to each other but with strong and weak structural disorder,
respectively, we show unambiguously that the disorder can induce
spin-liquid-like features. In particular, both compounds show dominant
antiferromagnetic interactions with a Curie-Weiss temperature of -17.4 and
-28.7 K for Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ and Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$,
respectively, but remain disordered down to about 0.05 K. Specific heat results
suggest the presence of gapless magnetic excitations characterized by a
residual linear term. Magnetic excitation spectra obtained by inelastic neutron
scattering (INS) at low temperatures display broad continua. All these
observations are consistent with those of a QSL. However, we find in
Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ which has strong disorder resulting from the random
mixing of the magnetic Tm$^{3+}$ and nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$, that the low-energy
magnetic excitations observed in the specific heat and INS measurements are
substantially enhanced, compared to those of Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$ which
has much less disorder. We believe that the effective spins of the Tm$^{3+}$
ions in the Zn$^{2+}$/Mg$^{2+}$ sites give rise to the low-energy magnetic
excitations, and the amount of the random occupancy determines the excitation
strength. These results provide direct evidence of the mimicry of a QSL caused

treatment units interfere with control units through market competition and

Unfortunately, current deep fake detection methods are not sustainable, as the

result in significant contamination of the stellar flux by nearby objects. We
use Gaia data to fit for and remove this contribution, providing
general-purpose software for this correction. We find all three sources have a
larger inclination, compared to earlier work. For WASP-121b, we find
significantly smaller values (13.5 degrees) of the inclination when using the
30 minutes cadence data compared to the 2 minutes cadence data. Using
simulations, we demonstrate that the radius ratio of exoplanet to star
($R_{p}/R_{\ast}$) is biased small relative to data taken with a larger
sampling interval although oversampling corrections mitigate the bias. This is
particularly important for deriving sub-percent transit differences between
bands. We find the radius ratio of exoplanet to star ($R_{p}/R_{\ast}$) in the
TESS band is 7.5$\sigma$ smaller than previous work for KELT-19Ab, but
consistent to within $\sim$2$\sigma$ for WASP-156b and WASP-121b. The
difference could be due to specific choices in the analysis, not necessarily
due to the presence of atmospheric features. The result for KELT-19Ab possibly
favors a haze-dominated atmosphere. We do not find evidence for the

conservative level set method has a few drawbacks, like distortion of
fluid-fluid interface, unphysical patch formation away from the interface and
lack of mass conservation. In this paper, a novel reinitialization approach has
been presented which circumvents these limitations by reformulating the
reinitialization equation. With the reformulated procedure, the present
approach is able to reinitialize the level set function without causing any
unwanted movement of the interface contour. The unphysical patch formation away
from the interface is also resolved here by avoiding the use of ill-conditioned
contour normal vectors. As a result of this measure, there is a significant
improvement in the mass conservation property. In addition, the simplified form
of the new reinitialization equation enables one to choose a much larger time
step during the reinitialization iteration. Moreover, the new formulation also
helps in reducing the amount of numerical computations per time step, leading
to an overall reduction in the computational efforts. In order to evaluate the
performance of the present formulation, a set of test problems involving
reinitialization of stationary level set functions is carried out first. Then,
the efficacy of the proposed reinitialization scheme is demonstrated using a
set of standard two-dimensional scalar advection based test problems and
incompressible two-phase flow problems. Finally, the ability to deal with
complex mesh types is demonstrated by solving a test problem on an unstructured
mesh consisting of finite volume cells having triangular and quadrilateral
shapes.

  Double Descent to Pruning Neural Networks","to appear at AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Deep networks are typically trained with many more parameters than the size
of the training dataset. Recent empirical evidence indicates that the practice
of overparameterization not only benefits training large models, but also
assists - perhaps counterintuitively - building lightweight models.
Specifically, it suggests that overparameterization benefits model pruning /
sparsification. This paper sheds light on these empirical findings by
theoretically characterizing the high-dimensional asymptotics of model pruning
in the overparameterized regime. The theory presented addresses the following
core question: ""should one train a small model from the beginning, or first
train a large model and then prune?"". We analytically identify regimes in
which, even if the location of the most informative features is known, we are
better off fitting a large model and then pruning rather than simply training
with the known informative features. This leads to a new double descent in the
training of sparse models: growing the original model, while preserving the
target sparsity, improves the test accuracy as one moves beyond the
overparameterization threshold. Our analysis further reveals the benefit of
retraining by relating it to feature correlations. We find that the above
phenomena are already present in linear and random-features models. Our
technical approach advances the toolset of high-dimensional analysis and
precisely characterizes the asymptotic distribution of over-parameterized
least-squares. The intuition gained by analytically studying simpler models is
numerically verified on neural networks.

situations where turbulence is present, but the interaction between large-scale
(LSD) and small-scale dynamos (SSD) is not fully understood. We performed a
systematic study of turbulent dynamos driven by isotropic forcing in isothermal
MHD with magnetic Prandtl number of unity, focusing on the exponential growth
stage. Both helical and non-helical forcing was employed to separate the
effects of LSD and SSD in a periodic domain. Reynolds numbers (Rm) up to
$\approx 250$ were examined and multiple resolutions used for convergence
checks. We ran our simulations with the Astaroth code, designed to accelerate
3D stencil computations on graphics processing units (GPUs) and to employ
multiple GPUs with peer-to-peer communication. We observed a speedup of
$\approx 35$ in single-node performance compared to the widely used multi-CPU
MHD solver Pencil Code. We estimated the growth rates both from the averaged
magnetic fields and their power spectra. At low Rm, LSD growth dominates, but
at high Rm SSD appears to dominate in both helically and non-helically forced
cases. Pure SSD growth rates follow a logarithmic scaling as a function of Rm.
Probability density functions of the magnetic field from the growth stage
exhibit SSD behaviour in helically forced cases even at intermediate Rm. We
estimated mean-field turbulence transport coefficients using closures like the
second-order correlation approximation (SOCA). They yield growth rates similar
to the directly measured ones and provide evidence of $\alpha$ quenching. Our
results are consistent with the SSD inhibiting the growth of the LSD at
moderate Rm, while the dynamo growth is enhanced at higher Rm.

discovered by Voiculescu. Many refinements have been obtained, including strong
asymptotic freeness of random unitaries and strong asymptotic freeness of
random permutations acting on the orthogonal of the Perron-Frobenius
eigenvector. In this paper, we consider a new matrix unitary model appearing
naturally from representation theory of compact groups. We fix a non-trivial
signature $\rho$, i.e. two finite sequences of non-increasing natural numbers,
and for $n$ large enough, consider the irreducible representation $V_{n,\rho}$
of $\mathbb{U}_n$ associated to the signature $\rho$. We consider the quotient
$\mathbb{U}_{n,\rho}$ of $\mathbb{U}_n$ viewed as a matrix subgroup of
$\mathbb{U}(V_{n,\rho})$, and show that strong asymptotic freeness holds in
this generalized context when drawing independent copies of the Haar measure.
We also obtain the orthogonal variant of this result. Thanks to classical
results in representation theory, this result is closely related to strong
asymptotic freeness for tensors, which we establish as a preliminary. In order
to achieve this result, we need to develop four new tools, each of independent
theoretical interest: (i) a centered Weingarten calculus and uniform estimates
thereof, (ii) a systematic and uniform comparison of Gaussian moments and
unitary moments of matrices, (iii) a generalized and simplified operator valued
non-backtracking theory in a general $C^*$-algebra, and finally, (iv)

coupling mechanisms on valley physics in two-dimensional materials. In the
static strain limit, we find that Dirac cone tilt and deformation potential
have analogous valley Hall response since they fall into the same universality
class of pseudospin structure. However, such argument fails for the coupling
mechanism with position-dependent Fermi velocity. For the isotropic case, a
significant valley Hall effect occurs near charge neutrality similar to the
bond-length change, whereas for the anisotropic case, the geometric valley
transport is suppressed, akin to the deformation potential. Gap opening
mechanism by nonuniform strain is found to totally inhibit the valley Hall
transport, even if the dynamics of strains are introduced. By varying gate
voltage, a tunable phonon-assisted valley Hall response can be realized, which
paves a way toward rich phenomena and new functionalities of valley

and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on structural MRI
scans that underwent either minimal pre-processing or more extensive
pre-processing into modulated gray matter (GM) maps. Classifiers were optimized
and evaluated using cross-validation in the ADNI (334 AD, 520 CN). Trained
classifiers were subsequently applied to predict conversion to AD in ADNI MCI
patients (231 converters, 628 non-converters) and in the independent Health-RI
Parelsnoer data set. From this multi-center study representing a tertiary
memory clinic population, we included 199 AD patients, 139 participants with
subjective cognitive decline, 48 MCI patients converting to dementia, and 91
MCI patients who did not convert to dementia. AD-CN classification based on
modulated GM maps resulted in a similar AUC for SVM (0.940) and CNN (0.933).
Application to conversion prediction in MCI yielded significantly higher
performance for SVM (0.756) than for CNN (0.742). In external validation,
performance was slightly decreased. For AD-CN, it again gave similar AUCs for
SVM (0.896) and CNN (0.876). For prediction in MCI, performances decreased for
both SVM (0.665) and CNN (0.702). Both with SVM and CNN, classification based
on modulated GM maps significantly outperformed classification based on
minimally processed images. Deep and conventional classifiers performed equally
well for AD classification and their performance decreased only slightly when
applied to the external cohort. We expect that this work on external validation
contributes towards translation of machine learning to clinical practice.

changed between or during the two apparitions. Nevertheless, we could fit all

states of 2012 TC4 in 2012 and 2017 were different. To interpret our results,
we developed a numerical model of its spin evolution in which we included two
potentially relevant perturbations: (i) gravitational torque due to the Sun and
Earth, and (ii) radiation torque known as the
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect. Despite our model
simplicity, we found that the role of gravitational torques is negligible.
Instead, we argue that the observed change of its spin state may be plausibly
explained as a result of the YORP torque. To strengthen this interpretation we
verify that (i) the internal energy dissipation due to material inelasticity,
and (ii) an impact with a sufficiently large interplanetary particle are both
highly unlikely causes its observed spin state change. If true, this is the
first case when the YORP effect has been detected for a tumbling body.

has focused on known customers, largely ignoring anonymous sessions, i.e.,
sessions initiated by a non-logged-in or unrecognized customer. However, in the
de-identified data from a large European e-commerce platform available to us,
more than 50% of the sessions start as anonymous sessions. In this paper, we
focus on purchase prediction for both anonymous and identified sessions on an
e-commerce platform. We start with a descriptive analysis of purchase vs.
non-purchase sessions. This analysis informs the definition of a feature-based
model for purchase prediction for anonymous sessions and identified sessions;
our models consider a range of session-based features for anonymous sessions,
such as the channel type, the number of visited pages, and the device type. For
identified user sessions, our analysis points to customer history data as a
valuable discriminator between purchase and non-purchase sessions. Based on our
analysis, we build two types of predictors: (1) a predictor for anonymous that
beats a production-ready predictor by over 17.54% F1; and (2) a predictor for
identified customers that uses session data as well as customer history and
achieves an F1 of 96.20%. Finally, we discuss the broader practical

interesting in many different image reconstruction contexts, although is
nonconvex and can be difficult to solve. In this work, we first describe a
novel implementation of the previous proximal alternating linearized minization
(PALM) algorithm to solve this optimization problem. We then make enhancements
to PALM, leading to a new algorithm named PALMNUT that combines the PALM
together with Nesterov's momentum and a novel approach that relies on uncoupled
coordinatewise step sizes derived from coordinatewise Lipschitz-like bounds.
Theoretically, we establish that a version of PALMNUT (without Nesterov's
momentum) monotonically decreases the objective function, leading to guaranteed
convergence in many cases of interest. Empirical results obtained in the
context of magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that PALMNUT has
computational advantages over common existing approaches like alternating
minimization. Although our focus is on the application to separate magnitude

in other nonconvex optimization problems with similar objective function

increasing interest in the psychological sciences with applications in
psychotherapy, analysis of political interactions, or interpersonal conflict
behavior. Facial expressions are widely described as being automatic and thus
hard to overtly influence. As such, they are a perfect measure for a better
understanding of unintentional behavior cues about social-emotional cognitive
processes. With this view, this study is concerned with the analysis of the
direction of emotional influence in dyadic dialogue based on facial expressions
only. We exploit computer vision capabilities along with causal inference
theory for quantitative verification of hypotheses on the direction of
emotional influence, i.e., causal effect relationships, in dyadic dialogues. We
address two main issues. First, in a dyadic dialogue, emotional influence
occurs over transient time intervals and with intensity and direction that are
variant over time. To this end, we propose a relevant interval selection
approach that we use prior to causal inference to identify those transient
intervals where causal inference should be applied. Second, we propose to use
fine-grained facial expressions that are present when strong distinct facial
emotions are not visible. To specify the direction of influence, we apply the
concept of Granger causality to the time series of facial expressions over
selected relevant intervals. We tested our approach on newly, experimentally
obtained data. Based on the quantitative verification of hypotheses on the
direction of emotional influence, we were able to show that the proposed
approach is most promising to reveal the causal effect pattern in various
instructed interaction conditions.

the Kerr black hole asymptotically. In different regions of the parameter
space, the solution describes i) a wormhole without event horizon (which, we
show, is almost ruled out by observations), ii) a black hole with a spacelike
transition surface inside the event horizon, or iii) a black hole with a
timelike transition region inside the inner horizon. It is shown how
fundamental parameters of LQG can be constrained by the observational

smoothed particle hydrodynamics formulation for thermo-capillary phase change
problems involving solid, liquid and gaseous phases with special focus on
selective laser melting, an emerging metal additive manufacturing technique.
Evaporation-induced recoil pressure, temperature-dependent surface tension and
wetting forces are considered as mechanical interface fluxes, while a Gaussian
laser beam heat source and evaporation-induced heat losses are considered as
thermal interface fluxes. A novel interface stabilization scheme is proposed,
which is shown to allow for a stable and smooth liquid-gas interface by
effectively damping spurious interface flows as typically occurring in
continuum surface force approaches. Moreover, discretization strategies for the
tangential projection of the temperature gradient, as required for the discrete
Marangoni forces, are critically reviewed. The proposed formulation is deemed
especially suitable for modeling of the melt pool dynamics in metal additive
manufacturing because the full range of relevant interface forces is considered
and the explicit resolution of the atmospheric gas phase enables a consistent
description of pore formation by gas inclusion. The accuracy and robustness of
the individual model and method building blocks is verified by means of several
selected examples in the context of the selective laser melting process.

commonsense, is a key challenge for language pre-training. According to recent
studies and our empirical observations, one possible reason is that some
easy-to-fit patterns in the training data, such as frequently co-occurring word
combinations, dominate and harm pre-training, making it hard for the model to
fit more complex information. We argue that mis-predictions can help locate
such dominating patterns that harm language understanding. When a
mis-prediction occurs, there should be frequently co-occurring patterns with
the mis-predicted word fitted by the model that lead to the mis-prediction. If
we can add regularization to train the model to rely less on such dominating
patterns when a mis-prediction occurs and focus more on the rest more subtle
patterns, more information can be efficiently fitted at pre-training. Following
this motivation, we propose a new language pre-training method, Mis-Predictions
as Harm Alerts (MPA). In MPA, when a mis-prediction occurs during pre-training,
we use its co-occurrence information to guide several heads of the
self-attention modules. Some self-attention heads in the Transformer modules
are optimized to assign lower attention weights to the words in the input
sentence that frequently co-occur with the mis-prediction while assigning
higher weights to the other words. By doing so, the Transformer model is
trained to rely less on the dominating frequently co-occurring patterns with
mis-predictions while focus more on the rest more complex information when
mis-predictions occur. Our experiments show that MPA expedites the pre-training
of BERT and ELECTRA and improves their performances on downstream tasks.

samples and scheduling batch size. A curvature-based learning rate (CBLR)
algorithm is proposed to better fit the curvature variation, a sensitive factor
affecting large batch size training, across layers in a NN. As an approximation
of CBLR, the median-curvature LR (MCLR) algorithm is found to gain comparable
performance to Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) algorithm. Our
theoretical results and algorithm offer geometry-based explanations to the
existing studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the layer wise LR
algorithms, for example LARS, can be regarded as special instances of CBLR.
Finally, we deduce a theoretical geometric picture of large batch size
training, and show that all the network parameters tend to center on their
related minima.

condensed matter physics. While it directly results in quantized response
coefficients in quantum systems, there has been no notion of quantized response
in classical systems thus far. This is because quantized response has always
been connected to topology via linear response theory that assumes a quantum
mechanical ground state. Yet, classical systems can carry arbitrarily amounts
of energy in each mode, even while possessing the same number of measurable
edge modes as their topological winding. In this work, we discover the totally
new paradigm of quantized classical response, which is based on the spectral
winding number in the complex spectral plane, rather than the winding of
eigenstates in momentum space. Such quantized response is classical insofar as
it applies to phenomenological non-Hermitian setting, arises from fundamental
mathematical properties of the Green's function, and shows up in steady-state
response, without invoking a conventional linear response theory. Specifically,
the ratio of the change in one quantity depicting signal amplification to the
variation in one imaginary flux-like parameter is found to display fascinating
plateaus, with their quantized values given by the spectral winding numbers as
the topological invariants.

determined as the spiral solution with the lowest average energy density. As
the phase boundary approaches, the period of the lowest energy spiral solution
diverges, and the spiral solutions become domain wall solutions with zero

have obtained remarkable performance for skeleton-based action recognition.
Particularly, the temporal dynamic of skeleton sequence conveys significant
information in the recognition task. For temporal dynamic modeling, GCN-based
methods only stack multi-layer 1D local convolutions to extract temporal
relations between adjacent time steps. With the repeat of a lot of local
convolutions, the key temporal information with non-adjacent temporal distance
may be ignored due to the information dilution. Therefore, these methods still
remain unclear how to fully explore temporal dynamic of skeleton sequence. In
this paper, we propose a Temporal Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (TE-GCN)
to tackle this limitation. The proposed TE-GCN constructs temporal relation
graph to capture complex temporal dynamic. Specifically, the constructed
temporal relation graph explicitly builds connections between semantically
related temporal features to model temporal relations between both adjacent and
non-adjacent time steps. Meanwhile, to further explore the sufficient temporal
dynamic, multi-head mechanism is designed to investigate multi-kinds of
temporal relations. Extensive experiments are performed on two widely used
large-scale datasets, NTU-60 RGB+D and NTU-120 RGB+D. And experimental results
show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance by
making contribution to temporal modeling for action recognition.

chosen base ring $A$. This result is proven by analyzing the bivariant ideal
generated by the so called snc relations, and, while the alternative
characterization we obtain for this ideal is interesting by itself because of
its simplicity, perhaps more importantly it allows us to easily extend the
definition of bivariant algebraic cobordism to divisorial Noetherian derived
schemes of finite Krull dimension. As an interesting corollary, we define the
corresponding homology theory called algebraic bordism. We also generalize
projective bundle formula, the theory of Chern classes, the Conner--Floyd
theorem and the Grothendieck--Riemann--Roch theorem to this setting. The
general definitions of bivariant cobordism is based on the careful study of
ample line bundles and quasi-projective morphisms of Noetherian derived
schemes, also undertaken in this work.

New sensor and control technology enhanced the functionality and usefulness of
artificial limbs to the point that complex movements, such as grasping, can be
performed to a limited extent. To date, the most successful results were
achieved by applying recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, in the domain
of artificial hands, experiments so far were limited to non-mobile wrists,
which significantly reduces the functionality of such prostheses. In this
paper, for the first time, we present empirical results on gesture recognition
with both mobile and non-mobile wrists. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
recurrent neural networks with simple recurrent units (SRU) outperform regular
RNNs in both cases in terms of gesture recognition accuracy, on data acquired
by an arm band sensing electromagnetic signals from arm muscles (via surface
electromyography or sEMG). Finally, we show that adding domain adaptation
techniques to continuous gesture recognition with RNN improves the transfer
ability between subjects, where a limb controller trained on data from one

environmental factors of HCW infections remain unclear. To fill this gap, an

distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in Wuhan, China were
explored. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the
impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other
external indicators of HCW infections. The results showed that the number of
daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution,
with and its mean observed on January 23, 2020 and a standard deviation of 10.8
days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the
city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term,
especially for HCWs in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs Wuhan
exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher
in the central city and lower in the outer city. Moreover, HCW infections
displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factors analyses
revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW
infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were
correlated with especially high risks of infection. These findings can aid
national epidemic prevention and control departments to understand the
spatiotemporal distributions of viral transmission resulting in HCW infections,
as well as external influencing factors, which can facilitate the protection of

Maker and Breaker, alternately claim~$1$ and~$b$ previously unclaimed edges of

component in her graph, while Breaker is trying to minimise it. We show that
the outcome of the game on the binomial random graph is strongly correlated
with the appearance of a nonempty $(b+2)$-core in the graph.
  For any integer $k$, the $k$-core of a graph is its largest subgraph of
minimum degree at least $k$. Pittel, Spencer and Wormald showed in 1996 that
for any $k\ge3$ there exists an explicitly defined constant $c_{k}$ such that
$p=c_{k}/n$ is the threshold function for the appearance of the $k$-core in
$G(n,p)$. More precisely, $G(n,c/n)$ has WHP a linear-size $k$-core when the
constant $c>c_{k}$, and an empty $k$-core when $c<c_{k}$.
  We show that for any positive constant $b$, when playing the $(1:b)$
component game on $G(n,c/n)$, Maker can WHP build a linear-size component if
$c>c_{b+2}$, while Breaker can WHP prevent Maker from building larger than
polylogarithmic-size components if $c<c_{b+2}$.
  For Breaker's strategy, we prove a theorem which may be of independent
interest. The standard algorithm for computing the $k$-core of any graph is to
repeatedly delete (""peel"") all vertices of degree less than $k$, as long as
such vertices remain. When $G(n,c/n)$ for $c<c_{k}$, it was shown by Jiang,
Mitzenmacher and Thaler that $\log_{k-1}\log n+\Theta(1)$ peeling iterations
are WHP necessary and sufficient to obtain the (empty) $k$-core of~$G$. Our
theorem states that already after a constant number of iterations, $G$ is WHP
shattered into pieces of polylogarithmic size.

two-legged model of a humanoid body to run in a simulated race course with
maximum speed. All submissions took a tabula rasa approach to reinforcement
learning (RL) and were able to produce relatively fast, but not optimal running
behaviour. In this paper, we demonstrate how data from videos of human running
(e.g. taken from YouTube) can be used to shape the reward of the humanoid
learning agent to speed up the learning and produce a better result.
Specifically, we are using the positions of key body parts at regular time
intervals to define a potential function for potential-based reward shaping
(PBRS). Since PBRS does not change the optimal policy, this approach allows the
RL agent to overcome sub-optimalities in the human movements that are shown in
the videos.
  We present experiments in which we combine selected techniques from the top
ten approaches from the NIPS competition with further optimizations to create
an high-performing agent as a baseline. We then demonstrate how video-based
reward shaping improves the performance further, resulting in an RL agent that
runs twice as fast as the baseline in 12 hours of training. We furthermore show
that our approach can overcome sub-optimal running behaviour in videos, with
the learned policy significantly outperforming that of the running agent from
the video.

This latter could be also deduced from the behavior of the capacitance-voltage

configuration. On the other hand, cyclic gate bias stress measurements allowed
to separate the contributions of interface states (Nit) both on the upper and
bottom parts of the 4H-SiC band gap and near interface oxide traps (NIOTs) in
the two oxides. In particular, it was found that NO annealing reduced the total

those trapped inside the oxide down to 1 x 1011 cm-2. Electron energy loss
spectroscopy demonstrated that the reduction of these traps in the NO annealed

measurements of heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies:
Measurements of electroweak probes constrain both the initial collision
geometry and the nuclear parton distribution functions. Results from soft
particle production show that the abundance of light-flavour hadrons from pions
up to hypertriton and $^4$He can be described by a universal temperature and
that these participate in the collective motion of the system. There are hints
of these effects also in small systems, which will be further investigated in
future to understand the underlying mechanisms. Studies of hard probes, such as
heavy quarks and jets show that parton energy loss plays an important role in
heavy-ion collisions. Differential measurements of J/$\psi$ mesons elucidate
their production mechanism, i.e.\ regeneration, and give evidence for
deconfinement in Pb--Pb collisions at LHC full energy. The large data samples
at the LHC enable studies of rare probes such as $\chi_{\rm c1}$(3872) and
top--anti-top production. Further, measurements of antinuclei cross sections
can provide input for dark matter searches.

and devices such as memristive switches. Analytical tools are therefore sought
that allow the behavior of ions in solids to be monitored and analyzed with
high spatial resolution and in real time. In principle, inelastic tunneling
spectroscopy offers these capabilities. However, as its spectral resolution is
limited by thermal softening of the Fermi-Dirac distribution, tunneling
spectroscopy is usually constrained to cryogenic temperatures. This constraint
would seem to render tunneling spectroscopy useless for studying ions in
motion. We report here the first inelastic tunneling spectroscopy studies above
room temperature. For these measurements, we have developed
high-temperature-stable tunnel junctions that incorporate within the tunnel
barrier ultrathin layers for efficient proton conduction. By analyzing the
vibrational modes of O-H bonds in BaZrO3-based heterostructures, we demonstrate
the detection of protons with a spectral resolution of 20 meV at 400 K (FWHM).
Overturning the hitherto existing prediction for the spectral resolution limit
of 186 meV (5.4 kBT at 400 K), this resolution enables high-temperature
tunneling spectroscopy of ion conductors. With these advances, inelastic
tunneling spectroscopy constitutes a novel, valuable analytical tool for
solid-state ionics.

used in the modeling of the redshift evolution of the merger rate. This is an
important aspect of binary black hole population analysis which is expected to
have close ties with the star formation history of the universe or dynamical
evolution of star clusters. At the least, it can probe the time delay between
the star formation and merger of remnants. However, due to the degeneracy
between the inclination angle of the binary and the luminosity distance, the
measured luminosity distance has large uncertainty that limits our ability to
precisely measure the redshift distribution of mergers. In this letter, we show
that by imposing the cosmological principle it is possible to suppress this
uncertainty and better discriminate between different distributions modeling
the redshift evolution of binary black hole merger rate. Additionally, we show
that by making a comparison with an analysis that does not make such imposition

understanding when analysed via conventional means, Nobel Laureate Robert
Shiller has since 2017 introduced and developed the idea of Narrative
Economics, where observable economic factors such as the dynamics of prices in
asset markets are explained largely as a consequence of the narratives (i.e.,
the stories) heard, told, and believed by participants in those markets.
Shiller argues that otherwise irrational and difficult-to-explain behaviors,
such as investors participating in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets, are
best explained and understood in narrative terms: people invest because they
believe, because they have a heartfelt opinions, about the future prospects of
the asset, and they tell to themselves and others stories (narratives) about
those beliefs and opinions. In this paper we describe what is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first ever agent-based modelling platform that allows for
the study of issues in narrative economics. We have created this by integrating
and synthesizing research in two previously separate fields: opinion dynamics
(OD), and agent-based computational economics (ACE) in the form of
minimally-intelligent trader-agents operating in accurately modelled financial
markets. We show here for the first time how long-established models in OD and
in ACE can be brought together to enable the experimental study of issues in
narrative economics, and we present initial results from our system. The

more effort by developers to maintain and evolve the application throughout its
life-cycle. They have long been catalogued with corresponding mitigating
solutions called refactoring operations. Objective: This SLR has a twofold
goal: the first is to identify the main code smells detection techniques and
tools discussed in the literature, and the second is to analyze to which extent
visual techniques have been applied to support the former. Method: Over 83
primary studies indexed in major scientific repositories were identified by our
search string in this SLR. Then, following existing best practices for
secondary studies, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the most
relevant works, extract their features and classify them. Results: We found
that the most commonly used approaches to code smells detection are
search-based (30.1%), and metric-based (24.1%). Most of the studies (83.1%) use
open-source software, with the Java language occupying the first position
(77.1%). In terms of code smells, God Class (51.8%), Feature Envy (33.7%), and
Long Method (26.5%) are the most covered ones. Machine learning techniques are
used in 35% of the studies. Around 80% of the studies only detect code smells,
without providing visualization techniques. In visualization-based approaches
several methods are used, such as: city metaphors, 3D visualization techniques.
Conclusions: We confirm that the detection of CS is a non trivial task, and
there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of: reducing the subjectivity
associated with the definition and detection of CS; increasing the diversity of
detected CS and of supported programming languages; constructing and sharing
oracles and datasets to facilitate the replication of CS detection and

superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused

the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly,
we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to
estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of
COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of
the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves
the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the
derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading
to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as
a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases
with superspreading.

shifted the paradigm of topological materials, which was previously limited to

equilibrium described by time-invariant Hamiltonians, without considering
time-variant or nonequilibrium properties. On the other hand, there is growing
interest in nonequilibrium systems in which time-periodic driving, known as
Floquet engineering, can induce unconventional phenomena including Floquet
topological phases and time crystals. Recent theories have attemped to combine
Floquet engineering and HOTIs, but there has thus far been no experimental

two-dimensional (2D) Floquet HOTI in a three-dimensional (3D) acoustic lattice,
with modulation along z axis serving as an effective time-dependent drive.
Direct acoustic measurements reveal Floquet corner states that have
time-periodic evolution, whose period can be even longer than the underlying
drive, a feature previously predicted for time crystals. The Floquet corner
states can exist alongside chiral edge states under topological protection,
unlike previous static HOTIs. These results demonstrate the unique space-time

basis interpolation on Grassmann manifolds for parametric Model Order Reduction
(pMOR) in hyperelasticity. The article contribution is mainly about stability
conditions, all defined from strong mathematical background. We show how the
stability of interpolation can be lost if certain geometrical requirements are
not satisfied by making a concrete elucidation of the local character of
linearization. To this effect, we draw special attention to the Grassmannian
Exponential map and optimal injectivity condition of this map, related to the
cut--locus of Grassmann manifolds. From this, explicit stability conditions are
established and can be directly used to determine the loss of injectivity in
practical pMOR applications. Another stability condition is formulated when
increasing the number p of mode, deduced from principal angles of subspaces of
different dimensions p. This stability condition helps to explain the
non-monotonic oscillatory behavior of the error-norm with respect to the number
of POD modes, and on the contrary, the monotonic decrease of the error-norm in
the two benchmark numerical examples considered herein. Under this study, pMOR
is applied in hyperelastic structures using a non-intrusive approach for
inserting the interpolated spatial POD ROM basis in a commercial FEM code. The
accuracy is assessed by \emph{a posteriori} error norms defined using the ROM
FEM solution and its high fidelity counterpart simulation. Numerical studies
successfully ascertained and highlighted the implication of stability
conditions. The various stability conditions can be applied to a variety of
other relevant problems involving parametrized ROMs generation based on POD
basis interpolation via Grassmann manifolds.

The main aim of the paper is to show how, in the realm of classical mechanics,
an 'almost' vanishing Rund-Trautman function accompanying an 'almost' symmetry
leads to an 'almost' constant of motion within the adiabatic assumption, that
is, to an adiabatic invariant. To this end, the Rund-Trautman function is first
introduced and analysed in detail, then it is implemented for the general
one-dimensional problem. Finally, its relevance in the adiabatic context is
examined through the example of the harmonic oscillator with a slowly varying
frequency. Notably, for some frequency profiles, explicit expansions of
adiabatic invariants are derived through it and an illustrative numerical test
is realized.

factorize it for precisely predicting the missing entries? Tensor factorization
has been extensively utilized for analyzing various multi-dimensional

real-world data are closely related to time. Moreover, they do not address
accuracy degradation due to the sparsity of time slices. The essential problems
of how to exploit the temporal property for tensor decomposition and consider
the sparsity of time slices remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose TATD

smoothing regularization with Gaussian kernel for modeling time dependency.
Moreover, we improve the performance of TATD by considering time-varying

be employed.

attempts to vary the number of layers, and the specimen tilt angle. However,
the number of sequences able to be discriminated this way remains few, because
of the similarities between the DPs. Also, the possibility of the occurrence of

given to guarantee the global coupled constraints. The self-triggering
mechanism help reduce the computation burden by skip insignificant iteration
steps, which determine a certain sampling instants to solve the DMPC

constructed as a dual form, and solved distributedly based on the Alternative

be replicated at zero cost, stored, and transmitted almost for free, etc. In
most DMs, data sellers are invited to indicate a price, together with a
description of their datasets. For data buyers, however, deciding whether
paying the requested price makes sense, can only be done after having used the
data with their AI/ML algorithms. Theoretical works have analysed the problem
of which datasets to buy, and at what price, in the context of full information
models, in which the performance of algorithms over any of the O(2^N) possible
subsets of N datasets is known a priori, together with the value functions of
buyers. Such information is, however, difficult to compute, let alone be made
public in the context of real-world DMs.
  In this paper, we show that if a DM provides to potential buyers a measure of
the performance of their AI/ML algorithm on individual datasets, then they can
select which datasets to buy with an efficacy that approximates that of a
complete information model. We call the resulting algorithm Try Before You Buy

to near optimal buying performance with only O(N) instead of O(2^N) information

is an important step towards interpretable machine learning. After the latent
space is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the
style representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous
works usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors
do not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.
Especially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which
we call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate
discriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that
feature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,
which provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,
positive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method
contributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in
multi-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve
a style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple
style types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always
have some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will
affect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon
training bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias
while disentangling multiple types. We conduct experiments on two datasets
(Yelp service reviews and Amazon product reviews) to evaluate the
style-disentangling effect and the unsupervised style transfer performance on
two style types: sentiment and tense. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of our model.

applications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for
a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an
instance that lead the model to give its prediction on the instance. Previous
works on generating extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a
selector that selects the most important features (i.e., the rationale)
followed by a predictor that makes the prediction based exclusively on the
selected features. One disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for
learning to select features comes from the comparison of the answers given by
the predictor and the ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze
more information from the predictor via an information calibration method. More
precisely, we train two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that
solves the task at hand in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a
selector-predictor model that additionally produces a rationale for its
prediction. The first model is used as a guide to the second model. We use an
adversarial-based technique to calibrate the information extracted by the two
models such that the difference between them is an indicator of the missed or
over-selected features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose to
use a language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent
rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task as well as on
three tasks from the legal domain show the effectiveness of our approach to
rationale extraction.

field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. Given a finite commutative group scheme $G$
over $K$ and a smooth projective curve $C$ over $K$ with a rational point, we
study the extension of pointed fppf $G$-torsors over $C$ to pointed torsors
over some $R$-regular model $\mathcal{C}$ of $C$. We first study this problem
in the category of log schemes: given a finite flat $R$-group scheme
$\mathcal{G}$, we prove that the data of a pointed $\mathcal{G}$-log torsor
over $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to that of a morphism $\mathcal{G}^D \to
\mathrm{Pic}^{log}_{\mathcal{C}/R}$, where $\mathcal{G}^D$ is the Cartier dual
of $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathrm{Pic}^{log}_{\mathcal{C}/R}$ the log Picard
functor. Then, we deduce a criterion for the extension of torsors: it suffices
to find a finite flat model of $G$ over $R$ for which a certain group scheme
morphism to the Jacobian $J$ of $C$ extends to the N\'eron model of $J$. In
this context, we compute the obstruction for the extended log torsor to come
from an fppf one. In a second part, we generalize a result of Chiodo which
gives a criterion for the $r$-torsion subgroup of the N\'eron model of $J$ to
be a finite flat group scheme, and we combine it with the results of the first
part. Finally, we give two detailed examples of extension of torsors when $C$
is a hyperelliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, which will illustrates our
techniques.

characterize LDT graphs as a subclass of properly vertex-colored cographs, and
provide a polynomial-time recognition algorithm as well as an algorithm to
construct a relaxed scenario that explains a given LDT. An edge in an LDT graph
implies that the two corresponding genes are separated by at least one HGT

help of simulations of evolutionary scenarios with a wide range of duplication,

expressed as a Linear Regression Model (LRM) of an indicator matrix, that is,
in terms of the inverse problem of regressing the observations. In other words,
both approaches, i.e. GLM and LRM, apply to different domains, the observation
and the label domains, and are linked by a normalization value at the
least-squares solution. Subsequently, from this relationship we derive a
statistical test based on a more refined predictive algorithm, i.e. the
(non)linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) that maximizes the class margin of
separation, within a permutation analysis. The MLE-based inference employs a
residual score and includes the upper bound to compute a better estimation of
the actual (real) error. Experimental results demonstrate how the parameter
estimations derived from each model resulted in different classification
performances in the equivalent inverse problem. Moreover, using real data the
aforementioned predictive algorithms within permutation tests, including such
model-free estimators, are able to provide a good trade-off between type I
error and statistical power.

the proper treatment of the functional measure of the unimodular path integral.

shown to be NP-Complete also for bipartite temporal graphs even when each edge

message interactions between edges and entitles through a communicative kernel
and enables a sufficient flow of relation information. Moreover, we demonstrate
that CoMPILE can naturally handle asymmetric/anti-symmetric relations without
the need for explosively increasing the number of model parameters by
extracting the directed enclosing subgraphs. Extensive experiments show
substantial performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on

present a great advantage for accurate solar magnetic field measurement. They
potentially contribute to the diagnosis of solar atmospheric parameters through
their high magnetic sensitivity. The goal of this study is to understand the
radiation transfer process of these lines in detail and explore the ability of
magnetic field diagnosis in the infrared. We calculated the Stokes profiles and
response functions of the two Mg I 12 $\mu$m lines based on one-dimensional
solar atmospheric models using the Rybicki-Hummer (RH) radiative transfer code.
The integration of these profiles with respect to the wavelength was used to
generate calibration curves related to the longitudinal and transverse fields.
The traditional single-wavelength calibration curve based on the weak-field
approximation was also tested to determine if it is suitable for the infrared.
The 12.32 $\mu$m line is more suitable for a magnetic field diagnosis because
its relative emission intensity and polarization signal are stronger than that
of the 12.22 $\mu$m line. The result from the response functions illustrates
that the derived magnetic field and velocity with 12.32 $\mu$m line mainly
originate from the height of 450 km, while that for the temperature is about
490 km. The calibration curves obtained by the wavelength-integrated method
show a nonlinear distribution. For the Mg I 12.32 $\mu$m line, the longitudinal
(transverse) field can be effectively inferred from Stokes V/I (Q/I and U/I) in
the linear range below $\sim 600$ G ($\sim 3000$ G) in quiet regions and below
$\sim 400$ G ($\sim 1200$ G) in penumbrae. Within the given linear range, the
method is a supplement to the magnetic field calibration when the Zeeman
components are incompletely split.

multiple base clusterings to produce better performance than that of the
individual one. The existing clustering ensemble methods generally construct a
co-association matrix, which indicates the pairwise similarity between samples,
as the weighted linear combination of the connective matrices from different
base clusterings, and the resulting co-association matrix is then adopted as
the input of an off-the-shelf clustering algorithm, e.g., spectral clustering.
However, the co-association matrix may be dominated by poor base clusterings,
resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank
tensor approximation-based method to solve the problem from a global
perspective. Specifically, by inspecting whether two samples are clustered to
an identical cluster under different base clusterings, we derive a
coherent-link matrix, which contains limited but highly reliable relationships
between samples. We then stack the coherent-link matrix and the co-association
matrix to form a three-dimensional tensor, the low-rankness property of which
is further explored to propagate the information of the coherent-link matrix to
the co-association matrix, producing a refined co-association matrix. We
formulate the proposed method as a convex constrained optimization problem and
solve it efficiently. Experimental results over 7 benchmark data sets show that
the proposed model achieves a breakthrough in clustering performance, compared
with 12 state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to explore the potential of low-rank tensor on clustering ensemble,

short-lived jets, about a year in the present simulations, interact with the

blown dense wind forms the main PN dense shell. Namely, the jets are older than

be too energetic, cannot be too wide, and cannot be too slow. A flow structure
where short-lived jets precede the main phase of nebula ejection by a few years

language processing, which requires an agent to determine the semantic relation
among input sentences. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive
performance in this area, especially BERT. Despite the effectiveness of these
models, most of them treat output labels as meaningless one-hot vectors,
underestimating the semantic information and guidance of relations that these
labels reveal, especially for tasks with a small number of labels. To address
this problem, we propose a Relation of Relation Learning Network (R2-Net) for
sentence semantic matching. Specifically, we first employ BERT to encode the
input sentences from a global perspective. Then a CNN-based encoder is designed
to capture keywords and phrase information from a local perspective. To fully
leverage labels for better relation information extraction, we introduce a
self-supervised relation of relation classification task for guiding R2-Net to
consider more about labels. Meanwhile, a triplet loss is employed to
distinguish the intra-class and inter-class relations in a finer granularity.
Empirical experiments on two sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed model. As a byproduct, we have released the codes
to facilitate other researches.

However, strict requirements to encode qubits and operators render the

enjoys several properties of crucial importance in applications. In particular,
the proposed solution has good decentralization properties and it is scalable
in that the number of local variables does not grow with the size or topology
of the communication network. Moreover, a global and uniform (both in the

provided towards a steady state which can be made arbitrarily close to the

losing uniformity with respect to the initial time.

these outflows to help refine the properties of the protostars. We imaged the
molecular outflows in SDC335 using new data from the ATCA of SiO and Class I
CH$_3$OH maser emission (~3 arcsec) alongside observations of four CO
transitions made with APEX and archival ALMA CO, $^{13}$CO (~1 arcsec), and HNC
data. We introduced a generalised argument to constrain outflow inclination
angles based on observed outflow properties. We used the properties of each
outflow to infer the accretion rates on the protostellar sources driving them
and to deduce the evolutionary characteristics of the sources. We identify
three molecular outflows in SDC335, one associated with each of the known
compact HII regions. The outflow properties show that the SDC335 protostars are
in the early stages (Class 0) of their evolution, with the potential to form
stars in excess of 50 M$_{\odot}$. The measured total accretion rate onto the
protostars is $1.4(\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-3}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to
the total mass infall rate toward the cloud centre on parsec scales of 2.5$(\pm

computer vision and pattern recognition. Despite recent impressive progress,
existing deep GM methods often have obvious difficulty in handling outliers,

based approach RGM, whose sequential node matching scheme naturally fits the
strategy for selective inlier matching against outliers. A revocable action
framework is devised to improve the agent's flexibility against the complex
constrained GM. Moreover, we propose a quadratic approximation technique to
regularize the affinity score, in the presence of outliers. As such, the agent
can finish inlier matching timely when the affinity score stops growing, for
which otherwise an additional parameter i.e. the number of inliers is needed to
avoid matching outliers. In this paper, we focus on learning the back-end
solver under the most general form of GM: the Lawler's QAP, whose input is the
affinity matrix. Especially, our approach can also boost existing GM methods
that use such input. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
its performance regarding both accuracy and robustness.

the enormous needs of users. How to capture user interests and make accurate
recommendations for users in heterogeneous e-commerce scenarios is still a
continuous research topic. However, most existing studies overlook the
intrinsic association of the scenarios: the log data collected from platforms
can be naturally divided into different scenarios (e.g., country, city,
culture).
  We observed that the scenarios are heterogeneous because of the huge
differences among them. Therefore, a unified model is difficult to effectively
capture complex correlations (e.g., differences and similarities) between
multiple scenarios thus seriously reducing the accuracy of recommendation
results.
  In this paper, we target the problem of multi-scenario recommendation in
e-commerce, and propose a novel recommendation model named Scenario-aware
Mutual Learning (SAML) that leverages the differences and similarities between
multiple scenarios. We first introduce scenario-aware feature representation,
which transforms the embedding and attention modules to map the features into
both global and scenario-specific subspace in parallel. Then we introduce an
auxiliary network to model the shared knowledge across all scenarios, and use a
multi-branch network to model differences among specific scenarios. Finally, we
employ a novel mutual unit to adaptively learn the similarity between various
scenarios and incorporate it into multi-branch network. We conduct extensive
experiments on both public and industrial datasets, empirical results show that
SAML consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

of a clear understanding of these processes as the ions may introduce
exceptional phenomena such as hysteresis or giant dielectric constants. As a
result, the electronic landscape, including its interaction with mobile ions,
is difficult to access both experimentally and analytically. To address this
challenge, we applied a series of small perturbation techniques including
impedance spectroscopy (IS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy

$\mathrm{MAPbI_3}$ perovskite solar cells. Our measurements indicate that both
electronic as well as ionic responses can be observed in all three methods and
assigned by literature comparison. The results reveal that the dominant
charge-carrier loss mechanism is surface recombination by limitation of the
quasi-Fermi level splitting. The interaction between mobile ions and the
electronic charge carriers leads to a shift of the apparent diode ideality
factor from 0.74 to 1.64 for increasing illumination intensity, despite the
recombination mechanism remaining unchanged.

generated integer-shift-invariant space that can reproduce polynomials up to a
given degree $M$. While this property allows for an approximation power of
order $(M+1)$, it comes with a tradeoff on the length of the support of the
basis functions. Specifically, we prove that the sum of the length of the
support of the generators is at least $(M+1)$. Following this result, we
introduce the notion of shortest basis of degree $M$, which is motivated by our
desire to minimize the computational costs. We then demonstrate that any basis
of shortest support generates a Riesz basis. Finally, we introduce a recursive
algorithm to construct the shortest-support basis for any multi-spline space.
It provides a generalization of both polynomial and Hermite B-splines. This
framework paves the way for novel applications such as fast derivative sampling
with arbitrarily high approximation power.

(C2F-FWN) for spatial-temporal consistent HVMT. Particularly, C2F-FWN utilizes
coarse-to-fine flow warping and Layout-Constrained Deformable Convolution

with multi-source appearance inputs, C2F-FWN can support appearance attribute
editing with great flexibility and efficiency. Besides public datasets, we also
collected a large-scale HVMT dataset named SoloDance for evaluation. Extensive

theoretically. Measurements of Rayleigh-Brillouin spectral profiles were
performed at a wavelength of 532 nm and at room temperature, for mixtures of
SF$_6-$He, SF$_6-$D$_2$ and SF$_6-$H$_2$. In these measurements, the pressure
of the gases with heavy molecular mass (SF$_6$) is set at 1 bar, while the
pressure of the lighter collision partner was varied. In view of the large
polarizability of SF$_6$ and the very small polarizabilities of He, H$_2$ and
D$_2$, under the chosen pressure conditions these low mass species act as
spectators and do not contribute to the light scattering spectrum, while they
influence the motion and relaxation of the heavy SF$_6$ molecules. A
generalized hydrodynamic model was developed that should be applicable for the
particular case of molecules with heavy and light disparate masses, as is the
case for the heavy SF$_6$ molecule, and the lighter collision partners. Based
on the kinetic theory of gases, our model replaces the classical
Navier-Stokes-Fourier relations with constitutive equations having an
exponential memory kernel. The energy exchange between translational and
internal modes of motion is included and quantified with a single parameter $z$
that characterizes the ratio between the mean elastic and inelastic molecular
collision frequencies. The model is compared with the experimental
Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering data, where the value of the parameter $z$ is
determined in a least-squares procedure. Where very good agreement is found
between experiment and the generalized hydrodynamic model, the computations in
the framework of classical hydrodynamics strongly deviate. Only in the

low and the number of sunspots was extremely reduced. This epoch is known as
the Maunder Minimum (MM). The study of stars in prolonged activity minima like
the MM could help to shed light on this enigmatic epoch.
  Aims. To explore if the star $\zeta^{2}$ Ret, which belongs to a binary
system, is in a state similar to the MM. We have collected more than 430
spectra acquired between 2000 and 2019 with the HARPS, REOSC, UVES, and FEROS
spectrographs.
  Methods. We performed a detailed long-term activity study of both components
using the Mount Wilson index, which is obtained from the Ca II H\&K lines. To
search for signs of an activity cycle, we analyzed the resulting time-series
with the Generalized Lomb-Scargle and CLEAN periodograms.
  Results. Our spectroscopic analysis shows a high activity level for zet01 Ret
and a significant decrease in the magnetic activity cycle amplitude of
$\zeta^{2}$ Ret. Thus, the activity difference between both components has been
slightly increased ($\Delta$log (RHK) $\sim$0.24 dex), when compared to the
previously reported value. The long series analyzed here allowed us to
recalculate and constrain the period of $\zeta^{2}$ Ret to $\sim$7.9 yr. We
also detected a long-term activity cycle of $\sim$4.2 yr in $\zeta^{1}$ Ret.
  Conclusions. By analogy with the scenario that proposes a weak solar cycle
during the MM, we suggest that activity signatures showed by $\zeta^{2}$ Ret,
i.e., a very low activity level when compared to its stellar companion, a
notably decreasing amplitude ($\sim$47%), and a cyclic behaviour, are possible
evidence that this star could be in a MM state. It is, to our knowledge, the
first MM candidate star detected through a highly discrepant activity behaviour
in a binary system.

embedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing
approaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative

embedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)

meta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we

differentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and
captures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.
Finally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation
function. Comprehensive experiments on two public and one industrial datasets
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AutoDis. Moreover, AutoDis has
been deployed onto a mainstream advertising platform, where online A/B test

Nevertheless, in the actual network operation, the base station (BS) and IRS
may belong to different operators, consequently, the IRS is reluctant to help
the BS without any payment. Therefore, this paper investigates price-based
reflection resource (elements) allocation strategies for an IRS-aided multiuser
multiple-input and single-output (MISO) downlink communication systems, in
which all transmissions over the same frequency band. Assuming that the IRS is
composed with multiple modules, each of which is attached with a smart
controller, thus, the states (active/idle) of module can be operated by its
controller, and all controllers can be communicated with each other via fiber
links. A Stackelberg game-based alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and
the passive beamforming of the active modules. Numerical examples are presented
to verify the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the proposed scheme is
effective in the utilities of both the BS and IRS.

loops may contain plasma which is up to 20 times denser than the surrounding
coronal plasma. In general the proposed model gives the relation between the
plasma temperature and the height of the loop in such a way that under the
given parameters of the associated U burst, higher loops contain cooler plasma
and vice versa. An alternative method of coronal loop height determination was
suggested. Assuming that the observed U burst and the preceding type III burst
were generated by the same exciter we define the height of the loop from the
delay of the former with respect to the latter at certain frequency. We show
that defining of coronal loops heights by another independent method, e.g.
interferometric or tied-array imaging may solve the uncertainty of the
inside-the-loop plasma temperature determination.

observation. More than 100 telescopes are planned to be in operation for as
long as 30 years, which motivated the development of a continuous condition
monitoring of the individual telescopes. The main goal of the monitoring is to
detect degradation and failures before critical damages occur. Two approaches
are considered: the structure monitoring system, in which the Eigenfrequencies
of the telescope and their damping rates are measured and monitored; and the
drive monitoring, in which the power spectra of rotating components are
measured during telescope movements. The structure monitoring concept system
was applied to the prototype Medium Size telescope (MST) prototype of CTA in
Berlin during late 2018 and in 2019, and the first results are presented here.
The system showed reasonable stability during periods, in which the telescope
structure was unchanged. The system was also capable to detect mechanical
changes, e.g. varying tension in the steel ropes of the camera support
structure. The successful implementation of the structure monitoring system
supports the decision of implementing the system in all future MSTs.

lens of Bayesian mean estimation (BME). In direct tests on numerical data, BME
is found to attain significantly lower error on average, but classical shadows
prove remarkably more accurate in specific situations -- such as high-fidelity
ground truth states -- which are improbable in a fully uniform Hilbert space.
We then introduce an observable-oriented pseudo-likelihood that successfully
emulates the dimension-independence and state-specific optimality of classical
shadows, but within a Bayesian framework that ensures only physical states. Our
research reveals how classical shadows effect important departures from
conventional thinking in quantum state estimation, as well as the utility of
Bayesian methods for uncovering and formalizing statistical assumptions.

enhances the details further. Under this framework's guidance, we can produce a
pencil sketch by drawing one stroke every time. Our method is fully
interpretable. Comparison with existing pencil drawing algorithms shows that

organize the set of chatbot intents by identifying them using proto-taxonomies,
i.e., meta-knowledge connecting high-level, symbolic concepts shared across
different intents. By using neuro-symbolic algorithms able to incorporate such
proto-taxonomies to expand intent representation, we show that such mined
meta-knowledge can improve accuracy in intent recognition. In a dataset with
intents and example utterances from hundreds of professional chatbots, we saw
improvements of more than 10% in the equal error rate (EER) in almost a third
of the chatbots when we apply those algorithms in comparison to a baseline of
the same algorithms without the meta-knowledge. The meta-knowledge proved to be
even more relevant in detecting out-of-scope utterances, decreasing the false
acceptance rate (FAR) in more than 20\% in about half of the chatbots. The
experiments demonstrate that such symbolic meta-knowledge structures can be
effectively mined and used by neuro-symbolic algorithms, apparently by
incorporating into the learning process higher-level structures of the problem
being solved. Based on these results, we also discuss how the use of mined

Uncertainties and future conditions are included in the proposed graph model
through anticipatory mobile networking to estimate the transmission energy cost

schedule their transmissions using the most efficient communication mode. These
decisions are later revisited in real-time using more precise knowledge about

significantly reduces the energy consumption (from 60% to 90% depending on the

performs closely to an ideal oracle based system with full knowledge of present

of Barenblatt cohesive models by many authors since the 1970's. In polymers and
metal creep, it is customary to assume that the relaxed modulus is zero, so
that we have typically a crack speed which depends on some power of the stress
intensity factor. Generally, when there is a finite relaxed modulus, it has
been shown that the toughness increases between a value at very low speeds at a
threshold toughness G0, to a very fast fracture value at Ginf, and that the
enhancement factor in infinite systems (where the classical singular fracture
mechanics field dominates) simply corresponds to the ratio of instantaneous to
relaxed elastic moduli.
  Here, we apply a cohesive model for the case of a bimaterial interface
between an elastic and a viscoelastic material, assuming the crack remains at
the interface, and neglect the details of bimaterial singularity. For the case
of a Maxwell material at low speeds the crack propagates with a speed which
depends only on viscosity, and the fourth power of the stress intensity factor,
and not on the elastic moduli of either material. For the Schapery type of
power law material with no relaxation modulus, there are more general results.
For arbitrary viscoelastic materials with nonzero relaxed modulus, we show that

physics over the past several years. In few-body reaction theory, there are
four main sources that contribute to the uncertainties in the calculated
observables: the effective potentials, approximations made to the few-body
problem, structure functions, and degrees of freedom left out of the model
space. In this work, we illustrate some of the features that can be obtained
when modern statistical tools are applied in the context of nuclear reactions.
This work consists of a summary of the progress that has been made in
quantifying theoretical uncertainties in this domain, focusing primarily on
those uncertainties coming from the effective optical potential as well as
their propagation within various reaction theories. We use, as the central
example, reactions on the doubly-magic stable nucleus $^{40}$Ca, namely neutron
and proton elastic scattering and single-nucleon transfer
$^{40}$Ca(d,p)$^{41}$Ca. First, we show different optimization schemes used to
constrain the optical potential from differential cross sections and other
experimental constraints; we then discuss how these uncertainties propagate to
the transfer cross section, comparing two reaction theories. We finish by
laying out our future plans.

suggesting that other factors such as prior background knowledge or personality

researches and industrial applications. However, most existing methods need to
access the training data of past 3D object classes when facing the common
real-world scenario: new classes of 3D objects arrive in a sequence. Moreover,
the performance of advanced approaches degrades dramatically for past learned
classes (i.e., catastrophic forgetting), due to the irregular and redundant
geometric structures of 3D point cloud data. To address these challenges, we
propose a new Incremental 3D Object Learning (i.e., I3DOL) model, which is the
first exploration to learn new classes of 3D object continually. Specifically,
an adaptive-geometric centroid module is designed to construct discriminative
local geometric structures, which can better characterize the irregular point
cloud representation for 3D object. Afterwards, to prevent the catastrophic
forgetting brought by redundant geometric information, a geometric-aware
attention mechanism is developed to quantify the contributions of local
geometric structures, and explore unique 3D geometric characteristics with high
contributions for classes incremental learning. Meanwhile, a score fairness
compensation strategy is proposed to further alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting caused by unbalanced data between past and new classes of 3D object,
by compensating biased prediction for new classes in the validation phase.
Experiments on 3D representative datasets validate the superiority of our I3DOL
framework.

used to study the accretion disc wind and how it depends on the state changes
in BHBs. Our aim is to investigate the origin and geometry of the accretion
disc wind in GRS 1915+105. We analysed the spectra of GRS 1915+105 in the soft
$\phi$ and hard $\chi$ classes, using the high resolution spectroscopy offered
by Chandra HETGS. In the soft state, we find a series of wind absorption lines
that follow a non linear dependence of velocity width, velocity shift and
equivalent width with respect to ionisation, indicating a multiple component or
stratified outflow. In the hard state we find only a faint Fe XXVI absorption
line. We model the absorption lines in both the states using a dedicated MHD
wind model to investigate a magnetic origin of the wind and to probe the cause
of variability in the observed lines flux between the two states. The MHD disc
wind model provides a good fit for both states, indicating the possibility of a
magnetic origin of the wind. The multiple ionisation components of the wind are
well characterised as a stratification of the same magnetic outflow. We find
that the observed variability in the lines flux between soft and hard states
cannot be explained by photo-ionisation alone but it is most likely due to a
large (three orders of magnitude) increase in the wind density. We find the
mass outflow rate of the wind to be comparable to the accretion rate,
suggesting a intimate link between accretion and ejection processes that lead
to state changes in BHBs.

is essential for understanding the superconducting mechanism of iron-based
superconductors. Compared to bulk FeSe, the superconducting single-layer
FeSe/SrTiO3 films exhibit a distinct electronic structure consisting of only
electron Fermi pockets, due to the formation of a new band gap at the Brillouin
zone (BZ) corners and an indirect band gap between the BZ center and corners.
Although intensive studies have been carried out, the origin of such a distinct
electronic structure and its connection to bulk FeSe remain unclear. Here we
report a systematic study on the temperature evolution of the electronic
structure in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. A temperature-induced electronic phase transition was clearly
observed at 200 K, above which the electronic structure of single-layer
FeSe/SrTiO3 films restored to that of bulk FeSe, characterized by the closing
of the new band gap and the vanishing of the indirect band gap. Moreover, the
interfacial charge transfer effect induced band shift of ~ 60 meV was
determined for the first time. These observations not only show the first
direct evidence that the electronic structure of single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films
originates from bulk FeSe through a combined effect of an electronic phase
transition and an interfacial charge transfer, but also provide a quantitative
basis for theoretical models in describing the electronic structure and
understanding the superconducting mechanism in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films.

learner. The teacher must select and convey information based on what they
think the learner perceives and believes. Teaching always involves misaligned
beliefs, but studies of pedagogy often focus on situations where teachers and
learners share perceptions. Nonetheless, a teacher and learner may not always
experience or attend to the same aspects of the environment. Here, we study how
misaligned perceptions influence communication. We hypothesize that the
efficacy of different forms of communication depends on the shared perceptual
state between teacher and learner. We develop a cooperative teaching game to
test whether concrete mediums (demonstrations, or ""showing"") are more robust
than abstract ones (language, or ""telling"") when the teacher and learner are
not perceptually aligned. We find evidence that (1) language-based teaching is
more affected by perceptual misalignment, but (2) demonstration-based teaching
is less likely to convey nuanced information. We discuss implications for human
pedagogy and machine learning.

focused on current cumulants in the long-time limit via full counting
statistics. Given that (TQDs) are non-trivial open quantum systems with many
interesting features, such as Aharonov-Bohm interference and coherent
population blocking, new fluctuating-time statistics, such as the waiting time
distribution (WTD), may provide more information than just the current
cumulants alone. In this paper, we use a Born-Markov master equation to
calculate the standard and higher-order WTDs for coherentlycoupled TQDs arrayed
in triangular ring geometries for several transport regimes. In all cases we
find that the WTD displays coherent oscillations that correspond directly to
individual time-dependent dot occupation probabilities, a result also reported
recently in Ref.[1]. Our analysis, however, goes beyond the single-occupancy
and single waiting time regimes, investigating waiting time behavior for TQDs
occupied by multiple electrons and with finite electron-electron interactions.
We demonstrate that, in these regimes of higher occupancy, quantum coherent
effects introduce correlations between successive waiting times, which we can
tune via an applied magnetic field. We also show that correlations can be used
to distinguish between TQD configurations that have identical FCS and that dark
states can be tuned with Aharonov-Bohm interference for more complicated
regimes than single-occupancy.

psychotherapy model wherein patients seek care from a provider through a
prescribed treatment plan developed over multiple provider visits. Recent
advances in wearable and mobile technology have generated increased interest in
digital mental healthcare that enables individuals to address episodic mental
health symptoms. However, these efforts are typically reactive and
symptom-focused and do not provide comprehensive, wrap-around, customized
treatments that capture an individual's holistic mental health model as it
unfolds over time. Recognizing that each individual is unique, we present the
notion of Personalized Mental Health Navigation (MHN): a therapist-in-the-loop,
cybernetic goal-based system that deploys a continuous cyclic loop of
measurement, estimation, guidance, to steer the individual's mental health
state towards a healthy zone. We outline the major components of MHN that is
premised on the development of an individual's personal mental health state,
holistically represented by a high-dimensional cover of multiple knowledge
layers such as emotion, biological patterns, sociology, behavior, and
cognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the personalized MHN approach via
a 12-month pilot case study for holistic stress management in college students
and highlight an instance of a therapist-in-the-loop intervention using MHN for
monitoring, estimating, and proactively addressing moderately severe depression
over a sustained period of time. We believe MHN paves the way to transform
mental healthcare from the current passive, episodic, reactive process (where
individuals seek help to address symptoms that have already manifested) to a
continuous and navigational paradigm that leverages a personalized model of the
individual, promising to deliver timely interventions to individuals in a
holistic manner.

cognitive-driven actions. In particular, they might anchor us in our decisions.
Whether the anchoring effect exists with software metrics has not been studied
yet. We conducted a randomized and double-blind experiment to investigate the
extent to which a displayed metric value for source code comprehensibility
anchors developers in their subjective rating of source code comprehensibility,
whether performance is affected by the anchoring effect when working on

dominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified during

drug approvals have been following a Juglar-Kuznet mid-term cycle with

Indeed, a measured $A^+$ value corresponds to relatively smaller or larger

decomposition technique. It is suitable for revealing spatio-temporal features
of both numerically and experimentally acquired data. Conceptually, DMD
performs a low-dimensional spectral decomposition of the data into the
following components: The modes, called DMD modes, encode the spatial
contribution of the decomposition, whereas the DMD amplitudes specify their
impact. Each associated eigenvalue, referred to as DMD eigenvalue,
characterizes the frequency and growth rate of the DMD mode. In this paper, we
demonstrate how the components of DMD can be utilized to obtain temporal and
spatial information from time-dependent flow fields. We begin with the
theoretical background of DMD and its application to unsteady flow. Next, we
examine the conventional process with DMD mathematically and put it in
relationship to the discrete Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the
current use of DMD components has several drawbacks. To resolve these problems
we adjust the components and provide new and meaningful insights into the
decomposition: We show that our improved components describe the flow more
adequately. Moreover, we remove redundancies in the decomposition and clarify
the interplay between components, allowing users to understand the impact of
components. These new representations ,which respect the spatio-temporal
character of DMD, enable two clustering methods that segment the flow into
physically relevant sections and can therefore be used for the selection of DMD
components. With a number of typical examples, we demonstrate that the
combination of these techniques allow new insights with DMD for unsteady flow.

oscillation modes. The results demonstrate the expectation that the fundamental
mode dominates the tidal response and show how the usual tidal deformability
(and the Love number) emerge in the static limit. In addition, we consider to
what extent the different modes may be excited to a level where the breaking
strain of the crust would be exceeded (locally). The results show that the
fundamental mode may fracture the crust during the late stages of inspiral.
This is also the case for the first gravity mode, which reaches the breaking
threshold in strongly stratified stars. In our models with a fluid ocean,
interface modes associated with the crust-ocean transition may also induce

  parsers","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.OH cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whether a file is accepted by a single parser is not a reliable indication of
whether a file complies with its stated format. Bugs within both the parser and
the format specification mean that a compliant file may fail to parse, or that
a non-compliant file might be read without any apparent trouble. The latter
situation presents a significant security risk, and should be avoided. This
article suggests that a better way to assess format specification compliance is
to examine the set of error messages produced by a set of parsers rather than a
single parser. If both a sample of compliant files and a sample of
non-compliant files are available, then we show how a statistical test based on
a pseudo-likelihood ratio can be very effective at determining a file's
compliance. Our method is format agnostic, and does not directly rely upon a
formal specification of the format. Although this article focuses upon the case
of the PDF format (ISO 32000-2), we make no attempt to use any specific details
of the format. Furthermore, we show how principal components analysis can be
useful for a format specification designer to assess the quality and structure
of these samples of files and parsers. While these tests are absolutely
rudimentary, it appears that their use to measure file format variability and
to identify non-compliant files is both novel and surprisingly effective.

makes gradient of architecture parameters biased for network weights and
architecture parameters are updated in different datasets alternatively in the
bi-level optimization framework. The bias causes the architecture parameters of
non-learnable operations to surpass that of learnable operations. Moreover,
using softmax as architecture parameters' activation function and inappropriate
learning rate would exacerbate the bias. As a result, it's frequently observed
that non-learnable operations are dominated in the search phase. To reduce the
bias, we propose to use single-level to replace bi-level optimization and
non-competitive activation function like sigmoid to replace softmax. As a
result, we could search high-performance architectures steadily. Experiments on
NAS Benchmark 201 validate our hypothesis and stably find out nearly the
optimal architecture. On DARTS space, we search the state-of-the-art
architecture with 77.0% top1 accuracy (training setting follows PDARTS and
without any additional module) on ImageNet-1K and steadily search architectures
up-to 76.5% top1 accuracy (but not select the best from the searched

however, there are usually equally many left- and right-handed molecules. If
homochirality was a prerequisite of life, there must have been physical or

Conversely, if it was a consequence of life, we must identify possible pathways

homochirality of any handedness could emerge as a consequence of the first

Although the basic neural network provides an alternative approach for

limits the model accuracy and fidelity. In this paper, a new family of the
energy-conservation neural network is introduced, which respects the physical
laws. The neural network is explored from a fundamental
single-degree-of-freedom system to a complicated multiple-degrees-of-freedom
system. The damping force and external forces are also considered step by step.
To improve the parallelization of the algorithm, the derivatives of the
structural states are parameterized with the novel energy-conservation neural
network instead of specifying the discrete sequence of structural states. The
proposed model uses the system energy as the last layer of the neural network
and leverages the underlying automatic differentiation graph to incorporate the
system energy naturally, which ultimately improves the accuracy and long-term
stability of structures dynamics response calculation under an earthquake

  discrimination of Enzymes model using different machine learning algorithm","3 Figures, 5 Tables, 6 Pages",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Enzymes and proteins are live driven biochemicals, which has a dramatic
impact over the environment, in which it is active. So, therefore, it is highly
looked-for to build such a robust and highly accurate automatic and
computational model to accurately predict enzymes nature. In this study, a
novel split amino acid composition model named piSAAC is proposed. In this
model, protein sequence is discretized in equal and balanced terminus to fully
evaluate the intrinsic correlation properties of the sequence. Several
state-of-the-art algorithms have been employed to evaluate the proposed model.
A 10-folds cross-validation evaluation is used for finding out the authenticity
and robust-ness of the model using different statistical measures e.g.
Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and area un-der ROC curve. The
experimental results show that, probabilistic neural network algorithm with
piSAAC feature extraction yields an accuracy of 98.01%, sensitivity of 97.12%,
specificity of 95.87%, f-measure of 0.9812and AUC 0.95812, over dataset S1,
accuracy of 97.85%, sensitivity of 97.54%, specificity of 96.24%, f-measure of
0.9774 and AUC 0.9803 over dataset S2. Evident from these excellent empirical
results, the proposed model would be a very useful tool for academic research
and drug designing related application areas.

biochar (PCBC) as alternatives to activated carbon used in Permeable Adsorptive
Barriers (PABs) for the in situ remediation of polluted groundwater. A
constructed lab-scale unconfined aquifer ($38\times30\times17$ $cm$) fitted
with PCP and PCBC PABs ($21\times3\times20$ $cm$), was evaluated for the
removal of $Pb^{2+}$ ions in a continuous flow setup. Results indicate that
after $3600$ minutes, PCP was able to reduce $Pb^{2+}$ ions from a Co=$50$
$mg/L$ to $7.94$ $mg/L$ for the first run and $19.4$ $mg/L$ for a second run,
respectively. Comparatively, PCBC reached $6.5$ $mg/L$ for the first run and
$8.94$ for the second run. It was confirmed that adsorption was best described
by the first-order kinetic model with $R^2$ values above $0.95$. Maximum
adsorption capacity values were found to be $1.00$, $0.63$, $1.08$, and $0.85$
mg/g for each scenario respectively. In addition, nonlinear regression models
of exponential and Gaussian Processes are fit to explain remediation by time
for $Pb^{2+}$ and Methylene Blue. Gaussian Processes are able to better explain
the variation of pollution removal compared to simpler exponential models. When
regressed against true removal percentages all models are able to provide
$R^2>0.99$.

to joint source and network coding. In NNC, the encoders at each source and
intermediate node, as well as the decoder at each destination node, are neural
networks which are all trained jointly for the task of communicating correlated
sources through a network of noisy point-to-point links. The NNC scheme is
application-specific and makes use of a training set of data, instead of making
assumptions on the source statistics. In addition, it can adapt to any
arbitrary network topology and power constraint. We show empirically that, for
the task of transmitting MNIST images over a network, the NNC scheme shows
improvement over baseline schemes, especially in the low-SNR regime.

Mittag-Leffler function in the framework of the Fractional Calculus. We first
start with the analytical properties of the classical Mittag-Leffler function
as derived from being the solution of the simplest fractional differential
equation governing relaxation processes. Through the Sections of the text we
plan to address the reader in this pathway towards the main applications of the
Mittag-Leffler function that has induced us in the past to define it as the
Queen Function of the Fractional Calculus.
  These applications concern some noteworthy stochastic processes and the time
fractional diffusion-wave equation. We expect that in the next future this
function will gain more credit in the science of complex systems.
  In Appendix A we sketch some historical aspects related to the author's
acquaintance with this function. Finally, with respect to the published version
in Entropy, we add Appendix B where we briefly refer to the numerical methods
nowadays available to compute the functions of the Mittag-Leffler type.

  tomography",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Identification of 3D cephalometric landmarks that serve as proxy to the shape
of human skull is the fundamental step in cephalometric analysis. Since manual
landmarking from 3D computed tomography (CT) images is a cumbersome task even
for the trained experts, automatic 3D landmark detection system is in a great
need. Recently, automatic landmarking of 2D cephalograms using deep learning
(DL) has achieved great success, but 3D landmarking for more than 80 landmarks
has not yet reached a satisfactory level, because of the factors hindering
machine learning such as the high dimensionality of the input data and limited
amount of training data due to ethical restrictions on the use of medical data.
This paper presents a semi-supervised DL method for 3D landmarking that takes
advantage of anonymized landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed. The
proposed method first detects a small number of easy-to-find reference
landmarks, then uses them to provide a rough estimation of the entire landmarks
by utilizing the low dimensional representation learned by variational
autoencoder (VAE). Anonymized landmark dataset is used for training the VAE.
Finally, coarse-to-fine detection is applied to the small bounding box provided
by rough estimation, using separate strategies suitable for mandible and
cranium. For mandibular landmarks, patch-based 3D CNN is applied to the
segmented image of the mandible (separated from the maxilla), in order to
capture 3D morphological features of mandible associated with the landmarks. We
detect 6 landmarks around the condyle all at once, instead of one by one,
because they are closely related to each other. For cranial landmarks, we again
use VAE-based latent representation for more accurate annotation. In our
experiment, the proposed method achieved an averaged 3D point-to-point error of
2.91 mm for 90 landmarks only with 15 paired training data.

analysis and DNA sequencing, to name just a few. These have in common the
selective optical excitation of molecules - fluorophores, or, in the case of
optogenetics, light-gated ion channels - with laser radiation falling within
their absorption spectrum. Unambiguous identification of molecules or cellular
subsets often requires jointly analyzing fluorescent signals from several
fluorescent markers, so that MLEs are required to provide excitation
wavelengths for several commercially available biocompatible fluorophores. A
number of functionalities are required from MLEs in addition to sourcing the
required wavelengths: Variable attenuation and/or digital intensity modulation
in the Hz to kHz range are required for a number of applications such as
optical trapping, lifetime imaging, or fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP). Moreover, switching of the laser between two fiber
outputs can be utilized for example to switch between scanning confocal
microscopy and widefield illumination modes, for instance, for conventional
fluorescence imaging.

  complexity",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although Transformer models such as Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3 are
successful in many natural language processing tasks, training and deploying
these models are costly and inefficient.Even if pre-trained models are used,
deploying these models still remained a challenge due to their large size.
Apart from deployment, these models take higher time during inference
restricting user-friendliness. The main bottleneck is self-attention which uses
quadratic time and space with respect to the sequence length. In order to
reduce the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism, Linformer
by Facebook's AI research team was introduced where they showed that the
self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix and
exploiting this finding, a new method for self-attention with linear time and
space complexity was proposed by them. In the Linformer, the time complexity
depends on the projection mapping dimension which acts as a hyperparameter and
affects the performance of the model, tuning this hyperparameter can be
time-consuming. In this paper, I proposed an alternative method for
self-attention with linear complexity in time and space and is independent of
the projection mapping dimension. Since this method works for long sequences
this can be used for images as well as audios.
