Gaudel-Dedieu and Sebastien, evaluating the performance of different versions
of matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in an anchored scenario with a
common comparator. The simulation study uses survival outcomes and the Cox
proportional hazards regression as the outcome model. It concludes that using
the LASSO for variable selection is preferable to balancing a maximal set of
covariates. However, there are no treatment effect modifiers in imbalance in
the study. The LASSO is more efficient because it selects a subset of the
maximal set of covariates but there are no cross-study imbalances in effect
modifiers inducing bias. We highlight the following points: (1) in the anchored
setting, MAIC is necessary where there are cross-trial imbalances in effect
modifiers; (2) the standard indirect comparison provides greater precision and
accuracy than MAIC if there are no effect modifiers in imbalance; (3) while the
target estimand of the simulation study is a conditional treatment effect, MAIC
targets a marginal or population-average treatment effect; (4) in MAIC,
variable selection is a problem of low dimensionality and sparsity-inducing
methods like the LASSO may be problematic. Finally, data-driven approaches do
not obviate the necessity for subject matter knowledge when selecting effect
modifiers. R code is provided in the Appendix to replicate the analyses and
illustrate our points.

planet that orbits the M3 dwarf revealed in the Ly$\alpha$ line an extended
neutral hydrogen atmosphere. This material fills a comet-like tail that
obscures the stellar disc for more than 10 hours after the planetary transit.
Here, we carry out a series of 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model
the interaction of the stellar wind with the escaping planetary atmosphere.
With these models, we seek to reproduce the $\sim56\%$ absorption found in
Ly$\alpha$ transits, simultaneously with the lack of absorption in H$\alpha$
transit. Varying the stellar wind strength and the EUV stellar luminosity, we
search for a set of parameters that best fit the observational data. Based on
Ly$\alpha$ observations, we found a stellar wind velocity at the position of
the planet to be around [250-460] km s$^{-1}$ with a temperature of
$[3-4]\times10^5$ K. The stellar and planetary mass loss rates are found to be
$2\times 10^{-15}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim[6-10]\times10^9$ g s$^{-1}$,
respectively, for a stellar EUV luminosity of $[0.8-1.6]\times10^{27}$ erg

present any significant absorption in the H$\alpha$ line in agreement with the
observations.

Different proposals combine lookahead routing and router bypass to skip the
arbitration and buffering, reducing router delay. However, the conditions to
use them requires completely empty buffers in the intermediate routers. This
restricts the amount of flits that use the bypass pipeline especially at medium
and high loads, increasing latency and power.
  This paper presents NEBB, Non-Empty Buffer Bypass, a mechanism that allows to
bypass flits even if the buffers to bypass are not empty. The mechanism applies
to wormhole and virtual-cut-through, each of them with different advantages.
NEBB-Hybrid is proposed to employ the best flow control in each situation. The
mechanism is extended to torus topologies, using FBFC and shared buffers.
  The proposals have been evaluated using Booksim, showing up to 75% reduction
of the buffered flits for single-flit packets, which translates into latency
and dynamic power reductions of up to 30% and 23% respectively. For bimodal
traffic, these improvements are 20 and 21% respectively. Additionally, the
bypass utilization is largely independent of the number of VCs when using
shared buffers and very competitive with few private ones, allowing to simplify
the allocation mechanisms.

worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the
magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region,
climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by
these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the
Generalised Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and
prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series
analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to
medium to large wildfires ($>$ 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span
of two decades (1996--2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual
vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify
abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting
vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions
to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its
predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire
periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from $R^2 = 0.66$ to
$R^2 = 0.93$ in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from $R^2 =
0.48$ to $R^2 = 0.81$ for Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), and from $R^2 = 0.49$ to
$R^2 = 0.85$ for Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show
greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as
having a lower Burning Index. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects
on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases
never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period.
Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.

thought to be caused mainly by $>$300 MeV protons interacting with the ambient
plasma at or near the photosphere. Prolonged periods of the gamma-ray emission
have prompted the suggestion that the source of the energetic protons is
acceleration at a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock, followed by
particle back-precipitation onto the solar atmosphere over extended times. We
study the latter hypothesis using test particle simulations, which allow us to
investigate whether scattering associated with turbulence aids particles in
overcoming the effect of magnetic mirroring, which impedes back-precipitation
by reflecting particles as they travel sunwards. The instantaneous
precipitation fraction, $P$, the proportion of protons that successfully
precipitate for injection at a fixed height, $r_i$, is studied as a function of
scattering mean free path, $\lambda$ and $r_i$. Upper limits to the total
precipitation fraction, $\overline{P}$, were calculated for eight LDGRF events
for moderate scattering conditions ($\lambda$=0.1 au). We find that the
presence of scattering helps back-precipitation compared to the scatter-free
case, although at very low $\lambda$ values outward convection with the solar
wind ultimately dominates. For eight LDGRF events, due to strong mirroring,
$\overline{P}$ is very small, between 0.56 and 0.93% even in the presence of
scattering. Time-extended acceleration and large total precipitation fractions,
as seen in the observations, cannot be reconciled for a moving shock source
according to our simulations. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain both long
duration $\gamma$ ray emission and efficient precipitation within this
scenario. These results challenge the CME shock source scenario as the main
mechanism for $\gamma$ ray production in LDGRFs.

  Computation Technique","13 pages, 9 figures, preprint submitted to Elsevier",,,,"cs.CG math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Packing optimization is a prevalent problem that necessitates robust and
efficient algorithms that are also simple to implement. One group of approaches
is the raster methods, which rely on approximating the objects with pixelated
representations. Although they are versatile in treating irregular geometries,
the raster methods received limited attention in solving problems involving
rotatable objects, where available studies generally analyze only right-angled
rotations. In addition, raster approximation allows the use of unique
performance metrics and indirect consideration of constraints, which have not
been exploited in the literature. This study presents the new Concurrent or
Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation Technique (COMPACT). The
method relies on raster representations of the objects that can be rotated by
arbitrary angles, unlike the right-angled rotation restrictions imposed in many
existing packing optimization studies based on raster methods. The raster
approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve
efficiency. Besides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which favors
efficient filling of the available space by maximizing the internal contact
between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain
boundaries. Moreover, the objective functions are exploited to discard overlap
and overflow constraints and enable the use of unconstrained optimization
methods. Several test problems involving concurrent and ordered packing of
multiple rectangular and circular objects into square bins are investigated.
The results show that the proposed technique performs effectively in
determining the packing arrangements.

account the effects of confinement along one of three spatial dimensions. The
framework is based on the nonaffine extension of lattice dynamics to amorphous
systems, or nonaffine response theory. The size effects due to the confinement
are taken into account via the nonaffine part of the shear storage modulus
$G'$. The nonaffine contribution is written as a sum over modes in $k$-space.
With a rigorous argument based on the analysis of the $k$-space integral over
modes, it is shown that the confinement size $L$ in one spatial dimension, e.g.
the $z$ axis, leads to a infrared cut-off for the modes contributing to the
nonaffine (softening) correction to the modulus that scales as $L^{-3}$.
Corrections for finite sample size $D$ in the two perpendicular dimensions
scale as $\sim (L/D)^4$, and are negligible for $L \ll D$. For liquids it is
predicted that $G'\sim L^{-3}$ in agreement with a previous more approximate
analysis, whereas for amorphous materials $G' \sim G'_{bulk} + \beta L^{-3}$.
For the case of liquids, four different experimental systems are shown to be
very well described by the $L^{-3}$ law.

perspectives is a hallmark of cognition and intelligence. Importantly, the
binding problem is not only relevant for vision but also for general
intelligence, sensorimotor integration, event processing, and language. Various
artificial neural network models have tackled this problem with dynamic neural
fields and related approaches. Here we focus on a generative encoder-decoder
architecture that adapts its perspective and binds features by means of
retrospective inference. We first train a model to learn sufficiently accurate
generative models of dynamic biological motion or other harmonic motion
patterns, such as a pendulum. We then scramble the input to a certain extent,
possibly vary the perspective onto it, and propagate the prediction error back
onto a binding matrix, that is, hidden neural states that determine feature
binding. Moreover, we propagate the error further back onto perspective taking
neurons, which rotate and translate the input features onto a known frame of
reference. Evaluations show that the resulting gradient-based inference process
solves the perspective taking and binding problem for known biological motion
patterns, essentially yielding a Gestalt perception mechanism. In addition,
redundant feature properties and population encodings are shown to be highly
useful. While we evaluate the algorithm on biological motion patterns, the
principled approach should be applicable to binding and Gestalt perception
problems in other domains.

Character Recognition) tools contain significant information, such as street
name, product brand and prices. Two tasks -- text-based visual question
answering and text-based image captioning, with a text extension from existing
vision-language applications, are catching on rapidly. To address these
problems, many sophisticated multi-modality encoding frameworks (such as
heterogeneous graph structure) are being used. In this paper, we argue that a
simple attention mechanism can do the same or even better job without any bells
and whistles. Under this mechanism, we simply split OCR token features into
separate visual- and linguistic-attention branches, and send them to a popular
Transformer decoder to generate answers or captions. Surprisingly, we find this
simple baseline model is rather strong -- it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on two popular benchmarks, TextVQA and all three
tasks of ST-VQA, although these SOTA models use far more complex encoding
mechanisms. Transferring it to text-based image captioning, we also surpass the
TextCaps Challenge 2020 winner. We wish this work to set the new baseline for
this two OCR text related applications and to inspire new thinking of
multi-modality encoder design. Code is available at

are often overlooked during model fitting, which may lead to spurious
scientific discoveries. Motivated by functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) studies, we propose a novel method for constructing brain connectivity
networks with correlated replicates and latent effects. In a typical fMRI
study, each participant is scanned and fMRI measurements are collected across a
period of time. In many cases, subjects may have different states of mind that
cannot be measured during the brain scan: for instance, some subjects may be
awake during the first half of the brain scan, and may fall asleep during the
second half of the brain scan. To model the correlation among replicates and
latent effects induced by the different states of mind, we assume that the
correlated replicates within each independent subject follow a one-lag vector
autoregressive model, and that the latent effects induced by the unmeasured
confounders are piecewise constant. The proposed method results in a convex
optimization problem which we solve using a block coordinate descent algorithm.
Theoretical guarantees are established for parameter estimation. We demonstrate
via extensive numerical studies that our method is able to estimate latent
variable graphical models with correlated replicates more accurately than
existing methods.

temperature of 1.6 keV, MKW4 is one of the smallest galaxy groups that have

from its center to the virial radius in the north, east, and northeast
directions. Its entropy profile follows a power-law of $\propto r^{1.1}$
between R$_{500}$ and R$_{200}$ in all directions, as expected from the purely
gravitational structure formation model. The well-behaved entropy profiles at
the outskirts of MKW4 disfavor the presence of gas clumping or thermal
non-equilibrium between ions and electrons in this system. We measure an
enclosed baryon fraction of 11% at R$_{200}$, remarkably smaller than the
cosmic baryon fraction of 15%. We note that the enclosed gas fractions at
R$_{200}$ are systematically smaller for groups than for clusters from existing
studies in the literature. The low baryon fraction of galaxy groups, such as
MKW4, suggests that their shallower gravitational potential well may make them
more vulnerable to baryon losses due to AGN feedback or galactic winds. We find
that the azimuthal scatter of various gas properties at the outskirts of MKW4
is significantly lower than in other systems, suggesting that MKW4 is a
spherically symmetric and highly relaxed system.

$\gamma$-ray coincidence relationships, leading to the identification of 41,

  First, for local intermittent fluctuations in lossy distribution grids I find
a remarkable and subtle but robust interplay of dynamical and topological
properties, which is largely absent for lossless grids.
  Second, I show how delays may induce resonance catastrophes and how the
existence of critical delays sets an upper limit for measurement times.
Further, I investigate whether centralized vs. decentralized power production,
for different grid topologies, changes this behavior.
  Third, the code used for producing the above results is in the process of
being published as an open-source Software framework called PowerDynamics.jl
being developed in the programming language Julia. It will cover the rich novel
dynamics caused by the integration of RES with the implementation of
Differential Algebraic (DAEs), Delayed Differential (DDEs) and Stochastic

the radio afterglow has contribution from two components: a weak, possibly
slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding wider cocoon, consistent with the

2) Strict alignments are required between lyric and melody, which relies on

pre-training and attention based alignment modeling for lyric-to-melody and

Probe (PSP) observed a coronal mass ejection (CME) from a distance of
approximately 30 solar radii as it passed through the instrument's 95 degree
field-of-view, providing an unprecedented view of the flux rope morphology of
the CME's internal structure. The same CME was seen by STEREO, beginning on 25
January.
  Aims: Our goal was to understand the origin and determine the trajectory of
this CME.
  Methods: We analyzed data from three well-placed spacecraft: Parker Solar
Probe (PSP), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A), and
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The CME trajectory was determined using the
method described in Liewer et al. (2020) and verified using simultaneous images
of the CME propagation from STEREO-A. The fortuitous alignment with STEREO-A
also provided views of coronal activity leading up to the eruption.
Observations from SDO, in conjunction with potential magnetic field models of
the corona, were used to analyze the coronal magnetic evolution for the three
days leading up to the flux rope ejection from the corona on 25 January.
  Results: We found that the 25 January CME is likely the end result of a slow
magnetic flux rope eruption that began on 23 January and was observed by
STEREO-A/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI). Analysis of these observations
suggest that the flux rope was apparently constrained in the corona for more
than a day before its final ejection on 25 January. STEREO-A/COR2 observations
of swelling and brightening of the overlying streamer for several hours prior
to eruption on January 25 led us to classify this as a streamer-blowout CME.
The analysis of the SDO data suggests that restructuring of the coronal
magnetic fields caused by an emerging active region led to the final ejection
of the flux rope.

Blazars are the most numerous class of High Energy (HE; E about 50
MeV - few 100 GeV) and Very High Energy (VHE; E about 100 GeV - 10 TeV)
gamma-ray emitters. As of today, a measured spectroscopic redshift is available
for only about 50% of gamma-ray BL Lacs, mainly due to the difficulty of
measuring reliable redshifts from their nearly featureless, continuum-dominated
optical spectra. The knowledge of the redshift is fundamental for understanding
the emission from blazars, for population studies and also for indirect studies
of the extragalactic background light and searches for Lorentz invariance
violation and axion-like particles using blazars. Aims. This paper is the first
of a series of papers which aim to measure the redshift of a sample of blazars
likely to be detected with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a
ground based gamma-ray observatory. Methods. Monte Carlo simulations were
performed to select those hard spectrum gamma-ray blazars detected with the
Fermi-LAT telescope still lacking redshift measurements but likely to be
detected by CTA in 30 hours of observing time or less. Optical observing
campaigns involving deep imaging and spectroscopic observations were organised
to efficiently constrain their redshifts. We performed deep medium to high
resolution spectroscopy of nineteen blazar optical counterparts using the ESI
spectrograph at Keck, the RSS spectrograph at the SALT telescope, and the
EFOSC2 spectrograph at the ESO NTT. We searched systematically for spectral
features and, when possible, we estimated the contribution of the host galaxy
to the total flux. Results. We measured eleven firm spectroscopic redshifts
with values ranging from 0.1116 to 0.482. one tentative redshift, three
redshift lower limits including one at z > 0.449 and another at z > 0.868.
There were four objects found to have featureless spectra.

processing elements increase per system-on-chip. Typical hardware solutions to
cross-core communication are often inflexible; while software solutions are

show, is that of shared state in software-based message queue mechanisms. This
paper proposes Virtual-Link (VL), a novel light-weight communication mechanism
with hardware support to facilitate M:N lock-free data movement. VL reduces the
amount of coherent shared state, which is a bottleneck for many approaches, to
zero. VL provides further latency benefit by keeping data on the fast path
(i.e., within the on-chip interconnect). VL enables directed cache-injection
(stashing) between PEs on the coherence bus, reducing the latency for
core-to-core communication. VL is particularly effective for fine-grain tasks
on streaming data. Evaluation on a full system simulator with 7 benchmarks
shows that VL achieves a 2.09x speedup over state-of-the-art software-based
communication mechanisms, while reducing memory traffic by 61%.

image pattern, termed ""spoof trace"", e.g., color distortion, 3D mask edge,
Moire pattern, and many others. Designing a generic face anti-spoofing model to
estimate those spoof traces can improve not only the generalization of the
spoof detection, but also the interpretability of the model's decision. Yet,
this is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of
ground truth in spoof traces. In this work, we design a novel adversarial
learning framework to disentangle spoof faces into the spoof traces and the
live counterparts. Guided by physical properties, the spoof generation is
represented as a combination of additive process and inpainting process.
Additive process describes spoofing as spoof material introducing extra
patterns (e.g., moire pattern), where the live counterpart can be recovered by
removing those patterns. Inpainting process describes spoofing as spoof
material fully covering certain regions, where the live counterpart of those
regions has to be ""guessed"". We use 3 additive components and 1 inpainting
component to represent traces at different frequency bands. The disentangled
spoof traces can be utilized to synthesize realistic new spoof faces after
proper geometric correction, and the synthesized spoof can be used for training
and improve the generalization of spoof detection. Our approach demonstrates
superior spoof detection performance on 3 testing scenarios: known attacks,
unknown attacks, and open-set attacks. Meanwhile, it provides a
visually-convincing estimation of the spoof traces. Source code and pre-trained

the screened Wilson line and soliton, the EE at large radius is described by a
position-dependent W-boson mass as a short-distance cutoff. Our holographic
results for EE and one-point functions of the Lagrangian and stress-energy

isotropic covariance case. We analyse in detail the associated consequences in

of the critical transition temperature, a broadening of the transition width
and an increase of the field necessary to fully saturate the magnetization
$M_{\rm s}$. The value of $M_{\rm s} \simeq 3\mu_{\rm B}$/Cr remains constant

2.39 GPa suggesting a reduction of the easy-axis type magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energy (MAE). A quantitative analysis of the FMR data gives evidence
that up to this pressure the MAE constant $K_{\rm U}$, although getting

learning and deep learning. Despite its popularity, the Wasserstein distance is
hard to approximate because of the curse of dimensionality. A recently proposed
approach to alleviate the curse of dimensionality is to project the sampled
data from the high dimensional probability distribution onto a
lower-dimensional subspace, and then compute the Wasserstein distance between
the projected data. However, this approach requires to solve a max-min problem
over the Stiefel manifold, which is very challenging in practice. The only
existing work that solves this problem directly is the RGAS (Riemannian
Gradient Ascent with Sinkhorn Iteration) algorithm, which requires to solve an
entropy-regularized optimal transport problem in each iteration, and thus can
be costly for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian
block coordinate descent (RBCD) method to solve this problem, which is based on
a novel reformulation of the regularized max-min problem over the Stiefel
manifold. We show that the complexity of arithmetic operations for RBCD to
obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. This significantly
improves the corresponding complexity of RGAS, which is $O(\epsilon^{-12})$.
Moreover, our RBCD has very low per-iteration complexity, and hence is suitable
for large-scale problems. Numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method is more efficient than existing methods, especially
when the number of sampled data is very large.

dynamically consistent model that displays a rich variety of phenomena.
Competitive equilibrium can only be reached after some time and within some
restricted region of parameter space, outside of which one observes spontaneous

so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of object poses would
produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape obtained from the sensor
output, we match it against the pre-computed set using the object-specific
embedding learned purely in simulation using contrastive learning.
  This results in a perception model that can localize objects from a single
tactile observation. It also allows reasoning over pose distributions and
including additional pose constraints coming from other perception systems or
multiple contacts. We provide quantitative results for four objects. Our
approach provides high accuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile
observations while regressing pose distributions to account for those contact
shapes that could result from different object poses. We further extend and

this outburst, GX 339-4 showed no atypical X-ray behaviour that may act as a
indicator for an outburst remaining within the hard state. However,
quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations showed a flatter than expected
coupling between the radio and X-ray luminosities (with a best fit relation of
$L_{\rm radio} \propto L_{\rm X}^{0.39 \pm 0.06}$), when compared to successful
outbursts from this system ($L_{\rm radio} \propto L_{\rm X}^{0.62 \pm 0.02}$).
While our 2017--2018 outburst data only span a limited radio and X-ray
luminosity range ($\sim$1 order of magnitude in both, where more than 2-orders
of magnitude in $L_{\rm X}$ is desired), including data from other hard-only

suggestive that for GX 339-4 a flatter radio -- X-ray correlation, implying a
more inefficient coupling between the jet and accretion flow, could act as an
indicator for a hard-only outburst. However, further monitoring of both
successful and hard-only outbursts over larger luminosity ranges with strictly
simultaneous radio and X-ray observations is required from different, single
sources, to explore if this applies generally to the population of black hole
X-ray binaries, or even GX 339-4 at higher hard-state luminosities.

Our analysis draws inspiration from a wealth of research in neuroscience and

schemes on a dyadic half-line, which is the positive half-line, equipped with
the standard Lebesgue measure and the digitwise binary addition operation,
where the Walsh functions play the role of exponents, are defined and studied.
Necessary and sufficient convergence conditions of the subdivision schemes in
terms of spectral properties of matrices and in terms of the smoothness of the
solution of the corresponding refinement equation are proved. The problem of
the convergence of subdivision schemes with non-negative coefficients is also
investigated. Explicit convergence criterion of the subdivision schemes with
four coefficients is obtained. As an auxiliary result fractal curves on a

patterns effectively. On real data, STMF outperforms NMF on six out of nine
gene expression datasets. While NMF assumes normal distribution and tends
toward the mean value, STMF can better fit to extreme values and distributions.
STMF is the first work that uses tropical semiring on sparse data. We show that
in certain cases semirings are useful because they consider the structure,
which is different and simpler to understand than it is with standard linear

of a formal mathematical foundation for relativistic quantum theory. The view
that the axiomatization of the subject is primarily a mathematical problem has
been prevalent. This view, however, implicitly asserts that said axiomatization
can be achieved without readdressing the basic concepts of quantum theory -- an
assertion that becomes more implausible the longer the debate on the conceptual
foundations of quantum mechanics itself continues.
  In this work we suggest a new approach to the above problem, which views the
non-relativistic theory from a purely statistical perspective: to generalize
the quantum-mechanical Born rule for particle position probability to the
general-relativistic setting. The advantages of this approach are that one
obtains a statistical theory from the onset and that it is independent of any
particular dynamical models and the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime.
  Here we develop the smooth $1$-body generalization, based on prior
contributions mainly due to C. Eckart and J. Ehlers. This generalization
respects the general principle of relativity and exposes the assumptions of
spacelikeness of the hypersurface and global hyperbolicity of the spacetime as
obsolete. We discuss two distinct formulations of the theory, which, we term
the Lagrangian and Eulerian pictures. Though the development of the former one
is the main contribution of this work, under these general conditions neither
one of the two has received such a comprehensive treatment in the literature
before. The Lagrangian picture also opens up a potentially viable path towards
the many-body generalization.
  We further provide a simple example in which the number of bodies is not
conserved.
  Readers interested in the theory of the general-relativistic continuity
equation will also find this work to be of value.

beam-driven cascades in the broad emission-line region of blazar jets. Methods:
Employing coupled kinetic equations for electrons (positrons) and photons
including an escape term, we numerically obtain their steady-state
distributions, and the escaping photon spectrum. Results: We find that cascade
emission resulting from beam interactions can produce a narrow spectral feature
at TeV energies. Indications of such an intermittent feature, which defies an
explanation in the standard shock-in-jet scenario, have been found at
$\approx\,4\,\sigma$ confidence level at an energy of $\approx$ 3 TeV in the

explaining the intermittent 3 TeV bump with the beam-interaction model are
plausible: Gap discharges that lead to multi-TeV beam electrons (positrons)
carrying $\approx$ 0.1 % of the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, which interact
with recombination-line photons from gas clouds that reprocess $\approx$ 1 % of

publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major
contribution to this. Yet despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars
are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large,
thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here
we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a
prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model
includes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer
two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax together with a
direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally
uses the colour and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that
stars of a given colour have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes
(plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that
the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for
stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalogue of 1.47 billion geometric
and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty
measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution,
so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the

a coarse-graining of a molecular dynamics simulation that provides dislocation
trajectories for an empirical computation of jump rates. With this
construction, we recover the original atomistic mobility estimates, with
remarkable computational speed-up and accuracy. Furthermore, the underlying

new facial expression and head pose. We call this conditional GAN -- MorphGAN.
Images generated using MorphGAN conserve the identity of the person in the
original image, and the provided control over head pose and facial expression
allows test sets to be created to identify robustness issues of a facial
recognition deep network with respect to pose and expression. Images generated
by MorphGAN can also serve as data augmentation when training data are scarce.
We show that by augmenting small datasets of faces with new poses and
expressions improves the recognition performance by up to 9% depending on the
augmentation and data scarcity.

calculations have been employed to study both light (H$_2$O) and heavy water
(D$_2$O) within the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. In particular, the deep
neural network is trained based on ab initio data obtained from the strongly
constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional.
Because of the lighter mass of hydrogen than deuteron, the properties of light
water is more influenced by nuclear quantum effect than those of heavy water.
Clear isotope effects are observed and analyzed in terms of hydrogen-bond
structure and electronic properties of water that are closely associated with
experimental observables. The molecular structures of both liquid H$_2$O and
D$_2$O agree well with the data extracted from scattering experiments. The
delicate isotope effects on radial distribution functions and angular
distribution functions are well reproduced as well. Our approach demonstrates
that deep neural network combined with SCAN functional based ab initio

the help of the operator product expansion, we first show that conservation

the standard position space operator product expansion differential operator
$\partial_\mu$, although the latter does not uplift to embedding space
covariantly. The differential operator in embedding space that imposes
conservation is the same differential operator $\mathcal{D}_{ijA}$ used in the

trains a convolutional neural network on these sharp frames. The trained

where Q(f) denotes the bounded-error quantum query complexity of f. This is
achieved by Alice running the optimal quantum query algorithm for f, using a
round of O(log n) qubits of communication to implement each query.
  This is in contrast with the classical setting, where it is easy to show that
R^{cc}(f o G) is at most 2R(f), where R^{cc} and R denote bounded-error
communication and query complexity, respectively. We show that the O(log n)
overhead is required for some functions in the quantum setting, and thus the
BCW simulation is tight. We note here that prior to our work, the possibility
of Q^{cc}(f o G) = O(Q(f)), for all f and all G in {AND_2, XOR_2}, had not been
ruled out. More specifically, we show the following.
  - We show that the log n overhead is *not* required when f is symmetric,
generalizing a result of Aaronson and Ambainis for the Set-Disjointness
function (Theory of Computing'05).
  - In order to prove the above, we design an efficient distributed version of
noisy amplitude amplification that allows us to prove the result when f is the
OR function.
  - In view of our first result above, one may ask whether the log n overhead
in the BCW simulation can be avoided even when f is transitive, which is a
weaker notion of symmetry. We give a strong negative answer by showing that the
log n overhead is still necessary for some transitive functions even when we
allow the quantum communication protocol an error probability that can be
arbitrarily close to 1/2.
  - We also give, among other things, a general recipe to construct functions
for which the log n overhead is required in the BCW simulation in the
bounded-error communication model.

lattice gauge theories coupled to dynamical matter and demonstrate how it
allows for an implementation of the toric-code ground state and its topological

individual plaquettes, whose motion induce the required plaquette terms. The
proposed building block is realized in the second-order coupling regime and is
well suited for implementations with superconducting qubits. Furthermore, we
propose a pathway to prepare topologically non-trivial initial states during
which a large gap on the order of the underlying coupling strength is present.
This is verified by both analytical arguments and numerical studies. Moreover,
we outline experimental signatures of the ground-state wavefunction and
introduce a minimal braiding protocol. Detecting a $\pi$-phase shift between

spectra of amorphous and crystalline ice mixtures and a laboratory spectrum of
crystalline ice. We next analyze the JIRAM data and, through Bayesian model
comparisons, find that a two-component intimately mixed model (TC-IM model) of
amorphous and crystalline ice is strongly preferred (at 26{\sigma} confidence)
over a two-component model of the same species but where their spectra are
areally/linearly mixed. We also find that the TC-IM model is strongly preferred
(at > 30{\sigma} confidence) over single-component models with only amorphous
or crystalline ice, indicating the presence of both these phases of water ice
in the data. For the highest SNR estimates of the JIRAM data, the TC-IM model
solution corresponds to a mixture with a very large number density fraction
(99.952 +/- 0.001 \%) of small (23.12 +/- 1.01 microns) amorphous ice grains,
and a very small fraction (0.048 +/- 0.001 \%) of large (565.34 +/- 1.01

grains we find is consistent with previous studies. The maximum-likelihood
spectrum of the TC-IM model, however, is in tension with the data in the

components not currently included in our model, primarily due to the limited

demonstrated that circular polarization (CP) images, as well as the linear

flow structure and magnetic field configuration around the black hole. In this
paper, we make new predictions for the cases in which disk emission dominates
over jet emission, bearing Sgr A* in mind. Here we set the proton-to-electron
temperature ratio of the disk component to be Tp/Te $\sim$ 2 so as to suppress
jet emission relative to emission from accretion flow. As a result, we obtain
ring-like images and triple-forked images around the black hole for face-on and
edge-on cases, respectively. We also find significant CP components in the
images ($\gtrsim 10\%$ in fraction), both with positive and negative signs,
amplified through the Faraday conversion, not sensitively depending on the
inclination angles. Furthermore, we find a ""separatrix"" in the CP images,
across which the sign of CP is reversed and on which the LP flux is brightest,
that can be attributed to the helical magnetic field structure in the disk.
These results indicate that future full polarization EHT images are a quite
useful tracer of the magnetic field structure. We also discuss to what extent
we will be able to extract information regarding the magnetic field
configurations, under the scattering in the interstellar plasma, in future EHT
polarimetric observations of Sgr A*.

using the fact that points along the same orbit have identical actions. Here we
present the workings of the method, and test it on simple axisymmetric models,
comparing the derived actions to those generated with the Torus Mapping

input phase-space measurements. These actions are much better conserved along
orbits than those estimated with the St\""ackel fudge. In our case, the
reciprocal mapping from actions and angles to positions and velocities can also
be learned. One of the advantages of the ACTIONFINDER is that it does not
require the underlying potential to be known in advance, indeed it is designed
to return the acceleration field. We expect the algorithm to be useful for
analysing the properties of dynamical systems in numerical simulations.

structures and their dynamics in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and is a leading
theory for cold cloud creation in various astrophysical environments. In this
paper we use two-dimensional (2D) simulations to investigate thermal
instability under the influence of various initial conditions and physical
processes. We experiment with Gaussian random field (GRF) density perturbations
of different initial power spectra. We also enroll thermal conduction and
physical viscosity in isotropic hydrodynamic and anisotropic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find that the initial GRF spectral
index $\alpha$ has a dramatic impact on the pure hydrodynamic development of
thermal instability, influencing the size, number and motions of clouds. Cloud
fragmentation happens due to two mechanisms: tearing and contraction rebound.
In the runs with isotropic conduction and viscosity, the structures and
dynamics of the clouds are dominated by evaporation and condensation flows in
the non-linear regime, and the flow speed is regulated by viscosity. Cloud
disruptions happen as a result of the Darrieus--Landau instability (DLI).
Although at very late times, all individual clouds merge into one cold
structure in all hydrodynamic runs. In the MHD case, the cloud structure is
determined by both the initial perturbations and the initial magnetic field
strength. In high $\beta$ runs, anisotropic conduction causes dense filaments
to align with the local magnetic fields and the field direction can become
reoriented. Strong magnetic fields suppress cross-field contraction and cold
filaments can form along or perpendicular to the initial fields.

3$-element interferometer array. Its invariance to element-based phase
corruption makes it invaluable for interferometric applications that otherwise
require high-accuracy phase calibration. However, its understanding has
remained mainly mathematical and limited to the aperture plane (Fourier dual of
image plane). Here, we lay the foundations for a geometrical insight. we show
that closure phase and its invariance to element-based corruption and to
translation are intricately related to the conserved properties (shape,
orientation, and size, or SOS) of the principal triangle enclosed by the three
fringes formed by a closed triad of array elements, which is referred herein as
the ""SOS conservation principle"". When element-based amplitude calibration is
not needed, as is typical in optical interferometry, the 3-element interference
image formed from phase-uncalibrated correlations is a true and uncorrupted
representation of the source object's morphology, except for a possible shift.
Based on this SOS conservation principle, we present two geometric methods to
measure the closure phase directly from a 3-element interference image (without
requiring an aperture-plane view): (i) the closure phase is directly measurable
from any one of the triangle's heights, and (ii) the squared closure phase is
proportional to the product of the areas enclosed by the triad of array
elements and the principal triangle in the aperture and image planes,
respectively. We validate this geometric understanding across a wide range
range of interferometric conditions using data from the Very Large Array and
the Event Horizon Telescope. This geometric insight can be potentially valuable
to other interferometric applications such as optical interferometry. These
geometric relationships are generalised for an $N$-element interferometer.

with applications ranging from demonstrations of quantum computational
advantage to descriptions of scrambling in strongly-interacting systems and
black holes. The utility of random quantum circuits in these settings stems
from their ability to rapidly generate quantum pseudo-randomness. In a seminal
paper by Brand\~ao, Harrow, and Horodecki, it was proven that the $t$-th moment
operator of local random quantum circuits on $n$ qudits with local dimension
$q$ has a spectral gap of at least $\Omega(n^{-1}t^{-5-3.1/\log(q)})$, which
implies that they are efficient constructions of approximate unitary designs.
As a first result, we use Knabe bounds for the spectral gaps of
frustration-free Hamiltonians to show that $1D$ random quantum circuits have a
spectral gap scaling as $\Omega(n^{-1})$, provided that $t$ is small compared
to the local dimension: $t^2\leq O(q)$. This implies a (nearly) linear scaling
of the circuit depth in the design order $t$. Our second result is an
unconditional spectral gap bounded below by $\Omega(n^{-1}\log^{-1}(n)
t^{-\alpha(q)})$ for random quantum circuits with all-to-all interactions. This
improves both the $n$ and $t$ scaling in design depth for the non-local model.
We show this by proving a recursion relation for the spectral gaps involving an
auxiliary random walk. Lastly, we solve the smallest non-trivial case exactly
and combine with numerics and Knabe bounds to improve the constants involved in
the spectral gap for small values of $t$.

number of no-go theorems constrain the ways in which a set of fault-tolerant
logic gates can be universal. These theorems are very restrictive, and
conventional wisdom holds that a universal fault-tolerant logic gate set cannot
be implemented natively, requiring us to use costly distillation procedures for
quantum computation. Here, we present a general framework for universal
fault-tolerant logic with stabiliser codes, together with a no-go theorem that
reveals the very broad conditions constraining such gate sets. Our theorem
applies to a wide range of stabiliser code families, including concatenated
codes and conventional topological stabiliser codes such as the surface code.
The broad applicability of our no-go theorem provides a new perspective on how
the constraints on universal fault-tolerant gate sets can be overcome. In
particular, we show how non-unitary implementations of logic gates provide a
general approach to circumvent the no-go theorem, and we present a rich

aspect of this system is that the density of electrons and holes can be
continuously tuned by an external gate voltage. This degree of freedom enables
investigation of the interplay between ferroelectricity and free carriers, a
previously unexplored regime. Here, we employ capacitive sensing in dual-gated
mesoscopic devices of bilayer WTe$_2$ to directly measure the spontaneous

the polarization in the conduction and valence bands, separately. We compare
our results to a low-energy model for the electronic bands and identify the

uncertainties in stellar evolution. 1D overshooting descriptions introduce a
free parameter ($f_{ov}$) that is in general not well constrained from
observations. Especially in small central convective regions the value is
highly uncertain due to its tight connection to the pressure scale height.
Long-term multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations can be used to study the
size of the overshooting region and the involved mixing processes. Here we show
how one can calibrate an overshooting parameter by performing 2D Maestro
simulations of Zero-Age-Main-Sequence stars ranging from $1.3$ to $3.5
M_\odot$. The simulations cover the convective cores of the stars and a large
fraction of the surrounding radiative envelope. We follow the convective flow
for at least 20 convective turnover times, while the longest simulation covers
430 turnover time scales. This allows us to study how the mixing as well as the
convective boundary evolve with time, and how the resulting entrainment can be
interpreted in terms of overshooting parameters. We find that increasing the
overshooting parameter $f_{ov}$ beyond a certain value in the initial model of
our simulations, changes the mixing behaviour completely. This result can be
used to put limits on the overshooting parameter. We find $0.010 < f_{ov} <
0.017$ to be in good agreement with our simulations of a $3.5 M_\odot$ mass
star. We also identify a diffusive mixing component due to internal gravity
waves (IGW) that is active throughout the convectively stable layer, but likely

combines two divergent length scales: One due to the bias, and the other due to

cooperative devices means identifying the optimal set of locations or
Collection Points (CP for short) to use, in the continuum between full
centralisation (i.e., all data on a single device) and full decentralisation

have the potential to enable network-wide observability of water quality
indicators, contamination event detection, and closed-loop feedback control of
WQ dynamics. To that end, prior research has investigated a wide range of
methods that guide the geographic placement of WQ sensors. These methods assign
a metric for fixed sensor placement (SP) followed by
\textit{metric-optimization} to obtain optimal SP. These metrics include
minimizing intrusion detection time, minimizing the expected population and
amount of contaminated water affected by an intrusion event. In contrast to the
literature, the objective of this paper is to provide a computational method
that considers the overlooked metric of state estimation and network-wide
observability of the WQ dynamics. This metric finds the optimal WQ sensor
placement that minimizes the state estimation error via the Kalman filter for
noisy WQ dynamics -- a metric that quantifies WDN observability. To that end,
the state-space dynamics of WQ states for an entire WDN are given and the
observability-driven sensor placement algorithm is presented. The algorithm
takes into account the time-varying nature of WQ dynamics due to changes in the
hydraulic profile -- a collection of hydraulic states including heads

profile over a certain period of time. Thorough case studies are given,

instead of using belief propagation, for both ease of implementation and
computational speed. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the
impact of using imputation instead of belief propagation on the quality of the
resulting BNs? From a simulation study using synthetic data and reference BNs,
we find that it is possible to recommend one approach over the other in several

The lacunary trigonometric sum $S_n$ is known to exhibit several properties
typical for sums of independent random variables. In this paper we initiate the
investigation of large deviation principles (LDPs) for $S_n$. Under the large
gap condition $a_{k+1}/a_k\to\infty$, we prove that $(S_n/n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$
satisfies an LDP with speed $n$ and the same rate function $\tilde{I}$ as for
sums of independent random variables with the arcsine distribution, but show
that the LDP may fail to hold when we only assume the Hadamard gap condition.
However, we prove that in the special case $a_k=q^k$ for some $q\in
\{2,3,\ldots\}$, $(S_n/n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ satisfies an LDP with speed $n$ and
a rate function $I_q$ different from $\tilde{I}$. We also show that $I_q$
converges pointwise to $\tilde I$ as $q\to\infty$ and construct a random
perturbation $(a_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$ of the sequence $(2^k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$
for which $a_{k+1}/a_k\to 2$ as $k\to\infty$, but for which
$(S_n/n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ satisfies an LDP with the rate function $\tilde{I}$
as in the independent case and not, as one might na{\""i}vely expect, with rate
function $I_2$. We relate this fact to the number of solutions of certain
Diophantine equations. Our results show that LDPs for lacunary trigonometric
sums are sensitive to the arithmetic properties of $(a_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}$.
This is particularly noteworthy since no such arithmetic effects are visible in
the central limit theorem by Salem and Zygmund or in the law of the iterated

background and perturbations) to the standard cosmological model, it is usual
to assume a $\Lambda$CDM background. This treatment is not correct and in the
era of precision cosmology could induce undesired biases in cosmological
parameters. Second, neutrino mass is usually held fixed in the analyses which
could obscure its relation to MG parameters. In a couple of previous papers we
showed that by using the Effective Fluid Approach we can accurately compute
observables in fairly general MG models. An appealing advantage of our approach
is that it allows a pretty easy implementation of this kinds of models in
Boltzmann solvers (i.e., less error--prone) while having a useful analytical
description of the effective fluid to understand the underlying physics. This
paper illustrates how an effective fluid approach can be used to carry out
proper analyses of cosmological constraints in MG models. We investigated three
MG models including the sum of neutrino masses as a varying parameter in our
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. Two models (i.e., Designer $f(R)$ [DES-fR]
and Designer Horndeski [HDES]) have a background matching $\Lambda$CDM, while
in a third model (i.e., Hu $\&$ Sawicki $f(R)$ model [HS]) the background
differs from the standard model. In this way we estimate how relevant the
background is when constraining MG parameters along with neutrinos' masses. We
implement the models in the popular Boltzmann solver CLASS and use recent,
available data (i.e., Planck 2018, CMB lensing, BAO, SNIa Pantheon compilation,
$H_0$ from SHOES, and RSD Gold-18 compilation) to compute tight cosmological
constraints in the MG parameters that account for deviation from the
$\Lambda$CDM model. [abridged]

tools of Riemannian geometry of Grassmannians as described by Absil et. al

Slater determinant that is critical point of the overlap function with a
correlated wave function. This algorithm can be applied to quantify the
entanglement or correlation of a wave function. We show that this algorithm is
equivalent to the Newton method using the standard parametrization of Slater
determinants by orbital rotations, but it can be more efficiently implemented
because the orbital basis used to express the correlated wave function is kept
fixed throughout the iterations. We present the equations of this method for a
general configuration interaction wave function and for a wave function with up
to double excitations over a reference determinant. Applications of this
algorithm to selected electronic systems are also presented and discussed.

introduces and analyzes a variant of the Frank Wolfe (FW) algorithm termed

in the step sizes, the convergence rate of ExtraFW for general convex problems
is shown to be ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{k})$, which is optimal in the sense of
matching the lower bound on the number of solved FW subproblems. However, the
merit of ExtraFW is its faster rate ${\cal O}\big(\frac{1}{k^2} \big)$ on a
class of machine learning problems. Compared with other parameter-free FW
variants that have faster rates on the same problems, ExtraFW has improved
rates and fine-grained analysis thanks to its PC update. Numerical tests on
binary classification with different sparsity-promoting constraints demonstrate
that the empirical performance of ExtraFW is significantly better than FW, and
even faster than Nesterov's accelerated gradient on certain datasets. For
matrix completion, ExtraFW enjoys smaller optimality gap, and lower rank than

good accuracy and is computationally highly efficient, we noticed that the
neural network-based corrections substantially violate the divergence freedom
of the velocity vector field. In this contribution, we discuss these findings
and analyze three approaches to address the problem: a penalty term to
encourage divergence freedom of the network output; a penalty term for the
corrected velocity field; and a network that learns the stream function, i.e.
the scalar potential of the divergence free velocity vector field and which
hence yields by construction divergence free corrections. Our experimental

that, for integer $t$ in systems with local interactions, these traces can be
re-expressed in terms of products of dual transfer matrices, each representing
a spatial slice of the system. We focus on properties of the dual transfer
matrix products as represented by a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, which we
call \textit{spectral Lyapunov exponents}. In particular, we examine the
features of this spectrum that distinguish chaotic and MBL phases. The transfer
matrices can be block-diagonalized using time-translation symmetry, and so the
spectral Lyapunov exponents are classified according to a momentum in the time
direction. For large $t$ we argue that the leading Lyapunov exponents in each
momentum sector tend to zero in the chaotic phase, while they remain finite in
the MBL phase. These conclusions are based on results from three complementary
types of calculation. We find exact results for the chaotic phase by
considering a Floquet random quantum circuit with on-site Hilbert space
dimension $q$ in the large-$q$ limit. In the MBL phase, we show that the
spectral Lyapunov exponents remain finite by systematically analyzing models of
non-interacting systems, weakly coupled systems, and local integrals of motion.
Numerically, we compute the Lyapunov exponents for a Floquet random quantum
circuit and for the kicked Ising model in the two phases. As an additional
result, we calculate exactly the higher point spectral form factors (hpSFF) in
the large-$q$ limit, and show that the generalized Thouless time scales
logarithmically in system size for all hpSFF in the large-$q$ chaotic phase.

utterances commonly required for supervised learning, usually resulting in
weeks of manual labor and high cost. In this paper, we present our results on
boosting NLU model performance through training data augmentation using a
sequential generative adversarial network (GAN). We explore data generation in
the context of two tasks, the bootstrapping of a new language and the handling
of low resource features. For both tasks we explore three sequential GAN
architectures, one with a token-level reward function, another with our own
implementation of a token-level Monte Carlo rollout reward, and a third with
sentence-level reward. We evaluate the performance of these feedback models
across several sampling methodologies and compare our results to upsampling the
original data to the same scale. We further improve the GAN model performance
through the transfer learning of the pretrained embeddings. Our experiments
reveal synthetic data generated using the sequential generative adversarial
network provides significant performance boosts across multiple metrics and can
be a major benefit to the NLU tasks.

and monitoring of many diseases. However, it is an inherently slow imaging
technique. Over the last 20 years, parallel imaging, temporal encoding and
compressed sensing have enabled substantial speed-ups in the acquisition of MRI
data, by accurately recovering missing lines of k-space data. However, clinical
uptake of vastly accelerated acquisitions has been limited, in particular in
compressed sensing, due to the time-consuming nature of the reconstructions and
unnatural looking images. Following the success of machine learning in a wide
range of imaging tasks, there has been a recent explosion in the use of machine
learning in the field of MRI image reconstruction. A wide range of approaches
have been proposed, which can be applied in k-space and/or image-space.
Promising results have been demonstrated from a range of methods, enabling
natural looking images and rapid computation. In this review article we
summarize the current machine learning approaches used in MRI reconstruction,
discuss their drawbacks, clinical applications, and current trends.

realistic and challenging problem attributable to poor outdoor scene visibility
(e.g. foggy weather). However, because most contemporary scene understanding
approaches are applied under ideal-weather conditions, such approaches may not
provide genuinely optimal performance when compared to established a priori
insights on extreme-weather understanding. In this paper, we propose a complex
but competitive multi-task learning approach capable of performing in real-time
semantic scene understanding and monocular depth estimation under foggy weather
conditions by leveraging both recent advances in adversarial training and
domain adaptation. As an end-to-end pipeline, our model provides a novel
solution to surpass degraded visibility in foggy weather conditions by
transferring scenes from foggy to normal using a GAN-based model. For optimal
performance in semantic segmentation, our model generates depth to be used as
complementary source information with RGB in the segmentation network. We
provide a robust method for foggy scene understanding by training two models
(normal and foggy) simultaneously with shared weights (each model is trained on
each weather condition independently). Our model incorporates RGB colour,
depth, and luminance images via distinct encoders with dense connectivity and
features fusing, and leverages skip connections to produce consistent depth and
segmentation predictions. Using this architectural formulation with light
computational complexity at inference time, we are able to achieve comparable
performance to contemporary approaches at a fraction of the overall model
complexity.

prefer side-by-side configurations and exhibit changes to their synchronization
mid-swimming. Using numerical simulations, alterations to the unsteady wake
dynamics imposed by abrupt changes in the phase angle between two pitching
side-by-side foils were examined at Reynolds number of 4;000 and Strouhal
number of 0:50. Four hybrid modes were considered in thisstudy with two modes
representing an abrupt phase change by pi during the 20th cycle. The other two
modes represented a simplified case of burst-and-coast swimming, in which there
was a brief (2 oscillation periods) suspension of oscillations before imposing
a change in phase angle. In all cases, the foils initially performed
out-of-phase pitching, and then they started their in-phase motion by either
performing the upstroke or down-stroke first. This kinematic change resulted in
the formation and growth of a secondary vortex street in between two primary
streets, which enabled and maintained a split wake configuration. Furthermore,
the phase switching altered the pressure levels on the top and bottom surfaces
of both foils to almost similar levels, which attributed to a reduction in the
side-force. The growth rate of the secondary vortex street remained consistent
for all four hybrid modes.

effects. The direct estimation of a function-on-function regression model is
usually an ill-posed problem. To overcome this difficulty, in practice, the
functional data that belong to the infinite-dimensional space are generally
projected into a finite-dimensional space of basis functions. The
function-on-function regression model is converted to a multivariate regression
model of the basis expansion coefficients. In the estimation phase of the
proposed method, the functional variables are approximated by a
finite-dimensional basis function expansion method. We show that the partial
least squares regression constructed via a functional response, multiple
functional predictors, and quadratic/interaction terms of the functional
predictors is equivalent to the partial least squares regression constructed
using basis expansions of functional variables. From the partial least squares
regression of the basis expansions of functional variables, we provide an
explicit formula for the partial least squares estimate of the coefficient
function of the function-on-function regression model. Because the true forms
of the models are generally unspecified, we propose a forward procedure for

  Understanding via Domain Adaptation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1909.07697",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robust semantic scene segmentation for automotive applications is a
challenging problem in two key aspects: (1) labelling every individual scene
pixel and (2) performing this task under unstable weather and illumination
changes (e.g., foggy weather), which results in poor outdoor scene visibility.
Such visibility limitations lead to non-optimal performance of generalised deep
convolutional neural network-based semantic scene segmentation. In this paper,
we propose an efficient end-to-end automotive semantic scene understanding
approach that is robust to foggy weather conditions. As an end-to-end pipeline,
our proposed approach provides: (1) the transformation of imagery from foggy to
clear weather conditions using a domain transfer approach (correcting for poor
visibility) and (2) semantically segmenting the scene using a competitive
encoder-decoder architecture with low computational complexity (enabling
real-time performance). Our approach incorporates RGB colour, depth and
luminance images via distinct encoders with dense connectivity and features
fusion to effectively exploit information from different inputs, which
contributes to an optimal feature representation within the overall model.
Using this architectural formulation with dense skip connections, our model
achieves comparable performance to contemporary approaches at a fraction of the
overall model complexity.

  Europe (DATE'21), February, 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have gained popularity owing to their practical
problem-solving capacity. However, they suffer from a serious integrity threat,
i.e., their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In the quest for DL
trustworthiness, recent works claimed the inherent robustness of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) to these attacks, without considering the variability in their
structural spiking parameters. This paper explores the security enhancement of
SNNs through internal structural parameters. Specifically, we investigate the
SNNs robustness to adversarial attacks with different values of the neuron's
firing voltage thresholds and time window boundaries. We thoroughly study SNNs
security under different adversarial attacks in the strong white-box setting,
with different noise budgets and under variable spiking parameters. Our results
show a significant impact of the structural parameters on the SNNs' security,
and promising sweet spots can be reached to design trustworthy SNNs with 85%
higher robustness than a traditional non-spiking DL system. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the impact of structural
parameters on SNNs robustness to adversarial attacks. The proposed
contributions and the experimental framework is available online to the
community for reproducible research.

imaging the local atomic structure of materials. TEM has been used heavily in
studies of defect structures of 2D materials such as monolayer graphene due to
its high dose efficiency. However, phase contrast imaging can produce complex
nonlinear contrast, even for weakly-scattering samples. It is therefore
difficult to develop fully-automated analysis routines for phase contrast TEM
studies using conventional image processing tools. For automated analysis of
large sample regions of graphene, one of the key problems is segmentation
between the structure of interest and unwanted structures such as surface
contaminant layers. In this study, we compare the performance of a conventional
Bragg filtering method to a deep learning routine based on the U-Net
architecture. We show that the deep learning method is more general, simpler to
apply in practice, and produces more accurate and robust results than the
conventional algorithm. We provide easily-adaptable source code for all results
in this paper, and discuss potential applications for deep learning in
fully-automated TEM image analysis.

numerical solver for modeling wave interaction with oscillating wave energy
converter (OWSC). The key idea is to couple SPHinXsys, an open-source
multi-physics library in unified smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH)
framework, with Simbody which presents an object-oriented Application
Programming Interface (API) for multi-body dynamics. More precisely, the wave
dynamics and its interaction with OWSC is resolved by Riemann-based
weakly-compressible SPH method using SPHinXsys, and the solid-body kinematics
is computed by Simbody library. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solver can accurately predict the wave elevations, flap rotation and
wave loading on the flap in comparison with laboratory experiment. In
particularly, the new solver shows optimized computational performance through
CPU cost analysis and comparison with commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT
and other SPH-based solvers in literature. Furthermore, a linear damper is
applied for imitating the power take-off (PTO) system to study its effects on
the hydrodynamics properties of OWSC and efficiency of energy harvesting. In
addition, the present solver is used to model extreme wave condition using the
focused wave approach to investigate the extreme loads and motions of OWSC
under such extreme wave conditions. It worth noting that though the model
validation used herein is a bottom hinged oscillating Wave Energy Converter
(WEC), the obtained numerical results show promising potential of the proposed
solver to future applications in the design of high-performance WECs.

between utility and privacy is a key challenge in federated learning and
analytics. In this work, we introduce a novel relaxation of local differential
privacy (LDP) that naturally arises in fully decentralized algorithms, i.e.,
when participants exchange information by communicating along the edges of a
network graph without central coordinator. This relaxation, that we call
network DP, captures the fact that users have only a local view of the system.
To show the relevance of network DP, we study a decentralized model of
computation where a token performs a walk on the network graph and is updated
sequentially by the party who receives it. For tasks such as real summation,
histogram computation and optimization with gradient descent, we propose simple
algorithms on ring and complete topologies. We prove that the privacy-utility
trade-offs of our algorithms under network DP significantly improve upon what
is achievable under LDP, and often match the utility of the trusted curator
model. Our results show for the first time that formal privacy gains can be
obtained from full decentralization. We also provide experiments to illustrate
the improved utility of our approach for decentralized training with stochastic

  This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings and

a challenging constrained planning problem because of the complex dependency
among decisions for different video frames and the bitrate constraint defined
at the end of the episode.
  We formulate the rate control problem as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP), and apply imitation learning to learn a neural rate

trajectories obtained through evolution strategies, our learned policy achieves
better encoding efficiency and has minimal constraint violation. In addition to
imitating the optimal actions, we find that additional auxiliary losses, data

learning a good rate control policy. We evaluate the learned policy against the

allows queries to be performed in superposition--is required for the
implementation of numerous quantum algorithms. While naive implementations of
QRAM are highly susceptible to decoherence and hence not scalable, it has been
argued that the bucket brigade QRAM architecture [Giovannetti et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 100 160501 (2008)] is highly resilient to noise, with the infidelity
of a query scaling only logarithmically with the memory size. In prior
analyses, however, this favorable scaling followed directly from the use of
contrived noise models, thus leaving open the question of whether experimental
implementations would actually enjoy the purported scaling advantage. In this
work, we study the effects of decoherence on QRAM in full generality. Our main
result is a proof that this favorable infidelity scaling holds for arbitrary
error channels (including, e.g., depolarizing noise and coherent errors). Our
proof identifies the origin of this noise resilience as the limited
entanglement among the memory's components, and it also reveals that
significant architectural simplifications can be made while preserving the
noise resilience. We verify these results numerically using a novel classical
algorithm for the efficient simulation of noisy QRAM circuits. Our findings
indicate that QRAM can be implemented with existing hardware in realistically
noisy devices, and that high-fidelity queries are possible without quantum
error correction. Furthermore, we also prove that the benefits of the
bucket-brigade architecture persist when quantum error correction is used, in

receptive areas. Next, the raw images are resampled to various resolutions to
introduce variations in the receptive fields that are used for independently
optimizing different forms of DilationNet scaled for different resolutions of
images. Afterward, a feature fusion scheme is introduced with the proposed
DeepFusionNet architecture for jointly optimizing the feature space of these
individually trained networks operating on different levels of observations.
All the convolutional layers of various forms of DilationNets that are
optimized to extract spatial features from different resolutions of images are
directly transferred to provide a variegated feature space from any image.
Later, joint optimization of these spatial features is carried out in the
DeepFusionNet to extract the most relevant representation of the sample image.
This scheme offers the opportunity to explore the feature space extensively by
varying the observation level to accurately diagnose the abnormality. Intense
experimentations on a publicly available dataset show outstanding performance
with accuracy over 99.5% outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.

years and have become a future trend. It is an important aspect of user
experience to know the Remaining Charging Time (RCT) of an EV with confidence.
However, it is difficult to find an algorithm that accurately estimates the RCT
for vehicles in the current EV market. The maximum RCT estimation error of the
Tesla Model X can be as high as 60 minutes from a 10 % to 99 % state-of-charge
(SOC) while charging at direct current (DC). A highly accurate RCT estimation
algorithm for electric vehicles is in high demand and will continue to be as
EVs become more popular. There are currently two challenges to arriving at an
accurate RCT estimate. First, most commercial chargers cannot provide requested
charging currents during a constant current (CC) stage. Second, it is hard to
predict the charging current profile in a constant voltage (CV) stage. To
address the first issue, this study proposes an RCT algorithm that updates the
charging accuracy online in the CC stage by considering the confidence interval
between the historical charging accuracy and real-time charging accuracy data.
To solve the second issue, this study proposes a battery resistance prediction
model to predict charging current profiles in the CV stage, using a Radial
Basis Function (RBF) neural network (NN). The test results demonstrate that the
RCT algorithm proposed in this study achieves an error rate improvement of 73.6
% and 84.4 % over the traditional method in the CC and CV stages, respectively.

Despite many advances in the microscopic understanding of the ordered states, a

collective excitations influence the electronic order formation? Here, we
experimentally show that a phonon affects the spin density wave (SDW) formation
after an SDW-quench by femtosecond laser pulses. In a thin film, the
temperature-dependent SDW period is quantized, allowing us to track the
out-of-equilibrium formation path of the SDW precisely. By exploiting its
persistent coupling to the lattice, we probe the SDW through the transient
lattice distortion, measured by femtosecond X-ray diffraction. We find that
within 500 femtoseconds after a complete quench, the SDW forms with the
low-temperature period, directly bypassing a thermal state with the
high-temperature period. We argue that a momentum-matched phonon launched by
the quench changes the formation path of the SDW through the dynamic pinning of
the order parameter.

in a quantum field theory model of neutrino oscillations, paying close
attention to unitarity requirements. From the probabilities of lepton number
violating processes obtained in this way, we derive a source term for the time
evolution of the lepton asymmetry. The source term has contributions that can
be identified with CP violation from mixing, oscillations and interference
between both. Given that this source term does not involve processes with
unstable particles in the initial or final states, neither does it require to
calculate number densities of neutrinos, no subtraction of real intermediate
states must be performed. In equilibrium the source term is null, as demanded
by unitarity and CPT invariance, due to a cancellation between the terms coming
from CP violation in mixing and oscillations. The calculations are done in a
simple scalar toy model, and the resummed propagator is diagonalized at first
order in the decay widths over the mass difference. We also comment on the
effect of the interference term, which is mild at the order we work, but seems

Particle rotations, in contrast, are much less sensitive to confinement
effects, while still sensitive to the mechanics of the packing. So far, little

of athermal amorphous packings. We demonstrate through experimental
measurements that particle packing mechanics can be directly linked to the
rotational motion of even round particles in a sheared packing. Our results

Schmidt law can be fitted with a single power law with slope $n = 1.5\pm0.05$
(including fitting method uncertainties), somewhat steeper than the value $n =
1.4\pm0.15$ found by K98. Fitting separate power laws to the non-starbursting

1.34\pm0.07$ and $0.98\pm0.07$, respectively), with a pronounced offset in the
zeropoint ($\sim$0.6\,dex) of the starburst relation to higher SFR surface
densities. This offset is seen even when a common conversion factor between CO
intensity and molecular hydrogen surface density is applied, and is confirmed
when disk surface densities of interstellar dust are used as proxies for gas
measurements. Tests for possible systematic biases in the starburst data fail
to uncover any spurious sources for such a large offset. We tentatively
conclude that the global Schmidt law in galaxies, at least as it is
conventionally measured, is bimodal or possibly multi-modal. Possible causes

boundary of absolute refractoriness is determined solely by the fast-time

the slow inactivation variable of the sodium current ahead of the propagating

making important decisions, such as whether to release criminal defendants
before trial. Policymakers assert that providing public servants with
algorithmic advice will improve human risk predictions and thereby lead to
better (e.g., fairer) decisions. Yet because many policy decisions require
balancing risk-reduction with competing goals, improving the accuracy of
predictions may not necessarily improve the quality of decisions. If risk
assessments make people more attentive to reducing risk at the expense of other
values, these algorithms would diminish the implementation of public policy
even as they lead to more accurate predictions. Through an experiment with
2,140 lay participants simulating two high-stakes government contexts, we
provide the first direct evidence that risk assessments can systematically
alter how people factor risk into their decisions. These shifts counteracted
the potential benefits of improved prediction accuracy. In the pretrial setting
of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more sensitive to
increases in perceived risk; this shift increased the racial disparity in
pretrial detention by 1.9%. In the government loans setting of our experiment,
the risk assessment made participants more risk-averse; this shift reduced
government aid by 8.3%. These results demonstrate the potential limits and
harms of attempts to improve public policy by incorporating predictive
algorithms into multifaceted policy decisions. If these observed behaviors
occur in practice, presenting risk assessments to public servants would
generate unexpected and unjust shifts in public policy without being subject to
democratic deliberation or oversight.

and employed in applications with success. A lot of problems in applications
are defined on bounded intervals or domains. Therefore, it is important in both
theory and application to construct all possible wavelets on intervals with
some desired properties from (bi)orthogonal (multi)wavelets on the real line.
Vanishing moments of compactly supported wavelets are the key property for
sparse wavelet representations and are closely linked to polynomial
reproduction of their underlying refinable (vector) functions. Boundary
wavelets with low order vanishing moments often lead to undesired boundary
artifacts as well as reduced sparsity and approximation orders near boundaries
in applications. From any arbitrarily given compactly supported (bi)orthogonal
multiwavelet on the real line, in this paper we propose two different
approaches to construct/derive all possible locally supported (bi)orthogonal
(multi)wavelets on $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$ with or without prescribed vanishing
moments, polynomial reproduction, and/or homogeneous boundary conditions. The
first approach generalizes the classical approach from scalar wavelets to
multiwavelets, while the second approach is direct without explicitly involving
any dual refinable functions and dual multiwavelets. (Multi)wavelets on
intervals satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions will also be addressed.
Though constructing orthogonal (multi)wavelets on intervals is much easier than
their biorthogonal counterparts, we show that some boundary orthogonal wavelets
cannot have any vanishing moments if these orthogonal (multi)wavelets on
intervals satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Several
examples of orthogonal and biorthogonal multiwavelets on the interval $[0,1]$
will be provided to illustrate our construction approaches and proposed
algorithms.

significant portion of the lymphatic vasculature and are divided by valves into
contractile segments known as lymphangions. Despite its importance, lymphatic
transport in collecting vessels is not well understood. We present a
computational model to study lymph flow through chains of valved, contracting
lymphangions. We used the Navier-Stokes equations to model the fluid flow and
the immersed boundary method to handle the two-way, fluid-structure interaction
in 2D, non-axisymmetric simulations. We used our model to evaluate the effects
of chain length, contraction style, and adverse axial pressure difference
(AAPD) on cycle-mean flow rates (CMFRs). In the model, longer lymphangion
chains generally yield larger CMFRs, and they fail to generate positive CMFRs
at higher AAPDs than shorter chains. Simultaneously contracting pumps generate
the largest CMFRs at nearly every AAPD and for every chain length. Due to the
contraction timing and valve dynamics, non-simultaneous pumps generate lower
CMFRs than the simultaneous pumps; the discrepancy diminishes as the AAPD
increases. Valve dynamics vary with the contraction style and exhibit
hysteretic opening and closing behaviors. Our model provides insight into how
contraction propagation affects flow rates and transport through a lymphangion
chain.

open quantum systems as nonunitary effective field theories that are not

introduce a general Keldysh action that maximally obeys Weinbergian
constraints, including locality, Poincar\'e invariance, and two ""$CPT$""
constraints: complete positivity and trace preserving as well as charge,
parity, and time reversal symmetry. We find that the perturbative Lindblad term
responsible for driven-dissipative dynamics introduced therein has the natural
form of a double-trace deformation $\mathcal{O}^2$, which, in the large $N$
limit, possibly leads to a new nonthermal conformal fixed point. This fixed
point is IR when $\Delta<d/2$ or UV when $\Delta>d/2$ given $d$ the dimensions
of spacetime and $\Delta$ the scaling dimension of $\mathcal{O}$. Such a UV
fixed point being not forbidden by Weinbergian constraints may suggest its
existence and even completion of itself, in contrast to the common sense that
dissipation effects are always IR relevant. This observation implies that
driven-dissipative dynamics is much richer than thermodynamics, differing in
not only its noncompliance with thermodynamic symmetry (e.g., the
fluctuation-dissipation relation) but its UV/IR relevance as well. Examples
including a $(0+1)$-$d$ harmonic oscillator under continuous measurement and a

operation field, the path recommender system adopts B-spline curves and
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine a collision-free path
curve with translational velocity constraint. The provided optimal reference
path feeds into the trajectory tracking controller enabling Kian-I to navigate
autonomously in the operating field. The trajectory tracking module eliminate
the error between the desired path and the followed trajectory through
controlling the wheels' velocity. To assess the feasibility of the proposed
control architecture, the performance of Kian-I robot in autonomous navigation
from any arbitrary initial pose to a target of interest is evaluated through

the ordering temperature of 115 K in $T^{\prime}$-type La$_2$CuO$_4$ (LCO)

data are freely available and usually trained together to reduce the domain
gap. However, considering the data privacy and the inefficiency of data
transmission, it is impractical in real scenarios. Hence, it draws our eyes to
optimize the network in the target domain without accessing labeled source
data. To explore this direction in object detection, for the first time, we
propose a source data-free domain adaptive object detection (SFOD) framework
via modeling it into a problem of learning with noisy labels. Generally, a
straightforward method is to leverage the pre-trained network from the source
domain to generate the pseudo labels for target domain optimization. However,
it is difficult to evaluate the quality of pseudo labels since no labels are
available in target domain. In this paper, self-entropy descent (SED) is a
metric proposed to search an appropriate confidence threshold for reliable
pseudo label generation without using any handcrafted labels. Nonetheless,
completely clean labels are still unattainable. After a thorough experimental
analysis, false negatives are found to dominate in the generated noisy labels.
Undoubtedly, false negatives mining is helpful for performance improvement, and
we ease it to false negatives simulation through data augmentation like Mosaic.
Extensive experiments conducted in four representative adaptation tasks have
demonstrated that the proposed framework can easily achieve state-of-the-art
performance. From another view, it also reminds the UDA community that the
labeled source data are not fully exploited in the existing methods.

presence of connected and automated vehicles. First a centralized platoon-based
controller is proposed for the cooperative intersection management problem that
takes advantage of the platooning systems and V2I communication to generate
fast and smooth traffic flow at a single intersection.
  Second, a data-driven approach is proposed for adaptive signal control in the
presence of connected vehicles. The proposed system relies on a data-driven
method for optimal signal timing and a data-driven heuristic method for
estimating routing decisions. It requires no additional sensors to be installed
at the intersection, reducing the installation costs compared to typical
settings of state-of-the-practice adaptive signal controllers.
  The proposed traffic controller contains an optimal signal timing module and
a traffic state estimator. The signal timing module is a neural network model
trained on microscopic simulation data to achieve optimal results according to
a given performance metric such as vehicular delay or average queue length. The
traffic state estimator relies on connected vehicles' information to estimate
the traffic's routing decisions. A heuristic method is proposed to minimize the
estimation error. With sufficient parameter tuning, the estimation error
decreases as the market penetration rate (MPR) of connected vehicles grows.
Estimation error is below 30% for an MPR of 10% and it shrinks below 20% when
MPR grows larger than 30%.
  Simulations showed that the proposed traffic controller outperforms Highway
Capacity Manual's methodology and given proper offline parameter tuning, it can
decrease average vehicular delay by up to 25%.

vectorial representations of text in high dimension and return a text based

fixed global sensitivity which leads to too much noise added in dense spaces

force with a local $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry. Dark Matter (DM) and its potential
interactions with the Standard Model (SM) continue to present a rich framework
for model building. In the case of thermal DM of a mass between a few MeV and a
few GeV, a compelling and much-explored framework is that of a dark
photon/vector portal, which posits a new $U(1)$ ""dark photon"" which only
couples to the SM via small kinetic mixing (KM) with the SM hypercharge. This
mixing can be mediated at the one-loop level by portal matter (PM) fields which
are charged under both the dark $U(1)$ and the SM gauge group. In earlier work,
one of the authors has noted that models with appropriate portal matter content
to produce finite and calculable kinetic mixing can arise from non-minimal dark
sectors, in which the dark $U(1)$ is a subgroup of a larger gauge symmetry
under which SM particles might have non-trivial representations. We expand on
this idea here by constructing a model in which in which the dark $U(1)$ is

flavor symmetry. The full dark/flavor symmetry group is $SU(4)_F \times
U(1)_F$, incorporating the local $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry with PM appearing as a
vector-like ""fourth generation"" to supplement the three generations of the SM.
To ensure finite contributions to KM, the SM gauge group is arranged into
Pati-Salam multiplets. The new extended dark gauge group presents a variety of
interesting experimental signatures, including non-trivial consequences of the
flavor symmetry being unified with the dark sector.

stellar dynamo and its relationship with stellar properties, as well as
allowing us to place the Sun's magnetism in the context of other stars. Only 61
Cyg A (K5V) and $\tau$ Boo (F8V) are currently known to have magnetic cycles
like the Sun's, where the large-scale magnetic field polarity reverses in phase
with the star's chromospheric activity cycles. ${\tau}$ Boo has a rapid
$\sim$240 d magnetic cycle, and it is not yet clear whether this is related to
the star's thin convection zone or if the dynamo is accelerated by interactions
between ${\tau}$ Boo and its hot Jupiter. To shed light on this, we studied the
magnetic activity of HD75332 (F7V) which has similar physical properties to
${\tau}$ Boo and does not appear to host a hot Jupiter. We characterized its
long term chromospheric activity variability over 53 yrs and used Zeeman
Doppler Imaging to reconstruct the large-scale surface magnetic field for 12
epochs between 2007 and 2019. Although we observe only one reversal of the
large-scale magnetic dipole, our results suggest that HD75332 has a rapid
$\sim$1.06 yr solar-like magnetic cycle where the magnetic field evolves in
phase with its chromospheric activity. If a solar-like cycle is present,
reversals of the large-scale radial field polarity are expected to occur at
around activity cycle maxima. This would be similar to the rapid magnetic cycle
observed for ${\tau}$ Boo, suggesting that rapid magnetic cycles may be
intrinsic to late-F stars and related to their shallow convection zones.

representation layers between low-level geometric feature extraction and
high-level semantic shape analysis; This allows the identification of each
compressed semantic function and the formation of a valid shape classifier from
different feature extraction levels. The proposed latent framework makes soft
object representation more generic (independent from the object's geometry and
its mechanical properties) and scalable (it can work with 1D/2D/3D tasks). Its
high-level semantic layer enables to perform (quasi) shape planning tasks with
soft objects, a valuable and underexplored capability in many soft manipulation
tasks. To validate this new methodology, we report a detailed experimental

Three main results are established concerning the latter pairs $(Y,D)$. First,
adapting work of Hein, we prove the existence of a complete Calabi-Yau metric
on $Y\setminus D$ asymptotic to a (generically non-standard) semi-flat metric
in every K\""ahler class. Secondly, we prove an optimal uniqueness theorem to

a finite dimensional K\""ahler moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics on $Y\setminus

conjecture of Yau in this setting. Thirdly, we prove that $Y\setminus D$

admits a special Lagrangian fibration whenever the de Rham cohomology class of
$\omega_{CY}$ is not topologically obstructed. Combining these results we

synthesizing constraints from radial velocity and transit surveys
simultaneously. We employ approximate Bayesian computation and various
mass-radius (M-R) relations to explore the population models describing these
surveys, both separately and in a joint fit. Using this approach, we fit a
planet distribution function of the form $d^{2} N/d\log{P}d\log{M} \propto
P^{\beta} M^{\alpha}$, with a break in the power law in mass at $M_{b}$, to
planets orbiting FGK stars with periods $P = [25, 200]$ days and masses $M =
[2, 50] M_{\oplus}$. We find that the M-R relation from Otegi et al. (2020),
which lets rocky and volatile-rich populations overlap in mass, allows us to
find a model that is consistent with both types of surveys. Our joint fit gives
$M_{b} = 21.6_{-3.2}^{+2.5} M_{\oplus}$ (errors reflect 68.3% credible
interval). This is nearly a factor of three higher than the break from
transit-only considerations and an M-R relation without such an overlap. The
corresponding planet-star mass ratio break $q_{b} \sim 7\times10^{-5}$ may be
consistent with microlensing studies ($q_b \sim 6\times10^{-5} -
2\times10^{-4}$). The joint fit also requires that a fraction of
$F_{\text{rocky}} = 0.63_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ planets in the overlap region belong
to the rocky population. Our results strongly suggest that future M-R relations

charged AdS black hole in GB gravity based on the free energy landscape. Below
the critical temperature, the free energy landscape topography has the shape of
double basins with each representing one stable/unstable black hole phase. The
thermodynamic small/large black hole phase transition is determined by the
equal depths of the basins. We also demonstrate the underlying kinetics of the
phase transition by studying the time evolution of the probability distribution
of the state in the ensemble as well as the MFPT and the kinetic fluctuation of
the state switching process caused by the thermal fluctuations. The final
distribution is determined by the Boltzmann law and the MFPT and its
fluctuation are closely related to the free energy landscape topography through
barrier heights and ensemble temperature. Furthermore, we provide a complete
description of the kinetics of phase transition with different physical
parameters. The free energy is the result of the delicate balance and
competition between the two relatively large numbers, the energy and entropy
multiplied by temperature. Low energy and low entropy can give rise to a stable
thermodynamic state in terms of free energy minimum (energy/mass preferred)
while the high energy and high entropy can also give rise to a stable state in
terms of free energy minimum. When the GB coupling constant increases, or the
electric charge (potential) increases, or the pressure (absolute value of
cosmological constant) decreases, it is easier for the small black hole state
to escape to the large black hole state. Meanwhile, the inverse process becomes
harder, i.e. the small (large) black hole state becomes less (more) stable.

entanglement islands and a phase transition in the entanglement surface, but
our results differ significantly from work in AdS/CFT in three major ways: (1)
the late-time entropy decreases in time, (2) island degrees of freedom exist at
all times, and not just at late times, with the phase transition changing
whether or not these degrees of freedom include the black hole interior, and
(3) the physics involves a field-theoretic IR divergence, emerging when the
boundary interval is too big relative to the black hole's inverse temperature.

two causes of performance degradation. One is the reduction of annotated

The first cause has less impact than the second one and can be mitigated by
adopting pretraining language models. The second cause seriously misguides a

observations, we propose a general approach, which can almost eliminate the
misguidance brought by unlabeled entities. The key idea is to use negative
sampling that, to a large extent, avoids training NER models with unlabeled

cost of oscillatory wing motion by using elastic elements for energy storage
and return. Insects possess highly resilient elastic regions in their flight
anatomy that may enable high dynamic efficiency. However, recent experiments
highlight losses due to damping in the insect thorax that could reduce the
benefit of those elastic elements. We performed experiments on, and simulations
of a dynamically-scaled robophysical flapping model with an elastic element and
biologically-relevant structural damping to elucidate the roles of body
mechanics, aerodynamics, and actuation in spring-wing energetics. We measured
oscillatory flapping wing dynamics and energetics subject to a range of
actuation parameters, system inertia, and spring elasticity. To generalize
these results, we derive the non-dimensional spring-wing equation of motion and
present variables that describe the resonance properties of flapping systems:
$N$, a measure of the relative influence of inertia and aerodynamics, and
$\hat{K}$, the reduced stiffness. We show that internal damping scales with
$N$, revealing that dynamic efficiency monotonically decreases with increasing
$N$. Based on these results, we introduce a general framework for understanding
the roles of internal damping, aerodynamic and inertial forces, and elastic

significance in industrial applications such as call centers, social robots and

recognition can improve the feedback efficiency and the quality of service.
Thus, the speech emotion recognition has been attracted much attention in both
industry and academic. Since emotions existing in an entire utterance may have
varied probabilities, speech emotion is likely to be ambiguous, which poses
great challenges to recognition tasks. However, previous studies commonly
assigned a single-label or multi-label to each utterance in certain. Therefore,
their algorithms result in low accuracies because of the inappropriate
representation. Inspired by the optimally interacting theory, we address the
ambiguous speech emotions by proposing a novel multi-classifier interactive
learning (MCIL) method. In MCIL, multiple different classifiers first mimic
several individuals, who have inconsistent cognitions of ambiguous emotions,
and construct new ambiguous labels (the emotion probability distribution).
Then, they are retrained with the new labels to interact with their cognitions.
This procedure enables each classifier to learn better representations of
ambiguous data from others, and further improves the recognition ability. The
experiments on three benchmark corpora (MAS, IEMOCAP, and FAU-AIBO) demonstrate
that MCIL does not only improve each classifier's performance, but also raises
their recognition consistency from moderate to substantial.

fact that bipartite graphs are widely used in various application domains. Most
previous methods, which adopt random walk-based or reconstruction-based
objectives, are typically effective to learn local graph structures. However,
the global properties of bipartite graph, including community structures of
homogeneous nodes and long-range dependencies of heterogeneous nodes, are not
well preserved. In this paper, we propose a bipartite graph embedding called
BiGI to capture such global properties by introducing a novel local-global
infomax objective. Specifically, BiGI first generates a global representation
which is composed of two prototype representations. BiGI then encodes sampled
edges as local representations via the proposed subgraph-level attention
mechanism. Through maximizing the mutual information between local and global
representations, BiGI enables nodes in bipartite graph to be globally relevant.
Our model is evaluated on various benchmark datasets for the tasks of top-K
recommendation and link prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiGI
achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines. Detailed analyses verify the high effectiveness of modeling the
global properties of bipartite graph.

an electromagnetic field drive, both circularly and linearly polarized light
and map it onto a Floquet $t$-$J$ model. We explore conditions on the drive
under which one can induce superconductivity (SC) in the system. We study the
Floquet $t$-$J$ model within the mean-field theory in the singlet pairing
channel and explore superconductivity for small doping in the system using the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. We uncover several superconducting phases, which
break lattice or time reversal symmetries in addition to the standard $U(1)$
symmetry. We show that the unconventional chiral SC order parameter ($d \pm
id$) can be driven to a nematic SC order parameter ($s+d$) in the presence of a
circularly polarized light. The $d+id$ SC order parameter breaks time reversal
symmetry and is topologically nontrivial, and supports chiral edge modes. We
further show that the three-fold nematic degeneracy can be lifted using
linearly polarized light. Our work, therefore, provides a generic framework for
inducing and controlling SC in the Hubbard honeycomb model, with possible
application to graphene and other two-dimensional materials.

implemented VLN tasks on continuous environments or physical robots, all of
which use a fixed camera configuration due to the limitations of datasets, such

real-life robots with different purposes have multiple camera configurations,
and the huge gap in visual information makes it difficult to directly transfer
the learned navigation model between various robots. In this paper, we propose
a visual perception generalization strategy based on meta-learning, which
enables the agent to fast adapt to a new camera configuration with a few shots.
In the training phase, we first locate the generalization problem to the visual
perception module, and then compare two meta-learning algorithms for better
generalization in seen and unseen environments. One of them uses the
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm that requires a few shot
adaptation, and the other refers to a metric-based meta-learning method with a
feature-wise affine transformation layer. The experiment results show that our
strategy successfully adapts the learned navigation model to a new camera

Many studies have shown machine learning models to be effective at detecting
lung nodules from chest X-ray images. However, these techniques have yet to be
embraced by the medical community due to several practical, ethical, and
regulatory constraints stemming from the black-box nature of deep learning
models. Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-ray are benign;
therefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection
cannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns,
this study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based
computer vision model which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as
interpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is
trained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers
associated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker
scores for chest X-ray images from two, independent data sets for which
malignancy metadata is available. We mine multi-variate predictive models by
fitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and
interrogate a range of metrics to determine the best model. Our best decision
tree model achieves sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0% respectively
with a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this

regression estimators, no extra regularization step is required by our proposed
estimator. Although, this estimator is initially designed to work with random

the electronic properties of single crystalline, SmBi employing varied state of

an antiferromagnetic order with a Neel temperature of ~ 9 K and a second

known that it is $\#P$-hard to compute this same quantity to within $2^{-n^2}$

paper included an elegant polynomial time algorithm for this estimation task
restricted to 2D circuits, which makes a novel use of 1D Matrix Product States
(MPS) carefully tailored to the 2D geometry of the circuit in question.
Surprisingly, it is not clear that it is possible to extend this use of MPS to
address the case of 3D circuits in polynomial time. This raises a natural
question as to whether the computational complexity of the 3D problem might be
drastically higher than that of the 2D problem. In this work we address this

  Our algorithm has a Divide-and-Conquer structure, demonstrating how to
approximate the desired quantity via several instantiations of the same problem

the original. This division step is then applied recursively, expressing the
original quantity as a weighted combination of smaller and smaller 3D-local

planets. Finally, the distance from the injected supernovae and Cr isotopic
compositions of the presolar grains were investigated in terms of the estimated
formation region of CCs. In our results, a plausible formation region of four

process, which can be implemented either with direct matrix inversion or with

been known to exhibit an unusually low thermal conductivity that makes them
very attractive thermoelectric materials. An apparently unrelated fact is that
the excitonic bandgap in these materials increases with temperature, whereas
for most semiconductors one observes the opposite trend. These two anomalous
features are also seen in a very different class of photovoltaic materials,
namely the halide-perovskites such as CsPbBr3. It has been previously proposed
that emphanisis, a local symmetry-breaking phenomenon, is the one common origin
of these unusual features. Discovered a decade ago, emphanisis is the name
given to the observed displacement of the lead or the tin ions from their cubic
symmetry ground state to a locally distorted phase at high temperature. This
phenomenon has been puzzling because it is unusual for the high-temperature
state to be of a lower symmetry than the degenerate ground state. Motivated by
the celebrated vibration-inversion resonance of the ammonia molecule, we
propose a quantum tunneling-based model for emphanisis where decoherence is
responsible for the local symmetry breaking with increasing temperature. From
the analytic expression of the temperature dependence of the tunnel splitting
(which serves as an order parameter), we provide three-parameter fitting
formulae which capture the observed temperature dependence of the ionic
displacements as well as the anomalous increase of the excitonic bandgap in all
the relevant materials.

for use in electronics, optoelectronics, flexible devices, etc. because they
are ultrathin and cover a wide range of properties. Among all methods to
prepare 2D materials, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is promising because it
produces materials with a high quality and reasonable cost. So far, much
efforts have been made to produce 2D compound materials with large domain size,
controllable number of layers, fast-growth rate, and high quality features,
etc. However, due to the complicated growth mechanism like sublimation and
diffusion processes of multiple precursors, maintaining the controllability,
repeatability, and high quality of CVD grown 2D binary and ternary materials is
still a big challenge, which prevents their widespread use. Here, taking 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) as examples, we review current
progress and highlight some promising growth strategies for the growth of 2D
compound materials. The key technology issues which affect the CVD process,
including non-metal precursor, metal precursor, substrate engineering,
temperature, and gas flow, are discussed. Also, methods in improving the
quality of CVD-grown 2D materials and current understanding on their growth
mechanism are highlighted. Finally, challenges and opportunities in this field
are proposed. We believe this review will guide the future design of
controllable CVD systems for the growth of 2D compound materials with good
controllability and high quality, laying the foundations for their potential
applications.

extraction from CPGs to reduce the gap and turn the latest research findings

four classes such as condition-action, condition-consequences, action, and
not-applicable based on the information presented in a sentence. We use deep
learning with state-of-the-art word embedding, improved word vectors technique

progress to tackle the problem of fake news detection. However, training an
effective deep learning model usually requires a large amount of labeled news,
while it is expensive and time-consuming to provide sufficient labeled news in
actual applications. To improve the detection performance of fake news, we take
advantage of the event correlations of news and propose an event correlation
filtering method (ECFM) for fake news detection, mainly consisting of the news
characterizer, the pseudo label annotator, the event credibility updater, and
the news entropy selector. The news characterizer is responsible for extracting
textual features from news, which cooperates with the pseudo label annotator to
assign pseudo labels for unlabeled news by fully exploiting the event
correlations of news. In addition, the event credibility updater employs
adaptive Kalman filter to weaken the credibility fluctuations of events. To
further improve the detection performance, the news entropy selector
automatically discovers high-quality samples from pseudo labeled news by
quantifying their news entropy. Finally, ECFM is proposed to integrate them to
detect fake news in an event correlation filtering manner. Extensive
experiments prove that the explainable introduction of the event correlations
of news is beneficial to improve the detection performance of fake news.

to identify undiagnosed COPD, especially in specific groups at risk, such as
those with sleep disorder breathing. To our knowledge, no research has looked
at the feasibility of COPD diagnosis from the nocturnal oximetry time series.
Approach: We hypothesize that patients with COPD will exert certain patterns
and/or dynamics of their overnight oximetry time series that are unique to this
condition. We introduce a novel approach to nocturnal COPD diagnosis using 44
oximetry digital biomarkers and 5 demographic features and assess its
performance in a population sample at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. A

behavior in twisted bilayer graphene, we revisit graphene's honeycomb lattice
doped close to the van Hove singularity, using the truncated unity functional
renormalization group approach. We consider an extended Hubbard model on the
honeycomb lattice including on-site and nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions,
and nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange and pair hopping interactions. By
varying the strength of the nearest-neighbor exchange coupling and Coulomb
repulsion as free parameters, we present rich ground-state phase diagrams which
contain the spin-triplet $f$-wave and spin-singlet chiral $d$-wave
superconducting phases, the commensurate and incommensurate spin- and
charge-density-wave phases, and the ferromagnetic phase. In the absence of the
exchange coupling and for small value of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, the
four-sublattice spin-density-wave phase is generated right around the van Hove
filling, while the chiral $d$-wave superconductivity emerges slightly away from
it. Surprisingly, the chiral $d$-wave superconductivity is strongly suppressed
by weak nearest-neighbor exchange coupling in our calculations. We argue that
this suppression might be one of the reasons why the chiral superconductivity
proposed for doped graphene has not yet been observed experimentally.

in tapered circular and rectangular channels assuming the flow in channels
fully developed. In the model, we take into account the inertance and dynamic
pressure terms. The model can be used for a wide range of flows: from the pure
capillary flow regime, where the capillary forces are the main driver of the
liquid in the channel, to the external pressure flow regime where the external
pressure applied to the liquid at the entrance to the channel is much larger
than the capillary pressure in the channel, so that the capillary force can be
ignored. We apply the model to rectangular Y-shape junctions, where the base
channel is connected to a reservoir and the end channels are exposed to
atmospheric air. We show that, in asymmetric Y-shape junctions, there can be a
time of meniscus arrest, where only one of the two channels with a smaller
radius fills, and, the other one, with a larger radius, is arrested. The time
of meniscus arrest decreases with an increase in the applied external pressure;
when this pressure becomes large enough, the meniscus arrest disappears.
However, if the ratio of the radii of the end channels is large, the meniscus
arrest does not appear because the flow resistance in the channel with the
smaller radius is much large than in the channel with the larger radius so that
the initial flow in the wider channel cannot be stopped by the differences in
the surface tension pressures in these channels. In this article, we also
investigate the applicability of the fully developed flow approximation assumed
in the model.

segmentation, which captures the local contexts by utilizing all proposals. In
the spatial graph, we treat object proposals of a frame as nodes and represent
their correlations with an edge weight strategy for mask context aggregation.
To capture temporal information from previous frames, we use a memory network
to refine the mask of current frame by retrieving historic masks in a temporal
graph. The joint use of both local patch details and temporal relationships
allow us to better address the challenges such as object occlusion and missing.
Without online learning and fine-tuning, our STG-Net achieves state-of-the-art

Even more, metabolic networks have a broader impact that ranges from resolution
of ecosystems to personalized medicine.The analysis of metabolic networks is a
computational geometry oriented field as one of the main operations they depend
on is sampling uniformly points from polytopes; the latter provides a
representation of the steady states of the metabolic networks. However, the
polytopes that result from biological data are of very high dimension (to the
order of thousands) and in most, if not all, the cases are considerably skinny.
Therefore, to perform uniform random sampling efficiently in this setting, we
need a novel algorithmic and computational framework specially tailored for the
properties of metabolic networks.We present a complete software framework to
handle sampling in metabolic networks. Its backbone is a Multiphase Monte Carlo
Sampling (MMCS) algorithm that unifies rounding and sampling in one pass,
obtaining both upon termination. It exploits an improved variant of the
Billiard Walk that enjoys faster arithmetic complexity per step. We demonstrate
the efficiency of our approach by performing extensive experiments on various

335 took less than 30 hours. To our knowledge, that is out of reach for

finite-dimensional dynamical system is nonlinear, the corresponding Koopman
operator is linear. Although the Koopman operator is infinite-dimensional,
adequate approximation makes it tractable and useful in some discussions and

only a specific type of observable is enough to be focused on in the control

Furthermore, the focus on the specific observable leads to a natural

paper, we study the synergies between vision and communications for edge
computing-enabled UAV flight. By proposing a framework of Edge Computing
Assisted Autonomous Flight (ECAAF), we illustrate that vision and
communications can interact with and assist each other with the aid of edge
computing and offloading, and further speed up the UAV mission completion.
ECAAF consists of three functionalities that are discussed in detail: edge
computing for 3D map acquisition, radio map construction from the 3D map, and
online trajectory planning. During ECAAF, the interactions of communication
capacity, video offloading, 3D map quality, and channel state of the trajectory
form a positive feedback loop. Simulation results verify that the proposed
method can improve mission performance by enhancing connectivity. Finally, we
conclude with some future research directions.

\emph{Lagrange density} always exists for the usual linear pde or linear
fractional problems $\oA\,u=f$ in physics, if the usual causality conditions
$u|_{t<0}=0$ and $f|_{t<0}=0$ are assumed. (The approach is actually applicable
to uniquely solvable linear operator equations for which an adjoint exist.) The
set of Lagrange densities together with the zero vector form a non-trivial
vector space and for each different set of variables, e.g. $\{u_t,f\}$,
$\{u_{xt},f\}$ or $\{u_t,u_x,u_y,u_z,f\}$, there exists a Lagrange density that
implies a Lagrange equation, which is equivalent to the considered problem. The
usual Lagrange density is such that it implies the 'original equation'. But
there are pde's for which the standard theory does not imply a Lagrange
density. We show that for each of these equations a (covariant) Lagrange
density exists that leads to an equivalent \emph{higher order pde} (if it is
formulated with the above causality conditions). For each of these equations,
there exists a Lagrange density that implies a Lagrange equation that equals
the original equation, but this Lagrange density contains at least one
\emph{linear integral operator}. A new point of view is that each of these
equivalent Lagrange densities for a given set of variables implies a (usually
different) \emph{generalized Hamiltonian density}, where the respective
'Hamiltonian' is conserved if $\oA$ and $f$ are appropriate. The standard
Lagrange density implies an Hamiltonian that (frequently) models the energy.
Morever, each conserved Hamiltonian implies countable many higher order

to incorporate structural heterogeneities on small spatial scales, preventing a
full understanding of the critical arrhythmogenic effects of conditions such as
cardiac fibrosis. In this work, we explore the technique of homogenisation by
volume averaging for the inclusion of non-conductive micro-structures into
larger-scale cardiac meshes with minor computational overhead. Importantly, our
approach is not restricted to periodic patterns, enabling homogenised models to
represent, for example, the intricate patterns of collagen deposition present
in different types of fibrosis. We first highlight the importance of
appropriate boundary condition choice for the closure problems that define the
parameters of homogenised models. Then, we demonstrate the technique's ability
to correctly upscale the effects of fibrotic patterns with a spatial resolution
of 10 $\mu$m into much larger numerical mesh sizes of 100-250 $\mu$m. The
homogenised models using these coarser meshes correctly predict critical
pro-arrhythmic effects of fibrosis, including slowed conduction, source/sink
mismatch, and stabilisation of re-entrant activation patterns. As such, this
approach to homogenisation represents a significant step towards whole organ
simulations that unravel the effects of microscopic cardiac tissue

Temperature-dependent current-induced SOT switching measurements further show
that the critical switching current densities decrease with respect to the

In this paper we address the problem of how to maintain the manifold properties
of a surface while it undergoes strong deformations that may cause topological
changes. We introduce a new self-intersection removal algorithm, TransforMesh,
and we propose a mesh evolution framework based on this algorithm. Numerous
shape modelling applications use surface evolution in order to improve shape
properties, such as appearance or accuracy. Both explicit and implicit
representations can be considered for that purpose. However, explicit mesh
representations, while allowing for accurate surface modelling, suffer from the
inherent difficulty of reliably dealing with self-intersections and topological
changes such as merges and splits. As a consequence, a majority of methods rely
on implicit representations of surfaces, e.g. level-sets, that naturally
overcome these issues. Nevertheless, these methods are based on volumetric
discretizations, which introduce an unwanted precision-complexity trade-off.
The method that we propose handles topological changes in a robust manner and
removes self intersections, thus overcoming the traditional limitations of
mesh-based approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of TransforMesh, we
describe two challenging applications, namely surface morphing and 3-D
reconstruction.

integrators applied to discretized versions of the Navier-Stokes equations.
However, the associated Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition severely restricts
the maximum time step size. Exploiting the Lagrangian nature of the Boltzmann
equation's material derivative, we now introduce a feasible three-dimensional
semi-Lagrangian lattice Boltzmann method (SLLBM), which circumvents this
restriction. While many lattice Boltzmann methods for compressible flows were
restricted to two dimensions due to the enormous number of discrete velocities
in three dimensions, the SLLBM uses only 45 discrete velocities. Based on
compressible Taylor-Green vortex simulations we show that the new method
accurately captures shocks or shocklets as well as turbulence in 3D without
utilizing additional filtering or stabilizing techniques, even when the time
step sizes are up to two orders of magnitude larger compared to simulations in
the literature. Our new method therefore enables researchers for the first time
to study compressible turbulent flows by a fully explicit scheme, whose range
of admissible time step sizes is only dictated by physics, while being
decoupled from the spatial discretization.

  layers",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The process of colloidal drying gives way to particle self-assembly in
numerous elds including photonics or biotechnology. Yet, the mechanisms and
conditions driving the nal particle arrangement in dry colloidal layers remain
elusive. Here, we examine how the drying rate selects the nanostructure of
thick dried layers in four dierent suspensions of silica nanospheres. Depending
on particle size and dispersity, either an amorphous arrangement, a crystalline
arrangement, or a rate-dependent amorphous-to-crystalline transition occurs at
the drying surface. Amorphous arrangements are observed in the two most
polydisperse suspensions while crystallinity occurs when dispersity is lower.
Counter-intuitively in the latter case, a higher drying rate favors ordering of
the particles. To complement these measurements and to take stock of the bulk
properties of the layer, tests on the layer porosity were undertaken. For all
suspensions studied herein, faster drying yields denser dry layers. Crystalline
surface arrangement implies large bulk volume fraction ($\sim$ 0.65) whereas
amorphous arrangements can be observed in layers with either low (down to
$\sim$ 0.53) or high ($\sim$ 0.65) volume fraction. Lastly, we demonstrate via
targeted additional experiments and SAXS measurements, that the packing
structure of the layers is mainly driven by the formation of aggregates and
their subsequent packing, and not by the competition between Brownian diusion
and convection. This highlights that a second dimensionless ratio in addition
to the Peclet number should be taken into account, namely the aggregation over
evaporation timescale.

theoretical results in cognitive science, here we study categorical effects in
artificial neural networks. We combine a theoretical analysis that makes use of
mutual and Fisher information quantities, and a series of numerical simulations
on networks of increasing complexity. These formal and numerical analyses
provide insights into the geometry of the neural representation in deep layers,
with expansion of space near category boundaries and contraction far from

complementary approaches: one mimics experiments in psychophysics and cognitive
neuroscience by means of morphed continua between stimuli of different
categories, while the other introduces a categoricality index that, for each

neural population level. We show on both shallow and deep neural networks that
category learning automatically induces categorical perception. We further show
that the deeper a layer, the stronger the categorical effects. As an outcome of
our study, we propose a coherent view of the efficacy of different heuristic
practices of the dropout regularization technique. More generally, our view,

problem: Given auxiliary inputs $t_0, \dotsc, t_{m-1}$, so-called generate and
propagate signals, construct a depth-optimum circuit over the basis {AND2, OR2}
computing all $n$ carry bits of an $n$-bit adder, where $m=2n-1$. In fact,
carry bits are AND-OR paths, i.e., Boolean functions of the form $t_0 \lor (
t_1 \land (t_2 \lor ( \dots t_{m-1}) \dots ))$. Classical approaches construct
so-called prefix circuits which do not achieve a competitive depth. For
instance, the popular construction by Kogge and Stone is only a
$2$-approximation. A lower bound on the depth of any prefix circuit is $1.44
\log_2 m$ + const, while recent non-prefix circuits have a depth of $\log_2 m$
+ $\log_2 \log_2 m$ + const. However, it is unknown whether any of these
polynomial-time approaches achieves the optimum depth for all $m$.
  We present a new exponential-time algorithm solving the problem optimally.
The previously best exact algorithm with a running time of $\mathcal O(2.45^m)$
is viable only for $m \leq 29$. Our algorithm is significantly faster: We
achieve a running time of $\mathcal O(2.02^m)$ and apply sophisticated pruning
strategies to improve practical running times dramatically. This allows us to
compute optimum circuits for all $m \leq 64$. Combining these computational
results with new theoretical insights, we derive the optimum depths of
$2^k$-bit adder circuits for all $k \leq 13$, previously known only for $k \leq
4$.
  In fact, we solve a more general problem occurring in VLSI design: $delay$
optimization of a $generalization$ of AND-OR paths where AND and OR do not
necessarily alternate. Our algorithm arises from our new structure theorem
which characterizes delay-optimum generalized AND-OR path circuits.

differ considerably. In this paper, we further investigate the properties of
the elliptical accretion disk of the nearly uniform distribution of
eccentricity within the disk plane. Our results show that the elliptical
accretion disks have distinctive hydrodynamic structures and spectral energy
distributions, associated with TDEs. The soft X-ray photons generated at
pericenter and nearby are trapped in the disk and advected around the ellipse
because of large electron scattering opacity. They are absorbed and reprocessed
into emission lines and low-frequency continuum via recombination and
bremsstrahlung emission. Because of the rapid increase of bound-free and
free-free opacities with radius, the low-frequency continuum photons become
trapped in the disk at large radius and are advected through apocenter and back
to the photon-trapping radius. Elliptical accretion disks predict sub-Eddington
luminosities and emit mainly at the photon-trapping radius of thousands of
Schwarzschild radii with a blackbody spectrum of nearly single temperature of
typically about 3X10^4 K. Because of the self-regulation, the photon-trapping
radius expands and contracts following the rise and fall of accretion rate. The
radiation temperature is nearly independent of BH mass and accretion rate and
varies weakly with the stellar mass and the viscosity parameter. Our results
are well consistent with the observations of optical/UV TDEs.

individually fit abundances to a large number of free parameters, we aim to

the spatial difference and the temporal difference in a single discharge cycle.
The D-D body force is computed with flush-mounted and bulge configuration of
the exposed electrode, which is operated at the peak-to-peak AC voltage of 7kV

positive-going phase of the AC power, but activate a smaller flow region than
the S-H model with Dc = 0.0117, which is given by the experiment beforehand at
7kV. The local induced velocity of the D-D bulge case at 7kV measured in the
downstream flow has the best agreement with the experimental result. The
maximum wall-parallel induced velocity in the S-H case with Dc = 0.0117 is
consistent with that in the experiment, however, the local induced velocity is
relatively high with different flow structures. In the post-stall flow over the

D-D bulge model at 7kV has approximately the same effect of leading-edge
suction enhancement and reattachment promotion as the S-H model with Dc = 0.16,

find that that periodic driving can generate states localized completely or
partially near the ends of a finite-sized system. Depending on the system
parameters, such states have Floquet eigenvalues lying either outside or inside
the continuum of eigenvalues of the bulk states; only in the former case we
find that these states are completely localized at the ends and are true edge

can generate two-particle states which are localized at the ends of the system.
We show that many of these effects can be understood using a Floquet
perturbation theory which is valid in the limit of large staggered potential or
large interaction strength. Some of these effects can also be understood
qualitatively by considering time-independent Hamiltonians which have a
potential at the sites at the edges; Hamiltonians of these kind effectively
appear in a Floquet-Magnus analysis of the driven problem. Finally, we discuss

progress in recent years. Existing stereo matching methods estimate disparity
instead of depth. They treat the disparity errors as the evaluation metric of
the depth estimation errors, since the depth can be calculated from the
disparity according to the triangulation principle. However, we find that the
error of the depth depends not only on the error of the disparity but also on
the depth range of the points. Therefore, even if the disparity error is low,
the depth error is still large, especially for the distant points. In this
paper, a novel Direct Depth Learning Network (DDL-Net) is designed for stereo
matching. DDL-Net consists of two stages: the Coarse Depth Estimation stage and
the Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage, which are all supervised by depth
instead of disparity. Specifically, Coarse Depth Estimation stage uniformly
samples the matching candidates according to depth range to construct cost
volume and output coarse depth. Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage
performs further matching near the coarse depth to correct the imprecise
matching and wrong matching. To make the Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement
stage robust to the coarse depth and adaptive to the depth range of the points,
the Granularity Uncertainty is introduced to Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement
stage. Granularity Uncertainty adjusts the matching range and selects the
candidates' features according to coarse prediction confidence and depth range.
We verify the performance of DDL-Net on SceneFlow dataset and DrivingStereo
dataset by different depth metrics. Results show that DDL-Net achieves an
average improvement of 25% on the SceneFlow dataset and $12\%$ on the
DrivingStereo dataset comparing the classical methods. More importantly, we
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy at a large distance.

provided that the vector field and constraint set possess certain structures,
which we call subsystems. This notion is based on causal dependence in the
dynamics between the different states. This results in sparse descriptions for
three problems from nonlinear dynamical systems: region of attraction, maximum
positively invariant set and (global) attractor. The decompositions can be
paired with any method for computing (outer) approximations of these sets in
order to reduce the computation to lower dimensional systems. We illustrate
this by the methods from previous works based on infinite-dimensional linear
programming, as one example where the curse of dimensionality is present and
hence dimension reduction is crucial. For polynomial dynamics, we show that
these problems admit a sparse sum-of-squares (SOS) approximation with
guaranteed convergence such that the number of variables in the largest SOS
multiplier is given by the dimension of the largest subsystem appearing in the
decomposition. The dimension of such subsystems depends on the sparse structure
of the vector field and the constraint set and can allow for a significant
reduction of the size of the semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations. The method
is simple to use and based solely on convex optimization. Numerical examples

""catalyst"" whose state has to remain invariant exactly in the transition. This
statement is proven both in the case of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics,
where von~Neumann entropy is the relevant entropy, and in the case of systems
whose states are described by probability distributions on finite sample
spaces, where Shannon entropy is the relevant entropy. The results give an
affirmative resolution to the (approximate) ""catalytic entropy conjecture""
introduced by Boes et al. [PRL 122, 210402 (2019)]. They provide a complete
single-shot characterization without external randomness of von Neumann entropy
and Shannon entropy. I also compare the results to the setting of
phenomenological thermodynamics and show how they can be used to obtain a
quantitative single-shot characterization of Gibbs states in quantum

companion of a spectral type earlier than M0. The WD progenitor evolves in
isolation, but its wind during the AGB phase pollutes the companion surface and
transfers some angular momentum. Within SHINE survey that uses SPHERE at the
VLT, we acquired images of HD2133, HD114174, and CD-567708 and combined this
data with high resolution spectra of the primaries, TESS, and literature data.
We performed accurate abundance analyses for the MS. We found brighter J and K
magnitudes for HD114174B than obtained previously and extended the photometry
down to 0.95 micron. Our new data indicate a higher temperature and then
shorter cooling age (5.57+/-0.02 Gyr) and larger mass (0.75+/-0.03 Mo) for this
WD than previously assumed. This solved the discrepancy previously found with
the age of the MS star. The two other WDs are less massive, indicating
progenitors of ~1.3 Mo and 1.5-1.8 Mo for HD2133B and CD-56 7708B,
respectively. We were able to derive constraints on the orbit for HD114174 and
CD-56 7708. The composition of the MS stars agrees fairly well with
expectations from pollution by the AGB progenitors of the WDs: HD2133A has a
small enrichment of n-capture elements, which is as expected for pollution by
an AGB star with a mass <1.5 Mo; CD-56 7708A is a previously unrecognized mild
Ba-star, which is expected due to pollution by an AGB star with a mass in the
range of 1.5-3.0 Mo; and HD114174 has a very moderate excess of n-capture
elements, which is in agreement with the expectation for a massive AGB star to
have a mass >3.0 Mo. On the other hand, none of these stars show the excesses
of C that are expected to go along with those of n-capture elements. This might
be related to the fact that these stars are at the edges of the mass range
where we expect nucleosynthesis related to thermal pulses.

$T(d_{1})\times T(d_{2})$ of a $d_{1}$-dimensional simplex $T(d_{1})$ and a

the premise that changes in resolution act as a smoothing equivalent to changes
in scale, a scale-space representation of the high-resolution image is
produced. Hence the one-to-one classical image matching paradigm becomes
one-to-many because the low-resolution image is compared with all the
scale-space representations of the high-resolution one. Key to the success of
such a process is the proper representation of the features to be matched in
scale-space. We show how to represent and extract interest points at variable
scales and we devise a method allowing the comparison of two images at two
different resolutions. The method comprises the use of photometric- and
rotation-invariant descriptors, a geometric model mapping the high-resolution
image onto a low-resolution image region, and an image matching strategy based
on local constraints and on the robust estimation of this geometric model.
Extensive experiments show that our matching method can be used for scale

are described via the self-consistent coupled-channel unitarized scheme based
on a SU(3) chiral Lagrangian which incorporates explicitly the $s-$ and $p-$

potential, spectral functions and reaction cross sections as well as their
dependence on baryon density, temperature and antikaon momentum in the nuclear
medium, which are incorporated in the off-shell dynamics of the PHSD. The
in-medium modification of kaons $(K = K^+, K^0)$ are accounted via the
kaon-nuclear potential, which is assumed to be proportional to the local baryon
density. The manifestation of the medium effects in observables is investigated
for the $K$ and ${\bar K}$ rapidity distributions, $p_T$-spectra as well as the
polar and azimuthal angular distributions, direct ($v_1$) and elliptic ($v_2$)

an intrinsic mode-selectivity, a directional momentum-filter, due to the
differences in electronic band-structure, which creates a separation of
electron reservoirs each at the opposite sides of the semiconductor, while at
the same time selecting modes propagating almost perpendicular to the
interface. The electronic separation coexists with a transport current
dominated by Andreev reflection and low elastic back-scattering, both dependent
on the gate-controllable electronic properties of the semiconductor.

consistent with the NOMAD-TGO observations. In this case, at altitudes below
120 km, our modelled limb intensity for [OI] 6300 {\AA} emission is smaller by
a factor 2 to 5 compared to that of NOMAD-TGO observation for [OI] 2972 {\AA}

intensities of these atomic oxygen forbidden emission lines. Our calculated
limb intensity for [OI] 6300 {\AA} emission, when the Mars is at near

occluded regions by using features corresponding to the whole image. This is
against the human's amodal perception, where human uses the visible part and
the shape prior knowledge of the target to infer the occluded region. To mimic
the behavior of human and solve the ambiguity in the learning, we propose a
framework, it firstly estimates a coarse visible mask and a coarse amodal mask.
Then based on the coarse prediction, our model infers the amodal mask by
concentrating on the visible region and utilizing the shape prior in the
memory. In this way, features corresponding to background and occlusion can be
suppressed for amodal mask estimation. Consequently, the amodal mask would not
be affected by what the occlusion is given the same visible regions. The
leverage of shape prior makes the amodal mask estimation more robust and
reasonable. Our proposed model is evaluated on three datasets. Experiments show
that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The

elastomers. It has been shown recently that a large electrocaloric effect
exceeding 7 K can be observed in smectic liquid crystals. Here, we report on a
significant elastocaloric response observed by direct elastocaloric
measurements in main-chain liquid crystal elastomers. It is demonstrated that
the character of the nematic to paranematic/isotropic transition can be tuned
from the supercritical regime towards the first-order regime, by decreasing the
density of crosslinkers. In the latter case, the latent heat additionally
enhances the elastocaloric response. Our results indicate that a significant
elastocaloric response is present in main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers,
driven by stress fields much smaller than in solid elastocaloric materials.
Therefore, elastocaloric soft materials can potentially play a significant role

polymeric syntactic foams under compressive loading is established. These
syntactic foams are closed cell composite foams with thin-walled microballoons
dispersed in a matrix (resin) whose closed cell structure provides excellent
mechanical properties, like high strength and low density. There are several
parameters that can contribute towards their mechanical properties, including,
microballoon volume fraction, microballoon wall thickness, bonding between the
microballoons and the matrix, and the crushing strength of microballoons.
Conducting purely experimental testing by varying these parameters can be very
time sensitive and expensive. Also, identification of densification mechanics
is challenging using experiments only. Higher densification stress and energy
are favorable properties under foam compression or crushing. Hence, the
influence of key structural and material parameters associated with syntactic
foams that dictate the mechanics of densification is studied here by
implementing micromechanics based computational models and multiple linear
regression analysis. Specifically, specific densification stresses and energy,
which are densification stresses and energy normalized by weight, are evaluated
which are more relevant for a wide variety of weight saving applications.
Microballoon crushing strength and volume fraction are identified as the
parameters that have the higher influence on densification stress and energy,
and their specific counterparts, whereas the interfacial bonding has the least
impact. In addition, designing aspects of syntactic foams with specified
overall density are discussed by mapping microballoon volume fraction and wall
thickness.

performance of existing methods are unsatisfactory on real datasets where the
new target domain comprises of heterogeneous sub-domains (e.g., diverse weather
characteristics). We point out that carefully reasoning about the multiple
modalities in the target domain can improve the robustness of adaptation
models. To this end, we propose a condition-guided adaptation framework that is
empowered by a special attentive progressive adversarial training (APAT)
mechanism and a novel self-training policy. The APAT strategy progressively
performs condition-specific alignment and attentive global feature matching.
The new self-training scheme exploits the adversarial ambivalences of easy and
hard adaptation regions and the correlations among target sub-domains
effectively. We evaluate our method (DCAA) on various adaptation scenarios
where the target images vary in weather conditions. The comparisons against

field. Recent works have built a large variety of deep learning models to
address this task. However, these approaches mostly rely on significant
architecture engineering and suffer from high computational burden. In this
paper, we propose a new method, named Retinex-inspired Unrolling with
Architecture Search (RUAS), to construct lightweight yet effective enhancement
network for low-light images in real-world scenario. Specifically, building
upon Retinex rule, RUAS first establishes models to characterize the intrinsic
underexposed structure of low-light images and unroll their optimization
processes to construct our holistic propagation structure. Then by designing a
cooperative reference-free learning strategy to discover low-light prior
architectures from a compact search space, RUAS is able to obtain a
top-performing image enhancement network, which is with fast speed and requires
few computational resources. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of
our RUAS framework against recently proposed state-of-the-art methods.

discretize the motion of a closed curve under surface diffusion with an
anisotropic surface energy $\gamma(\theta)$ -- anisotropic surface diffusion --
in two dimensions, while $\theta$ is the angle between the outward unit normal
vector and the vertical axis. By introducing a positive definite surface energy
(density) matrix $G(\theta)$, we present a new and simple variational
formulation for the anisotropic surface diffusion and prove that it satisfies
area/mass conservation and energy dissipation. The variational problem is
discretized in space by the parametric finite element method and area/mass
conservation and energy dissipation are established for the
semi-discretization. Then the problem is further discretized in time by a
(semi-implicit) backward Euler method so that only a linear system is to be
solved at each time step for the full-discretization and thus it is efficient.
We establish well-posedness of the full-discretization and identify some simple
conditions on $\gamma(\theta)$ such that the full-discretization keeps energy
dissipation and thus it is unconditionally energy-stable. Finally the ES-PFEM
is applied to simulate solid-state dewetting of thin films with anisotropic
surface energies, i.e. the motion of an open curve under anisotropic surface
diffusion with proper boundary conditions at the two triple points moving along
the horizontal substrate. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the
efficiency and accuracy as well as energy dissipation of the proposed ES-PFEM.

particular, when one considers gas flow accreting onto a central object.
Although the cylindrical coordinates have several advantages in describing
rotation, they have apparent singularity along the axis at the coordinate
origin (z-axis). This singularity introduces difficulties in numerical
simulations. First, it is difficult to reproduce the flow across the z-axis.
Second, the time step is extremely shortened by the CFL condition near the
z-axis because the numerical cell thereof is narrow in the azimuthal direction
for a given angular resolution. Here, we propose a new discretization scheme to
overcome these difficulties. In our new scheme, we consider changes in the
direction of the unit vector within a cell when evaluating the flux across each
cell surface. Besides, we evaluate the source term in the radial component of
the momentum equation from the thermal and dynamic pressures working on the
azimuthal cell surface. The new scheme is designed to be free-stream preserving
so that flow with uniform density, pressure, and velocity isan exact solution
of the discretized equation. These improvements are essential to using a lower
angular resolution in the innermost area and thus to elongate each time step.
Our examples demonstrate that the innermost circular region around the axis can
be resolved by only six numerical cells. We present an application to an
accreting compact star surrounded by a disk, in addition to Sod shock tube and

problem that separates the background and foreground of a video from its

dimensional space and the foreground is usually sparse. More importantly, each
video frame is a natural image that has textural patterns. By exploiting these
properties, we develop a message passing algorithm termed offline
denoising-based turbo message passing (DTMP). We show that these structural
properties can be efficiently handled by the existing denoising techniques
under the turbo message passing framework. We further extend the DTMP algorithm
to the online scenario where the video data is collected in an online manner.
The extension is based on the similarity/continuity between adjacent video
frames. We adopt the optical flow method to refine the estimation of the
foreground. We also adopt the sliding window based background estimation to
reduce complexity. By exploiting the Gaussianity of messages, we develop the
state evolution to characterize the per-iteration performance of offline and
online DTMP. Comparing to the existing algorithms, DTMP can work at much lower
compression rates, and can subtract the background successfully with a lower
mean squared error and better visual quality for both offline and online

speedups in solving problems intractable for conventional computers. However,
despite recent progress they remain limited in scaling and availability-making
quantum software and hardware development heavily reliant on quantum simulators
running on conventional hardware. However, most of those simulators mimic
perfect quantum computers and, hence, ignore the fragile nature of quantum
mechanical effects which frequently yield to decoherence errors in real quantum
devices. Considering those errors during the simulation is complex, but
necessary in order to tailor quantum algorithms for specific devices. Thus far,
most state-of-the-art simulators considering decoherence errors rely on
(exponentially) large array representations. As an alternative, simulators
based on decision diagrams have been shown very promising for simulation of
quantum circuits in general, but have not supported decoherence errors yet. In
this work, we are closing this gap. We investigate how the consideration of
decoherence errors affects the simulation performance of approaches based on
decision diagrams and propose advanced solutions to mitigate negative effects.
Experiments confirm that this yields improvements of several orders of
magnitudes compared to a naive consideration of errors.

  Neural Network",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised deep learning has been widely used in the studies of automatic ECG
classification, which largely benefits from sufficient annotation of large
datasets. However, most of the existing large ECG datasets are roughly
annotated, so the classification model trained on them can only detect the
existence of abnormalities in a whole recording, but cannot determine their
exact occurrence time. In addition, it may take huge time and economic cost to
construct a fine-annotated ECG dataset. Therefore, this study proposes weakly
supervised deep learning models for detecting abnormal ECG events and their
occurrence time. The available supervision information for the models is
limited to the event types in an ECG record, excluding the specific occurring
time of each event. By leverage of feature locality of deep convolution neural
network, the models first make predictions based on the local features, and
then aggregate the local predictions to infer the existence of each event
during the whole record. Through training, the local predictions are expected
to reflect the specific occurring time of each event. To test their potentials,
we apply the models for detecting cardiac rhythmic and morphological
arrhythmias by using the AFDB and MITDB datasets, respectively. The results
show that the models achieve beat-level accuracies of 99.09% in detecting
atrial fibrillation, and 99.13% in detecting morphological arrhythmias, which
are comparable to that of fully supervised learning models, demonstrating their
effectiveness. The local prediction maps revealed by this method are also
helpful to analyze and diagnose the decision logic of record-level
classification models.

DGP branch and due to the curvature effects from the GB component on the brane,
the black hole singularity acquires modified features. More precisely, during
collapse and for a finite comoving time, before a singularity would emerge at
the zero physical radius, the first time derivative of the Hubble rate
diverges, whereas the brane energy density and the Hubble rate remain finite.
This is a peculiar behavior which displays similar properties to the sudden
singularity occurring in particular late-time cosmological frameworks.
Furthermore, the question of whether this altered singularity can be viewed by
an external observer or will be hidden by a black hole horizon is addressed. We
establish that, depending on the given induced-gravity parameter and the GB
coupling constant, there exists a {\em threshold mass} for the collapsing dust,
below which no trapped surfaces evolve as the collapse proceeds toward the
singularity. In other words, a {\em naked sudden singularity} may form.

a set of (seen) visual concepts can be leveraged to recognize a new set of
(unseen) concepts, is a popular way of evaluating visual representations,
especially in a self-supervised learning framework. Nonetheless, the choice of
unseen concepts for such an evaluation is usually made arbitrarily, and
independently from the seen concepts used to train representations, thus
ignoring any semantic relationships between the two. In this paper, we argue
that the semantic relationships between seen and unseen concepts affect
generalization performance and propose ImageNet-CoG, a novel benchmark on the
ImageNet-21K (IN-21K) dataset that enables measuring concept generalization in
a principled way. Our benchmark leverages expert knowledge that comes from
WordNet in order to define a sequence of unseen IN-21K concept sets that are
semantically more and more distant from the ImageNet-1K (IN-1K) subset, a
ubiquitous training set. This allows us to benchmark visual representations
learned on IN-1K out-of-the box. We conduct a large-scale study encompassing 31
convolution and transformer-based models and show how different architectures,
levels of supervision, regularization techniques and use of web data impact the

a cornerstone in practical implementation of quantum computations. Processes of
separate dephasing in each qubit in experimentally feasible systems is commonly
accepted to destroy entanglement. In this work, we consider a system of two
strongly coupled qubits that interact with dephasing reservoirs. We demonstrate
that interaction with dephasing reservoirs can contribute to the formation of a
long-lived mixed entangled state with nonzero concurrence. The weight of the
subradiant state in this mixed state tends toward unity if the dephasing rate
is much larger than the radiative rate and less than the coupling constant
between qubits. The lifetime of this state is proportional to the exponent of
the ratio of the coupling constant to environmental temperature and can be, by
orders of magnitude, larger than the system's characteristic dephasing and
dissipation times. Therefore, high dephasing, along with strong coupling,
contributes to the creation of an entangled state with a long lifetime. This
result paves the way for creation of long-lived entangled states.

place on the sustained performance of reversible computers. Part I concerned
aggregate performance in terms of computational operations per unit time, but
neglected to consider interactions among computational sub-units or between
computational sub-units and shared resources such as memory or chemical
species. Part II extended the analysis to consider the former set of
interactions. In this Part we extend the analysis to consider the latter set,
with a particular focus on resource distribution in the first half. It is found
that most schemes imaginable fail to function effectively in the limit of
vanishing 'computational bias' $b$, which measures the net fraction of
transitions which are successful, and falls as the system grows in size.
Driving thermodynamically unfavourable reactions, such as resource
distribution, is a very general problem for such systems and can be solved by
supplying a sufficient excess of free energy. We propose a scheme to
dynamically supply enough free energy for a given reaction, automatically and
rapidly adapting to changes in the disequilibrium state of said
reaction--including the case when the favourable reaction direction switches.
The overhead of this scheme is no worse than the overhead found in Part II for
communicating reversible computers under the same regime.

such models. So far, the research has focused on the semantic level, namely,
deep point cloud classifiers. However, point clouds are also widely used in a
geometric-related form that includes encoding and reconstructing the geometry.
In this work, we are the first to consider the problem of adversarial examples
at a geometric level. In this setting, the question is how to craft a small
change to a clean source point cloud that leads, after passing through an
autoencoder model, to the reconstruction of a different target shape. Our
attack is in sharp contrast to existing semantic attacks on 3D point clouds.
While such works aim to modify the predicted label by a classifier, we alter
the entire reconstructed geometry. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness
of our attack in the case of defense, where we show that remnant
characteristics of the target shape are still present at the output after
applying the defense to the adversarial input. Our code is publicly available

to multiple linear transmit covariance constraints, including sum power
constraint, per antenna power constraints and interference power constraint. An
analytical solution to this problem is not known and existing numerical
solutions suffer from slow convergence rate and/or high per-iteration
complexity. Deriving computationally efficient solutions to the secrecy
capacity problem is challenging since the secrecy rate is expressed as a
difference of convex functions (DC) of the transmit covariance matrix, for
which its convexity is only known for some special cases. In this paper we
propose two low-complexity methods to compute the secrecy capacity along with a
convex reformulation for degraded channels. In the first method we capitalize
on the accelerated DC algorithm which requires solving a sequence of convex
subproblems, for which we propose an efficient iterative algorithm where each
iteration admits a closed-form solution. In the second method, we rely on the
concave-convex equivalent reformulation of the secrecy capacity problem which
allows us to derive the so-called partial best response algorithm to obtain an
optimal solution. Notably, each iteration of the second method can also be done
in closed form. The simulation results demonstrate a faster convergence rate of
our methods compared to other known solutions. We carry out extensive numerical

cyclotron resonance discharge sustained by powerful millimeter wave gyrotron

physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our physical labours, and
communicate with us through natural language. Here we study how to design
artificial agents that can interact naturally with humans using the
simplification of a virtual environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a
number of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research:
complex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language
comprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build
agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them
while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical.
Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and
use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between
human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our
agents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests,
including evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly
with them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training
and auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by
supervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent
capabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we
train evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human
judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without
additional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual environment
provide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising
tool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably
evaluating such agents is possible to surmount.

family of selfadjoint Fredholm operators parametrised by $X\times S^1$ which
has a non-trivial index bundle. Further, we use this observation and a family
index theorem of Pejsachowicz to study multiparameter bifurcation of homoclinic
solutions of Hamiltonian systems, where we generalise a previously known class
of examples.

  arXiv:1911.00974",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question of whether the hyper-dissipative (HD) Navier-Stokes (NS) system
can exhibit spontaneous formation of singularities in the super-critical
regime--the hyper-dissipation being generated by a fractional power of the
Laplacian confined to interval $\bigl(1, \frac{5}{4}\bigr)$--has been a major
open problem in the mathematical fluid dynamics since the foundational work of
J.L. Lions in 1960s. In this work, a mathematical evidence of criticality of
the Laplacian is presented. While the framework for the proof is based on the
`scale of sparseness' of the super-level sets of the positive and negative
parts of the components of the higher-order derivatives of the velocity or
vorticity fields recently introduced by the authors, a major novelty in the
current work is the classification of the HD flows near a potential
spatiotemporal singularity in two main categories, `homogeneous' (the flows
exhibiting a near-steady behavior) and `non-homogenous' (a generic case
consistent with the formation and decay of turbulence). The main result states
that in the non-homogeneous case, any power of the Laplacian greater than 1
yields a contradiction, preventing a blow-up. In order to illustrate the impact
of this work on the state-of-the art, a two-parameter family of the rescaled
(potential) blow-up profiles is considered, and it is shown that as soon as the
power of the Laplacian is greater than one, a new region in the parameter space
is ruled out (as a matter of fact, the region is a neighborhood of the
self-similar profile, i.e., the `approximately self-similar' blow-up is ruled
out).

largely used. One key point is the adaptation mechanism which resides at the

adaptation algorithm for DASH, namely SSIM Based Adaptation (SBA). This
mechanism is user-experience driven: it uses the Structural Similarity Index
Measurement (SSIM) as main video perceptual quality indicator; moreover, the
adaptation is based on a joint consideration of SSIM indicator and the physical
resources (buffer occupancy, bandwidth) in order to minimize the buffer
starvation (rebuffering) and video quality instability, as well as to maximize
the overall video quality (through SSIM). To evaluate the performance of our
proposal, we carried out trace-driven emulation with real traffic traces
(captured in real mobile network). Comparisons with some representative
algorithms (BBA, FESTIVE, OSMF) through major QoE metrics show that our
adaptation algorithm SBA achieves an efficient adaptation minimizing both the
rebuffering and instability, whereas the displayed video is maintained at a
high level of bitrate.

environment. High angular resolution observations have a key role in
understanding the disk structure and the dynamical processes at work. Aims. In
this study we aim to characterize the mid-infrared brightness distribution of
the inner disk of the young intermediate-mass star HD 163296, from VLTI/MATISSE
observations. Methods. We use geometric models to fit the data. Our models
include a smoothed ring, a flat disk with inner cavity, and a 2D Gaussian. The
models can account for disk inclination and for azimuthal asymmetries as well.
We also perform numerical hydro-dynamical simulations of the inner edge of the
disk. Results. Our modeling reveals a significant brightness asymmetry in the
L-band disk emission. The brightness maximum of the asymmetry is located at the
NW part of the disk image, nearly at the position angle of the semimajor axis.
The surface brightness ratio in the azimuthal variation is $3.5 \pm 0.2$.
Comparing our result on the location of the asymmetry with other
interferometric measurements, we confirm that the morphology of the $r<0.3$ au
disk region is time-variable. We propose that this asymmetric structure,
located in or near the inner rim of the dusty disk, orbits the star. For the
physical origin of the asymmetry, we tested a hypothesis where a vortex is
created by Rossby wave instability, and we find that a unique large scale
vortex may be compatible with our data. The half-light radius of the L-band
emitting region is $0.33\pm 0.01$ au, the inclination is
${52^\circ}^{+5^\circ}_{-7^\circ}$, and the position angle is $143^\circ \pm
3^\circ$. Our models predict that a non-negligible fraction of the L-band disk
emission originates inside the dust sublimation radius for $\mu$m-sized grains.
Refractory grains or large ($\gtrsim 10\ \mu$m-sized) grains could be the
origin for this emission.

a vast amount of light by releasing gravitational energy of accreting gas, with
a cumulative active period of only a few $10^8$ years, so-called the duty cycle
of the Active Galactic Nuclei. Namely, many galaxies today host a starving
massive black hole. Although galaxy collisions have been thought to enhance
nucleus activity, the origin of the duty cycle, especially the shutdown
process, is a still critical issue. Here we show that galaxy collisions are
also capable of suppressing black hole fueling by using an analytic model and
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, applying the well-determined
parameter sets for the galactic collision in the Andromeda galaxy. Our models
demonstrate that a central collision of galaxies can strip the torus-shaped gas
surrounding the massive black hole, the putative fueling source. The derived
condition for switching-off the black hole fueling indicates that a significant
fraction of currently bright nuclei can become inactive, reminiscent of
fading/dying active nucleus phenomena associated with galaxy merging events.
Galaxy collisions may therefore be responsible both for switching-off and
turning-on the nucleus activity, depending on the collision orbit (head-on or

during driving is crucial to prevent accidents that could claim a lot of
people's lives. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is suitable to detect micro-sleep
because EEG was associated with consciousness and sleep. Deep learning showed
great performance in recognizing brain states, but sufficient data should be
needed. However, collecting micro-sleep data during driving is inefficient and
has a high risk of obtaining poor data quality due to noisy driving situations.
Night-sleep data at home is easier to collect than micro-sleep data during
driving. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning approach using night-sleep EEG
to improve the performance of micro-sleep detection. We pre-trained the U-Net
to classify the 5-class sleep stages using night-sleep EEG and used the sleep
stages estimated by the U-Net to detect micro-sleep during driving. This
improved micro-sleep detection performance by about 30\% compared to the
traditional approach. Our approach was based on the hypothesis that micro-sleep
corresponds to the early stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We
analyzed EEG distribution during night-sleep and micro-sleep and found that
micro-sleep has a similar distribution to NREM sleep. Our results provide the
possibility of similarity between micro-sleep and the early stage of NREM sleep

combination of $EEE$ and $EEB$. We consider theories for which the Hamiltonian

only for GR (and the related theory of Self-Dual Gravity) these equations close
in the sense that they can be written in terms of only the metric and its first
time derivative. Modified theories are therefore seen to be essentially
non-metric in the sense that their dynamics cannot be reduced to
geometrodynamics. We then show this to be related to the problem with
Lorentzian reality conditions: the conditions of reality of the 3-metric and
its time derivative are not acceptable because they are not preserved by the

on higher-order time derivatives, which then leaves no room for degrees of

predicted in bilayer graphene/transition metal dichalcogenides (BLG/TMDC)

graphene layers, and only one of them is in close contact to the TMDC. The
presence of spin-orbit coupling can be probed by weak antilocalization (WAL) in
low field magnetotransport measurements. When the spin-orbit splitting in such
a heterostructure increases with the out of plane electric displacement field
$\bar D$, one intuitively expects a concomitant increase of WAL visibility. Our

WAL visibility around $\bar D=0$. This counterintuitive behaviour originates in
the intricate dependence of WAL in graphene on symmetric and antisymmetric spin

observations are confirmed by calculating spin precession and spin lifetimes
from an $8\times 8$ model Hamiltonian of BLG/TMDC.

acid-assisted products, the adoption of glucose as carbon source effectively
increases the carbon content in the composites. Irrespective of the organic
component, the composites exhibit low crystallinity and small grain size. This
results in good electrochemical performance of the anode materials as confirmed
for the glucose-assisted materials which after additional post treatment
delivers a competitive electrochemical capacity.

kid in a shopping mall, call for a new peer-to-peer localization technique that
can localize an individual's smartphone or wearables by directly using
another's on-body devices in unknown indoor environments. However, current
localization solutions either require pre-deployed infrastructures or multiple
antennas in both transceivers, impending their wide-scale application. In this
paper, we present P2PLocate, a peer-to-peer localization system that enables a
single-antenna device co-located with a batteryless backscatter tag to localize
another single-antenna device with decimeter-level accuracy. P2PLocate
leverages the multipath variations intentionally created by an on-body
backscatter tag, coupled with spatial information offered by user movements, to
accomplish this objective without relying on any pre-deployed infrastructures
or pre-training. P2PLocate incorporates novel algorithms to address two major
challenges: (i) interference with strong direct-path signal while extracting
multipath variations, and (ii) lack of direction information while using
single-antenna transceivers. We implement P2PLocate on commercial off-the-shelf
Google Nexus 6p, Intel 5300 WiFi card, and Raspberry Pi B4. Real-world
experiments reveal that P2PLocate can localize both static and mobile targets
with a median accuracy of 0.88 m.

health outcomes and efficiency problems for service providers. To address this
problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or
minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation
policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating
relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the
decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers
have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment
characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities.
This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the
implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care
program targeted at underserved communities in Bogot\'a, Colombia. Our
contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness
of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression
models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the
problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we
propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the
explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the
modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities
in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for
improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported
in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics
affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient prioritization

The dynamic filamentary structure of solar plumes above these outflows, and its
relationship with the overall plume structure, have remained largely
unexplored. We analyzed the statistics of continuously observed fine structure
inside a single representative bright plume within a mid-latitude coronal hole
during 2016 July 2-3. By applying advanced edge-enhancement and spatiotemporal
analysis techniques to extended series of high-resolution images from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we determined that the
plume was composed of numerous time-evolving filamentary substructures,
referred to as ""plumelets"" in this paper, that accounted for most of the plume
emission. The number of simultaneously identifiable plumelets was positively
correlated with plume brightness, peaked in the fully formed plume, and
remained saturated thereafter. The plumelets had transverse widths of 10 Mm and
intermittently supported upwardly propagating periodic disturbances with phase
speeds of 190-260 km/s and longitudinal wavelengths of 55-65 Mm. The
characteristic frequency (3.5 mHz) is commensurate with that of solar p-modes.
Oscillations in neighboring plumelets are uncorrelated, indicating that the
waves could be driven by p-mode flows at spatial scales smaller than the
plumelet separation. Multiple independent sources of outflow within a single
coronal plume should impart significant fine structure to the solar wind that

reaches the charged Nariai geometry ${\rm dS}_2\times S^2$ with Planckian

unstable by nonperturbative quantum effects. Our model suggests the existence
of quantum tunneling of the Nariai geometry and a scenario of

perturbations exhibit chaotic dynamics with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda=2\pi

We find that lowering $L$ leads to a catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking. The

temperature and high density, that we suggest to interpret as a gas-liquid
phase transition that takes place between the chiral symmetry broken phase

this intermediate phase in terms of the increase of the baryon density, and of
the correlation length of the fluctuations of the order parameter: for small
enough $L$ the correlation domains occupy a substantial portion of the volume
of the system, and the fluctuations are comparable to those in the critical
region. For these reasons, we dub this phase as the {\it subcritical liquid}.

Hall and net magnetisation hysteresis loops are explained by substantial
canting of the small net moment by up to \SI{40}{\degree} relative to the

interactions arising from antisite disorder and excess Mn in the unit cell.

point clouds are generally trained from one kind of LiDAR sensors. However,

point cloud resolution. In this paper, R-AGNO-RPN, a region proposal network
built on fusion of 3D point clouds and RGB images is proposed for 3D object
detection regardless of point cloud resolution. As our approach is designed to
be also applied on low point cloud resolutions, the proposed method focuses on
object localization instead of estimating refined boxes on reduced data. The
resilience to low-resolution point cloud is obtained through image features
accurately mapped to Bird's Eye View and a specific data augmentation procedure
that improves the contribution of the RGB images. To show the proposed
network's ability to deal with different point clouds resolutions, experiments
are conducted on both data coming from the KITTI 3D Object Detection and the
nuScenes datasets. In addition, to assess its performances, our method is
compared to PointPillars, a well-known 3D detection network. Experimental
results show that even on point cloud data reduced by $80\%$ of its original
points, our method is still able to deliver relevant proposals localization.

momentum (OAM) to relativistic energies and to produce vortex ions, protons,

during the acceleration and on how phase space of the wave packet evolves. We
show that both the OAM and a mean emittance of the packet, the latter obeying
the Schr\""odinger uncertainty relation, are conserved in axially symmetric
fields of electric and magnetic lenses, typical for accelerators and electron
microscopes, as well as in Penning traps, while a linear approximation of
weakly inhomogeneous fields works much better for single packets than for
classical beams. We analyze quantum dynamics of the packet's rms radius
$\langle\rho^2\rangle$, relate this dynamics to a generalized form of the van
Cittert-Zernike theorem, applicable at arbitrary distances from a source and
for non-Gaussian packets, and adapt the Courant-Snyder formalism to describe
the evolution of the wave packet's phase space. The vortex particles can
therefore be accelerated, focused, steered, trapped, and even stored in
azimuthally symmetric fields and traps, somewhat analogously to the classical
angular-momentum-dominated beams. Moreover, we give a quantum version of the
Busch theorem, which states how one can produce vortex electrons with a
magnetized cathode during either field- or photoemission, as well as vortex
ions and protons by using a magnetized stripping foil employed to change a
charge state of ions. Spatial coherence of the packets plays a crucial role in
these applications and we provide the necessary estimates for particles of

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to hierarchical models designed to perform
clustering in the space of latent parameters of subject-wise generative models.
Specifically, we focus on the case where the subject-wise generative model is a
dynamic causal model (DCM) for fMRI and clusters are defined in terms of
effective brain connectivity. While an attractive approach for detecting
mechanistically interpretable subgroups in heterogeneous populations, inverting
such a hierarchical model represents a particularly challenging case, since DCM
is often characterized by high posterior correlations between its parameters.
In this context, standard MCMC schemes exhibit poor performance and extremely
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate the properties of hierarchical
clustering which lead to the observed failure of standard MCMC schemes and
propose a solution designed to improve convergence but preserve computational
complexity. Specifically, we introduce a class of proposal distributions which
aims to capture the interdependencies between the parameters of the clustering
and subject-wise generative models and helps to reduce random walk behaviour of
the MCMC scheme. Critically, these proposal distributions only introduce a
single hyperparameter that needs to be tuned to achieve good performance. For
validation, we apply our proposed solution to synthetic and real-world datasets

We examine the dependence of the effective potential on the spatial Wilson
loops orientation in fully anisotropic background. For this purpose we obtain
general formulas for the effective potential and study appearance of the
effective potential dynamical wall. We consider particular fully anisotropic
model [arXiv:2011.07023] supported by Einstein-Dilaton-three-Maxwell action.
The effective potential strongly depends on the parameters of anisotropy and
magnetic field, therefore the energy loss depends on physical parameters $-$
$T$, $\mu$, $c_B$ and orientation. Orientation is determined by angles between
the moving heavy quark velocity, the axis of heavy ions collision and their

MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey.
Both GRGs were found within a 1 deg^2 region inside the COSMOS field. They have
redshifts of z=0.1656 and z=0.3363 and physical sizes of 2.4Mpc and 2.0Mpc,
respectively. Only the cores of these GRGs were clearly visible in previous
high resolution VLA observations, since the diffuse emission of the lobes was
resolved out. However, the excellent sensitivity and uv coverage of the new
MeerKAT telescope allowed this diffuse emission to be detected. The GRGs occupy
a unpopulated region of radio power - size parameter space. Based on a recent
estimate of the GRG number density, the probability of finding two or more GRGs
with such large sizes at z<0.4 in a ~1deg^2 field is only 2.7x10^-6, assuming
Poisson statistics. This supports the hypothesis that the prevalence of GRGs
has been significantly underestimated in the past due to limited sensitivity to
low surface brightness emission. The two GRGs presented here may be the first
of a new population to be revealed through surveys like MIGHTEE which provide
exquisite sensitivity to diffuse, extended emission.

Despite the intractability of the likelihood function and the infinite

only source of inaccuracy. That is achieved by using retrospective sampling
techniques and devising a pseudo-marginal infinite-dimensional MCMC algorithm

logarithmic depth circuits due to a local cost function. Second, we introduce
the Variational Fidelity Estimation (VFE) algorithm. We combine Uhlmann's
theorem and the freedom in purification to translate the estimation task into
an optimization problem over a unitary on an ancillary system with fixed

exponentially small correlations in the radiation emitted by a black hole are
sufficient to resolve the original paradox put forward by Hawking. We then
describe a refinement of the paradox that makes essential reference to the
black-hole interior. This analysis leads to a broadly-applicable physical
principle: in a theory of quantum gravity, a copy of all the information on a
Cauchy slice is also available near the boundary of the slice. This principle
can be made precise and established -- under weak assumptions, and using only
low-energy techniques -- in asymptotically global AdS and in four dimensional
asymptotically flat spacetime. When applied to black holes, this principle
tells us that the exterior of the black hole always retains a complete copy of
the information in the interior. We show that accounting for this redundancy
provides a resolution of the information paradox for evaporating black holes
and, conversely, that ignoring this redundancy leads to paradoxes even in the
absence of black holes. We relate this perspective to recent computations of
the Page curve for holographic CFTs coupled to nongravitational baths. But we
argue that such models may provide an inaccurate picture of the rate at which
information can be extracted from evaporating black holes in asymptotically
flat space. We discuss large black holes dual to typical states in AdS/CFT and
the new paradoxes that arise in this setting. These paradoxes also extend to
the eternal black hole. They can be resolved by assuming that the map between
the boundary CFT and the black-hole interior is state dependent. We discuss the
consistency of state-dependent bulk reconstructions. We conclude by examining
the viability of arguments for firewalls, fuzzballs and other kinds of
structure at the horizon.

punctured Riemann sphere $\mathbb C \smallsetminus \{0\}$ using the
Loewner-Kufarev equation. We associate to such a foliation a function on the
plane that describes the ""local winding"" along each leaf. Our main theorem is
that this function has finite Dirichlet energy if and only if the Loewner
driving measure $\rho$ has finite Loewner-Kufarev energy, defined by $$S(\rho)
= \frac{1}{2}\int_{S^1 \times \mathbb{R}} \nu_t'(\theta)^2 \, d \theta d t$$
whenever $\rho$ is of the form $\nu_t(\theta)^2 d\theta dt$, and set to
$\infty$ otherwise. Moreover, if either of these two energies is finite they
are equal up to a constant factor and in this case the foliation leaves are
Weil-Petersson quasicircles.
  This duality between energies has several consequences. The first is that the
Loewner-Kufarev energy is reversible, that is, invariant with respect to
inversion and time-reversal of the foliation. Furthermore, the Loewner energy
of a Jordan curve can be expressed using the minimal Loewner-Kufarev energy of
those measures that generate the curve as a leaf. This provides a new and
quantitative characterization of Weil-Petersson quasicircles. Finally, we
consider conformal distortion of the foliation, and show that the
Loewner-Kufarev energy satisfies an exact transformation law involving the
Schwarzian derivative.
  The proof of our main result uses an isometry between the Dirichlet energy
space and $L^2(2\rho)$ that we construct using a version of Hadamard's formula
expressed by means of the Loewner-Kufarev equation. While our results and
methods use no probability theory, there are links to probabilistic models. In

the space $C^{k+n}_{m+m'}(V, \W)$, and satisfy an analogue of Leibniz formula.

important role in financial modelling, both in portfolio optimization and risk
management. Natural language processing today allows to process news and social
media comments to detect signals of investors' confidence. We have explored the
relationship between sentiment extracted from financial news and tweets and
FTSE100 movements. We investigated the strength of the correlation between
sentiment measures on a given day and market volatility and returns observed
the next day. The findings suggest that there is evidence of correlation
between sentiment and stock market movements: the sentiment captured from news
headlines could be used as a signal to predict market returns; the same does
not apply for volatility. Also, in a surprising finding, for the sentiment
found in Twitter comments we obtained a correlation coefficient of -0.7, and
p-value below 0.05, which indicates a strong negative correlation between
positive sentiment captured from the tweets on a given day and the volatility
observed the next day. We developed an accurate classifier for the prediction
of market volatility in response to the arrival of new information by deploying
topic modelling, based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to extract feature
vectors from a collection of tweets and financial news. The obtained features
were used as additional input to the classifier. Thanks to the combination of
sentiment and topic modelling our classifier achieved a directional prediction
accuracy for volatility of 63%.

  Recorder using Aircraft Dynamics and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","20 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accurate aircraft-mass estimation is critical to airlines from the
safety-management and performance-optimization viewpoints. Overloading an
aircraft with passengers and baggage might result in a safety hazard. In
contrast, not fully utilizing an aircraft's payload-carrying capacity
undermines its operational efficiency and airline profitability. However,
accurate determination of the aircraft mass for each operating flight is not
feasible because it is impractical to weigh each aircraft component, including
the payload. The existing methods for aircraft-mass estimation are dependent on
the aircraft- and engine-performance parameters, which are usually considered
proprietary information. Moreover, the values of these parameters vary under
different operating conditions while those of others might be subject to large
estimation errors. This paper presents a data-driven method involving use of
the quick access recorder (QAR)-a digital flight-data recorder-installed on all
aircrafts to record the initial aircraft climb mass during each flight. The
method requires users to select appropriate parameters among several thousand
others recorded by the QAR using physical models. The selected data are
subsequently processed and provided as input to a multilayer perceptron neural
network for building the model for initial-climb aircraft-mass prediction.
Thus, the proposed method offers the advantages of both the model-based and
data-driven approaches for aircraft-mass estimation. Because this method does
not explicitly rely on any aircraft or engine parameter, it is universally
applicable to all aircraft types. In this study, the proposed method was
applied to a set of Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts, the results of which
demonstrated reasonable accuracy. Airlines can use this tool to better utilize
aircraft's payload.

accuracy of a domain adaptation technique for the localization of multiple
sound sources. Recently, deep neural networks have led to promising results for
this task, yet they require a large amount of labeled data for training.
Recording and labeling such datasets is very costly, especially because data
needs to be diverse enough to cover different acoustic conditions. In this
paper, we leverage acoustic simulators to inexpensively generate labeled
training samples. However, models trained on synthetic data tend to perform
poorly with real-world recordings due to the domain mismatch. For this, we
explore two domain adaptation methods using adversarial learning for sound
source localization which use labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data.
We propose a novel ensemble approach that combines discriminators applied at
different feature levels of the localization model. Experiments show that our
ensemble discrimination method significantly improves the localization
performance without requiring any label from the real data.

  Learning","15 pages","International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021",,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Model-Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling complex,
real-world systems that uses a model to make predictions about future behavior.
For each state encountered, MPC solves an online optimization problem to choose
a control action that will minimize future cost. This is a surprisingly
effective strategy, but real-time performance requirements warrant the use of
simple models. If the model is not sufficiently accurate, then the resulting
controller can be biased, limiting performance. We present a framework for
improving on MPC with model-free reinforcement learning (RL). The key insight
is to view MPC as constructing a series of local Q-function approximations. We
show that by using a parameter $\lambda$, similar to the trace decay parameter
in TD($\lambda$), we can systematically trade-off learned value estimates
against the local Q-function approximations. We present a theoretical analysis
that shows how error from inaccurate models in MPC and value function
estimation in RL can be balanced. We further propose an algorithm that changes
$\lambda$ over time to reduce the dependence on MPC as our estimates of the
value function improve, and test the efficacy our approach on challenging
high-dimensional manipulation tasks with biased models in simulation. We
demonstrate that our approach can obtain performance comparable with MPC with
access to true dynamics even under severe model bias and is more sample
efficient as compared to model-free RL.

two independent baths of harmonic oscillators, we move to replacing it with a
large collection of such systems, thereby invoking the large spin-boson model.
Whereas each of our two-level systems interacts strongly with one of the
aforementioned baths, it interacts weakly with the other. A polaron
transformation is used to make it possible for the problem in the strong
coupling regime to be treated with perturbation theory. We find that the case
involving a single two-level system exhibits qualitative and quantitative
differences from the case involving a collection of them; however, the general
effects of strong and weak couplings turn out to be the same as those in the
presence of system evolution, something which allows us to establish that
system evolution has no practical bearing on any of these effects.

  Traffic and Environment","16 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Access",,,,"cs.OH cs.AI cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Verification and validation of automated driving functions impose large
challenges. Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research
and industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety
relevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex
real-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is
needed. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was
introduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM
and extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM
provides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore,
functions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model
enables a structured description and categorization of the general environment,
without incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors.
Beyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are
elaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network
and traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of
the former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information.
The work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are
formulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of
the model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous
publications, the model and its design are described in far more detail.
Finally, the holistic description of the 6LM presented includes remarks on
possible future work when expanding the concept to machine perception aspects.

field of AI is witnessing rapid transformations and is being integrated into
our everyday lives at an incredible pace. Any major failure in these system's
predictions could be devastating, leaking sensitive information or even costing
lives (as in the case of self-driving cars). However, deep neural networks,
which form the basis of such systems, are highly susceptible to a specific type
of attack, called adversarial attacks. A hacker can, even with bare minimum
computation, generate adversarial examples (images or data points that belong
to another class, but consistently fool the model to get misclassified as
genuine) and crumble the basis of such algorithms. In this paper, we compile
and test numerous approaches to defend against such adversarial attacks. Out of
the ones explored, we found two effective techniques, namely Dropout and
Denoising Autoencoders, and show their success in preventing such attacks from
fooling the model. We demonstrate that these techniques are also resistant to
both higher noise levels as well as different kinds of adversarial attacks
(although not tested against all). We also develop a framework for deciding the
suitable defense technique to use against attacks, based on the nature of the
application and resource constraints of the Deep Neural Network.

models have been successful in explaining this property of the solar NSSL,
while global direct convection models have been unsuccessful. We investigate
reason for this discrepancy by measuring the mean flows, Reynolds stress, and
turbulent transport coefficients under NSSL conditions. Simulations have
minimal ingredients. These ingredients are inhomogeneity due to boundaries,
anisotropic turbulence, and rotation. Parameters of the simulations are chosen
such they match the weakly rotationally constrained NSSL. The simulations probe
locally Cartesian patches of the star at a given depth and latitude. The depth
of the patch is varied by changing the rotation rate such that the resulting
Coriolis numbers<1. We measure the turbulent transport coefficient relevant for
the non-diffusive and diffusive parts of the Reynolds stress and compare them
with predictions of current mean-field theories. A negative radial gradient of
mean flow similar to the solar NSSL is generated only at the equator where
meridional flows are absent. At other latitudes the meridional flow is
comparable to the mean flow corresponding to differential rotation. We also
find that meridional components of the Reynolds stress cannot be ignored.
Additionally, we find that the turbulent viscosity is quenched by rotation by
about 50\% from the surface to the bottom of the NSSL. Our local simulations do
not validate the explanation for the generation of the NSSL from mean-field
theory where meridional stresses are neglected. However, the rotational
dependence of turbulent viscosity in our simulations is in good agreement with
theoretical prediction. Our results are in qualitative agreement with global
convection simulations in that a NSSL obtained near the equator.

conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient training

In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for
medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue
(Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed
Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the
novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed
method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant
Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not
well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant
Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even
when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop
a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and
chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19
lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the
proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains
which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution
shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\%

fundamental physics theory based on cellular automaton interpretation (CAI).
First, assuming that we can calculate the time-evolved cellular automaton (CA)
for any initial CA by knowing the time-evolution law of the given system, we
will show that there exists a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
that can learn the time-evolution law of this system with only the calculated
data set for a certain example. Finding a CNN architecture that can learn CA is
equivalent to showing that a time-varying time-evolution operator can be
represented as a finite composition of time-independent linear functions and
ReLU type non-linear functions. As a concrete example, block CA, which is time
reversible and expressed as a matrix multiplication that changes with time,
will be used as the time-evolution law, and the CNN architecture that can learn
this evolution law will be proposed. However, by the universal approximation
theorem, even with data of arbitrary quantum systems, if the depth of the
network is deep enough, a CNN architecture that can learn actual rules can be
found, regardless of the Hamiltonian, and therefore, the time-evolution law can
be consistently expressed as a CNN. Also, since the convolution layer can be
expressed in a covariant form, it could be helpful to find a CNN architecture
that can learn the evolution law for a data set that includes gravity.
Meanwhile, it will be shown that if the activation function of the first and
last hidden layer is bypass, the CNN can be trained to include the
corresponding part of the probabilistic interpretation in conventional quantum
mechanics. Finally, for the CA model in which the dimensional reduction in
quantum gravity is first presented, we will discuss the CNN architecture that
can find the non-trivial evolution law in a deductive way.

differential equation that has only one independent variable is called an
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), and all derivatives in it are taken with
respect to that variable. Most often, the variable is time, t; although, I will
use x in this paper as the independent variable. The differential equation
where the unknown function depends on two or more variables is referred to as
Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Ordinary differential equations can be
solved by a variety of methods, analytical and numerical. Although there are
many analytic methods for finding the solution of differential equations, there
exist quite a number of differential equations that cannot be solved
analytically [8]. This means that the solution cannot be expressed as the sum
of a finite number of elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials,
trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions). For simple differential equations, it
is possible to find closed form solutions [9]. But many differential equations
arising in applications are so complicated that it is sometimes impractical to
have solution formulas; or at least if a solution formula is available, it may
involve integrals that can be calculated only by using a numerical quadrature
formula. In either case, numerical methods provide a powerful alternative tool
for solving the differential equations under the prescribed initial condition
or conditions [9]. In this paper, I present the basic and commonly used
numerical and analytical methods of solving ordinary differential equations.

of this research work is to create a framework, which can convert clinical text
into causal knowledge. Methods: A practical approach based on term expansion,
phrase generation, BERT based phrase embedding and semantic matching, semantic
enrichment, expert verification, and model evolution has been used to construct
a comprehensive causality mining framework. This active transfer learning based
framework along with its supplementary services, is able to extract and enrich,
causal relationships and their corresponding entities from clinical text.
Results: The multi-model transfer learning technique when applied over multiple

provide causality detection in other domains, as well. Significance: The
presented framework is generic enough to be utilized in any domain, healthcare

that utilizes a large set of feature tokens. As an example, this approach is
used to identify documents studying female sex workers that are assumed to
contain content relevant to either HIV or violence. We compare the performance
of the three classifiers by cross-validation and conduct a sensitivity analysis
on the portion of data utilized in training the model. Results: The random
forest approach provides the highest area under the curve (AUC) for both
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision/recall (PR). Analyses of
precision and recall suggest that random forest could facilitate manually
reviewing 20\% of the articles while containing 80\% of the relevant cases.

generative approaches often do not meet the stringent latency requirements of
responding to each user keystroke. Moreover, these generative approaches pose
the risk of showing nonsensical queries.
  In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem: we take the novel
approach of modeling session-aware QAC as an eXtreme Multi-Label Ranking (XMR)
problem where the input is the previous query in the session and the user's
current prefix, while the output space is the set of tens of millions of
queries entered by users in the recent past. We adapt a popular XMR algorithm

algorithm. The proposed modifications yield a 3.9x improvement in terms of Mean

dataset. We are able to maintain an inference latency of less than 10 ms while
still using session context. When compared against baseline models of
acceptable latency, we observed a 33% improvement in MRR for short prefixes of

analyzed, which considered the issues of designing the learning environment
using green computing. As a result, Cloud LMS has been established that cloud
LMS is a type of green IT and can serve as a tool for designing a
cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education
institution. A model of a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a
higher education institution using cloud LMS is proposed. The application of a
cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment will provide such capabilities:
keep electronic journals; use on-line services; conduct correspondence,
assessment of knowledge on-line; and more. And all of the above is the key to a
sustainable development of the learning environment.

  Envelopment Analysis",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transit monitoring is a preventative approach used to identify possible cases
of human trafficking prior to exploitation while an individual is in transit or
before one crosses a border. Transit monitoring is often conducted by
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who train staff to identify and intercept
suspicious activity. Love Justice International (LJI) is a well-established NGO
that has been conducting transit monitoring for years along the Nepal-India
border at multiple monitoring stations. In partnership with LJI, we developed a
system that uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to help LJI decision-makers
evaluate the performance of these stations at intercepting potential
human-trafficking victims given the amount of resources (e.g. staff, etc.)
available and make specific operational improvement recommendations. Our model
consists of 91 decision-making units (DMUs) from 7 stations over 13 quarters
and considers three inputs, four outputs, and 3 homogeneity criteria. Using
this model we identified efficient stations, compared rankings of station
performance, and recommended strategies to improve efficiency. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first application of DEA in the anti-human
trafficking domain.

wavelength and of the signal power to form tunable activation functions of the
single nodes in the complex valued network. Training of the network is achieved
by a particle swarm optimizer which selects the complex weights and the
activation functions. We demonstrate that a single feed-forward layer with a
single node perceptron is effective in compensating linear and nonlinear
distortions over a broad range of signal-to-noise-ratio and propagation
lengths. We propose to implement this simple neuronal network as an optical

  Framework for COVID-19 Detection using Ensembles of Networks",,,,,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which started in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, continues to spread rapidly affecting the whole world. It is
essential to have a highly sensitive diagnostic screening tool to detect the
disease as early as possible. Currently, chest CT imaging is preferred as the
primary screening tool for evaluating the COVID-19 pneumonia by radiological
imaging. However, CT imaging requires larger radiation doses, longer exposure
time, higher cost, and may suffer from patient movements. X-Ray imaging is a
fast, cheap, more patient-friendly and available in almost every healthcare
facility. Therefore, we have focused on X-Ray images and developed an
end-to-end deep learning model, i.e. Ensemble-CVDNet, to distinguish COVID-19
pneumonia from non-COVID pneumonia and healthy cases in this work. The proposed
model is based on a combination of three lightweight pre-trained models
SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet-B0 at different depths, and combines
feature maps in different abstraction levels. In the proposed end to-end model,
networks are used as feature extractors in parallel after fine-tuning, and some
additional layers are used at the top of them. The proposed model is evaluated
in the COVID-19 Radiography Database, a public data set consisting of 219
COVID-19, 1341 Healthy, and 1345 Viral Pneumonia chest X-Ray images.
Experimental results show that our lightweight Ensemble-CVDNet model provides
98.30% accuracy, 97.78% sensitivity, and 97.61% F1 score using only 5.62M
parameters. Moreover, it takes about 10ms to process and predict an X-Ray image
using the proposed method using a mid level GPU. We believe that the method
proposed in this study can be a helpful diagnostic screening tool for
radiologists in the early diagnosis of the disease.

a high evolutionary advantage by facilitating formation of a detailed picture

acquiring input from non-contact audio-visual means to contact based input via
pressure and temperature. The ambit of sensing can be extended further by
imparting the body with increased non-contact sensing capability through the
phenomenon of electrostatics. Here we present graphene-based tattoo sensor for
proximity sensing, employing the principle of electrostatic gating. The sensor
shows a remarkable change in resistance upon exposure to objects surrounded
with static charge on them. Compared to prior work in this field, the sensor
has demonstrated the highest recorded proximity detection range of 20 cm. It is
ultra-thin, highly skin conformal and comes with a facile transfer process such
that it can be tattooed on highly curvilinear rough substrates like the human
skin, unlike other graphene-based proximity sensors reported before. Present
work details the operation of wearable proximity sensor while exploring the
effect of mounting body on the working mechanism. A possible role of the sensor
as an alerting system against unwarranted contact with objects in public places
especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has also been explored in the
form of an LED bracelet whose color is controlled by the proximity sensor
attached to it.

NST combines two pictures, a content picture and a reference image in style
(such as the work of a renowned painter) in a way that makes the output image
look like an image of the material, but rendered with the form of a reference
picture. However, there is no study using the artwork or painting of
Bangladeshi painters. Bangladeshi painting has a long history of more than two
thousand years and is still being practiced by Bangladeshi painters. This study
generates NST stylized image on Bangladeshi paintings and analyzes the human
point of view regarding the aesthetic preference of NST on Bangladeshi
paintings. To assure our study's acceptance, we performed qualitative human
evaluations on generated stylized images by 60 individual humans of different
age and gender groups. We have explained how NST works for Bangladeshi
paintings and assess NST algorithms, both qualitatively \& quantitatively. Our
study acts as a pre-requisite for the impact of NST stylized image using
Bangladeshi paintings on mobile UI/GUI and material translation from the human
perspective. We hope that this study will encourage new collaborations to
create more NST related studies and expand the use of Bangladeshi artworks.

photo-realistic images of objects that ""do not exist."" These synthetic images
are rather difficult to detect as fake. However, the manner in which these
generative models are trained hints at a potential for information leakage from
the supplied training data, especially in the context of synthetic faces. This
paper presents experiments suggesting that identity information in face images
can flow from the training corpus into synthetic samples without any
adversarial actions when building or using the existing model. This raises
privacy-related questions, but also stimulates discussions of (a) the face
manifold's characteristics in the feature space and (b) how to create
generative models that do not inadvertently reveal identity information of real
subjects whose images were used for training. We used five different face
matchers (face_recognition, FaceNet, ArcFace, SphereFace and Neurotechnology
MegaMatcher) and the StyleGAN2 synthesis model, and show that this identity
leakage does exist for some, but not all methods. So, can we say that these
synthetically generated faces truly do not exist? Databases of real and
synthetically generated faces are made available with this paper to allow full
replicability of the results discussed in this work.
