improvements in single and binary stellar evolution models, as well as
previously unpublished data prompted us to revisit the progenitor of
low-luminosity type II-Plateau supernova, SN 2008bk. Using mid-IR data in
combination with dust models, we find that high temperature (4250-4500 K), high
extinction (E(B-V)>0.7) solutions are incompatible with the data. We therefore
favour a cool (~3500-3700 K) progenitor with a luminosity of log(L/Lsun)~4.53.
Comparing with evolutionary tracks, we infer progenitor masses in the 8-10 Msun
range in agreement with some previous studies. This mass is consistent with the
observed pattern of low-luminosity Type IIP SNe coming from the explosion of
RSGs at the lower extremum for core-collapse. We also present multi-epoch data
of the progenitor, but do not find clear evidence of variability.

  Platforms","Manuscript submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous computing is one of the most important computational solutions
to meet rapidly increasing demands on system performance. It typically allows
the main flow of applications to be executed on a CPU while the most
computationally intensive tasks are assigned to one or more accelerators, such
as GPUs and FPGAs. The refactoring of systems for execution on such platforms
is highly desired but also difficult to perform, mainly due the inherent
increase in software complexity. After exploration, we have identified a
current need for a systematic approach that supports engineers in the
refactoring process -- from CPU-centric applications to software that is
executed on heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we introduce a decision
framework that assists engineers in the task of refactoring software to
incorporate heterogeneous platforms. It covers the software engineering
lifecycle through five steps, consisting of questions to be answered in order
to successfully address aspects that are relevant for the refactoring
procedure. We evaluate the feasibility of the framework in two ways. First, we
capture the practitioner's impressions, concerns and suggestions through a
questionnaire. Then, we conduct a case study showing the step-by-step
application of the framework using a computer vision application in the
automotive domain.

addition, many of the current methods fail to address the uncertainty in the
linkage, which may result in overly precise estimates of relationships between
variables that are exclusive to one of the files. Bayesian methods for record
linkage can reduce the bias in the estimation of scientific relationships of
interest and provide interval estimates that account for the uncertainty in the
linkage; however, implementation of these methods can often be complex and
computationally intensive. This article presents the gfs_sampler package for
the Python programming language that utilizes a Bayesian approach for file
linkage. The linking procedure implemented in gfs_sampler samples from the
joint posterior distribution of model parameters and the linking permutations.
The algorithm approaches file linkage as a missing data problem and generates
multiple linked data sets. For computational efficiency, only the linkage
permutations are stored and multiple analyses are performed using each of the
permutations separately. This implementation reduces the computational
complexity of the linking process and the expertise required of researchers
analyzing linked data sets. We describe the algorithm implemented in the

models. They are very large which makes it necessary to break each image down
into smaller patches for analysis, image features have to be extracted at
multiple scales in order to capture both detail and context, and extreme class
imbalances may exist. Significant progress has been made in the analysis of
these images, thanks largely due to the availability of public annotated
datasets. We postulate, however, that even if a method scores well on a
challenge task, this success may not translate to good performance in a more
clinically relevant workflow. Many datasets consist of image patches which may
suffer from data curation bias; other datasets are only labelled at the whole
slide level and the lack of annotations across an image may mask erroneous
local predictions so long as the final decision is correct. In this paper, we
outline the differences between patch or slide-level classification versus
methods that need to localize or segment cancer accurately across the whole
slide, and we experimentally verify that best practices differ in both cases.
We apply a binary cancer detection network on post neoadjuvant therapy breast
cancer WSIs to find the tumor bed outlining the extent of cancer, a task which
requires sensitivity and precision across the whole slide. We extensively study
multiple design choices and their effects on the outcome, including
architectures and augmentations. Furthermore, we propose a negative data
sampling strategy, which drastically reduces the false positive rate (7% on
slide level) and improves each metric pertinent to our problem, with a 15%
reduction in the error of tumor extent.

motion. Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and
graphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D
joint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean
formulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint
rotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose,
leaving degrees of freedom undefined, making it hard to animate a realistic
human from only the joints. Note that the 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse
point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as point
cloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of
locations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given
such markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D shape and pose
of the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information
about human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the
naturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO,
which is a novel variational autoencoder that generates motions from latent
frequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion,
and sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency
components into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods
accumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from
true human bodies. To address this, we fit SMPL-X to the predictions at each
time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies. These
valid markers are then propagated in time. Experiments show that our method
produces state-of-the-art results and realistic 3D body animations. The code

Although their dynamics cannot be understood rigorously using perturbative
methods, their dominant effect on physical observables can be estimated in
singular configurations sensitive to the emission of soft radiation. The
differential distributions of some event-shape variables, notably the $C$
parameter, feature two such singular points. We analytically compute the
leading non-perturbative correction in the symmetric three-jet limit for the
$C$ parameter, and find that it differs by more than a factor of two from the
known result in the two-jet limit. We estimate the impact of this result on
strong coupling extractions, considering a range of functions to interpolate
the hadronisation correction in the region between the 2 and 3-jet limits.
Fitting data from ALEPH and JADE, we find that most interpolation choices
increase the extracted $\alpha_s$, with effects of up to $4\%$ relative to
standard fits. This brings a new perspective on the long-standing discrepancy

EuFe2As2 exhibits by far the largest magnetostructural coupling due to the
sizable biquadratic interaction between Eu and Fe moments. While the coupling
between Eu antiferromagnetic order and Fe structural/antiferromagnetic domains
enables rapid field detwinning, this prevents simple magnetometry measurements
from extracting the critical fields of the Eu metamagnetic transition. Here we
measure these critical fields by combining x-ray magnetic circular dichroism
spectroscopy with in-situ tunable uniaxial stress and applied magnetic field.
The combination of two tuning knobs allows us to separate the stress-detwinning
of structural domains from the field-induced reorientation of Eu moments.
Intriguingly, we find a spin-flip transition which can only result from a
strongly anisotropic interaction between Eu planes. We argue that this
anisotropic exchange is a consequence of the strong anisotropy in the
magnetically ordered Fe layer, which presents a new form of higher-order
coupling between Eu and Fe magnetism.

state-of-the-art low- and high-bandgap perovskite films for tandems to quantify
intrinsic recombination rates and absorption coefficients. We apply these data
to calculate the limiting efficiency of perovskite-silicon and all-perovskite
two-terminal tandems employing currently available bandgap materials as 42.0 %
and 40.8 % respectively. By including luminescence coupling between sub-cells,
i.e. the re-emission of photons from the high-bandgap sub-cell and their
absorption in the low-bandgap sub-cell, we reveal the stringent need for
current matching is relaxed when the high-bandgap sub-cell is a luminescent
perovskite compared to calculations that do not consider luminescence coupling.
We show luminescence coupling becomes important in all-perovskite tandems when
charge carrier trapping rates are < 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to carrier
lifetimes longer than 1 ${\mu}$s at low excitation densities) in the
high-bandgap sub-cell, which is lowered to 10$^{5}$ s$^{-1}$ in the
better-bandgap-matched perovskite-silicon cells. We demonstrate luminescence
coupling endows greater flexibility in both sub-cell thicknesses, increased
tolerance to different spectral conditions and a reduction in the total
thickness of light absorbing layers. To maximally exploit luminescence coupling
we reveal a key design rule for luminescent perovskite-based tandems: the
high-bandgap sub-cell should always have the higher short-circuit current.
Importantly, this can be achieved by reducing the bandgap or increasing the
thickness in the high-bandgap sub-cell with minimal reduction in efficiency,
thus allowing for wider, unstable bandgap compositions (>1.7 eV) to be avoided.
Finally, we experimentally visualise luminescence coupling in an all-perovskite
tandem device stack through cross-section luminescence images.

many novel properties compared to conventional correlators in Lorentzian

the case where two detectors moving relative to one another are used to observe
the particle and antiparticle of the same pair. We find that each detector will
still observe nucleation to occur in its rest frame, regardless of the motion
of the other detector. However, if the relative velocity of the two detectors
is sufficiently high, the particle and antiparticle of the pair can be observed
moving towards one another with arbitrarily large momenta, contrary to the

well as to produce giant vortex at the center within the vortex-pattern

exact numerical solution of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) formalism.
By comparing the TF predictions with exact GP solutions, in our investigation
with two different quartic-quadratic trap geometries, of particular relevance
is to observe that the TF approach is not only very useful to display the
averaged density distribution, but also quite realistic in establishing the
critical rotational conditions for the breakup occurrence and possible
giant-vortex formation. It provides almost exact results to define the contour
of the condensate distribution, even for high rotating system, after the system
split in two (still confined) clouds. The applicability of the Feynman rule to
the vortex distribution (full-numerical GP solutions) is also being confirmed
for these non-homogeneous asymmetric trap configurations. This study is
expected to be relevant for manipulating the rotation and trap parameters in
addition to Feshbach resonance techniques. It can also be helpful to define
initial conditions for any further studies on dynamical evolution of vortex
pattern distributions.

significantly lower than those obtained through classical numerical
discretizations (e.g., finite element, finite difference, finite volume, or
spectral methods). Thus, ROMs have been used to accelerate numerical
simulations of many query problems, e.g., uncertainty quantification, control,
and shape optimization. Projection-based ROMs have been particularly successful
in the numerical simulation of fluid flows. In this brief survey, we summarize
some recent ROM developments for the quasi-geostrophic equations (QGE) (also
known as the barotropic vorticity equations), which are a simplified model for
geophysical flows in which rotation plays a central role, such as wind-driven
ocean circulation in mid-latitude ocean basins. Since the QGE represent a
practical compromise between efficient numerical simulations of ocean flows and
accurate representations of large scale ocean dynamics, these equations have
often been used in the testing of new numerical methods for ocean flows. ROMs
have also been tested on the QGE for various settings in order to understand
their potential in efficient numerical simulations of ocean flows. In this
paper, we survey the ROMs developed for the QGE in order to understand their
potential in efficient numerical simulations of more complex ocean flows: We
explain how classical numerical methods for the QGE are used to generate the
ROM basis functions, we outline the main steps in the construction of
projection-based ROMs (with a particular focus on the under-resolved regime,
when the closure problem needs to be addressed), we illustrate the ROMs in the
numerical simulation of the QGE for various settings, and we present several
potential future research avenues in the ROM exploration of the QGE and more
complex models of geophysical flows.

the empirical studies emulates the future fifth-generation cellular systems for
both access and backhaul services, as well as for device-to-device
communications. Based on the measurement data collected in sunny weather with
intense solar activities, we developed large-scale propagation path loss models
at 60 GHz, and observed the effects of solar radio emissions on the path loss
data. It is shown that solar radio emission can decrease carrier-to-noise
ratio, and that this translates into a corresponding increase in the path loss
exponent (PLE) values for the large-scale propagation path loss channel models.
Empirical data show that 9.0%-15.6% higher PLE values were observed in hot and
sunny weather during the day (41{\deg}-42 {\deg}C) compared with the
counterpart measurements taken at night in cool and clear weather (20{\deg}-38

coverage in hot and sunny weather during the day. The empirical data are
closely corroborated by analytical estimates presented.

mechanics to extract flow fields from images. Recently, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been used to perform PIV analysis with accuracy on par
with classical methods. Here we extend the use of CNNs to analyze PIV data
while providing simultaneous uncertainty quantification on the inferred flow
field. The method we apply in this paper is a Bayesian convolutional neural
network (BCNN) which learns distributions of the CNN weights through
variational Bayes. We compare the performance of three different BCNN models.
The first network estimates flow velocity from image interrogation regions
only. Our second model learns to infer velocity from both the image
interrogation regions and interrogation region cross-correlation maps. Finally,
our best performing network derives velocities from interrogation region
cross-correlation maps only. We find that BCNNs using interrogation region
cross-correlation maps as inputs perform better than those using interrogation
windows only as inputs and discuss reasons why this may be the case.
Additionally, we test the best performing BCNN on a full test image pair,
showing that 100% of true particle displacements can be captured within its 95%
confidence interval. Finally, we show that BCNNs can be generalized to be used
with multi-pass PIV algorithms with a moderate loss in accuracy, which may be
overcome by future work on finetuning and training schemes. To our knowledge,
this is the first effort to use Bayesian neural networks to perform particle
image velocimetry.

the last years. An important aspect in the development of AVs is the assessment
of their safety. New approaches need to be worked out. Among these, real-world
scenario-based assessment is widely supported by many players in the automotive
field. Scenario-based assessment allows for using virtual simulation tools in
addition to physical tests, such as on a test track, proving ground, or public
road.
  We propose a procedure for real-world scenario-based road-approval assessment
considering three stakeholders: the applicant, the assessor, and the (road or
vehicle) authority. The challenges are as follows. Firstly, the tests need to
be tailored to the operational design domain (ODD) and dynamic driving task
(DDT) description of the AV. Secondly, it is assumed that the applicant does
not want to disclose all of the detailed test results because of proprietary or
confidential information contained in these results. Thirdly, due to the
complex ODD and DDT, many test scenarios are required to obtain sufficient
confidence in the assessment of the AV. Consequently, it is assumed that due to
limited resources, it is infeasible for the assessor to conduct all (physical)
tests.
  We propose a systematic approach for determining the tests that are based on
the requirements set by the authority and the AV's ODD and DDT description,
such that the tests are tailored to the applicable ODD and DDT. Each test comes
with metrics that enables the applicant to provide a performance rating of the
AV for each of the tests. By only providing a performance rating for each test,
the applicant does not need to disclose the details of the test results. In our
proposed procedure, the assessor only conducts a limited number of tests. The
main purpose of these tests is to verify the fidelity of the results provided
by the applicant.

control a system composed of several components and has access to only partial
information on the state of each component. Such problems are difficult because
of the partial observations, and because of the curse of dimensionality that
appears when the number of components increases. Partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs) have been introduced to deal with the first
challenge, while weakly coupled stochastic dynamic programs address the second.
Drawing from these two branches of the literature, we introduce the notion of
weakly coupled POMDPs. The objective is to find a policy maximizing the total
expected reward over a finite horizon. Our algorithms rely on two ingredients.
The first, which can be used independently, is a mixed integer linear
formulation for generic POMDPs that computes an optimal memoryless policy. The
formulation is strengthened with valid cuts based on a probabilistic
interpretation of the dependence between random variables, and its linear
relaxation provide a practically tight upper bound on the value of an optimal
history-dependent policies. The second is a collection of mathematical
programming formulations and algorithms which provide tractable policies and
upper bounds for weakly coupled POMDPs. Lagrangian relaxations, fluid
approximations, and almost sure constraints relaxations enable to break the
curse of dimensionality. We test our generic POMDPs formulations on benchmark
instance forms the literature, and our weakly coupled POMDP algorithms on a
maintenance problem. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of our approach.

problem. Such ill-posed inverse problems are typically regularized using prior
knowledge of the sought-after object property. Recently, deep neural networks
have been actively investigated for regularizing image reconstruction problems
by learning a prior for the object properties from training images. However, an
analysis of the prior information learned by these deep networks and their
ability to generalize to data that may lie outside the training distribution is
still being explored. An inaccurate prior might lead to false structures being
hallucinated in the reconstructed image and that is a cause for serious concern
in medical imaging. In this work, we propose to illustrate the effect of the
prior imposed by a reconstruction method by decomposing the image estimate into
generalized measurement and null components. The concept of a hallucination map
is introduced for the general purpose of understanding the effect of the prior
in regularized reconstruction methods. Numerical studies are conducted
corresponding to a stylized tomographic imaging modality. The behavior of
different reconstruction methods under the proposed formalism is discussed with
the help of the numerical studies.

adaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly
learn to transport the source style code to the target style code while
preserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation
methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided
unpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons
demonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content

collaboratively learn a global model under the orchestration of a central
server while keeping privacy-sensitive data locally. The
non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data samples across
participating nodes slow model training and impose additional communication
rounds for FL to converge. In this paper, we propose Federated Adaptive
Weighting (FedAdp) algorithm that aims to accelerate model convergence under
the presence of nodes with non-IID dataset. We observe the implicit connection
between the node contribution to the global model aggregation and data
distribution on the local node through theoretical and empirical analysis. We
then propose to assign different weights for updating the global model based on
node contribution adaptively through each training round. The contribution of
participating nodes is first measured by the angle between the local gradient
vector and the global gradient vector, and then, weight is quantified by a
designed non-linear mapping function subsequently. The simple yet effective
strategy can reinforce positive (suppress negative) node contribution
dynamically, resulting in communication round reduction drastically. Its
superiority over the commonly adopted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is verified
both theoretically and experimentally. With extensive experiments performed in
Pytorch and PySyft, we show that FL training with FedAdp can reduce the number
of communication rounds by up to 54.1% on MNIST dataset and up to 45.4% on
FashionMNIST dataset, as compared to FedAvg algorithm.

submillimeter dMRI is the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While
approaches capable of mitigating the low SNR in high resolution dMRI have been
proposed, namely simultaneous multi-slab (SMSlab) and generalized slice
dithered enhanced resolution with simultaneous multislice (gSlider-SMS),
limitations are associated with these approaches. The SMSlab sequences suffer
from the slab boundary artifacts and require additional navigators for phase
estimation. On the other hand, gSlider sequences require relatively high RF
power and peak amplitude, which increase the SAR and complicate the RF
excitation. In this work, we developed a navigator-free multishot-encoded
simultaneous multi-slice (MUSIUM) imaging approach on a 3T MR scanner,
achieving enhanced SNR, low RF power and peak amplitude, and being free from
slab boundary artifacts. The dMRI with ultrahigh resolution (0.86 mm isotropic
resolution), whole brain coverage and ~12.5 minute acquisition time were
achieved, revealing detailed structures at cortical and white matter areas. The
simulated and in vivo results also demonstrated that the MUSIUM imaging was

promising approach to achieve submillimeter diffusion imaging on 3T MR scanners

amorphous precursor deposited at the solidification front. We show that with
appropriate choice of the model parameters microstructures similar to those

representations for novel faces - have been studied only in coarse detail and
disregarding individual differences between learners. In their seminal study,
(Tanaka, Curran, Porterfield, & Collins, 2006) required the identification of a
particular novel face across 70 trials and found that the N250 component in the
ERP became more negative from the first to the second half of the experiment,
where it reached a similar amplitude as a well-known face. We were unable to
directly replicate this finding in our study when we used the original split of
trials. However, when we applied a different split of trials we observed very
similar changes in N250 amplitude. Then, we developed and applied a new
two-step explorative-confirmative non-parametric method based on permutation
testing to determine the time course of face individuation in individual
participants based on single-trial N250 amplitudes. We show that the assumption
of a steep initial increase of N250 amplitude across multiple presentations of
the target face, followed by a plateau, yields plausible results in fitting
linear trends for most participants. The transition point from initial
acquisition to the plateau phase differed strongly between participants and
tended to be earlier when performance in target face recognition was better.
Hence, face individuation may be accounted for by a biphasic process of early,
fast acquisition, followed by a slower, asymptotic consolidation or maintenance
phase. The current approach might be fruitfully applied to further
investigations into face individuation and their neural correlates

similar strength, which produce two clear orthogonal polarization angle tracks.
When viewed on a Poincare sphere, the emission is composed of two flux patches
that rotate meridionally as function of pulse longitude and pass through the
Stokes V poles, which results in transitions between orthogonal polarization
modes (OPMs). Moreover, the ratio of power in the patches is inversed once
within the profile window. It is shown that the meridional circularization is
caused by a coherent OPM transition (COMT) produced by a varying mode ratio at
a fixed quarter-wave phase lag. The COMTs may be ubiquitous and difficult to
detect in radio pulsar data, because they can leave no trace in polarized
fractions and they are described by equation similar to the rotating vector
model. The circularization, which coincides with flux minima at lower
frequency, requires that profile components are formed by radiation with an
oscillation phase which increases with longitude in steps of 90 degrees per
component. The properties can be understood as an interference pattern
involving two pairs of linear orthogonal modes (or two nonorthogonal elliptic
waves). The frequency-dependent coherent superposition of coplanar oscillations
can produce the minima in the pulse profile, and thereby the illusion of
components as separate entities. The orthogonally polarized signal which is
left after such negative interference explains the enhancement of polarization
degree which is commonly observed in the minima between profile components.

modelling (FEM) for multiaxial ferroelectric nanoparticle cores covered with an
elastically-isotropic soft or elastically-anisotropic rigid paraelectric shell,
with and without mismatch strains. In the case of a core covered with a soft
shell, the FEM results show that at room temperature a single polarization
vortex with a dipolar kernel can be stable if the electrostriction coupling is
weak. With increasing anisotropic electrostriction coupling, the vortex
disappears and is replaced by complex flux-closure structures, which are formed
in the equatorial plane and transform into an elongated vortex with a central
180-degree domain wall near the core poles. This complex domain morphology
develops in the core due to the anisotropic electrostriction, and the
flexoelectric coupling leads to an additional curvature and twist of the
polarization isosurfaces. In contrast to this, FEM performed for a core covered
with a rigid shell shows that, at room temperature, the anisotropic elastic
properties of the shell can stabilize vortex-like structures with three
flux-closure domains, which gradually cross in the equatorial plane of the core
and transform into 120-degree domains near the core poles. The flexoelectric
coupling leads to a noticeable curling of the flux-closure domain walls. A
mismatch strain compensates the curling of the flux-closure domains in the core
confined by the elastically-anisotropic rigid shell. Our analysis reveals
different types of topological defects, namely Bloch point structures (BPS) and
Ising lines, that form in a ferroelectric core covered with a soft or rigid
shell.

structured, and high dimensional (e.g., image and text), for which the
conventional deep auto-encoding latent variable models such as the Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) often suffer from difficulty of accurate decoder training or
realistic synthesis. A suboptimally trained decoder can potentially harm the
model's capability of identifying the true factors. In this paper we propose a
novel idea of the implicit decoder, which completely removes the ambient data
decoding module from a latent variable model, via implicit encoder inversion
that is achieved by Jacobian regularization of the low-dimensional embedding
function. Motivated from the recent Identifiable VAE (IVAE) model, we modify it
to incorporate the query modality data as conditioning auxiliary input, which
allows us to prove that the true parameters of the model can be identified
under some regularity conditions. Tested on various datasets where the true
factors are fully/partially available, our model is shown to identify the
factors accurately, significantly outperforming conventional encoder-decoder
latent variable models. We also test our model on the Recipe1M, the large-scale
food image/recipe dataset, where the learned factors by our approach highly
coincide with the most pronounced food factors that are widely agreed on,

phenomenological relevance in most of the scattering processes in particle
physics. On the contrary, it is particularly harmful for P_T-integrated
charmonium hadroproduction which renders a wide class of NLO results
essentially unusable. Indeed, in such processes, alphaS is not so small, the
PDFs are not evolved much and can be rather flat for the corresponding momentum

in $\mathbb{R}^d$ s.t. for any query range from a family of constant complexity
semialgebraic sets, all the points intersecting the range can be reported or
counted efficiently. When the ranges are composed of simplices, the problem can
be solved using $S(n)$ space and with $Q(n)$ query time with $S(n)Q^d(n) =
\tilde{O}(n^d)$ and this trade-off is almost tight. Consequently, there exists
low space structures that use $\tilde{O}(n)$ space with $O(n^{1-1/d})$ query
time and fast query structures that use $O(n^d)$ space with $O(\log^{d} n)$
query time. However, for the general semialgebraic ranges, only low space
solutions are known, but the best solutions match the same trade-off curve as
the simplex queries. It has been conjectured that the same could be done for
the fast query case but this open problem has stayed unresolved.
  Here, we disprove this conjecture. We give the first nontrivial lower bounds
for semilagebraic range searching and related problems. We show that any data
structure for reporting the points between two concentric circles with $Q(n)$
query time must use $S(n)=\Omega(n^{3-o(1)}/Q(n)^5)$ space, meaning, for
$Q(n)=O(\log^{O(1)}n)$, $\Omega(n^{3-o(1)})$ space must be used. We also study
the problem of reporting the points between two polynomials of form
$Y=\sum_{i=0}^\Delta a_i X^i$ where $a_0, \cdots, a_\Delta$ are given at the
query time. We show $S(n)=\Omega(n^{\Delta+1-o(1)}/Q(n)^{\Delta^2+\Delta})$. So
for $Q(n)=O(\log^{O(1)}n)$, we must use $\Omega(n^{\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space. For
the dual semialgebraic stabbing problems, we show that in linear space, any
data structure that solves 2D ring stabbing must use $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ query
time. This almost matches the linearization upper bound. For general
semialgebraic slab stabbing problems, again, we show an almost tight lower
bounds.

estimators of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the true posterior from the
prior by recycling samples used in the objective, with which we train models of

that the plasmonic substrate provides strong coupling with the C=O vibrational

the plasmon resonance allows for simultaneous strong coupling to two,
orthogonal water symmetric and asymmetric vibrational modes in a thin film of
copper sulfate monohydrate deposited on the substrate surface. A
three-coupled-oscillator model is developed to analyze the coupling strength of
the plasmon resonance with these two water modes. With precise control over the
nanodisk diameter, the plasmon resonance is tuned systematically through the
modes, with the coupling strength to both modes varying as a function of the
plasmon frequency, and with strong coupling to both modes achieved
simultaneously for a range of diameters. This work may aid further studies into

free gravitational Lagrangians as products of two Yang-Mills Lagrangians, in a
form amenable to be easily extended to the massive case. We discuss the origin
of these results from tensionless strings and show the existence of gauge
fixings that mix the two spin-one sectors and lead to an alternative,
especially simple, version of the free Lagrangian. We then construct cubic
vertices for the full double-copy multiplet, comprising a graviton, a two-form

at the cubic level the result gets uniquely fixed only upon imposing, on top of
gauge invariance, a left-right Lorentz symmetry ruling contraction of indices

unitary quantum channels (Nielsen and Chuang's No-Programming Theorem), meaning
that a universal programmable quantum processor does not exist. The situation
changes if the system has symmetries. Indeed, here we consider group-covariant
channels. If the group acts irreducibly on the channel input, these channels
can be implemented exactly by a programmable quantum processor with finite
program dimension (via teleportation simulation, which uses the
Choi-Jamiolkowski state of the channel as a program). Moreover, by leveraging
the representation theory of the symmetry group action, we show how to remove
redundancy in the program and prove that the resulting program register has
minimum Hilbert space dimension. Furthermore, we provide upper and lower bounds
on the program register dimension of a processor implementing all
group-covariant channels approximately.

filling gaps. In his argument, there were two completely separated computers in

computer supplies a stream of random numbers to the two computers representing
the two measurement stations in Bell's work. One could also imagine that
computer replaced by a cloned, virtual computer, generating the same
pseudo-random numbers within each of Alice and Bob's computers. Either way, we
need an assumption of the presence of shared i.i.d. randomness in the form of a
synchronised sequence of realisations of i.i.d. hidden variables underlying the
otherwise deterministic physics of the sequence of trials. Gull's proof then
just needs a third step: rewriting an expectation as the expectation of a

quantifying the proportion of disagreement in business and consumer
expectations of eleven European countries and the Euro Area.First, we compute
three independent indices of discrepancy corresponding to three dimensions of
uncertainty (economic, inflation and employment) and we average them to obtain
aggregate disagreement measures for businesses and for consumers.Next, we use a
bivariate Bayesian vector autoregressive framework to estimate the impulse
response functions to innovations in disagreement in every country.We find that
the effect on economic activity of shocks to the perception of uncertainty
differ markedly between manufacturers and consumers.On the one hand, shocks to
consumer discrepancy tend to be of greater magnitude and duration than those to
manufacturer discrepancy.On the other hand, innovations in disagreement between
the two collectives have an opposite effect on economic activity:shocks to
manufacturer discrepancy lead to a decrease in economic activity, as opposed to
shocks to consumer discrepancy.This finding is of particular relevance to
researchers when using cross-sectional dispersion of survey-based expectations,

typically assumed to remain constant. Here, we construct dynamical invariants
that allow us to derive the evolution of radial actions in spherical central
potentials with an arbitrary time dependence. We show that to linear order,
radial actions oscillate around a constant value with an amplitude $\Delta J_r
\propto \dot{\Phi}/\Phi\,P(E,L)$. Using this result, we develop a diffusion
theory that describes the evolution of the radial action distribution of
ensembles of tracer particles orbiting in generic time-dependent spherical
potentials. Tests against restricted $N$-body simulations in a varying Kepler
potential indicate that our linear theory is accurate in regions of phase-space
in which the diffusion coefficient $\tilde{D}(J_r) < 0.01\,J_r^2$. For
illustration, we apply our theory to two astrophysical processes. We show that
the median mass accretion rate of a Milky Way (MW) dark matter (DM) halo leads
to slow global time-variation of the gravitational potential, in which the
evolution of radial actions is linear (i.e. either adiabatic or diffusive) for
$\sim 84$ per cent of the DM halo at redshift $z=0$. This fraction grows
considerably with lookback time, suggesting that diffusion may be relevant to
the modelling of several Gyr-old tidal streams in action-angle space. As a
second application, we show that dynamical tracers in a self-interacting DM
(SIDM) dwarf halo (with $\sigma/m_\chi = 1\,{\rm cm^2g^{-1}}$) have invariant
radial actions during the formation of a cored density profile.

Recker","Searching, Sorting, and Cake Cutting in Rounds","33 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study sorting and searching in rounds motivated by a cake cutting problem.
The search problem we consider is: we are given an array $x = (x_1, \ldots,
x_n)$ and an element $z$ promised to be in the array. We have access to an
oracle that answers comparison queries: ""How is $x_i$ compared to $x_j$?"",
where the answer can be ""$<$"", ""$=$"", or ""$>$"". The goal is to find the
location of $z$ with success probability at least $p \in [0,1]$ in at most $k$
rounds of interaction with the oracle. The problem is called ordered or
unordered search, depending on whether the array $x$ is sorted or unsorted,
respectively.
  For ordered search, we show the expected query complexity of randomized
algorithms is $\Theta\bigl(k\cdot p \cdot n^{1/k}\bigr)$ in the worst case. In
contrast, the expected query complexity of deterministic algorithms searching
for a uniformly random element is $\Theta\bigl(k\cdot p^{1/k} \cdot
n^{1/k}\bigr)$. The uniform distribution is the worst case for deterministic
algorithms.
  For unordered search, the expected query complexity of randomized algorithms
is $np\bigl(\frac{k+1}{2k}\bigr) \pm 1$ in the worst case, while the expected
query complexity of deterministic algorithms searching for a uniformly random
element is $np \bigl(1 - \frac{k-1}{2k}p \bigr) \pm 1$.
  We also discuss the connections of these search problems to the rank query
model, where the array $x$ can be accessed via queries of the form ""Is
rank$(x_i) \leq k$?"". Unordered search is equivalent to Select with rank
queries (given $q$, find $x_i$ with rank $q$) and ordered search to Locate with
rank queries (given $x_i$, find its rank). We show an equivalence between
sorting with rank queries and proportional cake cutting with contiguous pieces
for any number of rounds, as well as an improved lower bound for deterministic
sorting in rounds with rank queries.

attempt to generate realistic textures through learning with adversarial loss,
our method, Generative LatEnt bANk (GLEAN), goes beyond existing practices by
directly leveraging rich and diverse priors encapsulated in a pre-trained GAN.
But unlike prevalent GAN inversion methods that require expensive
image-specific optimization at runtime, our approach only needs a single
forward pass to generate the upscaled image. GLEAN can be easily incorporated
in a simple encoder-bank-decoder architecture with multi-resolution skip
connections. Switching the bank allows the method to deal with images from
diverse categories, e.g., cat, building, human face, and car. Images upscaled
by GLEAN show clear improvements in terms of fidelity and texture faithfulness
in comparison to existing methods.

Hamiltonian evolutions on the lattice satisfy Lieb-Robinson bounds rather than

unitaries (ALPUs). We show that the index theory is robust and completely
extends to one-dimensional ALPUs. As a consequence, we achieve a converse to
the Lieb-Robinson bounds: any ALPU of index zero can be exactly generated by
some time-dependent, quasi-local Hamiltonian in constant time. For the special

variations (TTVs) upon their parent planet. Unfortunately, distinguishing
moon-induced TTVs from other sources, in particular planet-planet interactions,
has severely impeded its usefulness as a tool for identifying exomoon
candidates. A key feature of exomoon TTVs is that they will always be
undersampled, due to the simple fact that we can only observe the TTVs once per
transit/planetary period. We show that it is possible to analytically express
the aliased TTV periodicity as a function of planet and moon period. Further,
we show that inverting an aliased TTV period back to a true moon period is
fraught with hundreds of harmonic modes. However, a unique aspect of these TTV
aliases is that they are predicted to occur at consistently short periods,
irrespective of what model one assumes for the underlying moon population.
Specifically, 50% of all exomoons are expected to induce TTVs with a period
between 2 to 4 cycles, a range that planet-planet interactions rarely manifest
at. This provides an exciting and simple tool for quickly identifying exomoons
candidates and brings the TTV method back to the fore as an exomoon hunting
strategy. Applying this method to the candidate, Kepler-1625b i, reveals that
its TTV periodicity centers around the median period expected for exomoons.

at 2.1--2.29 micron from the AMBER+GRAVITY data reveal the central star
surrounded by an elliptical ring-like structure with a semimajor and semiminor

of an equatorial dust disk viewed from an inclination angle of ~50 degrees, and
its axis is approximately aligned with the bipolar nebula. The disk is
surprisingly compact, with an inner radius of a mere 3.5 Rstar (2 au). Our 2-D
radiative transfer modeling shows that an optically thick flared disk with

star, suggesting the oblateness of the star's atmosphere or the presence of a

the so called circumgalactic medium (CGM), is crucial to understand galaxy
evolution across cosmic time. We focus here on the the cool ($T\sim10^4$ K)
phase of this medium around star-forming galaxies in the local universe, whose
properties and dynamics are poorly understood. We developed semi-analytical
parametric models to describe the cool CGM as an outflow of gas clouds from the
central galaxy, as a result of supernova explosions in the disc (galactic
wind). The cloud motion is driven by the galaxy gravitational pull and by the
interactions with the hot ($T\sim10^6$ K) coronal gas. Through a bayesian
analysis, we compare the predictions of our models with the data of the
COS-Halos and COS-GASS surveys, which provide accurate kinematic information of
the cool CGM around more than 40 low-redshift star-forming galaxies, probing
distances up to the galaxy virial radii. Our findings clearly show that a
supernova-driven outflow model is not suitable to describe the dynamics of the
cool circumgalactic gas. Indeed, to reproduce the data, we need extreme
scenarios, with initial outflow velocities and mass loading factors that would
lead to unphysically high energy coupling from the supernovae to the gas and
with supernova efficiencies largely exceeding unity. This strongly suggests
that, since the outflows cannot reproduce most of the cool gas absorbers, the
latter are likely the result of cosmological inflow in the outer galaxy halos,
in analogy to what we have previously found for early-type galaxies.

strategies to detect radiative products from dark-matter decays with
line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments. This radiation will behave as a line
interloper for the atomic and molecular spectral lines targeted by LIM surveys.
The most distinctive signatures of the contribution from dark-matter radiative
decays are an extra anisotropy on the LIM power spectrum due to projection
effects, as well as a narrowing and a shift towards higher intensities of the
voxel intensity distribution. We forecast the minimum rate of decays into two
photons that LIM surveys will be sensitive to as function of the dark-matter
mass in the range $\sim 10^{-6}-10$ eV, and discuss how to reinterpret such
results for dark matter that decays into a photon and another particle. We find
that both the power spectrum and the voxel intensity distribution are expected
to be very sensitive to the dark-matter contribution, with the voxel intensity
distribution being more promising for most experiments considered. Interpreting
our results in terms of the axion, we show that LIM surveys will be extremely
competitive to detect its decay products, improving several orders of
magnitudes (depending on the mass) the sensitivity of laboratory and
astrophysical searches, especially in the mass range $\sim 1-10$ eV.

EW restoration in double EW boson production via the convergence of the
Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. This convergence is most easily measured
in the vector boson plus Higgs production, $Vh$, which is dominated by the
longitudinal polarizations. We define EW restoration by carefully taking the
limit of zero Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev). EW restoration is then
measured through the ratio of the $p_T^h$ distributions between $Vh$ production
in the Standard Model and Goldstone boson plus Higgs production in the zero vev
theory, where $p_T^h$ is the Higgs transverse momentum. As EW symmetry is
restored, this ratio converges to one at high energy. We present a method to
extract this ratio from collider data. With a full signal and background
analysis, we demonstrate that the 14 TeV HL-LHC can confirm that this ratio
converges to one to 40% precision while at the 27 TeV HE-LHC the precision will

black holes and their host galaxies. We find that these mergers occur in
typical galaxies along the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_*$ relation, and that between LISA

can trigger increased star formation, we find that galaxies hosting low-mass
black hole mergers tend to show a slight increase in star formation rates
compared to a mass-matched sample. However, high-mass merger hosts have typical
star formation rates, due to a combination of low gas fractions and powerful
AGN feedback. Although minor black hole mergers do not correlate with disturbed
morphologies, major mergers (especially at high-masses) tend to show
morphological evidence of recent galaxy mergers which survives for ~500 Myr.
This is on the same scale as the infall/hardening time of the merging black
holes, suggesting that electromagnetic followups to gravitational wave signals

spectroscopic measurements of their projected rotation velocities (vsini). The
basis of the method is that a lower obliquity -- all other things being equal

sought evidence for this effect using a sample of 150 Kepler stars with
effective temperatures between 5950 and 6550K and a control sample of 101 stars
with matching spectroscopic properties and random orientations. The planet
hosts have systematically higher values of vsini than the control stars, but
not by enough to be compatible with perfect spin-orbit alignment. The mean
value of sini is 0.856 +/- 0.036, which is 4-sigma away from unity (perfect
alignment), and 2-sigma away from pi/4 (random orientations). There is also
evidence that the hottest stars have a broader obliquity distribution: when
modeled separately, the stars cooler than 6250K have <sini> = 0.928 +/- 0.042,
while the hotter stars are consistent with random orientations. This is similar
to the pattern previously noted for stars with hot Jupiters. Based on these
results, obliquity excitation for early-G and late-F stars appears to be a
general outcome of star and planet formation, rather than being exclusively
linked to hot Jupiter formation.

fields, which is promising to largely improve the detection accuracy. In this
paper, we first investigate how expanding the receptive fields affect the
accuracy and computational costs of FPN. We explore a baseline model called
inception FPN in which each lateral connection contains convolution filters
with different kernel sizes. Moreover, we point out that not all objects need
such a complicated calculation and propose a new dynamic FPN (DyFPN). The
output features of DyFPN will be calculated by using the adaptively selected
branch according to a dynamic gating operation. Therefore, the proposed method
can provide a more efficient dynamic inference for achieving a better trade-off
between accuracy and computational cost. Extensive experiments conducted on
MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the proposed DyFPN significantly improves
performance with the optimal allocation of computation resources. For instance,
replacing inception FPN with DyFPN reduces about 40% of its FLOPs while
maintaining similar high performance.

point where it is now commonplace to see simulated samples (e.g., images) that
closely resemble real-world data. However, generation quality is generally
inconsistent for any given model and can vary dramatically between samples. We
introduce Discriminator Gradient flow (DGflow), a new technique that improves
generated samples via the gradient flow of entropy-regularized f-divergences
between the real and the generated data distributions. The gradient flow takes
the form of a non-linear Fokker-Plank equation, which can be easily simulated
by sampling from the equivalent McKean-Vlasov process. By refining inferior
samples, our technique avoids wasteful sample rejection used by previous
methods (DRS & MH-GAN). Compared to existing works that focus on specific GAN
variants, we show our refinement approach can be applied to GANs with
vector-valued critics and even other deep generative models such as VAEs and
Normalizing Flows. Empirical results on multiple synthetic, image, and text
datasets demonstrate that DGflow leads to significant improvement in the
quality of generated samples for a variety of generative models, outperforming
the state-of-the-art Discriminator Optimal Transport (DOT) and Discriminator
Driven Latent Sampling (DDLS) methods.

communication gap between the hearing and vocally impaired community and the
rest of the society. Word-level sign language recognition (WSLR) is the first
important step towards understanding and interpreting sign language. However,
recognizing signs from videos is a challenging task as the meaning of a word
depends on a combination of subtle body motions, hand configurations, and other
movements. Recent pose-based architectures for WSLR either model both the
spatial and temporal dependencies among the poses in different frames
simultaneously or only model the temporal information without fully utilizing
the spatial information.
  We tackle the problem of WSLR using a novel pose-based approach, which
captures spatial and temporal information separately and performs late fusion.
Our proposed architecture explicitly captures the spatial interactions in the
video using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The temporal dependencies
between the frames are captured using Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on WLASL, a standard word-level
sign language recognition dataset show that our model significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art on pose-based methods by achieving an improvement in the

interactions are clearly key determinants of collective cell migration -- in
addition to individual cells self-propulsion -- the physical mechanisms that
control the emergence of cell clustering and collective cell migration are
still poorly understood. In particular, observations have shown that binary
cell-cell collisions generally lead to anti-alignement of cell polarities and
separation of pairs -- a process called contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL),
which is expected to disfavor the formation of large scale cell clusters with
coherent motion. Here, we adopt a joint experimental and theoretical approach
to determine the large scale dynamics of cell assemblies from elementary
pairwise cell-cell interaction rules. We quantify experimentally binary
cell-cell interactions and show that they can be captured by a minimal
equilibrium-like pairwise asymmetric aligning interaction potential that
reproduces the CIL phenomenology. We identify its symmetry class, build the
corresponding active hydrodynamic theory and show on general grounds that such
asymmetric aligning interaction destroys large scale clustering and ordering,
leading instead to a liquid-like microphase of cell clusters of finite size and
short lived polarity, or to a fully dispersed isotropic phase. Finally, this
shows that CIL-like asymmetric interactions in cellular systems -- or general
active systems -- control cluster sizes and polarity, and can prevent large
scale coarsening and long range polarity, except in the singular regime of
dense confluent systems.

This work makes use of the individual spectral exposures provided by the SDSS.
  An automatic flare search was performed by detecting significant amplitude
changes in the $H\alpha$ and $H\beta$ spectral lines after a Gaussian profile
was fit to the line core. CMEs were searched for by identifying asymmetries in
the Balmer lines caused by the Doppler effect of plasma motions in the line of
sight.
  We identified 281 flares on late-type stars (spectral types K3 to M9). We
identified six possible CME candidates showing excess flux in Balmer line
wings. Flare energies in $H\alpha$ were calculated and masses of the CME
candidates were estimated. The derived $H\alpha$ flare energies range from $3
\times 10^{28} - 2 \times 10^{33}$ erg. The $H\alpha$ flare energy increases
with earlier types, while the fraction of flaring times increases with later
types. Mass estimates for the CME candidates are in the range of $6 \times
10^{16} - 6 \times 10^{18}$ g, and the highest projected velocities are
$\sim300 - 700\:$ km/s.
  The low detection rate of CMEs we obtained agrees with previous studies,

for understanding chemical evolution, SN Ia progenitors, and SN Ia physics.
Past estimates of the DTD in galaxy clusters have been deduced from SN Ia rates
measured in cluster samples observed at various redshifts, corresponding to
different time intervals after a presumed initial brief burst of star
formation. A recent analysis of a cluster sample at $z=1.13-1.75$ confirmed
indications from previous studies of lower-redshift clusters, that the DTD has
a power-law form, ${\rm DTD}(t)=R_1 (t/{\rm Gyr})^\alpha$, with amplitude
$R_1$, at delay $t=1~\rm Gyr$, several times higher than measured in
field-galaxy environments. This implied that SNe Ia are somehow produced in
larger numbers by the stellar populations in clusters. This conclusion,
however, could have been affected by the implicit assumption that the stars
were formed in a single brief starburst at high $z$. Here, we re-derive the DTD
from the cluster SN Ia data, but relax the single-burst assumption. Instead, we
allow for a range of star-formation histories and dust extinctions for each
cluster. Via MCMC modeling, we simultaneously fit, using stellar population
synthesis models and DTD models, the integrated galaxy-light photometry in
several bands, and the SN Ia numbers discovered in each cluster. With these
more-realistic assumptions, we find a best-fit DTD with power-law index
$\alpha=-1.09_{-0.12}^{+0.15}$, and amplitude $R_1=0.41_{-0.10}^{+0.12}\times

conversion and storage applications relies on the adequate characterization of
their intrinsic activity, which is currently hindered by the dearth of a
protocol for consistent and precise determination of double layer capacitance
(CDL). Herein, we propose a seven-step method that aims to determine CDL
reliably by scan rate-dependent cyclic voltammetry. The method considers three
aspects that strongly influence the outcome of the analysis: measurement
settings, data collection, and data processing. To illustrate the proposed
method, two systems were studied: a resistor-capacitor electric circuit and a
glassy carbon disk in an electrochemical cell. With these studies it is
demonstrated that when any of the mentioned aspects of the procedure are
neglected, substantial deviations of the results are observed with
misestimations as large as 61% in the case of the investigated electrochemical
system. Moreover, we propose allometric regression as a more suitable model
than linear regression for the determination of CDL for both the ideal and the
non-ideal systems investigated. We stress the importance of assessing the
accuracy of not only highly specialized electrochemical methods, but also of
those that are well-known and commonly used as it is the case of the
voltammetric methods. The methodology proposed herein is not limited to the
determination of CDL, but can be effectively applied to any other
voltammetry-based analysis that aims to deliver quantitative results.

networks to imperceptible perturbations made at test time. In the context of
image tasks, many algorithms have been proposed to make neural networks robust
to adversarial perturbations made to the input pixels. These perturbations are
typically measured in an $\ell_p$ norm. However, robustness often holds only
for the specific attack used for training. In this work we extend the above
setting to consider the problem of training of deep neural networks that can be
made simultaneously robust to perturbations applied in multiple natural
representation spaces. For the case of image data, examples include the
standard pixel representation as well as the representation in the discrete
cosine transform~(DCT) basis. We design a theoretically sound algorithm with
formal guarantees for the above problem. Furthermore, our guarantees also hold
when the goal is to require robustness with respect to multiple $\ell_p$ norm
based attacks. We then derive an efficient practical implementation and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard datasets for image

With given prior knowledge, the parameter vector can be viewed as states with a
specific reward, which is a function of the fitting error compared with the
measurements. The agent takes an action (either increasing or decreasing the
parameter) and the estimated parameter will move to a new state. Based on the
reward function, the optimal action policy will move the parameter set to a
state with the highest reward. If multiple events are available, they will be
used sequentially so that the updated $\mathbfcal{Q}$-value can be utilized to
improve the computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed

and nature of the transition between the solar corona and the solar wind to
stringent tests. The most popular mechanism aimed to explain the dynamics of
the nascent solar wind, including its heating and acceleration is
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Most of the previous models focus on
nonlinear cascade induced by interactions of outgoing Alfv\'en waves and their
reflections, ignoring effects that might be related to perpendicular
structuring of the solar coronal plasma, despite overwhelming evidence for it.
In this paper, for the first time, we analyse through 3D MHD numerical
simulations the dynamics of the perpendicularly structured solar corona and
solar wind, from the low corona to 15 R_Sun. We find that background
structuring has a strong effect on the evolution of MHD turbulence, on much
faster time scales than in the perpendicularly homogeneous case. On time scales
shorter than nonlinear times, linear effects related to phase mixing result in
a 1/f perpendicular energy spectrum. As the turbulent cascade develops, we
observe a perpendicular (parallel) energy spectrum with the power law index of
-3/2 or -5/3 (-2), a steeper perpendicular magnetic field than velocity
spectrum, and a strong build-up of negative residual energy. We conclude that
the turbulence is most probably generated by the self-cascade of the driven
transverse kink waves, referred to previously as `uniturbulence', which might
represent the dominant nonlinear energy cascade channel in the pristine solar
wind.

multi-task fashion. We achieve this through a three-stage solution. Firstly, we
train a segmentation network to produce rough pseudo-masks which predicted

the pseudo-masks using a multi-task model that enforces consistency whilst
exploiting the rich statistical information of the data. We compare our

take place, have developed sophisticated technology and data ecosystems to
allow advertisers to target users, yet advertisers may not know which sites
their ads appear on, i.e., the ad context. In practice, ad exchanges can
require publishers to provide accurate ad placement information to ad buyers
prior to submitting their bids, allowing them to adjust their bids for ads at
specific domains, subdomains or URLs. However, ad exchanges have historically
been reluctant to disclose placement information due to fears that buyers will
start buying ads only on the most desirable sites leaving inventory on other
sites unsold and lowering average revenue. This paper explores the empirical
effect of ad placement disclosure using a unique data set describing a change
in context information provided by a major private European ad exchange.
Analyzing this as a quasi-experiment using diff-in-diff, we find that average
revenue per impression rose when more context information was provided. This
shows that ad context information is important to ad buyers and that providing
more context information will not lead to deconflation. The exception to this
are sites which had a low number of buyers prior to the policy change;
consistent with theory, these sites with thin markets do not show a rise in
prices. Our analysis adds evidence that ad exchanges with reputable publishers,
particularly smaller volume, high quality sites, should provide ad buyers with
site placement information, which can be done at almost no cost.

wave signal due to the non-linear dynamics of the matter involved and the large
number of degrees of freedom of the phenomenon make the source parameter
inference problem very challenging. In this paper we take a step towards that
goal and present a parameter estimation approach which is based on the
gravitational waves associated with oscillations of proto-neutron stars (PNS).
Numerical simulations of CCSN have shown that buoyancy-driven g-modes are
responsible for a significant fraction of the gravitational wave signal and
their time-frequency evolution is linked to the physical properties of the
compact remnant through universal relations, as demonstrated in [1]. We use a
set of 1D CCSN simulations to build a model that relates the evolution of the
PNS properties with the frequency of the dominant g-mode, which is extracted
from the gravitational-wave data using a new algorithm we have developed for
our study. The model is used to infer the time evolution of a combination of
the mass and the radius of the PNS. The performance of the method is estimated
employing simulations of 2D CCSN waveforms covering a progenitor mass range
between 11 and 40 solar masses and different equations of state. Considering
signals embedded in Gaussian gravitational wave detector noise, we show that it
is possible to infer PNS properties for a galactic source using Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo data at design sensitivities. Third generation detectors
such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will allow to test distances of
${\cal O}(100\, {\rm kpc})$.

process associated with this model has the same transition diagram as in a
product-form queueing model called an order-independent loss queue. This allows
us to adapt existing results on order-independent (loss) queues to stochastic
matching models and, in particular, to derive closed-form expressions for
several performance metrics, like the waiting probability or the mean matching
time, that can be implemented using dynamic programming. Both these formulas
and the numerical results that they allow us to derive are used to gain insight
into the impact of parameters on performance. In particular, we characterize
performance in a so-called heavy-traffic regime in which the number of items of
a subset of the classes goes to infinity while items of other classes become
scarce.

(VR) experience and refers to such physiological repercussions as nausea and
dizziness triggered in response to VR exposure. Given the debilitating effect
of cybersickness on the user experience in VR, academic interest in the
automatic detection of cybersickness from physiological measurements has
crested in recent years. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been extensively used
to capture changes in electrical activity in the brain and to automatically
classify cybersickness from brainwaves using a variety of machine learning
algorithms. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) algorithms and increasing
availability of computational resources for DL have paved the way for a new
area of research into the application of DL frameworks to EEG-based detection
of cybersickness. Accordingly, this review involved a systematic review of the
peer-reviewed papers concerned with the application of DL frameworks to the
classification of cybersickness from EEG signals. The relevant literature was
identified through exhaustive database searches, and the papers were
scrutinized with respect to experimental protocols for data collection, data
preprocessing, and DL architectures. The review revealed a limited number of
studies in this nascent area of research and showed that the DL frameworks
reported in these studies (i.e., DNN, CNN, and RNN) could classify
cybersickness with an average accuracy rate of 93%. This review provides a
summary of the trends and issues in the application of DL frameworks to the
EEG-based detection of cybersickness, with some guidelines for future research.

engineering, which enable the unambiguous description of and reasoning about a
system's behaviour. Autonomous systems use software to make decisions without
human control, are often embedded in a robotic system, are often
safety-critical, and are increasingly being introduced into everyday settings.
Autonomous systems need robust development and verification methods, but formal
methods practitioners are often asked: Why use Formal Methods for Autonomous
Systems? To answer this question, this position paper describes five recipes
for formally verifying aspects of an autonomous system, collected from the
literature. The recipes are examples of how Formal Methods can be an effective
tool for the development and verification of autonomous systems. During design,
they enable unambiguous description of requirements; in development, formal
specifications can be verified against requirements; software components may be
synthesised from verified specifications; and behaviour can be monitored at
runtime and compared to its original specification. Modern Formal Methods often
include highly automated tool support, which enables exhaustive checking of a
system's state space. This paper argues that Formal Methods are a powerful tool
for the repertoire of development techniques for safe autonomous systems,
alongside other robust software engineering techniques.

exist in the specific scale-space domain. To this end, we first formulate the
superimposition problem into a mathematical model and then derive a closed-form
solution for multiscale analysis. The model is formulated via
difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) kernels in the continuous scale-space domain, and
it is proved that setting the scale-space pyramid's blurring ratio and
smoothness to 2 and 0.627, respectively, facilitates the detection of reliable
keypoints. For the applicability of the proposed model to discrete images, we
discretize it using the undecimated wavelet transform and the cubic spline
function. Theoretically, the complexity of our method is less than 5\% of that
of the popular baseline Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Extensive

transmission and malaria burden can improve birth outcomes. We conduct an
observational study of the effect of changing malaria burden on low birth
weight using data from 18,112 births in 19 countries in sub-Saharan African
countries during the years 2000--2015. A malaria prevalence decline from a high
rate (Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in children aged 2-up-to-10 (i.e.,
$Pf\text{PR}_{2-10}$) $>$ 0.4) to a low rate ($Pf\text{PR}_{2-10}$ $<$ 0.2) is
estimated to reduce the rate of low birth weight by 1.48 percentage points (95%
confidence interval: 3.70 percentage points reduction, 0.74 percentage points
increase), which is a 17% reduction in the low birth weight rate compared to
the average (8.6%) in our study population with observed birth weight records
(1.48/8.6 $\approx$ 17%). When focusing on first pregnancies, a decline in
malaria prevalence from high to low is estimated to have a greater impact on
the low birth weight rate than for all births: 3.73 percentage points (95%
confidence interval: 9.11 percentage points reduction, 1.64 percentage points
increase). Although the confidence intervals cannot rule out the possibility of
no effect at the 95% confidence level, the concurrence between our primary
analysis, secondary analyses, and sensitivity analyses, and the magnitude of
the effect size, contribute to the weight of the evidence suggesting that
declining malaria burden has an important effect on birth weight at the
population level. The novel statistical methodology developed in this article,

terms of the measurements at the antenna. The ROM is a low-dimensional
dynamical system that approximates this transfer function. While there are many
possible ROM realizations, we are interested in one that preserves passivity

of randomly functionalized polymers in solution, with the ability to form both
intra- and intermolecular reversible bonds. Under highly dilute conditions,
these polymers form soft nano-objects (so-called single-chain nanoparticles,
SCNPs), resulting from the purely intramolecular cross-linking of the reactive
functional groups. Here we show that the competition between intra- and
intermolecular bonds at finite concentration is governed by a delicate balance
of various entropic contributions and leads to a density dependent effective
valence. System-spanning networks are formed at relatively low monomer
densities and their stability is mediated by just a small number of
intermolecular connections per chain. The formation of intermolecular bonds
furthermore can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the polymer size on the
density for long bond lifetimes. Concomitantly, the polymers in the percolating
cluster adopt an intramolecular structure characteristic for self-avoiding
chains, which constitutes a strong contrast to the fractal globular behavior of
irreversible SCNPs in crowded solutions with purely topological interactions
(no intermolecular bonds). Finally, we study the dynamics of the system, which
displays signatures expected for reversible gel-forming systems. An interesting
behavior emerges in the reorganization dynamics of the percolating cluster. The
relaxation is mostly mediated by the diffusion over long distances, through
breaking and formation of bonds, of chains that do not leave the percolating
cluster. Regarding the few chains that are transiently free, the time they
spend until they reattach to the cluster is solely governed by the bond
strength.

the $\nabla\vec{B}$ and $\nabla\nabla\vec{B}$ tensors are computed, which can
be used for direct derivative-based optimization of electromagnetic coil shapes
to achieve the desired magnetic configuration. Moreover, if the norm of these
tensors is large compared to the field strength for a given magnetic field, the
field must have a short length scale, suggesting it may be hard to produce with
coils that are suitably far away. Second, we evaluate the minor radius at which
the flux surface shapes would become singular, providing a lower bound on the
achievable aspect ratio. This bound is also shown to be related to an
equilibrium beta limit. Finally, for configurations that are constructed to
achieve a desired magnetic field strength to first order in the expansion, we
compute the error field that arises due to second order terms.

minimizing the number of comparisons and/or exchanges/copies. However, a more
appropriate yardstick for the performance of sorting algorithms is based on the
total number of array accesses that are required (the ""work""). For a sort that
is based on divide-and-conquer (including iterative variations on that theme),
we can divide the work into linear, i.e. $\textbf{O}(N)$, work and
linearithmic, i.e. $\textbf{O}(N log N)$, work. An algorithm that moves work
from the linearithmic phase to the linear phase may be able to reduce the total
number of array accesses and, indirectly, processing time. This paper describes
an approach to sorting which reduces the number of expensive comparisons in the
linearithmic phase as much as possible by substituting inexpensive comparisons.
In Java, the two system sorts are dual-pivot quicksort (for primitives) and
Timsort for objects. We demonstrate that a combination of these two algorithms
can run significantly faster than either algorithm alone for the types of
objects which are expensive to compare. We call this improved sorting algorithm

world, especially after the recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The quarantine strategy is one of the important intervention
measures to control the spread of an epidemic by greatly minimizing the
likelihood of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. In this
study, we analyze the impact of various stochastic disturbances on the epidemic
dynamics during the quarantine period. For this purpose, we present an SIQS
epidemic model that incorporates the stochastic transmission and the L\'evy
noise in order to simulate both small and massive perturbations. Under
appropriate conditions, some interesting asymptotic properties are proved,
namely: ergodicity, persistence in the mean, and extinction of the disease. The
theoretical results show that the dynamics of the perturbed model are
determined by parameters that are closely related to the stochastic noises. Our
work improves many existing studies in the field of mathematical epidemiology
and provides new techniques to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of
epidemics.

essential for our everyday lives. With the prevalence of cyber-attacks on them,
measuring their robustness has become an important issue. To date, many
robustness metrics have been proposed. It is desirable for a robustness metric
to possess the following three properties: considering global network
topologies, strictly increasing upon link additions, and having a quadratic
complexity in terms of the number of nodes on sparse networks. This paper
proposes to use Average Network Flow (ANF) as a robustness metric, and proves
that it increases strictly, and gives an algorithm to compute ANF with a
quadratic complexity by leveraging Gomory-Hu trees. Thus, with ANF
intrinsically considering global network topologies, ANF is unveiled to be a
new robustness metric satisfying those three properties. Moreover, this paper
compares ANF with seven existing representative metrics, showing that each
metric has its own characteristics, so there is no silver bullet in measuring
network robustness and it is recommended to apply several metrics together to
gain a comprehensive view. Finally, by experimenting on the scenarios in which
network topologies preserve the same numbers of nodes and links, some
interesting behaviors of robustness metrics are reported.

trade-offs inherent to grating-based spectroscopy. The system employs a
plasmonic spectral encoder chip containing 252 different tiles of nanohole
arrays fabricated using a scalable and low-cost imprint lithography method,
where each tile has a unique geometry and, thus, a unique optical transmission
spectrum. The illumination spectrum of interest directly impinges upon the
plasmonic encoder, and a CMOS image sensor captures the transmitted light,
without any lenses, gratings, or other optical components in between, making
the entire hardware highly compact, light-weight and field-portable. A trained
neural network then reconstructs the unknown spectrum using the transmitted
intensity information from the spectral encoder in a feed-forward and
non-iterative manner. Benefiting from the parallelization of neural networks,
the average inference time per spectrum is ~28 microseconds, which is orders of
magnitude faster compared to other computational spectroscopy approaches. When
blindly tested on unseen new spectra (N = 14,648) with varying complexity, our

black hole is immersed in an externally supplied magnetic field, reconnection
of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere can generate negative energy
(relative to infinity) particles that fall into the black hole event horizon
while other particles escape stealing energy from the black hole. We show
analytically that energy extraction via magnetic reconnection is possible when
the black hole spin is high (dimensionless spin $a\sim1$) and the plasma is
strongly magnetized (plasma magnetization $\sigma_0>1/3$). The parameter space
region where energy extraction is allowed depends on the plasma magnetization
and the orientation of the reconnecting magnetic field lines. For $\sigma_0 \gg
1$, the asymptotic negative energy at infinity per enthalpy of the decelerated
plasma that is swallowed by a maximally rotating black hole is found to be
$\epsilon^\infty_- \simeq - \sqrt{\sigma_0/3}$. The accelerated plasma that
escapes to infinity and takes away black hole energy asymptotes the energy at
infinity per enthalpy $\epsilon^\infty_+ \simeq \sqrt{3\sigma_0}$. We show that
the maximum power extracted from the black hole by the escaping plasma is
$P_{\rm extr}^{\rm max} \sim 0.1 M^2\sqrt{\sigma_0}\,w_0$ (here, $M$ is the
black hole mass and $w_0$ is the plasma enthalpy density) for the collisionless
plasma regime and one order of magnitude lower for the collisional regime.
Energy extraction causes a significant spindown of the black hole when $a \sim
1$. The maximum efficiency of the plasma energization process via magnetic
reconnection in the ergosphere is found to be $\eta_{\rm max} \simeq 3/2$.
Since fast magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere should occur intermittently
in the scenario proposed here, the associated emission within a few
gravitational radii from the black hole is expected to display a bursty nature.

therefore be challenging for traditional structural determination techniques.
Often, scientists have to rely on piecemeal evidence drawn from diverse

heuristic derivation of the MaxEnt IRL model (for stochastic MDPs), allows a
unified view of MaxEnt IRL and Relative Entropy IRL, and leads to a model-free

linear using a padding trick.

prevailing sociopolitical environment, in time for the action taken to be
effective. Here we investigate the transient dynamics of behavioural change in
an agent-based model on structured networks that are also exposed to a global
external influence. We find that polarisation emerges naturally, even without
bounded confidence, but that for rationally motivated agents, it is temporary.
The speed of convergence to a final consensus is controlled by the rate at
which the polarised clusters are dissolved. This depends strongly on the
combination of external influences and the network topology. Both high

domain walls spans the entire field of magnetism from its relativistic quantum
fundamentals to applications in information technologies. The traditional focus
of the field on ferromagnets has recently started to shift towards
antiferromagnets which offer a rich materials landscape and utility in
ultra-fast and neuromorphic devices insensitive to magnetic field
perturbations. Here we report the observation that domain walls in an epitaxial
crystal of antiferromagnetic CuMnAs can be atomically sharp. We reveal this
ultimate domain wall scaling limit using differential phase contrast imaging
within aberrationcorrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, which we
complement by X-ray magnetic dichroism microscopy and ab initio calculations.
We highlight that the atomically sharp domain walls are outside the remits of
established spin-Hamiltonian theories and can offer device functionalities
unparalleled in ferromagnets.

that sub-60 mV/decade switching can be observed in a WS2 transistor with a
metal-insulator-metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIMIS) structure - without any

except that the ferroelectric layer is replaced by a leaky dielectric layer.
Through simulations of the charging dynamics during the device characterization
using an RC network model, we show that the observed steep-slope switching in
our ""ferroelectric-free"" transistors can be attributed to the internal gate
voltage response to the chosen varying gate voltage scan rates. We further show
that a constant gate voltage scan rate can also lead to transient sub-60

leaderboards by yielding unprecedented disparity accuracy, their inference time
is typically slow, on the order of seconds for a pair of 540p images. The main
reason is that the leading methods employ time-consuming 3D convolutions
applied to a 4D feature volume. A common way to speed up the computation is to
downsample the feature volume, but this loses high-frequency details. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a \emph{displacement-invariant cost
computation module} to compute the matching costs without needing a 4D feature
volume. Rather, costs are computed by applying the same 2D convolution network
on each disparity-shifted feature map pair independently. Unlike previous 2D
convolution-based methods that simply perform context mapping between inputs
and disparity maps, our proposed approach learns to match features between the
two images. We also propose an entropy-based refinement strategy to refine the
computed disparity map, which further improves speed by avoiding the need to
compute a second disparity map on the right image. Extensive experiments on
standard datasets (SceneFlow, KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury) demonstrate that
our method achieves competitive accuracy with much less inference time. On
typical image sizes, our method processes over 100 FPS on a desktop GPU, making
our method suitable for time-critical applications such as autonomous driving.
We also show that our approach generalizes well to unseen datasets,
outperforming 4D-volumetric methods.

complex and deep CNNs. Emerging CNNs have diverse per-layer computation
characteristics including parallelism, arithmetic intensity, locality, and
memory footprint. Per-layer strategy selection and fine-grained tuning are
required to achieve low end-to-end latency. However, specialized hardware
modules dedicated to each layer limit the per-layer utilization and adversely
affect end-to-end latency. In this paper, we address these problems by an
algorithm-architecture co-optimization framework, DYNAMAP, consisting of (1) a
unified hardware overlay that can be reused across layers, supporting dynamic
mapping of all three families of popular convolution algorithms, and further
allowing flexible dataflow switching to maximize hardware utilization for each

the hardware overlay and chooses optimal strategy mapping. We show that the

the optimal algorithm selection problem is NP-hard in general, by exploiting
the series-parallel structure of CNN models, we demonstrate a polynomial-time
solution for optimal algorithm mapping. DYNAMAP is optimized for any CNN,

Abreu-Nigro (2020) and Guay-Paquet (private communication), using $q$-hit

an engineered quantum platform. However, achieving the accuracy needed to
outperform classical methods has been an outstanding challenge. Here, using
eighteen superconducting qubits, we provide an experimental blueprint for an
accurate condensed-matter simulator and demonstrate how to probe fundamental
electronic properties. We benchmark the underlying method by reconstructing the
single-particle band-structure of a one-dimensional wire. We demonstrate nearly
complete mitigation of decoherence and readout errors and arrive at an accuracy
in measuring energy eigenvalues of this wire with an error of ~0.01 rad,
whereas typical energy scales are of order 1 rad. Insight into this
unprecedented algorithm fidelity is gained by highlighting robust properties of
a Fourier transform, including the ability to resolve eigenenergies with a
statistical uncertainty of 1e-4 rad. Furthermore, we synthesize magnetic flux
and disordered local potentials, two key tenets of a condensed-matter system.
When sweeping the magnetic flux, we observe avoided level crossings in the
spectrum, a detailed fingerprint of the spatial distribution of local disorder.
Combining these methods, we reconstruct electronic properties of the
eigenstates where we observe persistent currents and a strong suppression of
conductance with added disorder. Our work describes an accurate method for
quantum simulation and paves the way to study novel quantum materials with

labels flip into noisy ones, is of vital importance to model label noise and
design statistically consistent classifiers. The traditional transition matrix
is limited to model closed-set label noise, where noisy training data has true
class labels within the noisy label set. It is unfitted to employ such a
transition matrix to model open-set label noise, where some true class labels

may not perform well in practice. In this paper, we focus on learning under the

noise, and further to the cluster-dependent transition matrix to better
approximate the instance-dependent label noise in real-world applications. We
term the proposed transition matrix as the cluster-dependent extended

been designed to estimate the cluster-dependent extended transition matrix by
only exploiting the noisy data. Comprehensive synthetic and real experiments
validate that our method can better model the mixed label noise, following its
more robust performance than the prior state-of-the-art label-noise learning

in the form of multiple networks observed on the same set of subjects, where
each network is obtained in a related but different experiment condition or
application scenario. Such datasets can be modeled by multilayer networks where
each layer is a separate network itself while different layers are associated
and share some common information. The present paper studies community
detection in a stylized yet informative inhomogeneous multilayer network model.
In our model, layers are generated by different stochastic block models, the
community structures of which are (random) perturbations of a common global
structure while the connecting probabilities in different layers are not
related. Focusing on the symmetric two block case, we establish minimax rates
for both global estimation of the common structure and individualized
estimation of layer-wise community structures. Both minimax rates have sharp
exponents. In addition, we provide an efficient algorithm that is
simultaneously asymptotic minimax optimal for both estimation tasks under mild
conditions. The optimal rates depend on the parity of the number of most
informative layers, a phenomenon that is caused by inhomogeneity across layers.
The method is extended to handle multiple and potentially asymmetric community
cases. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both simulated examples and a real
multi-modal single-cell dataset.

costs may lead to widespread use of household PV-battery systems. As the
adoption of these systems are heavily influenced by retail tariffs, this paper
analyses the effects of flat retail tariffs with households free to invest in
PV battery systems. Using Perth, Australia for context, an open-source model is
used to simulate household PV battery investments over a 20-year period. We
find that flat usage and feed-in tariffs lead to distinct residual demand
patterns as households' transition from PV-only to PV-battery systems.
Analysing these patterns qualitatively from the bottom-up, we identify tipping
point transitions that may challenge future electricity system management,
market participation and energy policy. The continued use of flat tariffs
incentivises PV-battery households to maximise self-consumption, which reduces
annual grid-imports, increases annual grid-exports, and shifts residual demand
towards winter. Diurnal and seasonal demand patterns continue to change as
PV-battery households eventually become net-generators. Unmanaged, these
bottom-up changes may complicate energy decarbonisation efforts within
centralised electricity markets and suggests that policymakers should prepare
for PV-battery households to play a more active role in the energy system.

increasing amount of attention due to its significant research challenges and
practical value. Most of the existing methods use a single method to express
different types of attribute features. However, the simplex pattern can neither
cover the entire set of different attribute features nor capture the
higher-level semantic features in the attribute text. This paper establishes a
novel semisupervised model, namely the multilevel attribute embedding for
semisupervised user identity linkage (MAUIL), to seek the common user identity
across social networks. MAUIL includes two components: multilevel attribute
embedding and regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA)-based linear
projection. Specifically, the text attributes for each network are first
divided into three types: character-level, word-level, and topic-level
attributes. Second, unsupervised approaches are employed to extract the
corresponding three types of text attribute features, and user relationships
are embedded as a complimentary feature. All the resultant features are
combined to form the final representation of each user. Finally, target social
networks are projected into a common correlated space by RCCA with the help of
a small number of prematched user pairs. We demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets.

bulk materials, SOC strength is a constant that cannot be modified. Here we
demonstrate SOC and intrinsic spin-splitting in atomically thin InSe, which can
be modified over an unprecedentedly large range. From quantum oscillations, we
establish that the SOC parameter \alpha is thickness-dependent; it can be
continuously modulated over a wide range by an out-of-plane electric field,
achieving intrinsic spin splitting tunable between 0 and 20 meV. Surprisingly,
\alpha could be enhanced by an order of magnitude in some devices, suggesting
that SOC can be further manipulated. Our work highlights the extraordinary

effective computing services for Internet of Things (IoT) users in remote
areas. Due to the resource limitation of satellites, such as in computing,
storage, and energy, a computation task from a IoT user can be divided into
several parts and cooperatively accomplished by multiple satellites to improve
the overall operational efficiency of satellite networks. Network function
virtualization (NFV) is viewed as a new paradigm in allocating network
resources on-demand. Satellite edge computing combined with the NFV technology
is becoming an emerging topic. In this paper, we propose a potential game
approach for virtual network function (VNF) placement in satellite edge
computing. The VNF placement problem aims to maximize the number of allocated
IoT users, while minimizing the overall deployment cost. We formulate the VNF
placement problem with maximum network payoff as a potential game and analyze
the problem by a game-theoretical approach. We implement a decentralized
resource allocation algorithm based on a potential game (PGRA) to tackle the
VNF placement problem by finding a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we conduct the
experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed PGRA algorithm. The
simulation results show that the proposed PGRA algorithm can effectively

experimental and theoretical studies in fields ranging from cold atoms to
nuclear physics. However, theoretical description of quantum tunneling with
strongly interacting particles, such as nucleons in atomic nuclei, remains a
major challenge in quantum physics.
  Purpose: An initial-value approach to tunneling accounting for the degrees of
freedom of each interacting particle is highly desirable.
  Methods: Inspired by existing methods to describe instantons with periodic
solutions in imaginary time, we investigate the possibility to use an initial
value approach to describe tunneling at the mean-field level. Real-time and
imaginary-time Hartree dynamics are compared to the exact solution in the case
of two particles in a two-well potential.
  Results: Whereas real-time evolutions exhibit a spurious self-trapping effect
preventing tunneling in strongly interacting systems, the
imaginary-time-dependent mean-field method predicts tunneling rates in
excellent agreement with the exact solution.
  Conclusions: Being an initial-value method, it could be more suitable than
approaches requiring periodic solutions to describe realistic systems such as
heavy-ion fusion.

way, the low-rank component of the original data could be recovered roughly.
However, the shortcoming is that the detail information can not be fully

Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) can provide a good representation of the

improving reflection removal, cascaded deep models have been usually adopted to

methods are still limited in exploiting the result in prior stage for guiding
transmission estimation. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage network
with reflection-aware guidance (RAGNet) for single image reflection removal

it generally is much simpler and is relatively easier to estimate.
Reflectionaware guidance (RAG) module is then elaborated for better exploiting
the estimated reflection in predicting transmission layer. By incorporating
feature maps from the estimated reflection and observation, RAG can be used (i)
to mitigate the effect of reflection from the observation, and (ii) to generate
mask in partial convolution for mitigating the effect of deviating from linear
combination hypothesis. A dedicated mask loss is further presented for
reconciling the contributions of encoder and decoder features. Experiments on
five commonly used datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative
superiority of our RAGNet in comparison to the state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

large and wide scenes (e.g., public parks, long subway platforms, or event

detail for counting, e.g., when the scene is too large to fit into the
field-of-view of the camera, too long so that the resolution is too low on
faraway crowds, or when there are too many large objects that occlude large
portions of the crowd. Therefore, to solve the wide-area counting task requires
multiple cameras with overlapping fields-of-view. In this paper, we propose a
deep neural network framework for multi-view crowd counting, which fuses
information from multiple camera views to predict a scene-level density map on

rotations is homogeneously distributed in the system and is therefore mostly

company, and pay for the energy according to pre-specified prices that consist
of a time-dependent price per unit of energy, as well as a separate price for
peak demand. Since users' utilities are their private information, which they
may not be willing to share, a mediator, known as the planner, is introduced to
help optimize the overall satisfaction of the community (total utility minus
total payments) by mechanism design. A mechanism consists of a message space, a
tax/subsidy and an allocation function for each user. Each user reports a
message chosen from her own message space, and then receives some amount of
energy determined by the allocation function and pays the tax specified by the
tax function. A desirable mechanism induces a game, the Nash equilibria (NE) of
which result in an allocation that coincides with the optimal allocation for
the community.
  As a starting point, we design a mechanism for the energy community with
desirable properties such as full implementation, strong budget balance and
individual rationality for both users and the planner. We then modify this
baseline mechanism for communities where message exchanges are allowed only
within neighborhoods, and consequently, the tax/subsidy and allocation
functions of each user are only determined by the messages from her neighbors.
All the desirable properties of the baseline mechanism are preserved in the
distributed mechanism. Finally, we present a learning algorithm for the
baseline mechanism, based on projected gradient descent, that is guaranteed to
converge to the NE of the induced game.

strategies, class accuracy rates, training times, and costs in cloud based

over a validation dataset and 68\% over a target dataset with 90\% confidence.
We also compare a single node architecture with a parameter server variant
whose workers act as a boosting mechanism. The parameter server variant
outperforms class accuracy on the target dataset reaching 73\% class accuracy
compared to the best single node approach. A comparative investigation on the
systematic performance of the single node and parameter server variant

mechanisms of a refractory high entropy alloy, Ti29Zr24Nb23Hf24 (at.%), with a
single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. High-temperature compression
tests were conducted at temperatures from 700 to 1100{\deg}C at strain rates
ranging from 10-3 to 10 s-1. A sudden stress drop after yield point was
observed at higher temperatures and lower strain rates with the Zener-Holloman
parameter, lnZ, in the range of 17.2-20.7. Such a softening behavior can be
related to the interaction of dislocations with short-range clustering.
However, at higher strain rates or lower temperatures (lnZ>25.0), kink bands
were activated being responsible for the continuous strengthening of the alloy
in competition with the softening mechanism. Systematic TEM investigations
reveal that dislocation walls formed along {110} planes and dislocation loops
were observed at a low strain of 6% at a high strain rate of 1 s-1 and
800{\deg}C. Kink band induced dynamic recrystallization is evident upon further
straining. On the other hand, at low strain rate of 10-3 s-1 and 800{\deg}C,
discontinuous recrystallization mechanisms become dominant with arrays of
dislocations forming in front of the bulged boundaries of parent grains. These
sub-grain boundaries eventually turn into high-angle grain boundaries. We also
investigate the deformation mechanism of the alloy under extremely high strain
rate (103 s-1) at room temperature. The specimen exhibits extensive kink bands
with arrays of dislocation walls. As further strained, multiple slip systems
can be activated and the interaction of dislocation walls plays a vital role in
the strain hardening of the alloy.

finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to
calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the
likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability

  Embedding Mask Optimization","Accepted to CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel 3D point cloud learning model for deep LiDAR odometry, named
PWCLO-Net, using hierarchical embedding mask optimization is proposed in this
paper. In this model, the Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for
the LiDAR odometry task is built to refine the estimated pose in a
coarse-to-fine approach hierarchically. An attentive cost volume is built to
associate two point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a novel
trainable embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local motion patterns of all
points to regress the overall pose and filter outlier points. The estimated
current pose is used to warp the first point cloud to bridge the distance to
the second point cloud, and then the cost volume of the residual motion is
built. At the same time, the embedding mask is optimized hierarchically from
coarse to fine to obtain more accurate filtering information for pose
refinement. The trainable pose warp-refinement process is iteratively used to
make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The superior performance and
effectiveness of our LiDAR odometry model are demonstrated on KITTI odometry
dataset. Our method outperforms all recent learning-based methods and
outperforms the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, on
most sequences of KITTI odometry dataset.Our source codes will be released on

Brownian motion (GFBM) introduced by Pang and Taqqu (2019) and discuss the
applications of the GFBM and its mixtures to financial asset pricing. The GFBM
is self-similar and has non-stationary increments, whose Hurst index $H \in
(0,1)$ is determined by two parameters. We identify the region of these two
parameter values where the GFBM is a semimartingale. Specifically, in one
region resulting in $H\in (1/2,1)$, it is in fact a process of finite variation
and differentiable, and in another region also resulting in $H\in (1/2,1)$ it
is not a semimartingale. For regions resulting in $H \in (0,1/2]$ except the
Brownian motion case, the GFBM is also not a semimartingale. We establish
$p$-variation results of the GFBM, which are used to provide an alternative
proof of the non-semimartingale property when $H < 1/2$.
  We next show that the mixed process made up of an independent BM and a GFBM
is a semimartingale when the Hurst parameter for the GFBM is $H \in (1/2,1)$ in
both regions mentioned above, and derive the associated equivalent Brownian
measure. This result is in great contrast with the mixed FBM with $H \in
\{1/2\}\cup(3/4,1]$ proved by Cheridito (2001) and shows the significance of
the additional parameter introduced in the GFBM.
  We then study the semimartingale asset pricing theory with the mixed GFBM, in
presence of long range dependence. Our work extends Cheridito (2001) on the
mixed FBM asset pricing model in which the Hurst parameter of the FBM is $H \in
(3/4,1)$, because the Hurst parameter range of the GFBM is enlarged to
$(1/2,1)$. In addition, when the GFBM is a process of finite variation
mentioned above (resulting in $H\in (1/2,1)$), the mixed GFBM process as a
stock price model is a Brownian motion with a random drift of finite variation.

which has been variously dated between late 1239 and 1241, with the
understanding that narrowing the range in which this event occurred contributes
much to understanding the political situation in the area around 1240. George
Akropolites, a famous official of the Empire, gives an account that connects
Eirene's death to a comet that appeared ""six months earlier"", thus pointing to
two comet candidates that were visible from the Eastern Mediterranean between
1239 and 1241, one recorded on ""3 June 1239"" and the other on ""31 January
1240"". Recent historians prefer the former, based on historical circumstances
and without a critical assessment of the comet records. We revisit the
historical records and reveal that the ""3 June 1239"" candidate was not a comet.
On the other hand, the other candidate, sighted on ""31 January 1240"", was a
comet, as supported by multiple historical records in multiple regions, and is
also a good fit with Akropolites's narrative. Therefore, we conclude that
Eirene died six months after the comet that was seen on 31 January 1240, which
places her death in the summer of 1240. Given that the date of her death is
crucial for determining some other contemporary events across the Eastern
Mediterranean, our results offer a solid basis for further research on the
thirteenth-century Eastern Mediterranean.

studying macroscopic aspects of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence together with
the Hall term is meaningful since this term often influences not only
sub-ion-scales but also macroscopic scales. A new sub-ion-scale sub-grid-scale
model for large eddy simulations of Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is
developed in order to overcome the difficulties. Large eddy simulations by the
use of the new model successfully reproduce statistical natures such as the
energies and probability density functions of the vorticity and current

Our new sub-grid-scale model enables numerical simulations of homogeneous and
isotropic Hall magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a small computational cost,
improving the essential resolution of an LES from that carried out with earlier

wind-forced perturbations and disturbances caused by impulsive forces to wires.
Our main contribution is to answer whether or not historical positions and
velocities of a mmWave node is useful to track directional beams given the
complicated on-wire dynamics. To this end, we implement beam-tracking based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the complicated relationships
between the historical positions/velocities and appropriate beam steering
angles. Our numerical evaluations yielded the following key insights: Against
wind perturbations, an appropriate beam-tracking policy can be learned from the
historical positions and velocities of a node. Meanwhile, against impulsive
forces to the wire, the use of the position and velocity of the node is not
necessarily sufficient owing to the rapid displacement of the node. To solve
this, we propose to take advantage of the positional interaction on the wire by
leveraging the positions/velocities of several points on the wire as state
information in DRL. The results confirmed that this results in the avoidance of
beam misalignment, which would not be possible by using only the
position/velocity of the node.

chimera states, are a new type of dynamical patterns emerged in spatiotemporal
systems due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the system dynamics. In
generating SWC, the conventional wisdom is that the dynamical elements should
be coupled in a nonlocal fashion. For this reason, it is commonly believed that
SWC is excluded from the general reaction-diffusion (RD) systems possessing
only local couplings. Here, by an experimentally feasible model of
three-component FitzHugh-Nagumo-type RD system, we demonstrate that, even
though the system elements are locally coupled, stable SWCs can still be
observed in a wide region in the parameter space. The properties of SWCs are
explored, and the underlying mechanisms are analyzed from the point view of
coupled oscillators. Transitions from SWC to incoherent states are also
investigated, and it is found that SWCs are typically destabilized in two
scenarios, namely core breakup and core expansion. The former is characterized
by a continuous breakup of the single asynchronous core into a number of small
asynchronous cores, whereas the latter is featured by the continuous expansion
of the single asynchronous core to the whole space. Remarkably, in the scenario
of core expansion, the system may develop into an intriguing state in which
regular spiral waves are embedded in a completely disordered background. This
state, which is named shadowed spirals, manifests from a new perspective the
coexistence of incoherent and coherent states in spatiotemporal systems,
generalizing therefore the traditional concept of chimera states. Our studies
provide an affirmative answer to the observation of SWCs in RD systems, and
pave a way to the realization of SWCs in experiments.

using two different plasma techniques. The first plasma technique utilizes
frequency downshifting of the drive laser pulse in a nonlinear plasma wake.
Based on this technique, we have proposed and demonstrated that in a tailored
plasma structure multi-millijoule energy, single-cycle, long-wavelength IR
(3-20 $\mu$m) pulses can be generated by using an 810 nm Ti:sapphire drive
laser. Here we extend this idea to the THz frequency regime. We show that
sub-joule, terawatts, single-cycle terahertz (2-12 THz, or 150-25 $\mu$m)
pulses can be generated by replacing the drive laser with a picosecond 10
$\mu$m CO$_2$ laser and a different shaped plasma structure. The second plasma
technique employs frequency upshifting by colliding a CO$_2$ laser with a
rather sharp relativistic ionization front created by ionization of a gas in
less than half cycle (17 fs) of the CO$_2$ laser. Even though the electrons in
the ionization front carry no energy, the frequency of the CO$_2$ laser can be
upshifted due to the relativistic Doppler effect as the CO$_2$ laser pulse
enters the front. The wavelength can be tuned from 1-10 $\mu$m by simply
changing the electron density of the front. While the upshifted light with $5
<\lambda(\mu$m$)< 10$ propagates in the forward direction, that with $1
<\lambda(\mu$m$)< 5$ is back-reflected. These two plasma techniques seem
extremely promising for covering the entire molecular fingerprint region.

the complete silhouette of an object even when the object is not fully visible.
For each detected object, previous methods directly regress the target mask
from input features. However, images of an object under different amounts of
occlusion should have the same amodal mask output, which makes it harder to
train the regression model. To alleviate the problem, we propose to classify
input features into intermediate shape codes and recover complete object shapes
from them. First, we pre-train the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder
(VQ-VAE) model to learn these discrete shape codes from ground truth amodal
masks. Then, we incorporate the VQ-VAE model into the amodal instance
segmentation pipeline with an additional refinement module. We also detect an
occlusion map to integrate occlusion information with a backbone feature. As
such, our network faithfully detects bounding boxes of amodal objects. On an
internal embryo cell image benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods. To show generalizability, we show segmentation
results on the public KINS natural image benchmark. To examine the learned
shape codes and model design choices, we perform ablation studies on a
synthetic dataset of simple overlaid shapes. Our method would enable accurate
measurement of blastomeres in in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics, which
potentially can increase IVF success rate.

variation, although it is well known that this approach does not provide
adequate distinction between random vectors whose components are not always

representations have been proposed, with the most well-known being hidden
regular variation and the conditional extreme value model. These varying
depictions of extremal dependence arise through consideration of different
parts of the multivariate domain, and particularly exploring what happens when
extremes of one variable may grow at different rates to other variables. Thus
far, these alternative representations have come from distinct sources and
links between them are limited. In this work we elucidate many of the relevant

diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, interpretation of MRI
suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby
contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk
cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly
improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer
locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had
radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth
cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration
approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the
cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet,
a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology
image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image
preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep
neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI
using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and
histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and
evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an
additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that
our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and
is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm.
This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate
MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate
cancer on MRI. Our code is freely available at

qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative analysis, we
compare these platforms from three aspects (i.e., development, deployment, and
runtime) based on their official documentation to construct a taxonomy of
characteristics. In quantitative analysis, we analyze the runtime performance
of these platforms from multiple dimensions with well-designed benchmarks.
First, we analyze three key factors that can influence the startup latency of
serverless-based applications. Second, we compare the resource efficiency of
different platforms with 16 representative benchmarks. Finally, we measure
their performance difference when dealing with different concurrent requests,

to high-harmonic generation in crystalline solids which is able to properly
describe degenerate bands and band crossings is presented and analyzed. It is
well-known that numerical band structure calculations typically provide
electronic wave functions with an undetermined k-dependent phase which results
in matrix elements which contain arbitrary k-dependent phases. In addition,
such approaches usually mix degenerate bands and bands with an energy
difference smaller than the numerical precision in an arbitrary way for each
point in k-space. These ambiguities are problematic if one considers the
dynamics induced by electric fields since the matrix elements of the position
operator involve a derivative of the wave functions with respect to k. When the
light-matter interaction is described in the length gauge, the problem of
arbitrary phases and degenerate subspace mixing of Bloch states is solved by
adopting a smooth gauge transformation along the field direction. The results
obtained within this method are validated by comparing with calculations in the
velocity gauge. Although we obtain in both gauges the same overall result, the
length gauge is advantageous since it converges with a smaller number of bands
and thus requires significantly less numerical effort than the velocity gauge.
Also an unique distinction between inter- and intraband contributions and thus
an instructive physical interpretation is possible in the length gauge whereas
in the velocity gauge this is unclear. The computed
polarization-direction-dependent high-harmonic spectra agree well with
experimental data reported for GaAs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that,
under proper conditions, the Berry curvature is largely responsible for the
even-order harmonics which are polarized perpendicular to the driving field.

sought-after allotropes of carbon. The sp2 hybridized and thermodynamically
stable form of carbon forms a layered structure with strong in-plane carbon
bonds and weak inter-layer van der Waals bonding. Graphite is also a
high-temperature ceramic, and shaping them into complex geometries is
challenging, given its limited sintering behavior even at high temperatures.
Although the geometric design of the graphite structure in many of the
applications could dictate its precision performance, conventional synthesis
methods for formulating complex geometric graphite shapes are limited due to
the intrinsic brittleness and difficulties of high-temperature processing.
Here, we report the development of colloidal graphite ink from commercial
graphite powders with reproducible rheological behavior that allows the
fabrication of any complex architectures with tunable geometry and
directionality via 3D printing at room temperature. The method is enabled via
using small amounts of clay, another layered material, as an additive, allowing
the proper design of the graphene ink and subsequent binding of graphite
platelets during printing. Sheared layers of clay are easily able to flow,
adapt, and interface with graphite layers forming strong binding between the
layers and between particles that make the larger structures. The direct ink
printing of complex 3D architectures of graphite without further heat
treatments could lead to easy shape engineering and related applications of
graphite at various length scales, including complex graphite molds or
crucibles. The 3D printed complex graphitic structures exhibit excellent
thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, and the clay additive does not
seem to alter these properties due to the excellent inter-layer dispersion and

visualize high-dimensional data, the t-SNE leads to more powerful and flexible
visualization on 2 or 3-dimensional mapping than the SNE by using a
t-distribution as the distribution of low-dimensional data. Recently, Uniform
manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is proposed as a dimensionality
reduction technique. We present a novel technique called a q-Gaussian

Therefore, the q-SNE can also express the t-SNE and the SNE by changing the

September 6th. One MFR has positive magnetic twist which is a different sign
from other two MFRs. Since the temporal evolution of the magnetic flux of the

formation of the MFR having the positive twist is closely related to the
occurrence of the M-class flares including an M5.5 flare. We further found a
magnetic null in the magnetic field surrounding the MFRs, in particular, above
the MFR having positive twist before the M5.5 flare which is the largest
M-flare observed during this period. By comparing with the AIA 1600 angstrom

that reconnection induced by the torus instability of the positively twisted

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Safeguard functions such as those provided by advanced emergency braking
(AEB) can provide another layer of safety for autonomous vehicles (AV). A smart
safeguard function should adapt the activation conditions to the driving
policy, to avoid unnecessary interventions as well as improve vehicle safety.
This paper proposes a driving-policy adaptive safeguard (DPAS) design,
including a collision avoidance strategy and an activation function. The
collision avoidance strategy is designed in a reinforcement learning framework,
obtained by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It can learn from past collisions
and manipulate both braking and steering in stochastic traffics. The
driving-policy adaptive activation function should dynamically assess current
driving policy risk and kick in when an urgent threat is detected. To generate
this activation function, MCTS' exploration and rollout modules are designed to
fully evaluate the AV's current driving policy, and then explore other safer
actions. In this study, the DPAS is validated with two typical highway-driving
policies. The results are obtained through and 90,000 times in the stochastic
and aggressive simulated traffic. The results are calibrated by naturalistic
driving data and show that the proposed safeguard reduces the collision rate
significantly without introducing more interventions, compared with the
state-based benchmark safeguards. In summary, the proposed safeguard leverages
the learning-based method in stochastic and emergent scenarios and imposes
minimal influence on the driving policy.

controlled Markov chain formulation is proposed to model a homogeneous
population of users with binary demands (i.e., off or on). The binary demands
often arise in scheduling applications such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Normally, an independent service operator (ISO) has a finite number of options
when it comes to providing the users with electricity. The options represent
various incentive means, generation resources, and price profiles. The
objective of the ISO is to find optimal options in order to keep the
distribution of demands close to a desired level (which varies with time, in
general) by imposing the minimum price on the users. A Bellman equation is
developed here to identify the globally team-optimal strategy. The proposed
strategy is fair for all users and also protects the privacy of users.
Moreover, its computational complexity increases linearly (rather than
exponentially) with the number of users. A numerical example with 100 users is
presented for peak-load management.

ones from a set of code snippets. The main challenge of effective code
retrieval lies in mitigating the semantic gap between natural language

recent years. Its applicability, however, is still very much limited, due in
large part to the lack of efficient computational methods for calculating
higher-dimensional models. The high computational complexity shows itself
especially in the calculation of the imprecise version of the Kolmogorov
backward equation. The equation is represented at every point of an interval in
the form of a minimization problem, solvable merely with linear programming
techniques. Consequently, finding an exact solution on an entire interval is
infeasible, whence approximation approaches have been developed. To achieve
sufficient accuracy, in general, the linear programming optimization methods
need to be used in a large number of time points.
  The principal goal of this paper is to provide a new, more efficient approach
for solving the imprecise Kolmogorov backward equation. It is based on the
Lipschitz continuity of the solutions of the equation with respect to time,
causing the linear programming problems appearing in proximate points of the
time interval to have similar optimal solutions. This property is exploited by
utilizing the theory of normal cones of convex sets. The present article is
primarily devoted to providing the theoretical basis for the novel technique,
yet, the initial testing shows that in most cases it decisively outperforms the
existing methods.

knowledge graphs (BioKG) that provide direct and precise biomedical knowledge.
In the context of COVID-19, this issue is even more necessary to be
highlighted. However, most BioKG construction inevitably includes numerous
conflicts and noises deriving from incorrect knowledge descriptions in
literature and defective information extraction techniques. Many studies have
demonstrated that reasoning upon the knowledge graph is effective in
eliminating such conflicts and noises. This paper proposes a method BioGRER to
improve the BioKG's quality, which comprehensively combines the knowledge graph
embedding and logic rules that support and negate triplets in the BioKG. In the
proposed model, the BioKG refinement problem is formulated as the probability
estimation for triplets in the BioKG. We employ the variational EM algorithm to
optimize knowledge graph embedding and logic rule inference alternately. In
this way, our model could combine efforts from both the knowledge graph
embedding and logic rules, leading to better results than using them alone. We
evaluate our model over a COVID-19 knowledge graph and obtain competitive
results.

resources to the nodes of the network, and the attacker attacks a node, with
the objective to maximize the damage caused. Existing models assume that the
attack at node u causes damage only at u. However, in many real-world security
scenarios, the attack at a node u spreads to the neighbors of u and can cause
damage at multiple nodes, e.g., for the outbreak of a virus. In this paper, we
consider the network defending problem against contagious attacks.
  Existing works that study shared resources assume that the resource allocated
to a node can be shared or duplicated between neighboring nodes. However, in
real world, sharing resource naturally leads to a decrease in defending power
of the source node, especially when defending against contagious attacks. To
this end, we study the model in which resources allocated to a node can only be
transferred to its neighboring nodes, which we refer to as a reallocation
process.
  We show that this more general model is difficult in two aspects: (1) even
for a fixed allocation of resources, we show that computing the optimal
reallocation is NP-hard; (2) for the case when reallocation is not allowed, we
show that computing the optimal allocation (against contagious attack) is also
NP-hard. For positive results, we give a mixed integer linear program
formulation for the problem and a bi-criteria approximation algorithm. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the allocation and reallocation
strategies our algorithm computes perform well in terms of minimizing the
damage due to contagious attacks.

Among which time series is common in many scenarios like credit card payment,
user behavior, and sensors. General feature selection for features extracted by
sliding window aggregate calls for time-consuming iteration to generate
features, and then traditional feature selection methods are employed to rank
them. The decision of key parameter, i.e. the period of sliding windows,
depends on the domain knowledge and calls for trivial. Currently, there is no
automatic method to handle the sliding window aggregate features selection. As
the time consumption of feature generation with different periods and sliding
windows is huge, it is very hard to enumerate them all and then select them.
  In this paper, we propose a general framework using Markov Chain to solve
this problem. This framework is very efficient and has high accuracy, such that
it is able to perform feature selection on a variety of features and period
options. We show the detail by 2 common sliding windows and 3 types of

cutoff energy parameter ($\varepsilon_0$) and shock speed ($v_{\rm sh}$) are

a correlation between $\eta$ and an age of $t$ (or an expansion parameter of

  Based on how to model the object shape, current instance segmentation systems
can be divided into two categories, implicit and explicit models. The implicit
methods, which represent the object mask/contour by intractable network
parameters, and produce it through pixel-wise classification, are predominant.
However, the explicit methods, which parameterize the shape with simple and
explainable models, are less explored. Since the operations to generate the
final shape are light-weighted, the explicit methods have a clear speed
advantage over implicit methods, which is crucial for real-world applications.
The proposed USD-Seg adopts a linear model, sparse coding with dictionary, for
object shapes.
  First, it learns a dictionary from a large collection of shape datasets,
making any shape being able to be decomposed into a linear combination through
the dictionary.
  Hence the name ""Universal Shape Dictionary"".
  Then it adds a simple shape vector regression head to ordinary object
detector, giving the detector segmentation ability with minimal overhead.

they diagnose their medical conditions based on the symptoms they are
experiencing, which is also known as self-diagnosis. From the machine learning
perspective, online disease diagnosis is a sequential feature (symptom)
selection and classification problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are
the standard approaches to this type of tasks. Generally, they perform well
when the feature space is small, but frequently become inefficient in tasks
with a large number of features, such as the self-diagnosis. To address the
challenge, we propose a non-RL Bipartite Scalable framework for Online Disease
diAgnosis, called BSODA. BSODA is composed of two cooperative branches that
handle symptom-inquiry and disease-diagnosis, respectively. The inquiry branch
determines which symptom to collect next by an information-theoretic reward. We
employ a Product-of-Experts encoder to significantly improve the handling of
partial observations of a large number of features. Besides, we propose several
approximation methods to substantially reduce the computational cost of the
reward to a level that is acceptable for online services. Additionally, we
leverage the diagnosis model to estimate the reward more precisely. For the
diagnosis branch, we use a knowledge-guided self-attention model to perform
predictions. In particular, BSODA determines when to stop inquiry and output
predictions using both the inquiry and diagnosis models. We demonstrate that
BSODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets.
Moreover, we propose a novel evaluation method to test the transferability of
symptom checking methods from synthetic to real-world tasks. Compared to
existing RL baselines, BSODA is more effectively scalable to large search
spaces.

two types of scalarized black hole solutions, i.e., scalarized RN-like and
Schwarzschild-like solutions. Although the behavior of scalarized RN-like

the EMS model, we find that there exist significant differences between
scalarized Schwarzschild-like solutions in the EBIS model and scalarized
solutions in the EMS model. In particular, the domain of existence of
scalarized Schwarzschild-like solutions possesses a certain region, which is
composed of two branches. The branch of larger horizon area is a family of
disconnected scalarized solutions, which do not bifurcate from scalar-free
black holes. However, the branch of smaller horizon area may or may not
bifurcate from scalar-free black holes depending on the parameters.
Additionally, these two branches of scalarized solutions can be both

has been recently successfully grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy.
However, little is known to date about the growth mechanism for such puckered
honeycomb monolayer. In this study, by using scanning tunneling microscopy in
combination with first-principles density functional theory calculations, we
unveil that the puckered honeycomb Sb monolayer takes a kinetics-limited
two-step growth mode. As the coverage of Sb increases, the Sb atoms firstly
form the distorted hexagonal lattice as the half layer, and then the distorted
hexagonal half-layer transforms into the puckered honeycomb lattice as the full
layer. These results provide the atomic-scale insight in understanding the
growth mechanism of puckered honeycomb monolayer, and can be instructive to the
direct growth of other monolayers with the same structure.

junctions are often performed in solvents. Solvent-molecule coupling and
physical properties of the solvent can be used as the external stimulus to
control electric current through a molecule. In this paper, we propose a model,
which includes dynamical effects of solvent-molecule interaction in the
non-equilibrium Green's function calculations of electric current. The solvent
is considered as a macroscopic dipole moment that reorients stochastically and
interacts with the electrons tunnelling through the molecular junction. The
Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym equations for electronic Green's functions are solved in
time-domain with subsequent averaging over random realisations of rotational
variables using Furutsu-Novikov method for exact closure of infinite hierarchy
of stochastic correlation functions. The developed theory requires the use of
wide-band approximation as well as classical treatment of solvent degrees of
freedom. The theory is applied to a model molecular junction. It is
demonstrated that not only electrostatic interaction between molecular junction
and solvent but also solvent viscosity can be used to control electrical
properties of the junction. Aligning of the rotating dipole moment breaks
particle-hole symmetry of the transmission favouring either hole or electron
transport channels depending upon the aligning potential.

construct the ""Minimal Theory of Bigravity"" (MTBG), a theory of two interacting
spin-2 fields that propagates only four local degrees of freedom instead of the
usual seven ones and that allows for the same homogeneous and isotropic
cosmological solutions as in Hassan-Rosen bigravity (HRBG). Starting from a
precursor theory that propagates six local degrees of freedom, we carefully
choose additional constraints to eliminate two of them to construct the theory.
Investigating the cosmology of MTBG, we find that it accommodates two different
branches of homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, equivalent on-shell
to the two branches that are present in HRBG. Those branches in MTBG differ
however from the HRBG ones at the perturbative level, are both perfectly
healthy and do not exhibit strong coupling issues nor ghost instabilities. In
the so-called self-accelerating branch, characterized by the presence of an
effective cosmological constant, the scalar and vector sectors are the same as
in General Relativity (GR). In the so-called normal branch, the scalar sector
exhibits non-trivial phenomenology, while its vector sector remains the same as
in GR. In both branches, the tensor sector exhibits the usual HRBG features: an
effective mass term and oscillations of the gravitons. Therefore MTBG provides
a stable nonlinear completion of the cosmology in HRBG.

classification of different kinds of attention mechanisms in Deep Learning (DL)

InstaGATs, an LSTM with attention and a CNN with attention. We used these
models to classify normal and abnormal (i.e., artifactual or pathological) EEG
patterns. Results: We achieved the state of the art in all classification
problems, regardless the large variability of the datasets and the simple
architecture of the attention-enhanced models. We could also prove that,
depending on how the attention mechanism is applied and where the attention
layer is located in the model, we can alternatively leverage the information
contained in the time, frequency or space domain of the dataset. Conclusions:
with this work, we shed light over the role of different attention mechanisms
in the classification of normal and abnormal EEG patterns. Moreover, we
discussed how they can exploit the intrinsic relationships in the temporal,
frequency and spatial domains of our brain activity. Significance: Attention
represents a promising strategy to evaluate the quality of the EEG information,
and its relevance, in different real-world scenarios. Moreover, it can make it
easier to parallelize the computation and, thus, to speed up the analysis of
big electrophysiological (e.g., EEG) datasets.

increasing pressure, because of the interaction of Mn-d and O-p states. We also
find same pressure indused bandgap evolutions in the Pnnm phases of SiO2, GeO2,
SnO2 and PbO2. The different ways of octahedral connection in Pnnm phase and
Pa-3 phase leads to an interesting pressure-induced bandgap enlarging. And in
the Pa-3 phase, the band gap can be tuned to 1.34 eV by pressure to meet the
Shockley-Queisser limit. Moreover the two high pressure phases can be quenched

the last years. An essential aspect in the development of AVs is the assessment
of quality and performance aspects of the AVs, such as safety, comfort, and
efficiency. Among other methods, a scenario-based approach has been proposed.
With scenario-based testing, the AV is subjected to a collection of scenarios
that represent real-world situations.
  The collection of scenarios needs to cover the variety of what an AV can
encounter in real traffic. As a result, many different scenarios are
considered, that are grouped into so-called scenario categories. We propose a
method for defining the scenario categories using a system of tags, where each
tag describes a particular characteristic of a scenario category.
  There is a balance between having generic scenario categories - very specific
set of scenarios, while for another system one might be interested in a set of
scenarios with a high variety. To accommodate this, tags are structured in
trees. The different layers of the trees can be regarded as different
abstraction levels.
  Next to presenting the method for describing scenario categories using tags,
we will illustrate the method by showing applicable trees of tags using
concrete examples in the Singapore traffic system. Trees of tags are shown for
the vehicle under test, the dynamic environment (e.g., the other road users),
the static environment (e.g., the road layout), and the environmental
conditions (weather and lighting conditions). Few examples are presented to
illustrate the proposed method for defining the scenario categories using tags.

computing critical exponents and correlation functions of statistical mechanics
systems at a second order phase transition, or of condensed matter systems at a
quantum critical point. Conformal invariance is expected to be a feature of the
fixed point theory obtained from a microscopic model at criticality, under
appropriate averaging and rescaling operations: the action of the Wilsonian
Renormalization Group (RG). Unfortunately, an explicit connection between
critical microscopic models and their conformally invariant scaling limit is
still lacking in general. Nevertheless, the last decades witnessed significant
progress on this topic, both from the mathematical and physics sides, where
several new tools have been introduced and their ranges of applications have
constantly and significantly increased: I refer here, e.g., to discrete
holomorphicity, SLE, the use of lattice Ward Identities in constructive RG, the
conformal bootstrap program and its recent applications to 3D CFT. In an effort
to make further progress on these problems, the one-day workshop ""Emergent CFTs

isomorphic in time $q^{O(n)}$ for most $f$. This average-case setting has
direct practical implications, having been studied in multivariate cryptography
since the 1990s. Our second result concerns the complexity of testing
equivalence of alternating trilinear forms. This problem is of interest in both
mathematics and cryptography. We show that this problem is polynomial-time
equivalent to testing equivalence of symmetric trilinear forms, by showing that
they are both Tensor Isomorphism-complete (Grochow-Qiao, ITCS, 2021), therefore
is equivalent to testing isomorphism of cubic forms over most fields.

Raviart Thomas and Nedelec mass matrices map from degrees of freedoms (DoFs)

since they are dense.
  In this paper we present a new geometric construction of sparse inverse mass
matrices for arbitrary tetrahedral grids and possibly anisotropic materials,
debunking the conventional wisdom that the barycentric dual grid prohibits a
sparse representation for inverse mass matrices. In particular, we provide a
unified framework for the construction of both edge and face mass matrices and
their sparse inverses. Such a unifying principle relies on novel geometric
reconstruction formulas, from which, according to a well established design
strategy, local mass matrices are constructed as the sum of a consistent and a
stabilization term. A major difference with the approaches proposed so far is
that the consistent term is defined geometrically and explicitly, that is,
without the necessity of computing the inverses of local matrices. This
provides a sensible speedup and an easier implementation. We use these new
sparse inverse mass matrices to discretize a three dimensional Poisson problem,
providing the comparison between the results obtained by various formulations

imputation from a joint multivariate normal model of the patient

substantially improved the MSE (0.10 vs. 0.13), c-index (0.70 vs 0.68) and
calibration (calibration-in-the-large: 0.04 vs. 0.06; calibration slope: 1.01

induce higher-energy states characteristic of glass formation on faster

strains and well below the temperatures of thermally induced structural change,
is important, for example, in improving plasticity. Molecular-dynamics
simulations elucidate the mechanisms by which thermal cycling can induce
relaxation (reaching lower energy) as well as rejuvenation. Thermal cycling,
over tens of cycles, drives local atomic rearrangements progressively erasing
the initial glass structure. This arises mainly from the heating stage in each
thermal cycle, linked to the intrinsic structural heterogeneity in metallic
glasses. Although, in particular, the timescales in MD simulations are shorter
than in physical experiments, the present simulations reproduce many physically

spin-glass-type behavior with a unique two-step freezing at Tf1 about 80 K and
Tf2 about 35 K. Magnetic hyperfine splitting of 57Fe Moessbauer spectra was
observed below T* about 104 K (Tf1 < T*). The spectra just below T* (Tf1 < T <

indicating the existence of short-range correlations. The stochastic model of
ionic spin relaxation was used to account for the shape of the Moessbauer

radio transmitter for applications where alternative analog transmit circuits
are impractical. An important paramter for assessing the viability of an RF WPT
system is its end-to-end efficiency. In this regard, we present a prototype
test-bed comprising a software-defined radio (SDR) transmitter and an energy
harvesting receiver with a low resistive load; employing an SDR makes our
research meaningful for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT). We analyze the effect of clipping and non-linear amplification at the
SDR on multisine waveforms. Our experiments suggest that when the DC input
power at the transmitter is constant, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
multisine are unsuitable for RF WPT over a flat-fading channel, due to their
low average radiated power. The results indicate that the end-to-end efficiency
is positively correlated to the average RF power of the waveform, and that it
reduces with increasing PAPR. Consequently, digital modulations such as
phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modeulation (QAM) yield
better end-to-end efficiency than multisines. Moreover, the end-to-end
efficiency of PSK and QAM signals is invariant of the transmission bit rate. An
in-depth analysis of the end-to-end efficiency of WPT reveals that the
transmitter efficiency is lower than the receiver efficiency. Furthermore, we
study the impact of a reflecting surface on the end-to-end efficiency of WPT,
and assess the transmission quality of the information signals by evaluating
their error vector magnitude (EVM) for SWIPT. Overall, the experimental
observations of end-to-end efficiency and EVM suggest that, while employing an
SDR transmitter with fixed DC input power, a baseband quadrature PSK signal is
most suitable for SWIPT at large, among PSK and QAM signals.

""direct-method"" spatially-resolved metallicity observations using multispecies
auroral lines in a galaxy from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. SAMI609396B, at redshift
$z=0.018$, is a low-mass galaxy in a minor merger with intense star formation,
analogous to conditions at high redshifts. We use three methods to derive
direct metallicities and compare with strong-line diagnostics. The spatial
metallicity trends show significant differences among the three direct methods.
Our first method is based on the commonly used electron temperature
$T_e$([OIII]) from the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line and a traditional
$T_e$([OII]) -- $T_e$([OIII]) calibration. The second method applies a recent
empirical correction to the O$^+$ abundance from the [OIII]/[OII] strong-line
ratio. The third method infers the $T_e$([OII]) from the
[SII]$\lambda\lambda$4069,76 auroral lines. The first method favours a positive
metallicity gradient along SAMI609396B, whereas the second and third methods
yield flattened gradients. Strong-line diagnostics produce mostly flat
gradients, albeit with unquantified contamination from shocked regions. We
conclude that overlooked assumptions about the internal temperature structure
of HII regions in the direct method can lead to large discrepancies in
metallicity gradient studies. Our detailed analysis of SAMI609396B underlines
that high-accuracy metallicity gradient measurements require a wide array of
emission lines and improved spatial resolutions in order to properly constrain
excitation sources, physical conditions, and temperature structures of the
emitting gas. Integral-field spectroscopic studies with future facilities such
as JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based ELTs will be crucial in minimising systematic
effects on measured gradients in distant galaxies.

problem sizes, as long as the number of input vectors is divisible to the
number of computing units available in the architecture. Due to the complexity

Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to strike a balance between the benefits

differential privacy stands out for its ability to prevent predicate singling
out attacks and its composable privacy guarantees. A drawback of differential
privacy is the lack of interpretability of the main privacy parameter it relies
upon, namely epsilon. This leads to the recurrent question of how much epsilon
is enough? This article proposes a method to determine the epsilon value to be
used when disclosing the output of a process mining technique in terms of two
business-relevant metrics, namely absolute percentage error metrics capturing
the loss of accuracy (a.k.a. utility loss) resulting from adding noise to the

probability that an adversary may guess information about an individual as a

such a model, the nonlocal Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson equation, in the
so-called critical case, which corresponds to propagation in inviscid fluids.
The memory has an exponentially fading character and type I, meaning that
involves only the acoustic velocity potential. A major challenge in the global
analysis is that the linearized equation's decay estimates are of
regularity-loss type. As a result, the classical energy methods fail to work
for the nonlinear problem. To overcome this difficulty, we construct
appropriate time-weighted norms, where weights can have negative exponents.
These problem-tailored norms create artificial damping terms that help control
the nonlinearity and the loss of derivatives, and ultimately allow us to
discover the model's asymptotic behavior.

However, the mathematical principle of these algorithms is far from being

We prove that the dynamical system algorithms can be designed to minimize a
continuous function whose local minimum points give all the candidates of the
Ising model and the global minimum gives the minimizer of Ising problem. Using
this mathematical mechanism, we can easily understand several dynamical system
algorithms of the Ising model such as the coherent Ising machine, the
Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators and the simulated bifurcation algorithm.

properties of the simulated bifurcation algorithm to explain its convergence by
the low energy transit and capture in celestial mechanics. A detailed

Either way, predicting critical buckling conditions remains a long-standing
challenge. The subcritical nature of shell buckling imparts extreme sensitivity
to material and geometric imperfections. Consequently, measured critical loads
are inevitably lower than classic theoretical predictions. Here, we present a
robust mechanism to dynamically tune the buckling strength of shells,
exploiting the coupling between mechanics and magnetism. Our experiments on
pressurized spherical shells made of a magnetorheological elastomer demonstrate
the tunability of their buckling pressure via magnetic actuation. We develop a
theoretical model for thin magnetic elastic shells, which rationalizes the

magneto-elastic buckling number is recognized as the key governing parameter,
combining the geometrical, mechanical, and magnetic properties of the system.

given. The main aim of our work is to pursue this line of research and to
address the question how ""large"" (in terms of dimension) are genuinely
entangled subspaces that can be self-tested, concentrating on the multiqubit
stabilizer formalism. To this end, we first introduce a framework allowing to
efficiently check whether a given stabilizer subspace is genuinely entangled.
Building on it, we then determine the maximal dimension of genuinely entangled
subspaces that can be constructed within the stabilizer subspaces and provide
an exemplary construction of such maximally-dimensional subspaces for any
number of qubits. Third, we construct Bell inequalities that are maximally
violated by any entangled state from those subspaces and thus also any mixed
states supported on them, and we show these inequalities to be useful for
self-testing. Interestingly, our Bell inequalities allow for identification of
higher-dimensional face structures in the boundaries of the sets of quantum
correlations in the simplest multipartite Bell scenarios in which every
observer performs two dichotomic measurements.

Existing learning-based methods for mesh reconstruction mostly generate
triangles individually, making it hard to create manifold meshes. We leverage
the properties of 2D Delaunay triangulations to construct a mesh from manifold
surface elements. Our method first estimates local geodesic neighborhoods
around each point. We then perform a 2D projection of these neighborhoods using
a learned logarithmic map. A Delaunay triangulation in this 2D domain is
guaranteed to produce a manifold patch, which we call a Delaunay surface
element. We synchronize the local 2D projections of neighboring elements to
maximize the manifoldness of the reconstructed mesh. Our results show that we
achieve better overall manifoldness of our reconstructed meshes than current
methods to reconstruct meshes with arbitrary topology. Our code, data and

separate the foreground of an image from the background. One of the many tasks
for which it is useful is that of preprocessing document images in order to
identify relevant information, such as text or symbols. The wide variety of
document types, alphabets, and formats makes binarization challenging. There
are multiple proposals with which to solve this problem, from classical
manually-adjusted methods, to more recent approaches based on machine learning.
The latter techniques require a large amount of training data in order to
obtain good results; however, labeling a portion of each existing collection of
documents is not feasible in practice. This is a common problem in supervised
learning, which can be addressed by using the so-called Domain Adaptation (DA)
techniques. These techniques take advantage of the knowledge learned in one
domain, for which labeled data are available, to apply it to other domains for
which there are no labeled data. This paper proposes a method that combines
neural networks and DA in order to carry out unsupervised document
binarization. However, when both the source and target domains are very
similar, this adaptation could be detrimental. Our methodology, therefore,
first measures the similarity between domains in an innovative manner in order
to determine whether or not it is appropriate to apply the adaptation process.
The results reported in the experimentation, when evaluating up to 20 possible
combinations among five different domains, show that our proposal successfully
deals with the binarization of new document domains without the need for
labeled data.

that could remarkably affect the predictive result. Moreover, each
hyperparameter of an ML algorithm is potentially intertwined with the others,
and changing it might result in unforeseeable impacts on the remaining
hyperparameters. Evolutionary optimization is a promising method to try and
address those issues. According to this method, performant models are stored,
while the remainder are improved through crossover and mutation processes

this evolutionary procedure. In summary, our proposed tool helps the user to
generate new models through evolution and eventually explore powerful
hyperparameter combinations in diverse regions of the extensive hyperparameter

materials such as the hole-doped cuprates that possess a simple band structure.
The prevailing dogma is that strange metallicity in the cuprates is tied to a
quantum critical point at a doping $p*$ inside the superconducting dome. Here,
we study the high-field in-plane magnetoresistance of two superconducting
cuprate families at doping levels beyond $p*$. At all dopings, the
magnetoresistance exhibits quadrature scaling and becomes linear at high $H/T$
ratios. Moreover, its magnitude is found to be much larger than predicted by
conventional theory and insensitive to both impurity scattering and magnetic
field orientation. These observations, coupled with analysis of the zero-field

strange metal phase hosts two charge sectors, one containing coherent
quasiparticles, the other scale-invariant `Planckian' dissipators.

detailed face structures when applying to low resolution face images. Recent
deep learning based methods tailored for face images have achieved improved
performance by jointly trained with additional task such as face parsing and
landmark prediction. However, multi-task learning requires extra manually
labeled data. Besides, most of the existing works can only generate relatively
low resolution face images (e.g., $128\times128$), and their applications are
therefore limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel SPatial Attention
Residual Network (SPARNet) built on our newly proposed Face Attention Units
(FAUs) for face super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce a spatial
attention mechanism to the vanilla residual blocks. This enables the
convolutional layers to adaptively bootstrap features related to the key face
structures and pay less attention to those less feature-rich regions. This
makes the training more effective and efficient as the key face structures only
account for a very small portion of the face image. Visualization of the
attention maps shows that our spatial attention network can capture the key
face structures well even for very low resolution faces (e.g., $16\times16$).
Quantitative comparisons on various kinds of metrics (including PSNR, SSIM,
identity similarity, and landmark detection) demonstrate the superiority of our
method over current state-of-the-arts. We further extend SPARNet with
multi-scale discriminators, named as SPARNetHD, to produce high resolution
results (i.e., $512\times512$). We show that SPARNetHD trained with synthetic

synthetically degraded face images, but also show good generalization ability

computations in quantum mechanics have catalysed progress in physics. These
diagrams represent the underlying mathematical operations and aid physical
interpretation, but cannot generally be computed with directly. In this paper
we introduce the ZXH-calculus, a graphical language based on the ZX-calculus,
that we use to represent and reason about many-body states entirely
graphically. As a demonstration, we express the 1D AKLT state, a symmetry
protected topological state, in the ZXH-calculus by developing a representation
of spins higher than 1/2 within the calculus. By exploiting the simplifying
power of the ZXH-calculus rules we show how this representation
straightforwardly recovers the AKLT matrix-product state representation, the
existence of topologically protected edge states, and the non-vanishing of a
string order parameter. Extending beyond these known properties, our
diagrammatic approach also allows us to analytically derive that the Berry
phase of any finite-length 1D AKLT chain is $\pi$. In addition, we provide an
alternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced
to a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing
resource. Lastly, we build 2D higher-order topological phases diagrammatically,
which we use to illustrate a symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results
show that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and
computing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop
more efficient many-body algorithms and giving a novel diagrammatic perspective
on quantum phase transitions.

control anion occupation and in understanding the resultant implications for
electronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial strain induces preferential
occupation of F and O on the anion sites in perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-dFg
films grown on different substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to take
the apical-like sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized
x-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations,
resulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion. Under tensile strain, F tends to
take the equatorial-like sites, enabling the longer Mn-F bonds to lie within
the plane. The anion ordered oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant orbital
polarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to their valence
band density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F occupies the
apical-like anion site compared to the equatorial-like site. By demonstrating a
general strategy for inducing anion-site order in oxyfluoride perovskites, this
work lays the foundation for future materials design and synthesis efforts that

two-dimensional (2D) wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors presents new
opportunities for highly tunable and versatile qubits. So far, the study of
such spin emitters has focused on defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).
However, hBN necessarily contains a high density of nuclear spins, which are
expected to create a strong incoherent spin-bath that leads to poor coherence
properties of spins hosted in the material. Therefore, identification of new
qubit candidates in other 2DWBG materials is necessary. Given time demands of
$ab~initio$ methods, new approaches for rapid screening and calculation of
identifying properties of suitable atom-like qubits are required. In this work,
we present two new methods for rapid estimation of the zero-phonon line (ZPL),
a key property of atomic qubits in WBG materials. First, this ZPL is calculated
by exploiting Janak's theorem. For finite changes in occupation, we provide the
leading-order estimate of the correction to the ZPL obtained using Janak's
theorem, which is more rapid than the standard method ($\Delta$SCF). Next, we
also demonstrate an approach to converging excited states that is faster for
systems with small strain than the standard approach used in the $\Delta$SCF
method. We illustrate these methods using the case of the singly negatively
charged calcium vacancy in SiS$_2$, which we are the first to propose as a

high-throughput search for quantum defects in materials, with applications in

present a novel approach of using mirrors to enhance the illumination

the reflected LED beams on the walls to darker spots with the use of mirrors.
We formulate a joint optimization problem focusing on maximization of the SINR

propose a two-stage solution of the optimization problem with optimization of
illumination in the first stage and SINR at the second stage. We propose three
different heuristic solutions for the second stage and analyze the performance
of them, which demonstrates the advantages of each heuristic for different
possible scenarios. We also show that about threefold increase in average

the mirror placement is applied which is a significant performance improvement.

needed for phenomenology. Bridging the large energy separation between the
hadronic and perturbative regimes of QCD, however, is a notoriously difficult
task. In this contribution we focus on the case of the QCD coupling. We

future precision determinations. The new ideas exploit the decoupling of heavy
quarks to match $N_{\rm f}$-flavor QCD and the pure Yang-Mills theory. Through
this matching the computation of the non-perturbative running of the coupling
in QCD can be shifted to the computationally much easier to solve pure-gauge
theory. We shall present results for the determination of the
$\Lambda$-parameter of $N_{\rm f}=3$-flavor QCD where this strategy has been
applied and proven successful. The results demonstrate that these techniques

stage to reach flexible function for modeling. Weibull distribution has two
parameters which are shape $\alpha$ and scale $\beta$. In this study,
bimodality parameter is added and so bimodal Weibull distribution is proposed
by using a quadratic transformation technique used to generate bimodal
functions produced due to using the quadratic expression. The analytical
simplicity of Weibull and quadratic form give an advantage to derive a bimodal
Weibull via constructing normalizing constant. The characteristics and
properties of the proposed distribution are examined to show its usability in
modeling. After examination as first stage in modeling issue, it is appropriate
to use bimodal Weibull for modeling data sets. Two estimation methods which are
maximum $\log_q$ likelihood and its special form including objective functions
$\log_q(f)$ and $\log(f)$ are used to estimate the parameters of shape, scale
and bimodality parameters of the function. The second stage in modeling is
overcome by using heuristic algorithm for optimization of function according to
parameters due to fact that converging to global point of objective function is
performed by heuristic algorithm based on the stochastic optimization. Real
data sets are provided to show the modeling competence of the proposed
distribution.

multiple tissue parameters such as T1 and T2 relaxation times. The working
principle of MRF relies on varying acquisition parameters pseudo-randomly, so
that each tissue generates its unique signal evolution during scanning. Even
though MRF provides faster scanning, it has disadvantages such as erroneous and
slow generation of the corresponding parametric maps, which needs to be
improved. Moreover, there is a need for explainable architectures for
understanding the guiding signals to generate accurate parametric maps. In this
paper, we addressed both of these shortcomings by proposing a novel neural

M_\odot$ are fully convective. Aims: The goal is to study convection,
differential rotation, and dynamos as functions of rotation in fully convective
stars. Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic
numerical simulations with a star-in-a-box model, where a spherical star is
immersed inside of a Cartesian cube, are used. The model corresponds to a
$0.2M_\odot$ M5 dwarf. Rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$) between 4.3 and 430
days are explored. Results: The slowly rotating model with $P_{\rm rot}=430$
days produces anti-solar differential rotation with a slow equator and fast
poles, along with predominantly axisymmetric quasi-steady large-scale magnetic
fields. For intermediate rotation ($P_{\rm rot}=144$ and $43$ days)
differential rotation is solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) and large-scale
magnetic fields are mostly axisymmetric and either quasi-stationary or cyclic.
The latter occurs in a similar parameter regime as in other numerical studies
in spherical shells, and the cycle period is similar to observed cycles in
fully convective stars with comparable $P_{\rm rot}$. In the rapid rotation
regime the differential rotation is weak and the large-scale magnetic fields
are increasingly non-axisymmetric with a dominating $m=1$ mode. This
large-scale non-axisymmetric field also exhibits azimuthal dynamo waves.
Conclusions: The results of the star-in-a-box models agree with simulations of
partially convective late-type stars in spherical shells in that the
transitions in differential rotation and dynamo regimes occur at similar
rotational regimes in terms of the Coriolis (inverse Rossby) number. This
similarity between partially and fully convective stars suggests that the

ACR of the target class, for models trained on generated poison data, can be
reduced by more than 30\%. Moreover, the poisoned data is transferable to

handover (i.e., user association assignment) and massive MIMO antenna tilting
are configured as the RL policy to learn. Our rationale behind using RL is to
circumvent the challenges of analytically modeling user mobility and network
dynamics. To accomplish this joint optimization, we integrate vector rewards
into the RL value network and conduct RL action via a separate policy network.
We name this method as Pareto deterministic policy gradients (PDPG). It is an
actor-critic, model-free and deterministic policy algorithm which can handle
the coupling objectives with the following two merits: 1) It solves the
optimization via leveraging the degree of freedom of vector reward as opposed
to choosing handcrafted scalar-reward; 2) Cross-validation over multiple
policies can be significantly reduced. Accordingly, the RL enabled network
behaves in a self-organized way: It learns out the underlying user mobility
through measurement history to proactively operate handover and antenna tilt
without environment assumptions. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates that the
introduced RL method outperforms scalar-reward based approaches. Meanwhile, to
be self-contained, an ideal static optimization based brute-force search solver
is included as a benchmark. The comparison shows that the RL approach performs
as well as this ideal strategy, though the former one is constrained with
limited environment observations and lower action frequency, whereas the latter
ones have full access to the user mobility. The convergence of our introduced
approach is also tested under different user mobility environment based on our

the same sample. Here, we overcome this hindrance by utilizing the enhanced
light--matter coupling in an optical cavity to perform a minimally invasive
continuous measurement and track the time evolution of the atom number in a
quasi two-dimensional atomic gas during evaporation from a tilted trapping
potential. We demonstrate sufficient measurement precision to detect atom
number fluctuations well below the level set by Poissonian statistics.
Furthermore, we characterize the non-linearity of the evaporation process and
the inherent fluctuations of the transport of atoms out of the trapping volume
through two-time correlations of the atom number. Our results establish coupled

Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger event on the Galactic disk. For the first
time, we find a group of low-alpha MRSK stars, and classify it as a metal-rich
tail of the GSE galaxy based on the chemical and kinematical properties. This
group has slightly larger Rapo, Zmax and Etot distributions than a
previously-reported high-alpha group. Its low-alpha ratio does not allow for an
origin resulting from the splash process of the GSE merger event, as is
proposed to explain the high-alpha group. A hydrodynamical simulation by
Amarante et al. provides a promising solution, in which the GSE galaxy is a
clumpy Milky-Way analogue that develops a bimodal disk chemistry. This scenario
explains the existence of MRSK stars with both high-alpha and low-alpha ratios
found in this work. It is further supported by another new feature that a clump
of MRSK stars is located at Zmax=3-5 kpc, which corresponds to the widely
adopted disk-halo transition at |Z|~4 kpc. We suggest that a pile-up of MRSK
stars at Zmax contributes significantly to this disk-halo transition, an
interesting imprint left by the GSE merger event. These results also provide an
important implication on the connection between the GSE and the Virgo Radial
Merger.

continuously changing, and words shift their meanings for various reasons.
Semantic divergence in related languages is a key concern of historical
linguistics. In this paper we investigate semantic divergence across languages
by measuring the semantic similarity of cognate sets in multiple languages. The
method that we propose is based on cross-lingual word embeddings. In this paper
we implement and evaluate our method on English and five Romance languages, but
it can be extended easily to any language pair, requiring only large
monolingual corpora for the involved languages and a small bilingual dictionary
for the pair. This language-agnostic method facilitates a quantitative analysis
of cognates divergence -- by computing degrees of semantic similarity between
cognate pairs -- and provides insights for identifying false friends. As a
second contribution, we formulate a straightforward method for detecting false
friends, and introduce the notion of ""soft false friend"" and ""hard false
friend"", as well as a measure of the degree of ""falseness"" of a false friends
pair. Additionally, we propose an algorithm that can output suggestions for
correcting false friends, which could result in a very helpful tool for

investigated the temporal behavior of the comet on both seasonal and rotational
timescales. CN observations were used to explore the coma morphology, revealing
that there are two primary active areas that produce spiral structures. The
direction of rotation of these structures changes from pre- to post-perihelion,
indicating that the Earth crossed the comet's equatorial plane sometime around
perihelion. We also used the CN images to create photometric lightcurves that
consistently show two peaks in the activity, confirming the two source regions.
We measured the nucleus' apparent rotation period at a number of epochs using
both the morphology and the lightcurves. These results all show that the
rotation period is continuously changing throughout our observation window,
increasing from 8.98~hr in early November to 9.14~hr around perihelion and then
decreasing again to 8.94~hr in February. Although the geometry changes rapidly
around perihelion, the period changes cannot primarily be due to synodic
effects. The repetition of structures in the coma, both within a night and from
night-to-night, strongly suggests the nucleus is in a near-simple rotation
state. We also detected two outbursts, one on December~12 and the other on

for swing phase is proposed in such a way that the cycloid variables depend on
the staircase dimensions. Zero Moment Point(ZMP) criteria is taken for
satisfying stability constraint. This paper mainly can be divided into 3 steps:
1) Planning stable cycloid trajectory for initial step and subsequent step for
climbing upstairs and Inverse Kinematics using an unsupervised artificial
neural network with knot shifting procedure for jerk minimization. 2) Modeling
Dynamics for Toe foot biped model using Lagrange Dynamics along with contact
modeling using spring-damper system followed by developing Neural Network
Temporal Quantized Lagrange Dynamics which takes inverse kinematics output from
neural network as its inputs. 3) Using Ant Colony Optimization to tune PD

all controllers. Our solution approach works for arbitrary number of
controllers and generalizes to the setup when the mean-field is observed with

generalize to the infinite-horizon control setups as well. In addition, when
the mean-field is observed without noise, the size of the corresponding
information state increases polynomially (rather than exponentially) with the
number of controllers which allows us to solve problems with moderate number of
controllers. We illustrate our approach by an example motivated by smart grids

reliable and effective when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) based

outstanding performance in the image processing field. The potential of these
convolutional neural network (CNN) models can be used to efficiently detect the
complex DoS and DDoS by converting the network traffic dataset into images.
Therefore, in this work, we proposed a methodology to convert the network

ResNet over the converted data. The proposed methodology accomplished 99.99\%
accuracy for detecting the DoS and DDoS in case of binary classification.

degrade the grid performance because the reported readings are used for energy
management. This paper is the first work that investigates this problem in the
net-metering system, in which one SM is used to report the difference between
the power consumed and the power generated. First, we prepare a benign dataset
for the net-metering system by processing a real power consumption and
generation dataset. Then, we propose a new set of attacks tailored for the
net-metering system to create malicious dataset. After that, we analyze the
data and we found time correlations between the net meter readings and
correlations between the readings and relevant data obtained from trustworthy
sources such as the solar irradiance and temperature. Based on the data
analysis, we propose a general multi-data-source deep hybrid learning-based
detector to identify the false-reading attacks. Our detector is trained on net
meter readings of all customers besides data from the trustworthy sources to
enhance the detector performance by learning the correlations between them. The
rationale here is that although an attacker can report false readings, he
cannot manipulate the solar irradiance and temperature values because they are
beyond his control. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results
indicate that our detector can identify the false-reading attacks with high
detection rate and low false alarm.

drawn a great amount of attention in recent years. FL shows an inherent
advantage in privacy preservation, since users' raw data are processed locally.
However, it relies on a centralized server to perform model aggregation.
Therefore, FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions and external attacks. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework by integrating blockchain into FL,
namely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL), to
enhance the security of FL. The proposed BLADE-FL has a good performance in
terms of privacy preservation, tamper resistance, and effective cooperation of
learning. However, it gives rise to a new problem of training deficiency,
caused by lazy clients who plagiarize others' trained models and add artificial
noises to conceal their cheating behaviors. To be specific, we first develop a
convergence bound of the loss function with the presence of lazy clients and
prove that it is convex with respect to the total number of generated blocks
$K$. Then, we solve the convex problem by optimizing $K$ to minimize the loss
function. Furthermore, we discover the relationship between the optimal $K$,
the number of lazy clients, and the power of artificial noises used by lazy
clients. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the
proposed framework using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our analytical
results are shown to be consistent with the experimental results. In addition,
the derived optimal $K$ achieves the minimum value of loss function, and in
turn the optimal accuracy performance.

optimal control law is unique, linear, and identical across all subsystems.
Moreover, the optimal gains are computed by solving two decoupled Riccati

our proposed shape function provides the wormhole solutions with less (or may
be negligible) amount of exotic matter corresponding to the appropriate choice
of $f(R)$ gravity models and suitable values of free parameters. Interestingly,
the solutions obtained for this shape function generate stable static
spherically symmetric wormhole structure in the context of non-existence

that the sub-threshold swing of a topological transistor, in which conduction

of an electric field across the thickness results in the bending of the strip.
Conversely, a voltage can be detected between the two electrodes when the strip

follows the trend of a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watt (KWW) function, which is well

  New method: Here we describe the details of implementing Monte Carlo
simulations in three-dimensional (3d) voxelized segmentations of cells in

the computational load of simulating diffusion within and exchange between
multiple cells. Precision is further achieved by GPU-based parallel

  Results: Our simulation of diffusion in white matter axons segmented from a
mouse brain demonstrates its value in validating biophysical models.
Furthermore, we provide the theoretical background for implementing a
discretized diffusion process, and consider the finite-step effects of the
particle-membrane reflection and permeation events, needed for efficient

the focusing performance is significantly degraded due to the meta-atoms'

bandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance,
point-dipole models are used which incorporate different aspect's of the
meta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms
being designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar
resonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become
stronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and
amplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident
angles. The modelling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the

the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM; http://www.tropmet.res.in),
Pune, launched in 2009 with the support of the Ministry of Earth Sciences
(MoES), Government of India, focuses on the development of new climate
modelling capabilities in India and South Asia to address issues concerning the
science of climate change. CCCR-IITM has the mandate of developing an Earth
System Model and to make the regional climate projections. An important
achievement was made by developing an Earth System Model at IITM, which is an
important step towards understanding global and regional climate response to
long-term climate variability and climate change. CCCR-IITM has also generated
an ensemble of high resolution dynamically downscaled future projections of
regional climate over South Asia and Indian monsoon, which are found useful for
impact assessment studies and for quantifying uncertainties in the regional
projections. A brief overview of these core climate change modeling activities
of CCCR-IITM was presented in an Interim Report on Climate Change over India

  Engineers, In press",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a wireless network, gathering information at the base station about mobile
users based only on uplink channel measurements is an interesting challenge.
Indeed, accessing the users locations and predicting their downlink channels
would be particularly useful in order to optimize the network efficiency. In
this paper, a supervised machine learning approach addressing these tasks in an
unified way is proposed. It relies on a labeled database that can be acquired
in a simple way by the base station while operating. The proposed regression
method can be seen as a computationally efficient two layers neural network
initialized with a non-parametric estimator. It is illustrated on realistic
channel data, both for the positioning and channel mapping tasks, achieving
better results than previously proposed approaches, at a lower cost.
