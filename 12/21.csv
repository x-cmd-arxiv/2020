implementable quantum operations. On the other hand, general linear maps, such
as positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically
implemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in
theoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well
one can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by
physically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic
framework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition
technique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of
physically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability
measure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must
pertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using
physically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is
efficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of
this measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We
derive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and
obtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests.
Furthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the
quantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the
sampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In
particular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation
has no advantage over local error mitigation.

a significant disease that causes blindness and vision loss among millions of
people worldwide. It transpires as a result of accumulation of watery fluids
behind the retina. Therefore, detection of CSR at early stages allows
preventive measures to avert any impairment to the human eye. Traditionally,
several manual methods for detecting CSR have been developed in the past;
however, they have shown to be imprecise and unreliable. Consequently,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) services in the medical field, including automated
CSR detection, are now possible to detect and cure this disease. This review
assessed a variety of innovative technologies and researches that contribute to
the automatic detection of CSR. In this review, various CSR disease detection
techniques, broadly classified into two categories: a) CSR detection based on
classical imaging technologies, and b) CSR detection based on Machine/Deep
Learning methods, have been reviewed after an elaborated evaluation of 29
different relevant articles. Additionally, it also goes over the advantages,
drawbacks and limitations of a variety of traditional imaging techniques, such
as Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), Fundus Imaging and more
recent approaches that utilize Artificial Intelligence techniques. Finally, it
is concluded that the most recent Deep Learning (DL) classifiers deliver
accurate, fast, and reliable CSR detection. However, more research needs to be
conducted on publicly available datasets to improve computation complexity for
the reliable detection and diagnosis of CSR disease.

Eichelberger [IBM J. Res. Develop., 9 (1965)] showing this property for special

result Ikenmeyer et al. [J. ACM, 66:4 (2019)]: not only the complexities of
hazard-free and monotone circuits for monotone Boolean functions do coincide,
but every optimal hazard-free circuit for a monotone Boolean function must be
monotone. Then we show that hazard-free circuit complexity of a very simple
(non-monotone) Boolean function is super-polynomially larger than its
unrestricted circuit complexity. This function accepts a Boolean n x n matrix
iff every row and every column has exactly one 1-entry. Finally, we show that

completely answer the question wether the ground state energy, which is a
threshold between global existence and formation of singularities, is achieved.
For any prescribed mass, for mass-supercritical or mass-critical defocusing
perturbations, the ground state energy is achieved by a radially symmetric and
decreasing solution to the associated stationary equation. For mass-subcritical
perturbations, we show the existence of a critical prescribed mass, precisely
the mass of the unique, static, positive solution to the associated elliptic
equation, such that the ground state energy is achieved for any mass equal or
smaller than the critical one. Moreover, the ground state energy is not
achieved for mass larger than the critical one. As a byproduct of the
variational characterization of the ground state energy, we prove the existence
of blowing-up solutions in finite time, for any energy below the ground state

interpolation based method, in which we consider the base gestures as the key

information on social contacts in human communities. With the present study, we
report the quantitative assessment of contact patterns in a village in rural
Malawi, based on proximity sensors technology that allows for high-resolution
measurements of social contacts. The system provided information on community
structure of the village, on social relationships and social assortment between
individuals, and on daily contacts activity within the village. Our findings
revealed that the social network presented communities that were highly
correlated with household membership, thus confirming the importance of family
ties within the village. Contacts within households occur mainly between adults
and children, and adults and adolescents. This result suggests that the
principal role of adults within the family is the care for the youngest. Most
of the inter-household interactions occurred among caregivers and among
adolescents. We studied the tendency of participants to interact with
individuals with whom they shared similar attributes (i.e., assortativity). Age
and gender assortativity were observed in inter-household network, showing that
individuals not belonging to the same family group prefer to interact with
people with whom they share similar age and gender. Age disassortativity is
observed in intra-household networks. Family members congregate in the early
morning, during lunch time and dinner time. In contrast, individuals not
belonging to the same household displayed a growing contact activity from the
morning, reaching a maximum in the afternoon. The data collection
infrastructure used in this study seems to be very effective to capture the
dynamics of contacts by collecting high resolution temporal data and to give
access to the level of information needed to understand the social context of
the village.

Neumann (N) boundary conditions (BC) for a scatterer that is a circular
cylinder submitted to one or two incident waves. The three BIE methods lead to
different expressions for the traction (for D-BC) or boundary displacement (for

that can naturally handle pose-related uncertainties and ambiguities arising in
almost all real life applications concerning 3D data. While existing works
strive to find a single solution to the pose estimation problem, we make peace
with the ambiguities causing high uncertainty around which solutions to
identify as the best. Instead, we report a family of poses which capture the
nature of the solution space. DBN extends the state of the art direct pose
regression networks by (i) a multi-hypotheses prediction head which can yield
different distribution modes; and (ii) novel loss functions that benefit from
Bingham distributions on rotations. This way, DBN can work both in unambiguous
cases providing uncertainty information, and in ambiguous scenes where an
uncertainty per mode is desired. On a technical front, our network regresses
continuous Bingham mixture models and is applicable to both 2D data such as
images and to 3D data such as point clouds. We proposed new training strategies
so as to avoid mode or posterior collapse during training and to improve
numerical stability. Our methods are thoroughly tested on two different
applications exploiting two different modalities: (i) 6D camera relocalization
from images; and (ii) object pose estimation from 3D point clouds,
demonstrating decent advantages over the state of the art. For the former we
contributed our own dataset composed of five indoor scenes where it is
unavoidable to capture images corresponding to views that are hard to uniquely
identify. For the latter we achieve the top results especially for symmetric

been touted as among the most promising solutions to fake news, especially in

Markov-inspired computational method for identifying topics in tweets. In
contrast to other topic modeling approaches, our method clusters topics and
their current evolution in a predefined time window. Through these, we
collected data from Twitter accounts of two Brazilian fact-checking outlets and
presented the topics debunked by these initiatives in fortnights throughout the
pandemic. By comparing these organizations, we could identify similarities and
differences in what was shared by them. Our method resulted in an important
technique to cluster topics in a wide range of scenarios, including an
infodemic -- a period overabundance of the same information. In particular, the
data clearly revealed a complex intertwining between politics and the health

it possible to extract migration networks over time. Despite the recent
advances, existing spatial and temporal abstraction techniques for time-variant
flow data have limitations due to the lack of knowledge on the effect of
temporal partitioning on flow patterns. In this study, we extracted
state-to-state migration patterns over a period of 150 years between 1776 and
1926 from a cleaned, geocoded and connected family trees from Rootsweb.com. We
used birthplaces and birthyears of parents and children to extract
intergenerational migration flows between states. To reveal the temporal trends
of migration patterns, we evaluated three temporal partitioning strategies: (1)
predefined periods in American history, (2) overlapping time periods with fixed
length, and (3) time periods with variable length, which have approximately
equal volume of moves per time period. To account for the effect of geographic
proximity and flow volumes in migration flows, we transformed the raw flows
into modularity flows using a double-constrained a gravity model. Our
preliminary results revealed longitudinal population mobility in the U.S. on
such a large spatial and temporal scale.

times: one for a static version of the random graph, the other for a class of
dynamic versions of the random graph in which the edges are randomly rewired
but the degrees are preserved. The link is provided by the probability that the
random walk has not yet stepped along a previously rewired edge. We use this
link to compute the scaling of the mixing time for three specific classes of

to the current location of the random walk, the mixing time may exhibit no

Second, explicit, symbolic knowledge encoded in knowledge bases. Our approach
combines both - exploiting the powerful implicit reasoning of transformer

classes in arbitrary Coxeter groups in terms of cyclic shifts.
  Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. A cyclic shift of an element $w\in W$ is a
conjugate of $w$ of the form $sws$ for some simple reflection $s\in S$ such
that $\ell_S(sws)\leq\ell_S(w)$. The cyclic shift class of $w$ is then the set
of elements of $W$ that can be obtained from $w$ by a sequence of cyclic
shifts. Given a subset $K\subseteq S$ such that $W_K:=\langle K\rangle\subseteq
W$ is finite, we also call two elements $w,w'\in W$ $K$-conjugate if $w,w'$
normalise $W_K$ and $w'=w_0(K)ww_0(K)$, where $w_0(K)$ is the longest element
of $W_K$.
  Let $\mathcal O$ be a conjugacy class in $W$, and let $\mathcal O^{\min}$ be
the set of elements of minimal length in $\mathcal O$. Then $\mathcal O^{\min}$
is the disjoint union of finitely many cyclic shift classes $C_1,\dots,C_k$. We
define the structural conjugation graph associated to $\mathcal O$ to be the
graph with vertices $C_1,\dots,C_k$, and with an edge between distinct vertices
$C_i,C_j$ if they contain representatives $u\in C_i$ and $v\in C_j$ such that
$u,v$ are $K$-conjugate for some $K\subseteq S$.
  In this paper, we compute explicitely the structural conjugation graph
associated to any conjugacy class in $W$, and show in particular that it is
connected (that is, any two conjugate elements of $W$ differ only by a sequence
of cyclic shifts and $K$-conjugations). Along the way, we obtain several
results of independent interest, such as a description of the centraliser of an
infinite order element $w\in W$, as well as the existence of natural
decompositions of $w$ as a product of a ""torsion part"" and of a ""straight

pure mean regression towards distributional regression models. One important
strand thereof is that of conditional transformation models (CTMs). CTMs infer
the entire conditional distribution directly by applying a transformation
function to the response conditionally on a set of covariates towards a simple
log-concave reference distribution. Thereby, CTMs allow not only variance,
kurtosis or skewness but the complete conditional distribution to depend on the
explanatory variables. We propose a Bayesian notion of conditional
transformation models (BCTMs) focusing on exactly observed continuous
responses, but also incorporating extensions to randomly censored and discrete
responses. Rather than relying on Bernstein polynomials that have been
considered in likelihood-based CTMs, we implement a spline-based
parametrization for monotonic effects that are supplemented with smoothness
priors. Furthermore, we are able to benefit from the Bayesian paradigm via
easily obtainable credible intervals and other quantities without relying on
large sample approximations. A simulation study demonstrates the
competitiveness of our approach against its likelihood-based counterpart but
also Bayesian additive models of location, scale and shape and Bayesian
quantile regression. Two applications illustrate the versatility of BCTMs in
problems involving real world data, again including the comparison with various
types of competitors.

vehicle routing problems (VRP), for which exact solution methods are

successfully applied to the capacitated VRP (CVRP). The CVRP aims at defining
the minimum-cost delivery routes for a given set of identical vehicles since
each vehicle only travels one route and there is a single (central) depot. The
best metaheuristics to the CVRP avoid getting stuck in local optima by
embedding specific hill-climbing mechanisms such as diversification strategies
into the solution methods. This paper introduces a hybridization of a novel
adaptive version of Iterated Local Search with Path-Relinking (AILS-PR) to the
CVRP. The major contribution of this paper is an automatic mechanism to control
the diversity step of the metaheuristic to allow it to escape from local
optima. The results of experiments with 100 benchmark CVPR instances show that
AILS-PR outperformed the state-of-the-art CVRP metaheuristics.

construction of lightweight building elements, such as thin concrete shell

tolerances on deviations of the tensioned cable net geometry from the desired
target form are very tight. Therefore, the form needs to be readjusted on the
construction site. In order to employ model-based optimization techniques, the
precise identification of important uncertain model parameters of the cable net
system is required. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian process regression
to learn the function that maps the cable net geometry to the uncertain

only a single form measurement for the identification of the cable net model
parameters. This is beneficial since measurements of the cable net form on the
construction site are very expensive. For the training of the Gaussian
processes, simulated data is efficiently computed via convex programming. The
effectiveness of the proposed method and the impact of the precise

defined and proven to enable closed-form estimation of the parameters of
heavy-tailed distributions. Given independent, identically distributed samples
from a one-dimensional distribution, IAs are formed by partitioning samples
into pairs, triplets, or nth-order groupings and retaining the median of those
groupings that are approximately equal. The pdf of the IAs is proven to be the
normalized n^th power of the original density. From this property, heavy-tailed
distributions are proven to have well-defined means for their IA pairs, finite
second moments for their IA triplets, and a finite, well-defined (n-1)^th
moment for the nth grouping. Estimation of the location, scale, and shape
(inverse of degree of freedom) of the generalized Pareto and Student's t
distributions are possible via a system of three equations. Performance
analysis of the IA estimation methodology for the Student's t distribution
demonstrates that the method converges to the maximum likelihood estimate.
Closed-form estimates of the location and scale are determined from the mean of
the IA pairs and the second moment of the IA triplets, respectively. For the
Student's t distribution, the geometric mean of the original samples provides a
third equation to determine the shape, though its nonlinear solution requires
an iterative solver. With 10,000 samples the relative bias of the parameter
estimates is less than 0.01 and the relative precision is less than +/- 0.1.
Statistical physics applications are carried out for both a small sample (331)
astrophysics dataset and a large sample (2 x 10^8) standard map simulation.

is computed, singling out one line bundle whose associated condensation scale
is low enough to be compatible with the energy scales available at the LHC. The
corresponding region of K\""ahler moduli space where all bundle constraints are
satisfied is presented. The generic form of the moduli dependent $F$-terms due
to a gaugino superpotential - which spontaneously break $N=1$ supersymmetry in

associated with the low condensation scale. The moduli dependent coefficients
for each of the gaugino and scalar field soft supersymmetry breaking terms are
computed leading to a low-energy effective Lagrangian for the observable sector

conditions for the renormalization group equations which, at low energy, lead
to completely realistic physics satisfying all phenomenological constraints.

excellent agreement with the direct measured major loop, as well as the phase

on multispecies ecosystems points that interspecies interactions modify the

spatial scale of population synchrony generally increases as the fluctuations
propagates through the food web, i.e., the species more directly affected by
environmental fluctuations presents the smaller spatial scale of population
synchrony. Here, we found that this behaviour is generally true for a two

where the population fluctuations of one of the species does not damp by its

identify models easily and quickly optimize motions. Geometric mechanics
provides means for reduction of the dynamics by environmental homogeneity,
while the dissipative nature minimizes the role of second order (inertial)
features in the dynamics. Here we extend the tools of geometric system
identification to ``Shape-Underactuated Dissipative Systems (SUDS)'' -- systems
whose motions are more dissipative than inertial, but whose actuation is
restricted to a subset of the body shape coordinates.
  Many animal motions are SUDS, including micro-swimmers such as nematodes and
flagellated bacteria, and granular locomotors such as snakes and lizards. Many
soft robots are also SUDS, particularly those robots using highly damped series
elastic actuators. Whether involved in locomotion or manipulation, these robots
are often used to interface less rigidly with the environment.
  We motivate the use of SUDS models, and validate their ability to predict
motion of a variety of simulated viscous swimming platforms. For a large class
of SUDS, we show how the shape velocity actuation inputs can be directly
converted into torque inputs suggesting that systems with soft pneumatic
actuators or dielectric elastomers can be modeled with the tools presented.
Based on fundamental assumptions in the physics, we show how our model
complexity scales linearly with the number of passive shape coordinates. This
offers a large reduction on the number of trials needed to identify the system
model from experimental data, and may reduce overfitting. The sample efficiency
of our method suggests its use in modeling, control, and optimization in
robotics, and as a tool for the study of organismal motion in friction
dominated regimes.

with positive externalities like vaccines and bed nets. These different
application areas may lead to different concerns around fairness, welfare, and

of personalized pricing for the provision of goods with positive benefits, we
discuss how price optimization may provide unambiguous benefit by achieving a

intensive for mobile devices. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
attempt to take FL into the design of future wireless networks and develop a
novel joint design of wireless transmission and weight quantization for energy
efficient FL over mobile devices. Specifically, we develop flexible weight
quantization schemes to facilitate on-device local training over heterogeneous
mobile devices. Based on the observation that the energy consumption of local
computing is comparable to that of model updates, we formulate the energy
efficient FL problem into a mixed-integer programming problem where the
quantization and spectrum resource allocation strategies are jointly determined
for heterogeneous mobile devices to minimize the overall FL energy consumption
(computation + transmissions) while guaranteeing model performance and training
latency. Since the optimization variables of the problem are strongly coupled,
an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed, where the bandwidth allocation
and weight quantization levels are derived. Extensive simulations are conducted
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Proportional Feedback control suggests a proportional reduction of the state
variable at every $k$th step. First, if $k \neq 1$, a cycle is stabilized
rather than an equilibrium. Second, the equation can incorporate an additive
noise term, describing the variability of the environment, as well as
multiplicative noise corresponding to possible deviations in the control
intensity. The present paper deals with both issues, it justifies a possibility
of getting a stable blurred $k$-cycle. Presented examples include the Ricker

either multiplicative or additive noise only, numerical simulations illustrate
that a blurred cycle can be stabilized when both multiplicative and additive

at suggesting a series of system measurements to isolate the true explanation
for the system's misbehavior from a potentially exponential set of possible
explanations. To reason about the best next measurement, SD methods usually
require a sample of possible fault explanations at each step of the iterative
diagnostic process. The computation of this sample can be accomplished by
various diagnostic search algorithms. Among those, Reiter's HS-Tree is one of
the most popular due its desirable properties and general applicability.
Usually, HS-Tree is used in a stateless fashion throughout the SD process to
(re)compute a sample of possible fault explanations in each iteration, each
time given the latest (updated) system knowledge including all so-far collected
measurements. At this, the built search tree is discarded between two
iterations, although often large parts of the tree have to be rebuilt in the
next iteration, involving redundant operations and calls to costly reasoning
services.
  As a remedy to this, we propose DynamicHS, a variant of HS-Tree that
maintains state throughout the diagnostic session and additionally embraces
special strategies to minimize the number of expensive reasoner invocations. In
this vein, DynamicHS provides an answer to a longstanding question posed by
Raymond Reiter in his seminal paper from 1987.
  Extensive evaluations on real-world diagnosis problems prove the
reasonability of the DynamicHS and testify its clear superiority to HS-Tree
wrt. computation time. More specifically, DynamicHS outperformed HS-Tree in 96%
of the executed sequential diagnosis sessions and, per run, the latter required
up to 800% the time of the former. Remarkably, DynamicHS achieves these
performance improvements while preserving all desirable properties as well as

OGLE-2017-BLG-1049, which is a planet-host star mass ratio of
$q=9.53\pm0.39\times10^{-3}$ and has a caustic crossing feature in the Korea
Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) observations. The caustic crossing
feature yields an angular Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E}=0.52 \pm 0.11\
{\rm mas}$. However, the microlens parallax is not measured because of the time
scale of the event $t_{\rm E}\simeq 29\ {\rm days}$, which is not long enough
in this case to determine the microlens parallax. Thus, we perform a Bayesian
analysis to estimate physical quantities of the lens system. From this, we find
that the lens system has a star with mass $M_{\rm h}=0.55^{+0.36}_{-0.29} \
M_{\odot}$ hosting a giant planet with $M_{\rm p}=5.53^{+3.62}_{-2.87} \ M_{\rm
Jup}$, at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=5.67^{+1.11}_{-1.52}\ {\rm kpc}$. The
projected star-planet separation in units of the Einstein radius $(\theta_{\rm
E})$ corresponding to the total mass of the lens system is
$a_{\perp}=3.92^{+1.10}_{-1.32}\ \rm{au}$. This means that the planet is
located beyond the snow line of the host. The relative lens-source proper
motion is $\mu_{\rm rel}\sim 7 \ \rm{mas \ yr^{-1}}$, thus the lens and source
will be separated from each other within 10 years. Then the flux of the host
star can be measured by a 30m class telescope with high-resolution imaging in
the future, and thus its mass can be determined.

data mining and massive data processing systems. The past few years have
witnessed the popularity of the graph-based nearest neighbor search paradigm
because of its superiority over the space-partitioning algorithms. While a lot
of empirical studies demonstrate the efficiency of graph-based algorithms, not
much attention has been paid to a more fundamental question: why graph-based
algorithms work so well in practice? And which data property affects the
efficiency and how? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. Our
insight is that ""the probability that the neighbors of a point o tends to be
neighbors in the KNN graph"" is a crucial data property for query efficiency.
For a given dataset, such a property can be qualitatively measured by
clustering coefficient of the KNN graph. To show how clustering coefficient
affects the performance, we identify that, instead of the global connectivity,
the local connectivity around some given query q has more direct impact on
recall. Specifically, we observed that high clustering coefficient makes most
of the k nearest neighbors of q sit in a maximum strongly connected component
(SCC) in the graph. From the algorithmic point of view, we show that the search
procedure is actually composed of two phases - the one outside the maximum SCC
and the other one in it, which is different from the widely accepted single or
multiple paths search models. We proved that the commonly used graph-based
search algorithm is guaranteed to traverse the maximum SCC once visiting any
point in it. Our analysis reveals that high clustering coefficient leads to
large size of the maximum SCC, and thus provides good answer quality with the
help of the two-phase search procedure. Extensive empirical results over a
comprehensive collection of datasets validate our findings.

in extended halos of elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. Local thermal
instability in the hot gas leads to the formation of precipitating cold gas
clouds that feed the central supermassive black holes, thus heating the hot gas
and maintaining global thermal equilibrium. We perform three dimensional MHD
simulations of self-regulated AGN feedback in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster
with the aim of understanding the impact of the feedback physics on the
turbulence properties of the hot and cold phases of the ICM. We find that, in
general, the cold phase velocity structure function (VSF) is steeper than the
prediction from Kolmogorov's theory. We attribute the physical origin of the
steeper slope of the cold phase VSF to the driving of turbulent motions
primarily by the gravitational acceleration acting on the ballistic clouds. We
demonstrate that, in the pure hydrodynamical case, the precipitating cold
filaments may be the dominant agent driving turbulence in the hot ICM. The
arguments in favor of this hypothesis are that: (i) the cold phase mass
dominates over hot gas mass in the inner cool core; (ii) hot and cold gas
velocities are spatially correlated; (iii) both the cold and hot phase velocity
distributions are radially biased. We show that, in the MHD case, the
turbulence in the ambient hot medium (excluding the jet cone regions) can also
be driven by the AGN jets. The driving is then facilitated by enhanced coupling
due to magnetic fields of the ambient gas and the AGN jets. In the MHD case,
turbulence may thus be driven by a combination of AGN jet stirring and filament
motions. We conclude that future observations, including those from high
spatial and spectral resolution X-ray missions, may help to constrain
self-regulated AGN feedback by quantifying the multi-temperature VSF in the
ICM.

problem in quantum parameter estimation theory due to its wide range of

However, more often than not, the current state-of-the-art methods to estimate
quantum phases fail to reach this bound as they rely on maximum likelihood
estimators of non-identifiable likelihood functions. In this work we thoroughly
review various schemes for estimating the phase of a qubit, identifying the

Cram\'er-Rao bound, and propose a new adaptive scheme based on covariant
measurements to circumvent this problem. Our findings are carefully checked by

to safeguard the privacy of the patients' medical imaging data. In this paper,
a novel deep learning-based key generation network (DeepKeyGen) is proposed as
a stream cipher generator to generate the private key, which can then be used
for encrypting and decrypting of medical images. In DeepKeyGen, the generative
adversarial network (GAN) is adopted as the learning network to generate the
private key. Furthermore, the transformation domain (that represents the
""style"" of the private key to be generated) is designed to guide the learning
network to realize the private key generation process. The goal of DeepKeyGen
is to learn the mapping relationship of how to transfer the initial image to
the private key. We evaluate DeepKeyGen using three datasets, namely: the
Montgomery County chest X-ray dataset, the Ultrasonic Brachial Plexus dataset,
and the BraTS18 dataset. The evaluation findings and security analysis show
that the proposed key generation network can achieve a high-level security in
generating the private key.

  2021",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a novel dimensionality reduction method for maximum inner product
search (MIPS), named CEOs, based on the theory of concomitants of extreme order
statistics. Utilizing the asymptotic behavior of these concomitants, we show
that a few dimensions associated with the extreme values of the query signature
are enough to estimate inner products. Since CEOs only uses the sign of a small
subset of the query signature for estimation, we can precompute all inner
product estimators accurately before querying. These properties yield a
sublinear MIPS algorithm with an exponential indexing space complexity. We show
that our exponential space is optimal for the $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate MIPS
on a unit sphere. The search recall of CEOs can be theoretically guaranteed
under a mild condition.
  To deal with the exponential space complexity, we propose two practical
variants, including sCEOs-TA and coCEOs, that use linear space for solving
MIPS. sCEOs-TA exploits the threshold algorithm (TA) and provides superior
search recalls to competitive MIPS solvers. coCEOs is a data and dimension
co-reduction technique and outperforms sCEOs-TA on high recall requirements.
Empirically, they are very simple to implement and achieve at least 100x
speedup compared to the bruteforce search while returning top-10 MIPS with
accuracy at least 90% on many large-scale data sets.

performs simultaneous inference on a set of parameters from two directions, one
to test whether the assumed zero parameters indeed are zeros and one to test
whether exist zeros in the parameter set of nonzeros. As a result, we can
exactly identify whether the parameters are zeros, thereby keeping the data

proposed TOSI method asymptotically controls the Type I error at the
prespecified significance level and that the testing power converges to one.
Simulations are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method in

that the TOSI method is more predictive and has more interpretable estimators

which can effectively improve the generalization ability of neural networks in
image recognition tasks. Recent data mixing based augmentation strategies have
achieved great success. Especially, CutMix uses a simple but effective method
to improve the classifiers by randomly cropping a patch from one image and
pasting it on another image. To further promote the performance of CutMix, a
series of works explore to use the saliency information of the image to guide
the mixing. We systematically study the importance of the saliency information
for mixing data, and find that the saliency information is not so necessary for
promoting the augmentation performance. Furthermore, we find that the cutting
based data mixing methods carry two problems of label misallocation and object
information missing, which cannot be resolved simultaneously. We propose a more
effective but very easily implemented method, namely ResizeMix. We mix the data
by directly resizing the source image to a small patch and paste it on another
image. The obtained patch preserves more substantial object information
compared with conventional cut-based methods. ResizeMix shows evident
advantages over CutMix and the saliency-guided methods on both image
classification and object detection tasks without additional computation cost,
which even outperforms most costly search-based automatic augmentation methods.

decades, due to its appearance in a wide range of applications. The task of a

hybrid model-based data-driven deep architecture, referred to as Unfolded Phase

performance of state-of-the art data-driven and model-based phase retrieval
algorithms. The proposed method benefits from versatility and interpretability
of well-established model-based algorithms, while simultaneously benefiting
from the expressive power of deep neural networks. In particular, our proposed
model-based deep architecture is applied to the conventional phase retrieval
problem (via the incremental reshaped Wirtinger flow algorithm) and the sparse
phase retrieval problem (via the sparse truncated amplitude flow algorithm),
showing immense promise in both cases. Furthermore, we consider a joint design
of the sensing matrix and the signal processing algorithm and utilize the deep
unfolding technique in the process. Our numerical results illustrate the
effectiveness of such hybrid model-based and data-driven frameworks and

Here we present a toolbox to find the optimal discrimination of any set of

techniques, which provide rigorous (not heuristic) bounds, and which can be
efficiently solved on standard computers. We study both probabilistic and
unambiguous single-shot discrimination in two scenarios: the
""channel-discrimination scenario"", typical of metrology, in which the verifier
holds the light source and can set up a reference frame for the phase; and the
""source-discrimination scenario"", more frequent in cryptography, in which the
verifier only sees states that are diagonal in the photon-number basis. Our
techniques are illustrated with several examples. Among the results, we find
that, for many sets of modes, the optimal state for mode discrimination is a
superposition or mixture of at most two number states; but this is not general,

irreversible eye diseases, provides an alarm for implementing an intervention
to slow down the disease progression at early stage. A key question for this
forecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up
to the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide
an answer with a novel framework, namely \textbf{D}isease \textbf{F}orecast via
\textbf{P}rogression \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{DFPL}), which exploits the
irreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically,
based on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction
of the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal
image, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given
the progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To
model these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in
DFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the
disease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the
future image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image. The
generative model is implemented by a recurrent neural network, in order to
exploit the dependency of the historical data. To verify our approach, we apply
it to a PPA in-house dataset and it yields a significant improvement
(\textit{e.g.}, \textbf{4.48\%} of accuracy; \textbf{3.45\%} of AUC) over
others. Besides, our generative model can accurately localize the
disease-related regions.

surroundings. For example, air quality maps based on sensor readings help users
make decisions to mitigate the effects of pollution on their health. Standard
maps show readings from individual sensors or colored contours indicating
estimated pollution levels. However, showing a single estimate may conceal
uncertainty and lead to underestimation of risk, while showing sensor data
yields varied interpretations. We present several visualizations of uncertainty
in air quality maps, including a frequency-framing ""dotmap"" and small
multiples, and we compare them with standard contour and sensor-based maps. In
a user study, we find that including uncertainty in maps has a significant
effect on how much users would choose to reduce physical activity, and that
people make more cautious decisions when using uncertainty-aware maps.
Additionally, we analyze think-aloud transcriptions from the experiment to
understand more about how the representation of uncertainty influences people's
decision-making. Our results suggest ways to design maps of sensor data that
can encourage certain types of reasoning, yield more consistent responses, and
convey risk better than standard maps.

volume fraction ($\Phi_C$) dependent increase in the melting temperature of
globular proteins, $\Delta T_m(\Phi_C) \approx \Phi_C^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha =
\frac{1}{(3 \nu_{eff} - 1)}$. The effective Flory exponent, $\nu_{eff}$,
relates the radius of gyration in the unfolded state to the number of amino
acid residues in the protein. We derive the bound 1.25 $\le \alpha \le$ 2.0.
The theoretical predictions are confirmed using molecular simulations of
$\lambda$ repressor in the presence of spherical crowding particles. Analyses
of previous simulations and experiments confirm the predicted theoretical bound
for $\alpha$. We show that the non-specific attractions between crowding
particles and amino acid residues have to be substantial to fully negate the
enhanced protein stabilities due to intra protein attractive Asakura-Oosawa
(AO) depletion potential. Using the findings, we provide an alternate
explanation for the very modest (often less than 0.5 Kcal/mol) destabilization
in certain proteins in the cellular milieu. Cellular environment is
polydisperse containing large and small crowding agents. AO arguments suggest
that proteins would be localized between large (sizes exceeding that of the

consequences in a drainpipe during drainage of water from a stationary
rectangular tank. The critical and minimum depths of water above the inlet of
the drainpipe, where a surface dip starts to develop for drainpipes of various
diameters, were examined parametrically. This study explored the following
naturally occurring phenomena arising from a plughole vortex. (i) A plughole
vortex initially causes a surface dip to develop towards the inlet of the
drainpipe and as the surface dip approaches the inlet of the drainpipe it
creates a droplet-shaped air bubble. (ii) A unique bubble transformation, i.e.,
from a droplet-shaped to a donut-shaped bubble ring, occurs just after the
separation of the droplet-shaped air bubble from the surface dip. (iii) The
donut-shaped bubble ring flows with the drain water and initially causes bubbly
flow in the drainpipe. (iv) As the water head above the inlet of the drainpipe
decreases, the droplet-shaped bubble size increases, and consequently, the
bubble ring size increases and causes slug flow in the drainpipe. (v) As the
slugs combine, the flow of the draining water eventually becomes annular flow
in the drainpipe. Sounds, such as that of instantaneous fizz and bubble sink
draining, were observed to be produced as a result of the bubble formation
process. Temporal changes in the shape and size of the air bubbles were
studied. Within the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the ratio of the bubble diameter to
the bubble length was found to be linearly proportional to the ratio of the
water depth to the diameter of the drainpipe. Several drainage cases were
simulated numerically to observe the physics of these naturally occurring
phenomena. The shapes and sizes of the vortices induced by plugholes have been

permeability contrast is essential for the design and optimisation of enhanced
oil recovery processes. In this paper, we investigate the forced imbibition
behaviour in two dual-permeability geometries that are of equal permeability
contrast. First, a mathematical model is developed for the imbibition in a pore
doublet, which shows that the imbibition dynamics can be fully described by the
viscosity ratio $\lambda$ and capillary number $Ca_m$ which creatively
incorporates the influence of channel width and length. Through the finite
difference solution of the mathematical model, a $\lambda-Ca_m$ phase diagram
is established to characterise the imbibition preference in the pore doublet.
We then investigate the imbibition process in a dual-permeability pore network
using a well-established lattice Boltzmann method, focusing on the competition
between the viscous and capillary forces. Like in the pore doublet, the
preferential imbibition occurs in high permeability zone at high $Ca_{m}$ but
in low permeability zone at low $Ca_{m}$. When $Ca_m$ is not sufficiently high,
an oblique advancing pattern is observed which is attributed to non-trivial
interfacial tension. Thanks to the newly defined capillary number, the critical
$Ca_{m}$ curve on which the breakthrough simultaneously occurs in both
permeability zones, is found to match perfectly with that from the pore doublet
and it is the optimal condition for maximising the imbibition efficiency in the
entire pore network.

Banach space satisfying certain double invariance properties.
  In fact, a much stronger statement is presented: for a given compact subset
$M$ in such a Banach space $({\boldsymbol B}, \, \|\,\cdot\,\|_{\boldsymbol
B})$ one can construct a finite rank operator, whose range is contained in the
linear span of finitely many translates of $g$, and which approximates the
identity operator over $M$ up to a given level of precision.
  The setting of tempered distributions allows to reduce the technical
arguments to methods which are widely used in Fourier Analysis. The extension
to non-quasi-analytic weights respectively locally compact Abelian groups is
left to a forthcoming paper, which will be technically much more involved and
uses different ingredients.

a variety of fields, such as e-commerce networks, social networks and

problems in graph databases is to investigate the relationships between s and
t. A well-studied problem in such area is k-hop constrained s-t simple path
enumeration. Nevertheless, all existing algorithms targeting this problem
follow the DFS-based paradigm, which cannot scale up well. Moreover, using
hardware devices like FPGA to accelerate graph computation has become popular.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose the first FPGA-based algorithm
PEFP to solve the problem of k-hop constrained s-t simple path enumeration
efficiently. On the host side, we propose a preprocessing algorithm Pre-BFS to
reduce the graph size and search space. On the FPGA side in PEFP, we propose a
novel DFS-based batching technique to save on-chip memory efficiently. In
addition, we also propose caching techniques to cache necessary data in BRAM,
which overcome the latency bottleneck brought by the read/write operations
from/to FPGA DRAM. Finally, we propose a data separation technique to enable
dataflow optimization for the path verification module; hence the sub-stages in
that module can be executed in parallel. Comprehensive experiments show that
PEFP outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm JOIN by more than 1 order of
magnitude by average, and up to 2 orders of magnitude in terms of preprocessing
time, query processing time and total time, respectively.

valuable aid to search and rescue operations. Traditionally, UAVs utilize
exhaustive lawnmower exploration patterns to locate stranded survivors, without
any information regarding the survivor's whereabouts. In real life disaster
scenarios however, on-ground observers provide valuable information to the
rescue effort, such as the survivor's last known location and heading. In
earlier work, a Weight Based Exploration (WBE) model, which utilizes this
information to generate a prioritized list of waypoints to aid the UAV in its
search mission, was proposed. This approach was shown to be effective for a
single UAV locating a single survivor. In this paper, we extend the WBE model
to a team of UAVs locating multiple survivors. The model initially partitions
the search environment amongst the UAVs using Voronoi cells. The UAVs then
utilize the WBE model to locate survivors in their partitions. We test this
model with varying survivor locations and headings. We demonstrate the
scalability of the model developed by testing the model with aerial teams

  Vectors",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microstructures are critical to the physical properties of materials.
Stochastic microstructures are commonly observed in many kinds of materials and
traditional descriptor-based image analysis of them can be challenging. In this
paper, we introduce a powerful and versatile score-based framework for
analyzing nonstationarity in stochastic materials microstructures. The
framework involves training a parametric supervised learning model to predict a
pixel value using neighboring pixels in images of microstructures~(as known as
micrographs), and this predictive model provides an implicit characterization
of the stochastic nature of the microstructure. The basis for our approach is
the Fisher score vector, defined as the gradient of the log-likelihood with
respect to the parameters of the predictive model, at each micrograph pixel. A
fundamental property of the score vector is that it is zero-mean if the
predictive relationship in the vicinity of that pixel remains unchanged, which
we equate with the local stochastic nature of the microstructure remaining
unchanged. Conversely, if the local stochastic nature changes, then the mean of
the score vector generally differs from zero. Our framework analyzes how the
local mean of the score vector varies across one or more image samples to: (1)
monitor for nonstationarity by indicating whether new samples are statistically
different than reference samples and where they may differ and (2) diagnose
nonstationarity by identifying the distinct types of stochastic microstructures
and labeling accordingly the corresponding regions of the samples. Unlike
feature-based methods, our approach is almost completely general and requires
no prior knowledge of the nature of the nonstationarities. Using a number of
real and simulated micrographs, including polymer composites and multiphase
alloys, we demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach.

Instead of deploying implementation-costly back-propagation, we directly

resource-constrained stochastic noisy zeroth-order optimization problem, and
propose a novel mixed-training strategy with two-level sparsity and power-aware

  Reparametrization, Regularization, and Uncertainty Quantification",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an accurate imaging approach for modeling
velocity structure by minimizing the misfit between recorded and predicted
seismic waveforms. However, the strong non-linearity of FWI resulting from
fitting oscillatory waveforms can trap the optimization in local minima. We
propose a neural-network-based full waveform inversion method (NNFWI) that
integrates deep neural networks with FWI by representing the velocity model
with a generative neural network. Neural networks can naturally introduce
spatial correlations as regularization to the generated velocity model, which
suppresses noise in the gradients and mitigates local minima. The velocity
model generated by neural networks is input to the same partial differential
equation (PDE) solvers used in conventional FWI. The gradients of both the
neural networks and PDEs are calculated using automatic differentiation, which
back-propagates gradients through the acoustic PDEs and neural network layers
to update the weights of the generative neural network. Experiments on 1D
velocity models, the Marmousi model, and the 2004 BP model demonstrate that
NNFWI can mitigate local minima, especially for imaging high-contrast features
like salt bodies, and significantly improves the inversion in the presence of
noise. Adding dropout layers to the neural network model also allows analyzing
the uncertainty of the inversion results through Monte Carlo dropout. NNFWI
opens a new pathway to combine deep learning and FWI for exploiting both the
characteristics of deep neural networks and the high accuracy of PDE solvers.
Because NNFWI does not require extra training data and optimization loops, it
provides an attractive and straightforward alternative to conventional FWI.

that segments intensity calibration phantom regions in computed tomography (CT)

Methods: A total of 1040 cases (520 cases each from two institutions), in which
an intensity calibration phantom (B-MAS200, Kyoto Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) was
used, were included herein. A training dataset was created by manually
segmenting the regions of the phantom for 40 cases (20 cases each).
Segmentation accuracy of the CNN model was assessed with the Dice coefficient
and the average symmetric surface distance (ASD) through the 4-fold cross
validation. Further, absolute differences of radiodensity values (in Hounsfield
units: HU) were compared between manually segmented regions and automatically
segmented regions. The system was tested on the remaining 1000 cases. For each
institution, linear regression was applied to calculate coefficients for the
correlation between radiodensity and the densities of the phantom. Results:
After training, the median Dice coefficient was 0.977, and the median ASD was
0.116 mm. When segmented regions were compared between manual segmentation and
automated segmentation, the median absolute difference was 0.114 HU. For the
test cases, the median correlation coefficient was 0.9998 for one institution
and was 0.9999 for the other, with a minimum value of 0.9863. Conclusions: The
CNN model successfully segmented the calibration phantom's regions in the CT
images with excellent accuracy, and the automated method was found to be at
least equivalent to the conventional manual method. Future study should
integrate the system by automatically segmenting the region of interest in
bones such that the bone mineral density can be fully automatically quantified

electric vehicle aggregators face the uncertainty of reserve activation on one
side and electric vehicle availability on the other. These uncertainty can have
a negative effect on both the aggregators' profitability and their users'

Three electric vehicle scheduling models were designed and tested: the

single dish radio telescope in the world, has implemented an innovative
technology for its huge reflector, which changes the shape of the primary
reflector from spherical to that of a paraboloid of 300 m aperture. Here we
explore how the current FAST sensitivity can potentially be further improved by
increasing the illuminated area (i.e., the aperture of the paraboloid embedded
in the spherical surface). Alternatively, the maximum zenith angle can be
increased to give greater sky coverage by decreasing the illuminated
aperture.Different parabolic apertures within the FAST capability are analyzed
in terms of how far the spherical surface would have to move to approximate a
paraboloid. The sensitivity of FAST can be improved by approximately 10 % if
the aperture of the paraboloid is increased from 300 m to 315 m. The parabolic
aperture lies within the main spherical surface and does not extend beyond its
edge. The maximum zenith angle can be increased to approximately 35 degrees
from 26.4 degrees, if we decrease the aperture of the paraboloid to 220 m. This
would still give a sensitivity similar to the Arecibo 305 m radio telescope.
Radial deviations between paraboloids of different apertures and the spherical
surfaces of differing radii are also investigated. Maximum zenith angles
corresponding to different apertures of the paraboloid are further derived. A
spherical surface with a different radius can provide a reference baseline for
shape-changing applied through active reflector technology to FAST-like
telescopes.

among them. Our goal is to design efficient distributed scheduling algorithms
to maximize the network utility, which is a function of the achieved throughput
by the user equipment (UEs), subject to the average and instantaneous power
consumption constraints of the BSs. We propose a Media Access Control (MAC) and
a power allocation/adaptation mechanism utilizing the Lyapunov stochastic
optimization framework and non-cooperative games. In particular, we first
decompose the original utility maximization problem into two sub-optimization
problems for each time frame, which are a convex optimization problem and a
non-convex optimization problem, respectively. By formulating the distributed
scheduling problem as a non-cooperative game where each BS is a player
attempting to optimize its own utility, we provide a distributed solution to
the non-convex sub-optimization problem via finding the Nash Equilibrium (NE)
of the game whose weights are determined optimally by the Lyapunov optimization
framework. Finally, we conduct simulation under various network settings to
show the effectiveness of the proposed game-based beam scheduling algorithm in
comparison to that of several reference schemes.

challenges, we propose to exploit robust representations derived from multiple

further encode such representations with boundary and hierarchical information

  boundary value problems for $2 \times 2$ Dirac type systems","70 pages",,,,"math.SP math.CA math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper is concerned with the stability property under perturbation
$Q\to\widetilde Q$ of different spectral characteristics of a BVP associated in
$L^2([0,1];\Bbb C^2)$ with the following $2\times2$ Dirac type equation
$$L_U(Q)y=-iB^{-1}y'+Q(x)y=\lambda y,\quad B={\rm diag}(b_1,b_2),\quad
b_1<0<b_2,\quad y={\rm col}(y_1,y_2),\quad(1)$$ with a potential matrix $Q\in
L^p=L^p([0,1];\Bbb C^{2\times2})$ and subject to regular boundary conditions
$Uy=\{U_1,U_2\}y=0$.
  Our approach to spectral stability relies on the existence of triangular
transformation operators $K_Q^\pm$ for system (1) with $Q\in L^1$ established
in our previous works. We prove the Lipshitz property of the mapping $Q\to
K_Q^\pm$ from the balls in $L^p$ to the special Banach spaces
$X_{\infty,p}^2,X_{1,p}^2$, naturally arising here, and obtain similar property
for Fourier transforms of $K_Q^\pm$. These properties are of independent
interest and play a crucial role in the proofs of all stability results
discussed in the paper. For instance, as an immediate consequence we get the
Lipshitz property of the mapping $Q\to\Phi_Q$, where $\Phi_Q$ is the
fundamental matrix of the system (1).
  Assuming boundary conditions (BC) to be strictly regular, we show that the
mapping $Q\to\sigma(L_U(Q))-\sigma(L_U(0))$ sends $L^p,p\in[1,2]$, either into
$l^{p'}$ or into $l^p(\{(1+|n|)^{p-2}\})$; we also establish its Lipshitz
property on compacts. We show similar result for the mapping $Q\to F_Q-F_0$
into $l^{p'}(\Bbb Z; C([0,1];\Bbb C^2))$, where $F_Q$ is a sequence of
normalized eigenfunctions of $L_U(Q)$. Certain modifications of these results
are proved for balls in $L^p,p\in[1,2]$.
  If $Q\in L^2$ we establish a criterion for the system of root vectors of
$L_U(Q)$ to form a Bari basis in $L^2([0,1];\Bbb C^2)$. Under a simple
additional assumption this system forms a Bari basis if and only if BC are
self-adjoint.

  A main point of the paper is the interaction between the domain knowledge

approaches. Besides the ML methods, the utilized input features play a major
role in shaping the localization solution; we present a detailed discussion of
the different features and what could influence them, be it the underlying

discussion is dedicated to the different ML methods that have been applied to
localization problems, discussing the underlying problem and the solution

tasks and achieves dominant results using separately trained person detection

end-to-end fashion. Although the end-to-end approaches yield higher inference
efficiency, they largely lag behind those two-step counterparts in terms of

is mainly caused by the Re-ID sub-networks of end-to-end methods. To this end,
we propose a simple yet strong end-to-end network with diverse knowledge
distillation to break the bottleneck. We also design a spatial-invariant
augmentation to assist model to be invariant to inaccurate detection results.

used graph clustering algorithm. For large graphs, however, sequential SCAN
variants are prohibitively slow, and parallel SCAN variants do not effectively
share work among queries with different SCAN parameter settings. Since users of
SCAN often explore many parameter settings to find good clusterings, it is
worthwhile to precompute an index that speeds up queries.
  This paper presents a practical and provably efficient parallel index-based
SCAN algorithm based on GS*-Index, a recent sequential algorithm. Our parallel
algorithm improves upon the asymptotic work of the sequential algorithm by
using integer sorting. It is also highly parallel, achieving logarithmic span
(parallel time) for both index construction and clustering queries.
Furthermore, we apply locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to design a novel
approximate SCAN algorithm and prove guarantees for its clustering behavior.
  We present an experimental evaluation of our algorithms on large real-world
graphs. On a 48-core machine with two-way hyper-threading, our parallel index
construction achieves 50--151$\times$ speedup over the construction of
GS*-Index. In fact, even on a single thread, our index construction algorithm
is faster than GS*-Index. Our parallel index query implementation achieves
5--32$\times$ speedup over GS*-Index queries across a range of SCAN parameter
values, and our implementation is always faster than ppSCAN, a state-of-the-art
parallel SCAN algorithm. Moreover, our experiments show that applying LSH
results in faster index construction while maintaining good clustering quality.

entropy estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a family of estimators

mutual information. We show that these estimators are strongly consistent and
demonstrate their performance in a variety of use-cases. First, we consider
large alphabet entropy estimation. Then, we extend the scope to mutual
information estimation. Next, we apply the proposed scheme to conditional
mutual information estimation, as we focus on independence testing tasks.
Finally, we study a transfer entropy estimation problem. The proposed

method; a more effective MCI-like approximation method was proposed recently,

overlooked until now, mainly due to the widespread practice of unreasonably
restricting attack optimization to a limited number of iterations. In
particular, we, for the first time, identify that a simple logit loss can yield

transfer settings, especially including three new, realistic settings: an
ensemble transfer setting with little model similarity, a worse-case setting
with low-ranked target classes, and also a real-world attack against the Google

  Brain Tumor Segmentation from Multi-Views?","21 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When diagnosing the brain tumor, doctors usually make a diagnosis by
observing multimodal brain images from the axial view, the coronal view and the
sagittal view, respectively. And then they make a comprehensive decision to
confirm the brain tumor based on the information obtained from multi-views.
Inspired by this diagnosing process and in order to further utilize the 3D
information hidden in the dataset, this paper proposes a multi-view dynamic
fusion framework to improve the performance of brain tumor segmentation. The
proposed framework consists of 1) a multi-view deep neural network
architecture, which represents multi learning networks for segmenting the brain
tumor from different views and each deep neural network corresponds to
multi-modal brain images from one single view and 2) the dynamic decision
fusion method, which is mainly used to fuse segmentation results from
multi-views as an integrate one and two different fusion methods, the voting
method and the weighted averaging method, have been adopted to evaluate the
fusing process. Moreover, the multi-view fusion loss, which consists of the
segmentation loss, the transition loss and the decision loss, is proposed to
facilitate the training process of multi-view learning networks so as to keep
the consistency of appearance and space, not only in the process of fusing
segmentation results, but also in the process of training the learning network.
\par By evaluating the proposed framework on BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2018, it can
be found that the fusion results from multi-views achieve a better performance
than the segmentation result from the single view and the effectiveness of
proposed multi-view fusion loss has also been proved. Moreover, the proposed
framework achieves a better segmentation performance and a higher efficiency
compared to other counterpart methods.

pre-established test. For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this paper,
I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous information
when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called
dilation -- an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an example, I present
hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO's minimum quality requirement for
rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The ambiguity in the information
arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test:
the joint distribution of true infection and test results is not observed.
Using results from Copula theory, I construct the (usually non-singleton) set
of all these possible joint distributions, which allows me to assess the new
test's informativeness. This analysis leads to a simple sufficient condition to
make sure that a new test is not a dilation. I illustrate my approach with
applications to data from three COVID-19 related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests
satisfy my sufficient condition easily and are therefore informative. However,
less accurate procedures, like chest CT scans, may exhibit dilation.

finite-volume/finite-difference scheme for the viscous and resistive equations
of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) based on an appropriate 3-split of the governing
PDE system, which is decomposed into a first convective subsystem, a second
subsystem involving the coupling of the velocity field with the magnetic field
and a third subsystem involving the pressure-velocity coupling. The nonlinear
convective terms are discretized explicitly, while the remaining two subsystems
accounting for the Alfven waves and the magneto-acoustic waves are treated
implicitly. The final algorithm is at least formally constrained only by a mild
CFL stability condition depending on the velocity field of the pure
hydrodynamic convection. To preserve the divergence-free constraint of the
magnetic field exactly at the discrete level, a proper set of overlapping dual
meshes is employed. The resulting linear algebraic systems are shown to be
symmetric and therefore can be solved by means of an efficient standard
matrix-free conjugate gradient algorithm. One of the peculiarities of the
presented algorithm is that the magnetic field is defined on the edges of the
main grid, while the electric field is on the faces. The final scheme can be
regarded as a novel shock-capturing, conservative and structure preserving
semi-implicit scheme for the nonlinear viscous and resistive MHD equations.
Several numerical tests are presented to show the main features of our novel
solver: linear-stability in the sense of Lyapunov is verified at a prescribed
constant equilibrium solution; a 2nd-order of convergence is numerically
estimated; shock-capturing capabilities are proven against a standard set of
stringent MHD shock-problems; accuracy and robustness are verified against a

boundaries from a neuron's input. Then, the latter are propagated to
effectively find a neuron's output since it is the input of the next one. This
paper describes the first bit-precise symbolic verification framework to reason
over actual implementations of ANNs in CUDA, based on invariant inference,
therefore providing further guarantees about finite-precision arithmetic and
its rounding errors, which are routinely ignored in the existing literature. We
have implemented the proposed approach on top of the efficient SMT-based
bounded model checker (ESBMC), and its experimental results show that it can
successfully verify safety properties, in actual implementations of ANNs, and
generate real adversarial cases in MLPs. Our approach was able to verify and
produce adversarial examples for 85.8% of 21 test cases considering different

spin models which include terms accounting for two social phenomena: homophily
-- the tendency for people with similar opinions to establish positive
relations -- and social balance -- the tendency for people to establish
balanced triadic relations. Spins represent attribute vectors that encode
multiple (binary) opinions of individuals and social interactions between
individuals can be positive or negative. Recent work suggests that large
systems of N >> 1 individuals never reach a balanced state (where unbalanced
triads with one or three hostile links remain), provided the number of
attributes for each agent is less than O(N^2) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 078302].
Here we show that this statement is overly restrictive. Within a Hamiltonian
framework that minimizes individuals' social stress, we demonstrate that
stationary, balanced, but fragmented states can be reached for any number of
attributes, if, in addition to homophily, individuals take into account a
significant fraction, q, of their triadic relations. Above a critical value
q_c, balanced states result. This result also holds for sparse realistic social
networks. Finally, in the limit of small q, our result agrees with that of

However, existing methods require separate inference through the entire network

effects due to long latency. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on
a neural architecture search technique that enables efficient generation of
multiple imagery effects via two stages of pruning: task-agnostic and
task-specific pruning. Specifically, task-specific pruning learns to adaptively
remove the irrelevant network parameters for each task, while task-agnostic
pruning learns to find an efficient architecture by sharing the early layers of
the network across different tasks. Since the shared layers allow for feature
reuse, only a single inference of the task-agnostic layers is needed to
generate multiple imagery effects from the input image. Using the proposed
task-agnostic and task-specific pruning schemes together significantly reduces
the FLOPs and the actual latency of inference compared to the baseline. We
reduce 95.7% of the FLOPs when generating 27 imagery effects, and make the GPU
latency 73.0% faster on 4K-resolution images.

is achieved by dividing the overall inference problem into sub-problems where
we sequentially infer the posterior distribution of one tensor decomposition

well-known iterative algorithm alternating linear scheme (ALS). In this way,
the consideration of measurement noise is enabled, as well as the incorporation

emerging compound semiconductor material due to its ultra-wide bandgap. However
the pristine $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ has an inversion center, displaying no

substantially reduces their computational costs. However, existing works either
suffer from a severe performance drop in ultra-low precision of 4 or lower

To our knowledge, this vulnerability to low precisions relies on two
statistical observations of feature map values. First, distribution of feature
map values varies significantly per channel and per input image. Second,
feature maps have outliers that can dominate the quantization error. Based on
these observations, we propose a novel distribution-aware quantization scheme
(DAQ) which facilitates accurate training-free quantization in ultra-low
precision. A simple function of DAQ determines dynamic range of feature maps
and weights with low computational burden. Furthermore, our method enables
mixed-precision quantization by calculating the relative sensitivity of each
channel, without any training process involved. Nonetheless, quantization-aware
training is also applicable for auxiliary performance gain. Our new method
outperforms recent training-free and even training-based quantization methods

is the well-known Ramanujan sum and the complex numbers $G(q)$, as $q\in$N, are
the Ramanujan coefficients; of course, we mean, implicitly, that the series
converges pointwise, in all natural $a$, as its partial sums $\sum_{q\le
Q}G(q)c_q(a)$ converge in C, when $Q\to \infty$. Motivated by our recent study
of infinite and finite Euler products for the Ramanujan series, in which we
assumed $G$ multiplicative, we look at a kind of (partial) smooth summations.
These are $\sum_{q\in (P)}G(q)c_q(a)$, where the indices $q$ in $(P)$ means
that all prime factors $p$ of $q$ are up to $P$ (fixed); then, we pass to the
limit over $P\to \infty$. Notice that this kind of partial sums over $P-$smooth
numbers (i.e., in $(P)$, see the above) make up an infinite sum, themselves,
$\forall P\in$P fixed, in general; however, our summands contain $c_q(a)$, that
has a vertical limit, i.e. it's supported over indices $q\in$N for which the
$p-$adic valuations of, resp., $q$ and $a$, namely $v_p(q)$, resp., $v_p(a)$
satisfy $v_p(q)\le v_p(a)+1$ and this is true $\forall p\le P$ ($P$'s fixed).
In other words, $\forall G:$N $\rightarrow$ C, here, $\sum_{q\in
(P)}G(q)c_q(a)$ is a finite sum, $\forall a\in $N, $\forall P\in $P fixed: we
will call $\sum_{q=1}^{\infty}G(q)c_q(a)$ a 'smooth Ramanujan series' if and
only if $\exists \lim_P \sum_{q\in (P)}G(q)c_q(a)\in $C, $\forall a\in $N.
Notice a very important property : smooth Ramanujan series and Ramanujan series
need not to be the same. We prove : smooth Ramanujan series converge under
Wintner Assumption. (This is not necessarily true for Ramanujan series.) We
apply this to correlations and to the Hardy--Littlewood ""$2k-$Twin Primes""

develop an effective analytical model, which allows us to reproduce the

graph Laplacian, which leverages recent graph signal processing results.
Further, we derive a novel formulation of the Jensen divergence for the

connectivity patterns corresponding to different task conditions. Furthermore,
we apply the Laplacian denoising technique to brain networks estimated from
real EEG data recorded during MI-BCI experiments. Using our novel formulation
of the J-divergence, we are able to quantify the distance between the FC
networks in the motor imagery and resting states, as well as to understand the
contribution of each Laplacian variable to the total J-divergence between two
states. Experimental results on real MI-BCI EEG data demonstrate that the
Laplacian denoising improves the separation of motor imagery and resting mental

However, BMC techniques struggle to falsify programs that contain loops. BMC
needs to incrementally unfold the program loops up to the bound $k$, exposing
the property violation, which can thus lead to exploring a considerable state

waiting to enter the airplane. We analyze three policies in the many-passenger
limit by a geometric representation of the queue position and row designation
of each passenger and apply a Lorentzian metric to calculate the total boarding
time. The boarding time is governed by the time each passenger needs to clear
the aisle, and the added time is determined by the aisle-clearing time
distribution through an effective aisle-clearing time parameter. The
non-organized queues under the common random boarding policy are characterized
by large effective aisle-clearing time. We show that, subject to a mathematical
assumption which we have verified by extensive numerical computations in all
realistic cases, the average total boarding time is always reduced when slow
passengers are separated from faster passengers and the slow group is allowed
to enter the airplane first. This is a universal result that holds for any
combination of the three main governing parameters: the ratio between effective
aisle-clearing times of the fast and the slow group, the fraction of slow
passenger, and the congestion of passengers in the aisle. Separation into
groups based on aisle-clearing time allows for more synchronized seating, but
the result is non-trivial, as the similar fast-first policy -- where the two
groups enter the airplane in reverse order -- is inferior to random boarding
for a range of parameter settings. The asymptotic results conform well with
discrete-event simulations with realistic number of passengers, and both the
slow-first and the fast-first policies have the ability to perform unboundedly
better than random boarding. Parameters based on empirical data, with hand
luggage as criteria for separating passengers into the slow group, give a 13\%
reduction in total boarding time for slow first compared to random boarding.

large-scale structure (LSS). However, the extractions of these information are
usually hindered by the nonlinearities of the LSS, which can be largely
alleviated by various techniques known as the reconstruction. In realistic
applications, the efficiencies of these methods are always degraded by many
limiting factors, a quite important one being the shot noise induced by the
finite number density of biased matter tracers (i.e., luminous galaxies or dark
matter halos) in observations. In this work, we explore the gains of biased
tracer reconstruction achieved from halo mass information, which can suppress
shot noise component and dramatically improves the cross-correlation between
tracer field and dark matter. To this end, we first closely study the
clustering biases and the stochasticity properties of halo fields with various
number densities under different weighting schemes, i.e., the uniform, mass and
optimal weightings. Then, we apply the biased tracer reconstruction method to
these different weighted halo fields and investigate how linear bias and
observational mass scatter affect the reconstruction performance. Our results
demonstrate that halo masses are critical information for significantly
improving the performance of biased tracer reconstruction, indicating a great
application potential for substantially promoting the precision of cosmological

existence of finite mean values of the waiting times at the different states of
the model. Gaussian statistics in the long time limit is achieved due to
ergodicity and convergence of the distribution of the temporal occupation
fraction in state $D_{+}$ to a $\delta$-function. The short time behavior of
the same quantity converges to a uniform distribution, which leads to the non -
analyticity in $P(x,t)$. We demonstrate how super - statistical framework is a
zeroth order short time expansion of $P(x,t)$, in the number of transitions,
that does not yield the cusp like shape. The latter, considered as the key
feature of experiments in the field, is found with the first correction in
perturbation theory.

non-trivial and appear to be crucial for the intriguing functionalities of
these materials. In the quantum-mechanical framework of time-dependent
density-functional theory, we investigate from first principles the impact of
protonation of triazine and amino groups in molecular building blocks of COFs
in water solution. In all considered cases, we find that proton uptake leads to
a gap reduction and to a reorganization of the electronic structure, driven by
the presence of the proton and by the electrostatic attraction between the
positively charged protonated species and the negative counterion in its
vicinity. Structural distortions induced by protonation are found to play only
a minor role. The interplay between band-gap renormalization and exciton
binding strength determines the energy of the absorption onsets: when the
former prevails on the latter, a red-shift is observed. Furthermore, the
spatial and energetic rearrangement of the molecular orbitals upon protonation
induces a splitting of the lowest-energy peaks and a decrease of their
oscillator strength in comparison with the pristine counterparts. Our results
offer quantitative and microscopic insight into the role of protonation on the
electronic and optical properties of triazine derivatives as building blocks of
COFs. As such, they contribute to rationalize the relationships between

degeneracy and Fermi surfaces with nontrivial Chern numbers have been
discovered experimentally in AlPt[arXiv:1812.03310] and
XSi(X=Rh,Co)[arXiv:1812.04466][arXiv:1901.03358][arXiv:1809.01312]. In this
work, we largely expand the family of multifold fermion materials by pointing
out that several well-studied noncentrosymmetric superconductors are indeed
multifold fermion metals. Importantly, their normal state topological
properties, which have been ignored in previous studies, play an important role
in the superconducting properties. Taking Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and Li$_2$Pt$_3$B as
examples, we found a large number of unconventional degenerate points, such as
double spin-1, spin-3/2, Weyl and double Weyl topological band crossing points
near the Fermi energy, which result in finite Chern numbers on Fermi surfaces.
Long Fermi arc states in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B, originating from the nontrivial band
topology were found. Importantly, it has been shown experimentally that
Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and Li$_2$Pt$_3$B are fully gapped and gapless superconductors,
respectively. By analyzing the possible pairing symmetries, we suggest that
Li$_2$Pd$_3$B can be a DIII class topological superconductor with Majorana
surface states, even though the spin-orbit coupling in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B is
negligible. Interestingly, Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, being gapless, is likely to be a
nodal topological superconductor with dispersionless surface Majorana modes. We
further identified that several noncentrosymmetric superconductors, such as
Mo$_3$Al$_2$C, PdBiSe, Y$_2$C$_3$ and La$_2$C$_3$, are multifold fermion
superconductors whose normal state topological properties have been ignored in
previous experimental and theoretical studies.

is simulated in a finite element environment under a diverse set of contact
conditions, and spherical particles are projected to a simulated image.
Features extracted from the images are mapped to the 3D contact force
distribution, with the ground truth also obtained via finite-element
simulations, with an artificial neural network that is therefore entirely
trained on synthetic data avoiding the need for real-world data collection. The
resulting model exhibits high accuracy when evaluated on real-world tactile

conditions is determined by the properties of the traps that are responsible
for these unique properties. Traps are characterized by the height of their
associated barrier for thermal detrapping, and a continuous distribution of
trap depths is often found in real materials. Accurately determining trap depth
distributions is hence of importance for the understanding and development of
persistent phosphors. However, extracting the trap depth distribution is often
hindered by the presence of a thermal barrier for charging as well, which
causes a temperature-dependent filling of traps. For this case, we propose a
method for extracting the trap depth distribution from a set of
thermoluminescence (TL) curves obtained at different charging temperatures. The
TL curves are first transformed into electron population functions via the
Tikhonov regularization, assuming first-order kinetics. Subsequently, the
occupation of the traps as a function of their depth, quantified by the
so-called filling function, is obtained. Finally, the underlying trap depth
distribution is reconstructed from the filling functions. The proposed method
provides a substantial improvement in precision and resolution for the trap
depth distribution compared with existing methods. This is hence a step forward
in understanding the (de)trapping behavior of persistent and storage phosphors.

this work we propose to combine the two approaches leveraging their respective

Optimizing over the parameterization then allows us to search the shapes for a
photo consistent solution with respect to other images. This allows us to
enforce geometric properties that are difficult to observe in single image as

  Space Deformation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a methodology to automatically obtain Pose Space Deformation (PSD)
basis for rigged garments through deep learning. Classical approaches rely on
Physically Based Simulations (PBS) to animate clothes. These are general
solutions that, given a sufficiently fine-grained discretization of space and
time, can achieve highly realistic results. However, they are computationally
expensive and any scene modification prompts the need of re-simulation. Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS) with PSD offers a lightweight alternative to PBS, though,
it needs huge volumes of data to learn proper PSD. We propose using deep
learning, formulated as an implicit PBS, to unsupervisedly learn realistic
cloth Pose Space Deformations in a constrained scenario: dressed humans.
Furthermore, we show it is possible to train these models in an amount of time
comparable to a PBS of a few sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to propose a neural simulator for cloth. While deep-based approaches
in the domain are becoming a trend, these are data-hungry models. Moreover,
authors often propose complex formulations to better learn wrinkles from PBS
data. Supervised learning leads to physically inconsistent predictions that
require collision solving to be used. Also, dependency on PBS data limits the
scalability of these solutions, while their formulation hinders its
applicability and compatibility. By proposing an unsupervised methodology to
learn PSD for LBS models (3D animation standard), we overcome both of these
drawbacks. Results obtained show cloth-consistency in the animated garments and
meaningful pose-dependant folds and wrinkles. Our solution is extremely
efficient, handles multiple layers of cloth, allows unsupervised outfit
resizing and can be easily applied to any custom 3D avatar.

included by constraining supercell lattice constants perpendicular to the [001]

strain reduces the Sn composition required to bring the (positive) direct band
gap to zero by approximately 5% compared to a relaxed Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ alloy

comparatively less impact on the alloy band gap at $\Gamma$. Using DFT

a phase transition (known in signal analysis as 'Nyquist rate') determining the

As suggested by Perelomov, the transition is given according to the hyperbolic
volume of the fundamental region. The solution is a more general form (in phase
space) of the $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ variant of a 1989 conjecture of Kristian Seip
about wavelet frames, where the same value of `Nyquist rate' is obtained as the
trace of a certain localization operator. The proof consists of first
connecting the problem to the theory of von Neumann algebras, by introducing a
new class of projective representations of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ acting on
non-analytic Bergman-type spaces. We then adapt to this setting a new method
for computing von Neumann dimensions, due to Sir Vaughan Jones. Our solution
contains necessary conditions in the form of a `Nyquist rate' dividing frames
from Riesz sequences of coherent states and sampling from interpolating
sequences. They hold for an infinite sequence of spaces of polyanalytic
functions containing the eigenspaces of the Maass operator and their orthogonal
sums. Within mild boundaries, we show that our result is best possible, by
characterizing our sequence of function spaces as the only invariant spaces
under the non-analytic $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$-representations.

universal theory for the aerodynamic force on a body in three-dimensional
steady flow, effective from incompressible all the way to supersonic regimes.
In this theory, the total aerodynamic force can be determined solely with the
vorticity distribution on a single wake plane locating in the steady linear far
field. Despite the vital importance of this result, its validity and
performance in practice has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we
performed Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of subsonic, transonic,
and supersonic flows over a three-dimensional wing. The aerodynamic forces
obtained from the universal force theory are compared with that from the
standard wall-stress integrals. The agreement between these two formulas
confirms for the first time the validity of the theory in three-dimensional
steady viscous and compressible flow. The good performance of the universal
formula is mainly due to the fact that the turbulent viscosity in the wake is
much larger than the molecular viscosity therein, which can reduce
significantly the distance of the steady linear far field from the body. To
further confirm the correctness of the theory, comparisons are made for the
flow structures on the wake plane obtained from the analytical results and
numerical simulations. The underlying physics relevant to the universality of
the theory is explained by identifying different sources of vorticity in the
wake.

a porous medium. The interacting nature of the pores within a porous medium can
be well depicted by an interacting capillary model. However, the arrangement of
pores is crucial in understanding the flow behaviour in an interacting
capillary system, which also leads to different governing equations of
spontaneous imbibition. To this end, in the present work, we first develop a
generalized one-dimensional lubrication approximation model to predict the
imbibition behaviour in an interacting multi-capillary system. Using our
generalized model, we observe that the flow dynamics, the capillary having the
leading meniscus and the breakthrough time are governed by the contrast in the
radii and the arrangement of the capillaries. We also show that during
breakthrough, the saturation of the multi-capillary system depends on the
arrangement of the capillaries. We show that the breakthrough in the
bundle-of-tubes model occurs at a dimensionless time of $0.5$, while the
breakthrough in the interacting capillary system occurs between the
dimensionless times $0.31$ and $0.42$, for the capillary system considered in
this study. Comparing the interacting multi-capillary system with the

particular, we prove a reduction theorem which shows that instead of maximizing
over all subspaces, it suffices to maximize over so-called trace spaces which
have their basis in the spectral fibers. The reduction leads to an algorithm
for computing angular values of dimensions one and two. We apply the algorithm

Testing for mediation is empirically very important in psychology, sociology,
medicine, economics and business, generating over 100,000 citations to a single
key paper. The no-mediation hypothesis $H_{0}:\theta_{1}\theta _{2}=0$ also
poses a theoretically interesting statistical problem since it defines a
manifold that is non-regular in the origin where rejection probabilities of
standard tests are extremely low. We prove that a similar test for mediation
only exists if the size is the reciprocal of an integer. It is unique, but has
objectionable properties. We propose a new test that is nearly similar with
power close to the envelope without these abject properties and is easy to use
in practice. Construction uses the general varying $g$-method that we propose.
We illustrate the results in an educational setting with gender role beliefs
and in a trade union sentiment application.

data, becoming ubiquitous in state-of-the-art solutions for a wide variety of
applications. Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive,
requiring $O(L^2)$ in serial time and memory as functions of input length $L$.
Recent works proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as
$O(L)$ for serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent
Transformer mechanisms with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of
overall computational complexity. We observe a remarkable computational
flexibility: forward and backward propagation can be performed with no
approximations using sublinear memory as a function of $L$ (in addition to
negligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of greater time
complexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer consumes
only $O(1)$ memory during training, and still requires $O(L)$ time. This
discovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete
backward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a
smartphone or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards
decentralized and democratized deep learning.

  Uncoordinated Constant Step-Sizes",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed optimization and Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems have
drawn much attention in the control community recently. This paper studies a
class of non-cooperative games, known as N-cluster game, which subsumes both
cooperative and non-cooperative nature among multiple agents in the two
problems: solving distributed optimization problem within the cluster, while
playing a non-cooperative game across the clusters. Moreover, we consider a
partial-decision information game setup, i.e., the agents do not have direct
access to other agents' decisions, and hence need to communicate with each
other through a directed graph. To solve the N-cluster game problem, we propose
a distributed NE seeking algorithm by a synthesis of consensus and gradient
tracking. Unlike other existing discrete-time methods for N-cluster games where
either a common step-size is publicly known by all agents or only known by
agents from the same cluster, the proposed algorithm can work with fully
uncoordinated constant step-sizes, which allows the agents (both within and
across the clusters) to choose their own preferred step-sizes. We prove that
all agents' decisions converge linearly to their corresponding NE so long as
the largest step-size and the heterogeneity of the step-sizes are small. We
verify the derived results through a numerical example in a Cournot competition
game.

changes. Therefore, comprehending the effects of these changes on software's
architecture over the releases becomes necessary. However, it is challenging to
keep architecture in-check and add new changes simultaneously for every
release. To this end, we propose a visualization tool called AC2, which allows
its users to examine the alterations in the architecture at both higher and
lower levels of abstraction for the python projects. AC2 uses call graphs and
collaboration graphs to show the interaction between different architectural
components. The tool provides four different views to see the architectural
changes. The user can examine two releases at a time to comprehend the
architectural changes between the releases. AC2 can support the maintainers and
developers to observe changes in the project and its influence on the
architecture, which allow them to see its increasing complexity over the
releases at the component level. AC2 can be downloaded at

power on the likelihood before combining with the prior via Bayes's formula.
This fractional power, which is often viewed as a remedy for potential model
misspecification bias, is called the learning rate, and a number of data-driven
learning rate selection methods have been proposed in the recent literature.
Each of these proposals has a different focus, a different target they aim to
achieve, which makes them difficult to compare. In this paper, we provide a
direct head-to-head comparison of these learning rate selection methods in
various misspecified model scenarios, in terms of several relevant metrics, in
particular, coverage probability of the generalized Bayes credible regions. In
some examples all the methods perform well, while in others the
misspecification is too severe to be overcome, but we find that the so-called
generalized posterior calibration algorithm tends to outperform the others in
terms of credible region coverage probability.

with an accurate wavelength calibration through molecular-band cells. This is
an entirely new area of investigation that will provide timely results to
improve the search of telluric planets with NIR spectrographs such as iSHELL,
CARMENES, and GIANO-B. We will extract several disc-integrated activity
indicators and average magnetic field measurements for the Sun in the NIR.
Eventually, they will be correlated with both the RV of the Sun-as-a -star and
the resolved images of the solar disc in visible and NIR. Such an approach will
allow for a better understanding of the origin of activity-induced RV
variations in the two spectral domains and will help in improving the
techniques for their corrections. In this paper, we outline the science drivers
for the LOCNES project and its first commissioning results.

reaching a Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 100$ is generated in a water

three-dimensional motion is recorded using two orthogonally positioned

the velocity fluctuations of the particles in still fluid and find that
differences in the falling style might be explained by a closer alignment
between the particle's pitch angle and its velocity vector. By comparing the
trajectories under background turbulence with the quiescent fluid cases, we
measure a decrease in the mean descent velocity in turbulence for the
conditions tested. We also study the secondary motion of the particles and
identify descent events that are unique to turbulence such as 'long gliding'
and 'rapid rotation' events. Lastly, we show an increase in the radial
dispersion of the particles under background turbulence and correlate the
timescale of descent events with the local settling velocity.

only according to the matching degree between the query and each individual
candidate response. Although good performance has been achieved, these recent
works ignore the comparison among the candidate responses, which could provide
rich information for selecting the most appropriate response. Intuitively,
better decisions could be made when the models can get access to the comparison

a novel and plug-in Self-attention Comparison Module for retrieval-based

detection and classification of traffic anomalies based on the identification
of atypical fluctuations in the relationship between density and flow. For
aggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by
the fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern
sensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data
consequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are
best described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density-flow
plane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK
National Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these
distributions for London's M25 motorway. Curves in the density-flow plane are
then constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These
curves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic
states. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than
specific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95\% probability curve
correlate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant
congestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region
provides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We
validate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events
in historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature.
Detection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and
found to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed
distribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much
lower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other
metrics. This method has the additional advantage of being self-calibrating.

perpendicular to the layers (along $z$), we reveal novel unconventional
scenarios of the response of the band-gap edges to the magnetization. The
modification of the valence and conduction states is considered in terms of
their $\Gamma$-point spin $s^z$ and total angular momentum $J^z$ on the atomic
sites where the states are localized. The actual scenario depends on whether
$s^z$ and $J^z$ have the same or opposite sign. In particular, the opposite
sign for the valence state and the same sign for the conduction state give rise
to an unconventional response in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ -- both in the bulk crystal and
in ultra-thin films, which fundamentally distinguishes this topological
insulator from Bi$_2$Se$_3$, where both states have the same sign. To gain a
deeper insight into different scenarios in insulators with both inverted and
non-inverted zero-field band structure, a minimal four-band third-order k.p
model is constructed from first principles. Within this model, we analyze the
field-induced band structure of the insulators and identify Weyl nodes that
appear in a magnetic phase and behave differently depending on the scenario. We
characterize the topology of the modified band structure by the Chern number
$\mathcal{C}$ and find the unconventional response to be accompanied by a large
Chern number $\mathcal{C}=\pm3$.

exploiting quantum error correction (QEC) to actively battle these undesired

a quantum-computing architecture based on a single string of ions confined by a
radio-frequency trap, and manipulated by individually-addressed laser beams.
This type of errors affects spectator qubits that, ideally, should remain
unaltered during the application of single- and two-qubit quantum gates
addressed at a different set of active qubits. We microscopically model
crosstalk errors from first principles and present a detailed study showing the
importance of using a coherent vs incoherent error modelling and, moreover,
discuss strategies to actively suppress this crosstalk at the gate level.
Finally, we study the impact of residual crosstalk errors on the performance of
fault-tolerant QEC numerically, identifying the experimental target values that
need to be achieved in near-term trapped-ion experiments to reach the
break-even point for beneficial QEC with low-distance topological codes.

To

contactless operations in hospitals and reduce cross-infection between medical
staff and patients. Although semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) technology can improve the autonomy of robots, semantic object
association is still a problem that is worthy of being studied. The key to
solving this problem is to correctly associate multiple object measurements of
one object landmark by using semantic information, and to refine the pose of
object landmark in real time. To this end, we propose a hierarchical object
association strategy and a pose-refinement approach. The former one consists of
two levels, i.e., a short-term object association and a global one. In the
first level, we employ the multiple-object-tracking for short-term object
association, through which the incorrect association among objects whose
locations are close and appearances are similar can be avoided. Moreover, the
short-term object association can provide more abundant object appearance and
more robust estimation of object pose for the global object association in the
second level. To refine the object pose in the map, we develop an approach to
choose the optimal object pose from all object measurements associated with an
object landmark. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on seven
simulated hospital sequences1, a real hospital environment and the KITTI
dataset. Experimental results show that our method has an obviously improvement
in terms of robustness and accuracy for the object association and the
trajectory estimation in the semantic SLAM.

QSO B1420+326 is a blazar classified as a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar
(FSRQ). In the beginning of 2020 it underwent an enhanced flux state. An
extensive multiwavelength campaign allowed us to trace the evolution of the
flare. Aims. We search for VHE gamma-ray emission from QSO B1420+326 during
this flaring state. We aim to characterize and model the broadband emission of
the source over different phases of the flare. Methods. The source was observed
with a number of instruments in radio, near infrared, optical (including
polarimetry and spectroscopy), ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We use
dedicated optical spectroscopy results to estimate the accretion disk and the
dust torus luminosity. We perform spectral energy distribution modeling in the
framework of combined Synchrotron-Self-Compton and External Compton scenario in
which the electron energy distribution is partially determined from
acceleration and cooling processes. Results. During the enhanced state the flux
of both SED components drastically increased and the peaks were shifted to
higher energies. Follow up observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the
detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from this source, making it
one of only a handful of FSRQs known in this energy range. Modeling allows us
to constrain the evolution of the magnetic field and electron energy
distribution in the emission region. The gamma-ray flare was accompanied by a
rotation of the optical polarization vector during a low polarization state.
Also, a new, superluminal radio knot contemporaneously appeared in the radio
image of the jet. The optical spectroscopy shows a prominent FeII bump with
flux evolving together with the continuum emission and a MgII line with varying
equivalent width.

nuclear matter. The interest is, whether the strengths of the
bottomonium-(nuclear matter) and charmonium-(nuclear matter) interactions are
similar or different. This is because, each ($J/\Psi,\Upsilon$) and
($\eta_c,\eta_b$) meson group is usually assumed to have very similar
properties based on the heavy charm and bottom quark masses. The estimate for
the $\Upsilon$ is made using an SU(5) effective Lagrangian and the anomalous
coupling one, by studying the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$ meson loop
contributions for the self-energy. As for the $\eta_b$, we include the $BB^*$
and $B^*B^*$ meson loop contributions in the self-energy. The in-medium masses
of the $B$ and $B^*$ mesons appearing in the self-energy are calculated by the
quark-meson coupling model. An analysis on the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$ meson
loops in the $\Upsilon$ mass shift is made by comparing with the corresponding
$DD, DD^*$, and $D^*D^*$ meson loops for the $J/\Psi$ mass shift. Our
prediction for the $\eta_b$ mass shift is made including only the lowest order
$BB^*$ meson loop. The $\Upsilon$ mass shift, with including only the $BB$
loop, is predicted to be -16 to -22 MeV at the nuclear matter saturation
density using the $\Upsilon BB$ coupling constant determined by the vector
meson dominance model with the experimental data, while the $\eta_b$ mass shift
is predicted to be -75 to -82 MeV with the SU(5) universal coupling constant
determined by the $\Upsilon BB$ coupling constant. Our results show an
appreciable difference between the bottomonium-(nuclear matter) and
charmonium-(nuclear matter) interaction strengths. We also study the $\Upsilon$
and $\eta_b$ mass shifts in a heavy quark (heavy meson) symmetry limit.

quantizing quasi-Hamiltonian $G$-spaces, where $G$ is a compact simple Lie
group. Our starting point is the well-acknowledged analogy between the
cotangent bundle $T^*G$ in Hamiltonian geometry and the internally fused double
$D(G)=G\times G$ in quasi-Hamiltonian geometry. Guillemin and Sternberg
consider the former, studing half-densities and phase functions on its
so-called character Lagrangians $\Lambda_{\mathcal{O}}\subseteq T^*G$. Our
quasi-Hamiltonian counterpart replaces these character Lagrangians with the
universal centralizers $\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}}\longrightarrow\mathcal{C}$ of
regular, $\frac{1}{k}$-integral conjugacy classes $\mathcal{C}\subseteq G$. We
show each universal centralizer to be a ""quasi-Hamiltonian Lagrangian"" in
$D(G)$, and to come equipped with a half-density and phase function.
  At the same time, we consider a Dehn twist-induced automorphism
$R:D(G)\longrightarrow D(G)$ that lacks a natural Hamiltonian analogue. Each
quasi-Hamiltonian Lagrangian $R(\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}})$ is shown to have a
clean intersection with every $\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}'}$, and to come equipped
with a half-density and phase function of its own. This leads us to consider
the possibility of a well-behaved, quasi-Hamiltonian notion of the BKS pairing
between $R(\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}})$ and $\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}'}$. We construct
such a pairing and study its properties. This is facilitated by the nice
geometric fearures of $R(\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}})\cap\Lambda_{\mathcal{C}'}$ and
a reformulation of the classical BKS pairing. Our work is perhaps the first
step towards a level-$k$ quantization of $D(G)$ via the enhanced symplectic
""category"".

Accepted by AAAI 2021 (Long Paper)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In document-level relation extraction (DocRE), graph structure is generally
used to encode relation information in the input document to classify the
relation category between each entity pair, and has greatly advanced the DocRE
task over the past several years. However, the learned graph representation
universally models relation information between all entity pairs regardless of
whether there are relationships between these entity pairs. Thus, those entity
pairs without relationships disperse the attention of the encoder-classifier
DocRE for ones with relationships, which may further hind the improvement of
DocRE. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel
encoder-classifier-reconstructor model for DocRE. The reconstructor manages to
reconstruct the ground-truth path dependencies from the graph representation,
to ensure that the proposed DocRE model pays more attention to encode entity
pairs with relationships in the training. Furthermore, the reconstructor is
regarded as a relationship indicator to assist relation classification in the
inference, which can further improve the performance of DocRE model.
Experimental results on a large-scale DocRE dataset show that the proposed
model can significantly improve the accuracy of relation extraction on a strong
heterogeneous graph-based baseline.

of the same category and its essential solution is to mine the subtle and
discriminative regions. Convolution neural networks (CNNs), which employ the
cross entropy loss (CE-loss) as the loss function, show poor performance since
the model can only learn the most discriminative part and ignore other
meaningful regions. Some existing works try to solve this problem by mining
more discriminative regions by some detection techniques or attention
mechanisms. However, most of them will meet the background noise problem when
trying to find more discriminative regions. In this paper, we address it in a
knowledge transfer learning manner. Multiple models are trained one by one, and
all previously trained models are regarded as teacher models to supervise the
training of the current one. Specifically, a orthogonal loss (OR-loss) is
proposed to encourage the network to find diverse and meaningful regions. In
addition, the first model is trained with only CE-Loss. Finally, all models'
outputs with complementary knowledge are combined together for the final
prediction result. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and

found that the oscillations affect eclipse timing measurements. Binary modeling
of the high-quality TESS data indicates that the eclipsing components of the
triple system are twin dwarfs with parameters of $M_2$/$M_1$ = 0.995,
$R_2$/$R_1$ = 0.901, and $\Delta$($T_{\rm eff,1}$--$T_{\rm eff,2}$) = 12 K in

0.054 may mostly come from a G-type tertiary companion. Our predicted parallax
of 1.52 $\pm$ 0.09 mas is concurrent with the Gaia measurement of 1.52 $\pm$
0.05 mas. Multifrequency analysis of the outside-eclipse residuals reveals 22
significant pulsation signals: four in the gravity-mode region (0.03$-$2.22
day$^{-1}$) and 18 in the pressure-mode region (9.19$-$25.12 day$^{-1}$). Of
the low frequencies, $f_{11}$ and $f_{14}$ are orbital harmonics that can be
identified as tidally excited modes. The pulsation periods and constants for
the high frequencies, and the position in the Cepheid instability strip
demonstrate that the pulsating component of IM Per is a $\delta$ Sct variable.

methods due to its significant effects on the quality of node embedding and
performance on downstream network analysis tasks. Most existing HOP definitions
are based on either homophily to place close and highly interconnected nodes
tightly in embedding space or heterophily to place distant but structurally
similar nodes together after embedding. In real-world networks, both can
co-exist, and thus considering only one could limit the prediction performance
and interpretability. However, there is no general and universal solution that
takes both into consideration. In this paper, we propose such a simple yet
powerful framework called homophily and heterophliy preserving network
transformation (H2NT) to capture HOP that flexibly unifies homophily and
heterophily. Specifically, H2NT utilises motif representations to transform a
network into a new network with a hybrid assumption via micro-level and
macro-level walk paths. H2NT can be used as an enhancer to be integrated with
any existing network embedding methods without requiring any changes to latter
methods. Because H2NT can sparsify networks with motif structures, it can also
improve the computational efficiency of existing network embedding methods when
integrated. We conduct experiments on node classification, structural role
classification and motif prediction to show the superior prediction performance
and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. In particular,
DeepWalk-based H2 NT achieves 24% improvement in terms of precision on motif
prediction, while reducing 46% computational time compared to the original
DeepWalk.

propose the BERT-PLI framework by modeling the Paragraph Level Interactions

demonstrate that the domain specific paragraph-level modelling does not appear

reproducibility study, we investigate BERT-PLI for document retrieval in the

improvements for patent document retrieval compared to the BM25 baseline.
Furthermore, we evaluate the BERT-PLI model for cross-domain retrieval between
the legal and patent domain on individual components, both on a paragraph and
document-level. We find that the transfer of the BERT-PLI model on the

one they were trained for. While it is still unclear how to overcome these
limitations, one can observe a paradigm shift within the machine learning
community, with research interests shifting away from increasing the
performance of highly parameterized models to exceedingly specific tasks, and
towards employing machine learning algorithms in highly diverse domains. This
research question can be approached from different angles. For instance, the
field of Informed AI investigates the problem of infusing domain knowledge into
a machine learning model, by using techniques such as regularization, data

rather than investigating how to provide domain-specific knowledge to machine

controlled actions do not operate directly on the system's degrees of freedom
(as in the case of active vibration control) but on the system's parameters,
i.e., mass, damping, or stiffness.
  Cyclic variations in the stiffness of a structural system have been addressed
in several previous studies as an effective semi-active vibration reduction
method. The proposed applications of this idea, denoted here as stiffness
modulation, range from stepwise stiffness variations on a simple spring-mass
system to continuous stiffness changes on rotor blades under aerodynamic loads.
  Semi-active systems are generally claimed to be energetically passive.
However, changes in stiffness directly affect the elastic potential energy of
the system and require external work under given conditions. In most cases,
such injection or extraction of energy (performed by the device in charge of
the stiffness variation and denoted as the pseudo-active effect) usually
coexists with the semi-active effect, which operates by redistributing the
potential energy within the system in such a way that it can be dissipated more
efficiently.
  This work focuses on the discrimination between these two effects, which is
absent in previous literature. A first study on their dependence on the process
parameters of stiffness modulation is presented here, with emphasis on the
spatial distribution of the stiffness changes. It is shown that localized
changes tend to result in a larger semi-active share of vibration attenuation,
whereas a spatially homogeneous stiffness modulation only generates a
pseudo-active effect.

the radial density profile $\zeta(y)$ is (for $\gamma\not=1$) $[\int_0^y \zeta
\bar y^2 d\bar y]^{1/2}=-yd(\zeta^{\gamma-1})/dy$. Or,
$\theta^n(y)=y^{-2}[(y\theta')^2]'$, where $\theta=\zeta^{\gamma-1}$, and
$n\equiv (\gamma-1)^{-1}$. I discuss properties of the solutions, contrasting
them with those of their Newtonian analogues -- the Lane-Emden polytropes. Due
to the stronger MOND gravity, all DML polytropes have a finite mass, and for
$n<\infty$ ($\gamma>1$) all have a finite radius. (Lane-Emden spheres have a
finite mass only for $n\le 5$.) I use the DML polytropes to study DML scaling
relations. For example, they satisfy a universal relation (for all
$\mathcal{K}$ and $\gamma$) between the total mass, $M$, and the mass-average
velocity dispersion $\sigma$: $MGa_0=(9/4)\sigma^4$. However, the relation
between $M$ and other measures of the velocity dispersion, such as the central,
projected one, $\bar\sigma$, does depend on $n$ (but not $\mathcal{K}$),
defining a `fundamental surface' in the $[M,~\bar\sigma,~n]$ space. I also
describe the generalization to anisotropic polytropes, which also all have a
finite radius (for $\gamma>1$), and all satisfy the above universal $M-\sigma$
relation. This more extended class of models exhibits the
central-surface-densities relation: a tight relation between the baryonic and
the dynamical central surface densities predicted by MOND.

robotics such as intelligent vehicles. Security of CNNs in robotics
applications is an important issue, for which potential adversarial attacks on
CNNs are worth research. Pooling is a typical step of dimension reduction and
information discarding in CNNs. Such information discarding may result in
mis-deletion and mis-preservation of data features which largely influence the
output of the network. This may aggravate the vulnerability of CNNs to
adversarial attacks. In this paper, we conduct adversarial attacks on CNNs from
the perspective of network structure by investigating and exploiting the
vulnerability of pooling. First, a novel adversarial attack methodology named
Strict Layer-Output Manipulation (SLOM) is proposed. Then an attack method
based on Strict Pooling Manipulation (SPM) which is an instantiation of the
SLOM spirit is designed to effectively realize both type I and type II
adversarial attacks on a target CNN. Performances of attacks based on SPM at
different depths are also investigated and compared. Moreover, performances of
attack methods designed by instantiating the SLOM spirit with different
operation layers of CNNs are compared. Experiment results reflect that pooling
tends to be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than other operations in
CNNs.

determined by whether a particular transfer function in the network can be
uniquely distinguished within a network model set, on the basis of data.
Whereas previous research has focused on the situations that all network
signals are either excited or measured, we develop generalized analysis results
for the situation of partial measurement and partial excitation. As
identifiability conditions typically require a sufficient number of external
excitation signals, this work introduces a novel network model structure such
that excitation from unmeasured noise signals is included, which leads to less
conservative identifiability conditions than relying on measured excitation
signals only. More importantly, graphical conditions are developed to verify
global and generic identifiability of a single module based on the topology of
the dynamic network. Depending on whether the input or the output of the module
can be measured, we present four identifiability conditions which cover all
possible situations in single module identification. These conditions further
lead to synthesis approaches for allocating excitation signals and selecting
measured signals, to warrant single module identifiability. In addition, if the
identifiability conditions are satisfied, indirect identification methods are
developed to provide a consistent estimate of the module. All the obtained
results are also extended to identifiability of multiple modules in the
network.

particle physics in which the precise localisation of kinematic edges, often
blurred by e.g.\ background contributions and detector effects, is crucial for
determining particle masses. We show that even for binned data, typical for
high energy physics, the optimal FIR filter kernel can be approximated by the
{\em first derivative of a Gaussian} (FDOG). We study two highly complementary
supersymmetric scenarios that, if realised in nature, could be observed at a
future high-energy $e^+e^-$ collider such as the International Linear Collider

production of $\tilde{e}^{\pm}-$pairs while the second focuses on the
$\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}$ and $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}$-pair production. We

A timing and spectral analysis of the ensemble of X-ray bursts reveals

the detection of a 386.5 Hz burst oscillation candidate. The latter is
especially notable, given that a previous study of this source claimed a 1122

it has now been decomposed into a triple system with a complex disk and outflow
geometry. We aim to measure the brightness of all three components of the T
Tauri system (T Tau N, T Tau Sa, T Tau Sb) in the mid-infrared in order to
obtain photometry around the $\sim 9.7~\mu m$ silicate feature. This allows us
to study their variability and to investigate the distribution of dust and the
geometry of circumstellar and circumbinary disks in this complex system. We
observe T Tauri with the VLT/VISIR-NEAR instrument. With kernel phase
interferometry post-processing of the data, and using the astrometric positions
of all three components from VLT/SPHERE, we measure the three components'
individual brightnesses (including the southern binary at an angular separation
down to $\sim 0.2~\lambda/D$) and obtain their photometry. In order to validate
our methods, we simulate and recover mock data of the T Tauri system using the
observed reference point-spread function of HD 27639. We find that T Tau N is
rather stable and shows weak silicate emission, while T Tau Sa is highly
variable and shows prominent silicate absorption. T Tau Sb became significantly
fainter compared to data from 2004 and 2006, suggesting increased extinction by
dust. The precision of our photometry is limited by systematic errors, which is
consistent with previous studies using kernel phase interferometry. Our results
confirm the complex scenario of misaligned disks in the T Tauri system that had
been observed previously, and they are in agreement with the recently observed
dimming of T Tau Sb in the near-infrared. Our mid-infrared photometry supports
the interpretation that T Tau Sb has moved behind the dense region of the Sa-Sb
circumbinary disk on its tight orbit around Sa, therefore suffering increased
extinction.

until today, considering a self-consistent interaction that incorporates the
back-reaction of the GW into the plasma. We use a relativistic causal
hydrodynamic framework with a positive entropy production based on a
Second-Order Theory (SOT) in which the viscous properties of the fluid are
effectively described by a new set of independent variables. We study how the
spin-2 modes typical of SOTs capture the simplest GW-fluid viscous interaction
to first order. We consider that all non-ideal properties of the primordial
plasma are due to an extra effectively massless self-interacting scalar field
whose state becomes a many-particles one after Reheating and for which an
effective fluid description is suitable. We numerically solve the evolution
equations and explicitly compute the current GW spectrum obtaining two
contributions. On the one hand we have the viscous evolution of the pGW: For
the collision-dominated regime the GW source becomes negligible while in the
collisionless limit there exists an absorption of the pGW energy due to the
damping effect produced by the free-streaming spin-2 modes of the fluid and
driven by the expansion of the Universe. The latter effect is characterized by
a relative amplitude decrease of about 1 to 10 \% with respect to the GW free
evolution spectrum. On the other hand we get the GW production due to the decay
of the initial spin-2 fluctuations of the fluid that is negligible compared
with the above-mentioned contribution.
  This SOT framework captures the same qualitative effects on the evolution of
GW coupled to matter reported in previous works in which a kinetic theory
approach has been used.

sensitivity is similar to that of other materials including Si, InGaAs, GaN,

short response time, which favors the rapid/high-sensitively detection. The
analysis on the mobility dependence of the response time revealed the same
detection regimes as the traditional semiconductor materials, i.e. the
non-resonant (collision dominated) regime, the resonant ballistic regime, and
the viscous regime. When the kinematic viscosity ({\nu}) is above a certain
critical viscosity value, {\nu}NR, the plasmonic FETs always operates in the
viscous non-resonant regime regardless of channel length (L). In this regime,
the response time rises monotonically with the increase of L. When {\nu} <
{\nu}NR, the plasmonic resonance can be reached in a certain range of L (i.e.
the resonant window). Within this window, the carrier transport is ballistic.
For a sufficiently short channel, the graphene devices would always operate in
the non-resonant regime regardless of the field-effect mobility, corresponding
to another viscous regime. The above work mapped the operating regimes of
graphene plasmonic FETs, and demonstrated the significance of the viscous
effects for the graphene plasmonic detection. These results could be used for
the extraction of the temperature dependences of viscosity in graphene.

strategies typically require high computational resources due to large circuit

quantum cloning (VQC), a quantum machine learning based cryptanalysis algorithm

vary the concentrations of CH$_4$ by several orders of magnitude. In a second

them to recent transit observations. Finally, we determine the observation time
required to detect spectral bands with low resolution spectroscopy using JWST

CH$_4$-rich atmospheres O$_2$ has strong chemical sinks, leading to low
concentrations of O$_2$ and O$_3$. The potential biosignatures NH$_3$, PH$_3$,
CH$_3$Cl and N$_2$O are less sensitive to the concentration of H$_2$, CO$_2$

asymmetry (TSSA) of inclusive $\pi^0$ at center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt s$) of
200 GeV and 500 GeV in transversely polarized proton-proton collisions in the
pseudo-rapidity region 2.7 to 4.0. The results at the two different energies
show a continuous increase of the TSSA with Feynman-$x$, and, when compared to
previous measurements, no dependence on $\sqrt s$ from 19.4 GeV to 500 GeV is
found. To investigate the underlying physics leading to this large TSSA,
different topologies have been studied. $\pi^0$ with no nearby particles tend
to have a higher TSSA than inclusive $\pi^0$. The TSSA for inclusive
electromagnetic jets, sensitive to the Sivers effect in the initial state, is
substantially smaller, but shows the same behavior as the inclusive $\pi^0$
asymmetry as a function of Feynman-$x$. To investigate final-state effects, the
Collins asymmetry of $\pi^0$ inside electromagnetic jets has been measured. The
Collins asymmetry is analyzed for its dependence on the $\pi^0$ momentum
transverse to the jet thrust axis and its dependence on the fraction of jet
energy carried by the $\pi^0$. The asymmetry was found to be small in each case
for both center-of-mass energies. All the measurements are compared to
QCD-based theoretical calculations for transverse-momentum-dependent parton
distribution functions and fragmentation functions. Some discrepancies are
found, which indicates new mechanisms might be involved.

  Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes","submitted for publication",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMT) like the Extremely Large
Telescope (ELT), currently under construction depend heavily on Adaptive Optics
(AO) systems to correct for atmospheric turbulence. To be able to correct wider
fields of view (FoV), Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems were
introduced, which use multiple guide stars to obtain an almost uniform
correction over the FoV. However, a residual blur remains in the astronmical
images due to the time delay stemming from the wavefront sensor (WFS)
integration time and temporal response of the deformable mirror(s) (DM). This
results in a blur which can be mathematically described by a convolution of the
true image with the point spread function (PSF). Due to the nature of the
atmosphere and its correction, the PSF is spatially varying.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm for MCAO PSF reconstruction adapted to
the needs of GSMTs in a storage efficient way. In particular, the PSF
reconstruction algorithm for Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) from [40]
is combined with an algorithm for atmospheric tomography from [33] to obtain a
direction dependent reconstruction of the post-AO PSF.
  Results obtained in an end-to-end simulation tool show qualitatively good
reconstruction of the PSF compared to the PSF calculated directly from the
simulated incoming wavefront. Furthermore, the used algorithm has a reasonable
runtime and memory consumption.

analysis problems that result in parameter identification in sparse exponential
sums $$f(k)=\sum_{j=1}^{T}c_{j}e^{-2\pi i\langle t_{j},k\rangle},\quad k\in
\mathbb{Z}^{d},$$ where the parameters are pairwise different $\{
t_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}\subset [0,1)^{d}$, and $\{ c_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}\subset
\mathbb{C}\setminus \{ 0\}$ are nonzero. The focus of our investigation is on a
Prony's method variant based on a multivariate matrix pencil approach. The
method constructs matrices $S_{1}$, \ldots , $S_{d}$ from the sampling values,
and their simultaneous diagonalization yields the parameters $\{
t_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}$. The parameters $\{ c_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}$ are computed as the
solution of an linear least squares problem, where the matrix of the problem is
determined by $\{ t_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}$. Since the method involves independent
generation and manipulation of certain number of matrices, there is intrinsic
capacity for parallelization of the whole computation process on several
levels. Hence, we propose parallel version of the Prony's method in order to
increase its efficiency. The tasks concerning generation of matrices is divided
among GPU's block of threads and CPU, where heavier load is put on the GPU.
From the algorithmic point of view, the CPU is dedicated to the more complex
tasks. With careful choice of algorithms solving the subtasks, the load between
CPU and GPU is balanced. Besides the parallelization techniques, we are also
concerned with some numerical issues, and we provide detailed numerical
analysis of the method in case of noisy input data. Finally, we performed a set
of numerical tests which confirm superior efficiency of the parallel algorithm
and consistency of the forward error with the results of numerical analysis.

faces the problem of confusion between the anterior and posterior parts of the
objects, caused by the feature similarity of such parts in typical objects in
traffic scenes such as cars and pedestrians. While difficult to solve, the
problem may lead to serious orientation estimation errors, and pose threats to
the upcoming decision making process of the ego vehicle, since the predicted
tracks of objects may have directions opposite to ground truths. In this paper,
we mitigate this problem by proposing a pretraining method. The method focuses
on predicting the left/right semicircle in which the orientation of the object
is located. The trained semicircle prediction model is then integrated into the
orientation angle estimation model which predicts a value in range $[0, \pi]$.
Experiment results show that the proposed semicircle prediction enhances the
accuracy of orientation estimation, and mitigates the problem stated above.
With the proposed method, a backbone achieves similar state-of-the-art
orientation estimation performance to existing approaches with well-designed
network structures.

perspective that gaussian blurring, a common technique of image preprocessing,
can be aggressive itself in specific occasions, thus exposing the network to
real-world adversarial attacks. We first propose an adversarial attack demo
named peak suppression (PS) by suppressing the values of peak elements in the
features of the data. Based on the blurring spirit of PS, we further apply
gaussian blurring to the data, to investigate the potential influence and
threats of gaussian blurring to performance of the network. Experiment results
show that PS and well-designed gaussian blurring can form adversarial attacks

With the strong physical significance and wide applications of gaussian

remains a grand challenge in swarm robotics. To solve this challenge, we
investigate a behaviour adaptation approach, where one searches an archive of
controllers for potential recovery solutions. To apply behaviour adaptation in
swarm robotic systems, we propose two algorithms: (i) Swarm Map-based
Optimisation (SMBO), which selects and evaluates one controller at a time, for
a homogeneous swarm, in a centralised fashion; and (ii) Swarm Map-based
Optimisation Decentralised (SMBO-Dec), which performs an asynchronous
batch-based Bayesian optimisation to simultaneously explore different
controllers for groups of robots in the swarm. We set up foraging experiments
with a variety of disturbances: injected faults to proximity sensors, ground
sensors, and the actuators of individual robots, with 100 unique combinations
for each type. We also investigate disturbances in the operating environment of
the swarm, where the swarm has to adapt to drastic changes in the number of
resources available in the environment, and to one of the robots behaving
disruptively towards the rest of the swarm, with 30 unique conditions for each
such perturbation. The viability of SMBO and SMBO-Dec is demonstrated,
comparing favourably to variants of random search and gradient descent, and
various ablations, and improving performance up to 80% compared to the
performance at the time of fault injection within at most 30 evaluations.

quasi-2-D structure reduces the degrees of freedom available to tailor their
radiation pattern. To overcome this limitation, a possible solution consists in
etching on a grounded substrate two concentric radiating elements and combining
two modes (one for each element) with proper amplitude/phase relations.
Although this technique leads, in principle, to an infinite number of possible
configurations (i.e., each patch element can support an infinite number of
modes), the theoretical and experimental verifications available in the
literature are limited to the first two radiating modes (TM 11 and TM 21 ) of a
circular patch antenna. Recently, we have shown that the design of this
circular patch can be effectively performed by exploiting the topological
properties of vortex fields and, in particular, by controlling the phase
singularity exhibited by the higher order right-handed circularly polarized
(RHCP) TM 21 mode of the circular patch. Since the number of RHCP higher order
modes of a circular patch is infinite, we can in principle deal with an
arbitrary number of phase singularity points, whose combined control leads to
unprecedented possibilities to shape the radiation pattern of a circular patch.
In this article, we present a complete design tool to determine the number and
position of phase singularity points arising when combining the RHCP modes of a
circular patch antenna and, eventually, manipulate them to synthesize the
required radiation pattern. As a realistic application example, we show how the
proposed tool can be used to effectively design a single antenna whose
radiation pattern can be properly tailored to switch between two different

of the countries around the world. The whole world is trying to overcome this
pandemic situation. A better health care quality may help a country to tackle
the pandemic. Making clusters of countries with similar types of health care
quality provides an insight into the quality of health care in different
countries. In the area of machine learning and data science, the K-means
clustering algorithm is typically used to create clusters based on similarity.
In this paper, we propose an efficient K-means clustering method that
determines the initial centroids of the clusters efficiently. Based on this
proposed method, we have determined health care quality clusters of countries
utilizing the COVID-19 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed
method reduces the number of iterations and execution time to analyze COVID-19
while comparing with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm.

sixth-generation (6G) communications have attracted much attention from both
the industry and the academia. Compared with 5G, 6G will have a wider frequency
band, higher transmission rate, spectrum efficiency, greater connection
capacity, shorter delay, broader coverage, and more robust anti-interference
capability to satisfy various network requirements. This survey presents an
insightful understanding of 6G wireless communications by introducing
requirements, features, critical technologies, challenges, and applications.
First, we give an overview of 6G from perspectives of technologies, security
and privacy, and applications. Subsequently, we introduce various 6G
technologies and their existing challenges in detail, e.g., artificial
intelligence (AI), intelligent surfaces, THz, space-air-ground-sea integrated
network, cell-free massive MIMO, etc. Because of these technologies, 6G is
expected to outperform existing wireless communication systems regarding the
transmission rate, latency, global coverage, etc. Next, we discuss security and
privacy techniques that can be applied to protect data in 6G. Since edge
devices are expected to gain popularity soon, the vast amount of generated data
and frequent data exchange make the leakage of data easily. Finally, we predict
real-world applications built on the technologies and features of 6G; for
example, smart healthcare, smart city, and smart manufacturing will be
implemented by taking advantage of AI.

We prove

numerically, confirming its validity. Using standard techniques from the study
of dynamical systems, as for example the Lyapunov characteristic exponents, we
investigate the chaotic dynamics of the plasma and show numerically its
existence for a wide range of parameter values. Finally, we illustrate how
chaotic dynamics organizes in the parameter space for fixed values of the
initial conditions, as the Mach number and the quantum diffraction parameter
are continuously varied.

COVID-19 so combative resources can be effectively allocated and prioritized
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditionally, community prevalence has been
assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the
increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been
met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method
for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by
the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different
spatial, temporal, and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the
spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms
surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess
community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability.
Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method
predicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive for
COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative
Error (MRE) of 60.40\% with 95\% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This
implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than the original in a
population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage
of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported
symptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15
(MRE of 23.61\% with 95\% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York. We
present an analysis of these results, exposing various clinical attributes of
interest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze how
various policy enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19
in a community.

Here, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK
airports between 2018 and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean
delay and extreme events among airlines and airports, identifying a power-law
decay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes in plane delay
