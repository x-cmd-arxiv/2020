  Affinity Prediction",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Accurately predicting the binding affinity between drugs and proteins is an
essential step for computational drug discovery. Since graph neural networks
(GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various graph-related tasks,
GNNs have been considered as a promising tool to improve the binding affinity
prediction in recent years. However, most of the existing GNN architectures can
only encode the topological graph structure of drugs and proteins without
considering the relative spatial information among their atoms. Whereas,
different from other graph datasets such as social networks and commonsense
knowledge graphs, the relative spatial position and chemical bonds among atoms
have significant impacts on the binding affinity. To this end, in this paper,
we propose a diStance-aware Molecule graph Attention Network (S-MAN) tailored
to drug-target binding affinity prediction. As a dedicated solution, we first
propose a position encoding mechanism to integrate the topological structure
and spatial position information into the constructed pocket-ligand graph.
Moreover, we propose a novel edge-node hierarchical attentive aggregation
structure which has edge-level aggregation and node-level aggregation. The
hierarchical attentive aggregation can capture spatial dependencies among
atoms, as well as fuse the position-enhanced information with the capability of
discriminating multiple spatial relations among atoms. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on two standard datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness
of S-MAN.

Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all
connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not
leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the
graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We
introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard
model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood
connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is
represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the
sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer
normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster
training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is
extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a.
chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge
graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance
of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap
between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of
line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As
our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black
box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.

maps carefully collected in RainNet cover various meteorological phenomena
(e.g., hurricane, squall), which is of great help to improve the model
generalization ability. In addition, the map pairs in RainNet are organized in
the form of image sequences ($720$ maps per month or 1 map/hour), showing
complex physical properties, e.g., temporal misalignment, temporal sparse, and
fluid properties. Furthermore, two deep-learning-oriented metrics are
specifically introduced to evaluate or verify the comprehensive performance of

paper, we propose a model that uses the spontaneous breaking of scale
invariance in the scalar sector as a unified origin for dynamical generation of
both scales. Using the Gildener-Weinberg approximation, only one scalar
acquires a vacuum expectation value of $v_S \sim (10^{16-17})\,\mathrm{GeV}$,

$\mu_H$ via the neutrino option with right handed neutrino masses $m_N = y_M

mass with the inclusion of a type-I seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, we adopt an
unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry and a $Z_2$-odd set of right-handed Majorana neutrinos
$\chi$ that do not take part in the neutrino option and are able to produce the
correct dark matter relic abundance (dominantly) via inflaton decay. The model

mission in Sectors 1 to 5. Our sample consists of 25 pulsators: ten fundamental
mode, three overtone and two double-mode classical Cepheids, plus three Type II
and seven anomalous Cepheids. The targets were chosen from fields with
different stellar densities, both from the Galactic field and from the
Magellanic System. Three targets have 2-minute cadence light curves available
by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center: for the rest, we prepared
custom light curves from the full-frame images with our own differential
photometric FITSH pipeline. Our main goal was to explore the potential and the
limitations of TESS concerning the various subtypes of Cepheids. We detected
many low amplitude features: weak modulation, period jitter, and timing
variations due to light-time effect. We also report signs of non-radial modes
and the first discovery of such a mode in an anomalous Cepheid, the overtone
star XZ Cet, which we then confirmed with ground-based multicolor photometric
measurements. We prepared a custom photometric solution to minimize saturation
effects in the bright fundamental-mode classical Cepheid, $\beta$ Dor with the
lightkurve software, and we revealed strong evidence of cycle-to-cycle
variations in the star. In several cases, however, fluctuations in the
pulsation could not be distinguished from instrumental effects, such as
contamination from nearby sources which also varies between sectors. Finally,
we discuss how precise light curve shapes will be crucial not only for
classification purposes but also to determine physical properties of these
stars.

prominent challenges in cheminformatics today. As a result, generative and
evolutionary inverse designs from the field of artificial intelligence have
emerged at a rapid pace, with aims to optimize molecules for a particular
chemical property. These models 'indirectly' explore the chemical space; by
learning latent spaces, policies, distributions or by applying mutations on
populations of molecules. However, the recent development of the SELFIES string
representation of molecules, a surjective alternative to SMILES, have made
possible other potential techniques. Based on SELFIES, we therefore propose
PASITHEA, a direct gradient-based molecule optimization that applies
inceptionism techniques from computer vision. PASITHEA exploits the use of
gradients by directly reversing the learning process of a neural network, which
is trained to predict real-valued chemical properties. Effectively, this forms
an inverse regression model, which is capable of generating molecular variants
optimized for a certain property. Although our results are preliminary, we
observe a shift in distribution of a chosen property during inverse-training, a
clear indication of PASITHEA's viability. A striking property of inceptionism
is that we can directly probe the model's understanding of the chemical space
it was trained on. We expect that extending PASITHEA to larger datasets,
molecules and more complex properties will lead to advances in the design of
new functional molecules as well as the interpretation and explanation of
machine learning models.

label $y$ of example $x$ is generated from the target halfspace corrupted by a
Massart adversary with flipping probability $\eta(x) \leq \eta \leq 1/2$, the
goal is to compute a hypothesis with small misclassification error. The best
known $\mathrm{poly}(d, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithms for this problem achieve
error of $\eta+\epsilon$, which can be far from the optimal bound of
$\mathrm{OPT}+\epsilon$, where $\mathrm{OPT} = \mathbf{E}_{x \sim D_x}

super-polynomial time in the Statistical Query model, a large gap remains
between known upper and lower bounds.
  In this work, we essentially characterize the efficient learnability of
Massart halfspaces in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Specifically, we show
that no efficient SQ algorithm for learning Massart halfspaces on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ can achieve error better than $\Omega(\eta)$, even if
$\mathrm{OPT} = 2^{-\log^{c} (d)}$, for any universal constant $c \in (0, 1)$.
Furthermore, when the noise upper bound $\eta$ is close to $1/2$, our error
lower bound becomes $\eta - o_{\eta}(1)$, where the $o_{\eta}(1)$ term goes to
$0$ when $\eta$ approaches $1/2$. Our results provide strong evidence that
known learning algorithms for Massart halfspaces are nearly best possible,
thereby resolving a longstanding open problem in learning theory.

hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals interactions, or conformational sampling. We
present a Free energy Machine Learning (FML) model applicable throughout
chemical compound space and based on a representation that employs Boltzmann
averages to account for an approximated sampling of configurational space.
Using the FreeSolv database, FML's out-of-sample prediction errors of
experimental hydration free energies decay systematically with training set
size, and experimental uncertainty (0.6 kcal/mol) is reached after training on
490 molecules (80\% of FreeSolv). Corresponding FML model errors are also on
par with state-of-the art physics based approaches. To generate the input
representation for a new query compound, FML requires approximate and short
molecular dynamics runs. We showcase its usefulness through analysis of FML
solvation free energies for 116k organic molecules (all force-field compatible
molecules in QM9 database) identifying the most and least solvated systems, and
rediscovering quasi-linear structure property relationships in terms of simple
descriptors such as hydrogen-bond donors, number of NH or OH groups, number of
oxygen atoms in hydrocarbons, and number of heavy atoms. FML's accuracy is
maximal when the temperature used for the molecular dynamics simulation to
generate averaged input representation samples in training is the same as for
the query compounds. The sampling time for the representation converges rapidly
with respect to the prediction error.

that, apart when $\mu$ is a Dirac mass and the error vanishes, the order is not
larger than $1$ and give a sufficient condition for the order to be equal to

checking that for the order to lie in the interval $\left(1/\rho,1\right)$, the
support has to be bounded and by stating a necessary and sufficient condition
in terms of the tails of $\mu$ for the order to be equal to some given value in
the interval $\left(0,1/\rho\right)$, thus precising the sufficient condition

active galactic nuclei remains elusive. Magnetospheric processes, occurring in
the close vicinity of the central black hole, could account for these flares.
  Aims: We aim to bridge the gap between simulations and observations by
synthesizing gamma-ray lightcurves in order to characterize the activity of a
black-hole magnetosphere, using kinetic simulations.
  Methods: We perform global axisymmetric two-dimensional general-relativistic
particle-in-cell simulations of a Kerr black-hole magnetosphere. We include a
self-consistent treatment of radiative processes and plasma supply, as well as
a realistic magnetic configuration, with a large-scale equatorial current
sheet. We couple our particle-in-cell code with a ray-tracing algorithm, in
order to produce synthetic lightcurves.
  Results: These simulations show a highly dynamic magnetosphere, as well as
very efficient dissipation of the magnetic energy. An external supply of
magnetic flux is found to maintain the magnetosphere in a dynamic state,
otherwise the magnetosphere settles in a quasi-steady Wald-like configuration.
The dissipated energy is mostly converted to gamma-ray photons. The lightcurves
at low viewing angle (face-on) mainly trace the spark gap activity and exhibit
high variability. On the other hand, no significant variability is found at
high viewing angle (edge-on), where the main contribution comes from the
reconnecting current sheet.
  Conclusions: We observe that black-hole magnetospheres with a current sheet
are characterized by a very high radiative efficiency. The typical amplitude of
the flares in our simulations is lower than what is detected in active galactic
nuclei. Such flares could result from the variation of parameters external to
the black hole

simultaneous formation of stretched I-substitutional Pb bonds (and thus Pb-I-Pb

Direct and indirect experimental evidences for the presence of interfacial
metallic states are provided, and a non-conventional defect-passivating nature
of the strained interdigitated perovskite/ETL interface is emphasized. It is
experimentally demonstrated that the PbO capping method is generally applicable
to other ETL materials including ZnO and SrTiO$_3$, and that the zipper-like
interdigitated metallic interface leads to about two-fold increase in charge
extraction rate. Finally, in terms of the photovoltaic efficiency, we observe a

  Using Artificial Intelligence",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The optic nerve head (ONH) typically experiences complex neural- and
connective-tissue structural changes with the development and progression of
glaucoma, and monitoring these changes could be critical for improved diagnosis
and prognosis in the glaucoma clinic. The gold-standard technique to assess
structural changes of the ONH clinically is optical coherence tomography (OCT).
However, OCT is limited to the measurement of a few hand-engineered parameters,
such as the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and has not yet
been qualified as a stand-alone device for glaucoma diagnosis and prognosis
applications. We argue this is because the vast amount of information available
in a 3D OCT scan of the ONH has not been fully exploited. In this study we
propose a deep learning approach that can: \textbf{(1)} fully exploit
information from an OCT scan of the ONH; \textbf{(2)} describe the structural
phenotype of the glaucomatous ONH; and that can \textbf{(3)} be used as a
robust glaucoma diagnosis tool. Specifically, the structural features
identified by our algorithm were found to be related to clinical observations
of glaucoma. The diagnostic accuracy from these structural features was $92.0
\pm 2.3 \%$ with a sensitivity of $90.0 \pm 2.4 \% $ (at $95 \%$ specificity).
By changing their magnitudes in steps, we were able to reveal how the
morphology of the ONH changes as one transitions from a `non-glaucoma' to a
`glaucoma' condition. We believe our work may have strong clinical implication
for our understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis, and could be improved in the
future to also predict future loss of vision.

reaction forces and scapular kinematics for rotator cuff tears of different
tendons with and without a reverse prosthesis. Available motion capture data
during anterior flexion was input to a finite-element musculoskeletal shoulder
model, and muscle activations were computed using inverse dynamics. The model
was validated with respect to in-vivo glenohumeral joint reaction force (JRF)
measurements, and also compared to existing clinical and biomechanical data.
Simulations were carried out for the intact joint as well as for various
tendons involved in a rotator cuff tear: superior (supraspinatus),
superior-anterior (supraspinatus and subscapularis), and superior-posterior
(supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor). Each rotator cuff tear
condition was repeated after shifting the humerus and the glenohumeral joint
center of rotation to simulate the effect of a reverse prosthesis. Changes in
compressive, shear, and total JRF were analysed, along with scapular upward
rotation. The model compared favourably to in-vivo measurements, and existing
clinical and biomechanical knowledge. Simulated JRF lie in the ranges of
in-vivo JRF measurements and shows a linear increase past 90 degree flexion.
Implanting a reverse prosthesis with a functional rotator cuff or with an
isolated supraspinatus tear led to over 2 times higher compressive force
component than with massive rotator cuff tears (superior-anterior or
superior-posterior). Such higher compression forces might increase the risk of
wear and implant fracture.

simulations to study the interplay between the modification of the molecular

AAs are surface-active compounds with a complex hydrophilic head and three
hydrophobic tails whose structural rigidity is enhanced with the attachement of
a simple aromatic group. We observe that the aromatic group can positively or
negatively affect the performance of the AAs, depending on its location along

  population statistics","37 pages, 7 figures, extended abstract accepted for NTTS 2021",,,,"stat.ME cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper aims to give an overview of various approaches to statistical
disclosure control based on random noise that are currently being discussed for
official population statistics and censuses. A particular focus is on a
stringent delineation between different concepts influencing the discussion: we
separate clearly between risk measures, noise distributions and output
mechanisms - putting these concepts into scope and into relation with each
other.
  After recapitulating differential privacy as a risk measure, the paper also
remarks on utility and risk aspects of some specific output mechanisms and
parameter setups, with special attention on static outputs that are rather
typical in official population statistics. In particular, it is argued that
unbounded noise distributions, such as plain Laplace, may jeopardise key unique
census features without a clear need from a risk perspective. On the other
hand, bounded noise distributions, such as the truncated Laplace or the cell
key method, can be set up to keep unique census features while controlling
disclosure risks in census-like outputs.
  Finally, the paper analyses some typical attack scenarios to constrain
generic noise parameter ranges that suggest a good risk/utility compromise for
the 2021 EU census output scenario. The analysis also shows that strictly
differentially private mechanisms would be severely constrained in this
scenario.

provide an algorithm that does not need such an exhaustive search, and show
that the best possible bounds can be obtained propagating complex pairs only

the convex hull is always tightly inscribed in the respective rigorous bounding

additional basis elements such as exponentials and logarithms. Alternative
summation methods can then be used to ""resum"" series to obtain more efficient
approximations, and have been successfully widely applied in the study of
continuous linear and nonlinear, single and multidimensional problems. In
particular, a method known as transasymptotic resummation can be used to
describe continuous behaviour occurring on multiple scales without the need for
asymptotic matching. Here we apply transasymptotic resummation to discrete
systems and show that it may be used to naturally and efficiently describe
discrete delayed bifurcations, or ""canards"", in singularly-perturbed variants
of the logistic map which contain delayed period-doubling bifurcations. We use
transasymptotic resummation to approximate the solutions, and describe the
behaviour of the solution across the bifurcations. This approach has two
significant advantages: it may be applied in systematic fashion even across
multiple bifurcations, and the exponential multipliers encode information about
the bifurcations that are used to explain effects seen in the solution
behaviour.

pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model. We show that the evolution strength is
similar to literature values up to $z\sim 1.6$. Beyond $z\sim 2$, we find that
the SFG RLF exhibits a negative evolution ($L^*$ moves to lower luminosities)
due to the decrease in low stellar-mass sources in our stellar mass-limited
sample at high redshifts. From the RLF for SFGs, we determine the evolution in
the cosmic star-formation-rate density (SFRD), which we find to be consistent
with the established behaviour up to $z\sim 1$. Beyond $z\sim 1$ cosmic SFRD
declines if one assumes an evolving infrared--radio correlation (IRRC), whereas
it stays relatively higher if one adopts a constant IRRC. We find that the form
of the relation between radio luminosity and SFR is therefore crucial in
measuring the cosmic SFRD from radio data. We investigate the effects of
stellar mass on the total RLF by splitting our sample into low ($10^{8.5} \leq

(DP) to turbulence onset/decay in wall-bounded flows, we propose a minimal
stochastic model dedicated to the interpretation of the spatially intermittent
regimes observed in channel flow before its return to laminar flow. Numerical
simulations show that a regime with bands obliquely drifting in two stream-wise
symmetrical directions bifurcates into an asymmetrical regime, before
ultimately decaying to laminar flow. The model is expressed in terms of a
probabilistic cellular automaton evolving von Neumann neighbourhoods with
probabilities educed from a close examination of simulation results. It
implements band propagation and the two main local processes: longitudinal
splitting involving bands with the same orientation, and transversal splitting
giving birth to a daughter band with orientation opposite to that of its
mother. The ultimate decay stage observed to display one-dimensional DP
properties in a two-dimensional geometry is interpreted as resulting from the
irrelevance of lateral spreading in the single-orientation regime. The model
also reproduces the bifurcation restoring the symmetry upon variation of the
probability attached to transversal splitting, which opens the way to a study
of the critical properties of that bifurcation, in analogy with thermodynamic
phase transitions.

We consider two setups where a drive creates population inversion in the bare

due to higher-order processes in a driven two-level atom. In all cases, the end
of the waveguide acts as a mirror for the light. We find that this enhances the
amplification in two ways compared to the same setups in an open waveguide.
Firstly, the mirror forces all output from the atom to travel in one direction
instead of being split up into two output channels. Secondly, interference due
to the mirror enables tuning of the ratio of relaxation rates for different
transitions in the atom to increase population inversion. We quantify the
enhancement in amplification due to these factors and show that it can be

Here, we show that states of MIPS coexistence are in fact only metastable for
three-dimensional active Brownian particles over a very broad range of

active crystallization. At an activity just above the MIPS critical point, the
liquid-gas binodal is superseded by the crystal-fluid coexistence curve, with
solid, liquid, and gas all coexisting at the triple point where the two curves
intersect. Nucleating an active crystal from a disordered fluid, however,
requires a rare fluctuation that exhibits the nearly close-packed density of
the solid phase. The corresponding barrier to crystallization is surmountable
on a feasible timescale only at high activity, and only at fluid densities near
maximal packing. The glassiness expected for such dense liquids at equilibrium
is strongly mitigated by active forces, so that the lifetime of liquid-gas
coexistence declines steadily with increasing activity, manifesting in
simulations as a facile spontaneous crystallization at extremely high activity.

we explicitly account for robot motion and sensing uncertainties while

  application to $\alpha$-CrOOH(D)","8 pages",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Triangular lattice quantum antiferromagnet has recently emerged to be a
promising playground for realizing Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) -- a class of
highly entangled quantum phases hosting emergent gauge fields and gapless Dirac
fermions. While previous theories and experiments focused mainly on $S=1/2$
spin systems, more recently signals of a DSL were detected in an $S=3/2$ system
$\alpha$-CrOOH(D). In this work we develop a theory of DSLs on triangular
lattice with spin-$S$ moments. We argue that in the most natural scenario, a
spin-$S$ system realizes a $U(2S)$ DSL, described at low energy by gapless
Dirac fermions coupled with an emergent $U(2S)$ gauge field (also known as
$U(2S)$ QCD$_3$). An appealing feature of this scenario is that at sufficiently
large $S$, the $U(2S)$ QCD becomes intrinsically unstable toward spontaneous
symmetry breaking and confinement. The confined phase is simply the
$120^{\circ}$ coplanar magnetic order, which agrees with semiclassical
(large-$S$) results on simple Heisenberg-like models. Other scenarios are
nevertheless possible, especially at small $S$ when quantum fluctuations are
strong. For $S=3/2$, we argue that a $U(1)$ DSL is also theoretically possible
and phenomenologically compatible with existing measurements. One way to
distinguish the $U(3)$ DSL from the $U(1)$ DSL is to break time-reversal
symmetry, for example by adding a spin chirality term
$\vec{S}_i\cdot(\vec{S}_j\times\vec{S}_k)$ in numerical simulations: the $U(1)$
DSL becomes the standard Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid with
semion/anti-semion excitation; the $U(3)$ DSL, in contrast, becomes a
non-abelian chiral spin liquid described by the $SU(2)_3$ topological order,
with Fibonacci-like anyons.

distinct $P_i$ and $P_j$ have neither common vertices nor adjacent vertices
(except perhaps their end-vertices). The Induced Disjoint Paths problem is to
decide if a graph $G$ with $k$ pairs of specified vertices $(s_i,t_i)$ contains
$k$ mutually induced paths $P_i$ such that each $P_i$ connects $s_i$ and $t_i$.
This is a classical graph problem that is NP-complete even for $k=2$. We study
it for AT-free graphs.
  Unlike its subclasses of permutation graphs and cocomparability graphs, the
class of AT-free graphs has no geometric intersection model. However, by a new,
structural analysis of the behaviour of Induced Disjoint Paths for AT-free
graphs, we prove that it can be solved in polynomial time for AT-free graphs
even when $k$ is part of the input. This is in contrast to the situation for
other well-known graph classes, such as planar graphs, claw-free graphs, or
more recently, (theta,wheel)-free graphs, for which such a result only holds if
$k$ is fixed.
  As a consequence of our main result, the problem of deciding if a given
AT-free graph contains a fixed graph $H$ as an induced topological minor admits
a polynomial-time algorithm. In addition, we show that such an algorithm is
essentially optimal by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard with parameter
$|V_H|$, even on a subclass of AT-free graph, namely cobipartite graphs. We
also show that the problems $k$-in-a-Path and $k$-in-a-Tree are polynomial-time
solvable on AT-free graphs even if $k$ is part of the input. These problems are
to test if a graph has an induced path or induced tree, respectively, spanning
$k$ given vertices.

single model using knowledge distillation. We consider the challenging case
where the ensemble is simply an average of the outputs of a few independently
trained neural networks with the SAME architecture, trained using the SAME
algorithm on the SAME data set, and they only differ by the random seeds used
in the initialization.
  We show that ensemble/knowledge distillation in Deep Learning works very
differently from traditional learning theory (such as boosting or NTKs, neural
tangent kernels). To properly understand them, we develop a theory showing that
when data has a structure we refer to as ``multi-view'', then ensemble of
independently trained neural networks can provably improve test accuracy, and
such superior test accuracy can also be provably distilled into a single model
by training a single model to match the output of the ensemble instead of the
true label. Our result sheds light on how ensemble works in deep learning in a
way that is completely different from traditional theorems, and how the ``dark
knowledge'' is hidden in the outputs of the ensemble and can be used in
distillation. In the end, we prove that self-distillation can also be viewed as
implicitly combining ensemble and knowledge distillation to improve test
accuracy.

warnings of flood or drought risk in a changing climate. However, to make
trust-worthy predictions of precipitation, at a local scale, is one of the most
difficult challenges for today's weather and climate models. This is because
important features, such as individual clouds and high-resolution topography,
cannot be resolved explicitly within simulations due to the significant
computational cost of high-resolution simulations. Climate models are typically
run at $\sim$50-100 km resolution which is insufficient to represent local
precipitation events in satisfying detail. Here, we develop a method to make
probabilistic precipitation predictions based on features that climate models
can resolve well and that is not highly sensitive to the approximations used in
individual models. To predict, we will use a temporal compound Poisson
distribution dependent on the output of climate models at a location. We use
the output of Earth System models at coarse resolution $\sim$50 km as input and
train the statistical models towards precipitation observations over Wales at
$\sim$10 km resolution. A Bayesian inferential scheme is provided so that the
compound-Poisson model can be inferred using a
Gibbs-within-Metropolis-Elliptic-Slice sampling scheme which enables us to
quantify the uncertainty of our predictions. In addition, we use a Gaussian
process regressor on the posterior samples of the model parameters, to infer a
spatially coherent model and hence to produce spatially coherent rainfall
prediction. We illustrate the prediction performance of our model by training

objective of artificial intelligence. Developmental approaches argue that this

agents that can learn to represent, generate, select and solve their own

deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods has been leading to the emergence of a
new field: $developmental$ $reinforcement$ $learning$. Developmental RL is
concerned with the use of deep RL algorithms to tackle a developmental problem

Chong, Costin Iancu","QGo: Scalable Quantum Circuit Optimization Using Automated Synthesis",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The current phase of quantum computing is in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) era. On NISQ devices, two-qubit gates such as CNOTs are much
noisier than single-qubit gates, so it is essential to minimize their count.
Quantum circuit synthesis is a process of decomposing an arbitrary unitary into
a sequence of quantum gates, and can be used as an optimization tool to produce
shorter circuits to improve overall circuit fidelity. However, the
time-to-solution of synthesis grows exponentially with the number of qubits. As
a result, synthesis is intractable for circuits on a large qubit scale.
  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical, block-by-block optimization
framework, QGo, for quantum circuit optimization. Our approach allows an
exponential cost optimization to scale to large circuits. QGo uses a
combination of partitioning and synthesis: 1) partition the circuit into a
sequence of independent circuit blocks; 2) re-generate and optimize each block
using quantum synthesis; and 3) re-compose the final circuit by stitching all
the blocks together. We perform our analysis and show the fidelity improvements
in three different regimes: small-size circuits on real devices, medium-size
circuits on noise simulations, and large-size circuits on analytical models.
Using a set of NISQ benchmarks, we show that QGo can reduce the number of CNOT
gates by 29.9% on average and up to 50% when compared with industrial compilers
such as t|ket>. When executed on the IBM Athens system, shorter depth leads to
higher circuit fidelity. We also demonstrate the scalability of our QGo
technique to optimize circuits of 60+ qubits. Our technique is the first
demonstration of successfully employing and scaling synthesis in the
compilation toolchain for large circuits. Overall, our approach is robust for
direct incorporation in production compiler toolchains.

of information. The rich variety of appearance and interactions between humans
depicted over a large temporal context in these films could be a valuable
source of data. However, the richness of data comes at the expense of
fundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors
with heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing human 3D
understanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with an
insight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between
frames, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to
handle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that
provide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a
multi-shot optimization framework, which leads to improved 3D reconstruction
and mining of long sequences with pseudo ground truth 3D human mesh. We show
that the resulting data is beneficial in the training of various human mesh
recovery models: for single image, we achieve improved robustness; for video we
propose a pure transformer-based temporal encoder, which can naturally handle
missing observations due to shot changes in the input frames. We demonstrate
the importance of the insight and proposed models through extensive

data movement and low arithmetic intensity. Moreover, existing NN accelerators
mainly focus on optimizing convolutional or recurrent models, and cannot
efficiently support attention. In this paper, we present SpAtten, an efficient
algorithm-architecture co-design that leverages token sparsity, head sparsity,
and quantization opportunities to reduce the attention computation and memory

novel cascade token pruning to prune away unimportant tokens in the sentence.
We also propose cascade head pruning to remove unessential heads. Cascade
pruning is fundamentally different from weight pruning since there is no
trainable weight in the attention mechanism, and the pruned tokens and heads
are selected on the fly. To efficiently support them on hardware, we design a
novel top-k engine to rank token and head importance scores with high
throughput. Furthermore, we propose progressive quantization that first fetches
MSBs only and performs the computation; if the confidence is low, it fetches

Matrix Product States (SIMPS) algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 017201 (2017)].
The non-interacting GAA model is a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model with a
self-duality-induced mobility edge. To search for a many-body mobility edge in
the interacting case, we exploit the advantages of SIMPS that it targets
many-body states in an energy-resolved fashion and does not require all
many-body states to be localized for some to converge. Our analysis indicates
that the targeted states in the presence of the single-particle mobility edge
match neither `MBL-like' fully-converged localized states nor the fully
delocalized case where SIMPS fails to converge. We benchmark the algorithm's
output both for parameters that give fully converged, `MBL-like' localized
states and for delocalized parameters where SIMPS fails to converge. In the
intermediate cases, where the parameters produce a single-particle mobility
edge, we find many-body states that develop entropy oscillations as a function
of cut position at larger bond dimensions. These oscillations at larger bond
dimensions, which are also found in the fully-localized benchmark but not the
fully-delocalized benchmark, occur both at the band edge and center and may
indicate convergence to a non-thermal state (either localized or critical).

novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be

approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D

extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle
occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods

way to boost object detection performance in aerial images. While various
neural network representations have been developed, previous works are still
inefficient to investigate the noise-resilient performance, especially on
aerial images with noise taken by the cameras with telephoto lenses, and most
of the research is concentrated in the field of denoising. Of course, denoising
usually requires an additional computational burden to obtain higher quality
images, while noise-resilient is more of a description of the robustness of the
network itself to different noises, which is an attribute of the algorithm
itself. For this reason, the work will be started by analyzing the
noise-resilient performance of the neural network, and then propose two
hypotheses to build a noise-resilient structure. Based on these hypotheses, we
compare the noise-resilient ability of the Oct-ResNet with frequency division
processing and the commonly used ResNet. In addition, previous feature pyramid
networks used for aerial object detection tasks are not specifically designed
for the frequency division feature maps of the Oct-ResNet, and they usually
lack attention to bridging the semantic gap between diverse feature maps from
different depths. On the basis of this, a novel octave convolution-based
semantic attention feature pyramid network (OcSaFPN) is proposed to get higher
accuracy in object detection with noise. The proposed algorithm tested on three
datasets demonstrates that the proposed OcSaFPN achieves a state-of-the-art
detection performance with Gaussian noise or multiplicative noise. In addition,
more experiments have proved that the OcSaFPN structure can be easily added to
existing algorithms, and the noise-resilient ability can be effectively
improved.

examples of complex star-formation histories may yet be hidden within existing

to be a rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarf (WD), but it has never been

spin-down of the WD generates pulsed synchrotron radiation that far outshines
the WD's photosphere. As a result, a previous study of AR Sco was unable to
detect the WD in the averaged far-ultraviolet spectrum from a Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) observation. In an effort to unveil the WD's spectrum, we
reanalyze these HST observations by calculating the average spectrum in the
troughs between synchrotron pulses. We identify weak spectral features from the
previously unseen WD and estimate its surface temperature to be 11500$\pm$500K.
Additionally, during the synchrotron pulses, we detect broad Lyman-$\alpha$
absorption consistent with hot WD spectral models. We infer the presence of a
pair of hotspots, with temperatures between 23000K and 28000K, near the
magnetic poles of the WD. As the WD is not expected to be accreting from its

The Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption of the hotspots appears relatively undistorted by
Zeeman splitting, constraining the WD's field strength to be 100 MG, but the

in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Following, we set up the joint
Poisson-Boltzmann equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and solve it numerically
to obtain a three-dimensional density distribution of different baryonic

further build a three-dimensional dynamical model of the molecular disc and
consecutively produce simulated CO spectral cubes and spectral width profiles.
We find that the simulated spectral width profiles distinguishably differ for
different assumed thick disc molecular gas fractions. Several CO spectral width
profiles are then produced for different assumed thick disc molecular gas
fractions and compared with the observed one to obtain the best fit thick disc
molecular gas fraction profile. We find that the thick disc molecular gas

from many different experiments pose unique challenges to statistical
inference. Many models in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology fall
into one or both of these categories. These issues are often sidestepped with
statistically unsound ad hoc methods, involving intersection of parameter
intervals estimated by multiple experiments, and random or grid sampling of
model parameters. Whilst these methods are easy to apply, they exhibit
pathologies even in low-dimensional parameter spaces, and quickly become
problematic to use and interpret in higher dimensions. In this article we give
clear guidance for going beyond these procedures, suggesting where possible
simple methods for performing statistically sound inference, and
recommendations of readily-available software tools and standards that can
assist in doing so. Our aim is to provide any physicists lacking comprehensive
statistical training with recommendations for reaching correct scientific
conclusions, with only a modest increase in analysis burden. Our examples can

as a paradigm to understand the quantum mechanics of scattering and time-decay
in a diverse set of physical systems. As one of the generators of area
preserving transformations, the IHO Hamiltonian can be studied as a dilatation
generator, squeeze generator, a Lorentz boost generator, or a scattering
potential. In establishing these different forms, we demonstrate the physics of
the IHO that underlies phenomena as disparate as the Hawking-Unruh effect and
scattering in the lowest Landau level(LLL) in quantum Hall systems. We derive
the emergence of the IHO Hamiltonian in the LLL in a gauge invariant way and
show its exact parallels with the Rindler Hamiltonian that describes quantum
mechanics near event horizons. This approach of studying distinct physical
systems with symmetries described by isomorphic Lie algebras through the
emergent IHO Hamiltonian enables us to reinterpret geometric response in the
lowest Landau level in terms of relativistic effects such as Wigner rotation.
Further, the analytic scattering matrix of the IHO points to the existence of
quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spectrum, which have quantized time-decay
rates. We present a way to access these QNMs through wave packet scattering,
thus proposing a novel effect in quantum Hall point contact geometries that
parallels those found in black holes.

observe binary-black-hole mergers (BBHs) up to redshift of $\sim 30$. This
gives unprecedented access to the formation and evolution of BBHs throughout
cosmic history. In this paper we consider three sub-populations of BBHs
originating from the different evolutionary channels: isolated formation in
galactic fields, dynamical formation in globular clusters and mergers of black
holes formed from Population III (Pop III) stars at very high redshift. Using
input from populations synthesis analyses, we created two months of simulated
data of a network of 3G detectors made of two Cosmic Explorers and an Einstein
Telescope, consisting of $\sim16000$ field and cluster BBHs as well as
$\sim400$ Pop III BBHs. First, we show how one can use non-parametric models to
infer the existence and characteristic of a primary and secondary peak in the
merger rate distribution. In particular, the location and the height of the
secondary peak around $z\approx 12$, arising from the merger of Pop III
remnants, can be constrained at $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ level. Then we perform a
modeled analysis, using phenomenological templates for the merger rates of the
three sub-population, and extract the branching ratios and the characteristic
parameters of the merger rate densities of the individual formation channels.
With this modeled method, the uncertainty on the measurement of the fraction of
Pop III BBHs can be improved to $\lesssim 10\%$, while the ratio between field
and cluster BBHs can be measured with an uncertainty of $\sim 50\%$.

$\hat\mu_t(q^2)$ and electric dipole moment $\hat d_t(q^2)$ of the top quark
are calculated within the reduced 331 model (RM331) in the general case of an
off-shell gluon. It is argued that the results are gauge independent for
$q^2\ne 0$ and represent valid observable quantities. In the RM331 $\hat
\mu_t(q^2)$ receives new contributions from two heavy gauge bosons $Z'$ and
$V^+$ and a new neutral scalar boson $h_2$, along with a new contribution from
the standard model Higgs boson via flavor changing neutral currents. The
latter, which are also mediated by the $Z'$ gauge boson and the scalar boson
$h_2$, can give a non-vanishing $\hat d_t$ provided that there is a
$CP$-violating phase. The analytical results are presented in terms of both
Feynman parameter integrals and Passarino-Veltman scalar functions, which are
useful to cross-check the numerical results. Both $\hat\mu_t(q^2)$ and $\hat
d_t$ are numerically evaluated for parameter values still allowed by the
constraints from experimental data. It is found that the new one-loop
contributions of the RM331 to $\hat \mu_t(q^2)$ are of the same order of
magnitude or larger than in other standard model extensions, with the dominant
contribution arising from the $V^+$ gauge boson for $\|q\|$ in the 30-1000 GeV
interval and a mass $m_{V}$ of the order of a few hundreds of GeVs. As for
$\hat d_t(q^2)$, it receives the largest contribution from $h_2$ exchange and
can reach values of the order of $10^{-20}$, which is smaller than the
contributions predicted by other standard model extensions.

to measure scintillation bandwidths for 28 pulsars at 1500 MHz and 15 pulsars
at 820 MHz. We examine scaling behavior for 17 pulsars and find power-law
indices ranging from $-0.7$ to $-3.6$, though these may be biased shallow due
to insufficient frequency resolution at lower frequencies. We were also able to
measure scintillation timescales for six pulsars at 1500 MHz and seven pulsars
at 820 MHz. There is fair agreement between our scattering delay measurements
and electron-density model predictions for most pulsars. We derive interstellar
scattering-based transverse velocities assuming isotropic scattering and a
scattering screen halfway between the pulsar and earth. We also estimate the
location of the scattering screens assuming proper motion and interstellar
scattering-derived transverse velocities are equal. We find no correlations
between variations in scattering delay and either variations in dispersion
measure or flux density. For most pulsars for which scattering delays were
measurable, we find that time of arrival uncertainties for a given epoch are
larger than our scattering delay measurements, indicating that variable
scattering delays are currently subdominant in our overall noise budget but are

matrix of an $F = 1$ spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, initially prepared in
coherent states, in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field and
within the single mode approximation. The phenomenon emerges as a many-body
effect of the interplay of the quadratic Zeeman effect, that breaks the
rotational symmetry, and the spin-spin interactions. By performing full quantum
diagonalizations very accurate time evolution of large condensates are
analyzed, leading to heuristic analytic expressions for the time dependence of
the one-body density matrix, in the weak and strong interacting regimes, for
initial coherent states. We are able to find accurate analytical expressions
for both the decoherence and the recurrence times, in terms of the number of
atoms and strength parameters, that show remarkable differences depending on
the strength of the spin-spin interactions. The features of the stationary
states in both regimes is also investigated. We discuss the nature of these
limits in the light of the thermodynamic limit.

regime of the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, where the physics can be
understood in terms of sparse domain walls of six flavors. As in the previously
studied models, the spread of entangled domain wall pairs generated by the
quench lead to a linear growth of entropy with time, upto a time $\ell/2v_g$ in
size-$\ell$ subsystems in the bulk where $v_g$ is the maximal group velocity of
domain walls. In small subsystems located in the bulk, the entropy continues to
further grow towards $\ln 3$, as domain walls traverse the subsystem and
increment the population of the two oppositely ordered states, restoring the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. The latter growth in entropy is seen also in small
subsystems near an open boundary in a non-chiral clock model. In contrast to
this, in the case of the chiral model, the entropy of small subsystems near an
open boundary saturates. We rationalize the difference in behavior in terms of
qualitatively different scattering properties of domain walls at the open
boundary in the chiral model. We also present empirical results for entropy
growth, correlation spread, and energies of longitudinal-field-induced bound
states of domain wall pairs in the chiral model.

the existence of Berry monopoles in the band structure of such materials, or,
equivalently, due to the chiral anomaly and chiral magnetic effect. Sound
absorption is shown to come primarily from the motion of Weyl nodes in energy
space, associated with the propagation of a sound wave. We argue that acoustic
magneto-chiral dichroism, which occurs when absorption of sound is different
for opposite propagation directions, and for opposite directions of the
magnetic field, can be a definitive probe of band topology. The part of the
monopole-related sound magnetoabsorption that is even in the magnetic field is
negative in time-reversal Weyl materials. The difference in the sign of the
effect as compared to the positive anomaly-related transport magnetoconductance
stems from the existence of valley electrochemical imbalances without magnetic

few Weyl nodes, the magneto-absorption is negative at low frequencies, but can
change sign with increasing frequency.

magnetization in a superconductor, mainly focused on the spin magnetization in
previous studies, but ignore the effect of the orbital magnetic moments carried
by the paired Bloch electrons. In this work, we show that orbital magnetic
moments in superconductors can induce large orbital magnetization in the
presence of a current. We constructed a unified description for the
current-induced spin and orbital magnetization across the superconductivity
normal metal phase transition. We find that in a superconductor with uniform
pairing, the current-induced magnetization at a given current density is the
same as that in its normal metal state, while with the nonuniform
superconducting pairing, the current-induced magnetization exhibits an abrupt
change in magnitude near the superconductivity normal metal phase transition.
Importantly, our theory predicts the orbital magnetoelectric effect in
superconducting twisted bilayer graphene which has paired Bloch electrons with
large orbital magnetic moments and negligible spin-orbit coupling. We propose
that the measurement of the current-induced orbital magnetoelectric effect can
be used to detect the possible nonuniform pairings in twisted bilayer graphene
and other newly discovered superconductors with non-trivial Berry curvatures.

treatment effect prediction. This task is found in many applications such as
personalized medicine or targeted advertising and has gained a surge of
interest in recent years under the name of Uplift Modeling. It consists in
targeting treatment to the individuals for whom it would be the most
beneficial. In real life scenarios, when we do not have access to ground-truth
individual treatment effect, the capacity of models to do so is generally
measured by the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC), a metric that differs from
the learning objectives of most of the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)
models. We argue that the learning of these models could inadvertently degrade
AUUC and lead to suboptimal treatment assignment. To tackle this issue, we
propose a generalization bound on the AUUC and present a novel learning
algorithm that optimizes a derivable surrogate of this bound, called AUUC-max.
Finally, we empirically demonstrate the tightness of this generalization bound,
its effectiveness for hyper-parameter tuning and show the efficiency of the
proposed algorithm compared to a wide range of competitive baselines on two
classical benchmarks.

expected to be highly sensitive to suprathermal protons, which enhance the
high-energy tails of the observed velocity distributions and are well

the results of a refined quasilinear (QL) approach, able to describe the

convolution operation with mechanisms based on self-attention leads to improved
performance on image classification and object detection tasks. In this work,
we show how attention mechanisms can be used to replace another canonical
operation: strided transposed convolution. We term our novel attention-based
operation attention-based upsampling since it increases/upsamples the spatial
dimensions of the feature maps. Through experiments on single image
super-resolution and joint-image upsampling tasks, we show that attention-based
upsampling consistently outperforms traditional upsampling methods based on
strided transposed convolution or based on adaptive filters while using fewer
parameters. We show that the inherent flexibility of the attention mechanism,
which allows it to use separate sources for calculating the attention
coefficients and the attention targets, makes attention-based upsampling a
natural choice when fusing information from multiple image modalities.

chooses the highest order possible interpolation, which is central, i.e.
non-dissipative in the current approach and for the discontinuities, the

uncertainty because there is a variety of different segmentation tools (both

Through the creation and sampling of segmentation uncertainty probability maps,
we systematically and objectively create uncertainty distributions of the

follow a Normal distribution, but, in more complicated physics simulations, the
resulting uncertainty distribution can be both nonintuitive and surprisingly

guiding performance is crucial for designing single-mode, wide-band, and ultra
low-loss nested hollow-core anti-resonant fiber (HC-ARF). Here we thoroughly
investigate on how the propagation loss is affected by the nested elements when
their geometry is realistic (i.e., non-ideal). Interestingly, it was found that
the size rather than the shape of the nested elements, have a dominant role in
the final loss performance of the HC-ARFs. We identify a unique 'V-shape'
pattern for suppression of higher-order modes loss by optimizing free design
parameters of HC-ARF. We find that a 5-tube nested HC-ARF has wider
transmission window and better single-mode operation than 6-tube HC-ARF. We
show that the propagation loss can be significantly improved by using
anisotropic nested anti-resonant tubes elongated in the radial direction. Our
simulations indicate that with this novel fiber design, a propagation loss as
low as 0.11 dB/km at 1.55 $\mu$m can be achieved. Our results provide design
insights towards fully exploiting single-mode, wide-band, and ultra low-loss
HC-ARF. In addition, the extraordinary optical properties of the proposed fiber
can be beneficial for several applications such as future optical communication
system, high energy light transport, extreme non-nonlinear optics and beyond.

developers to compose rich functionalities and explore reuse within and across
apps. Unfortunately, as reported by a large body of literature, ICC is rather
""complex and largely unconstrained"", leaving room to a lack of precision in
apps modeling. To address the challenge of tracking ICCs within apps, state of
the art static approaches such as Epicc, IccTA and Amandroid have focused on
the documented framework ICC methods (e.g., startActivity) to build their
approaches. In this work we show that ICC models inferred in these state of the
art tools may actually be incomplete: the framework provides other atypical
ways of performing ICCs. To address this limitation in the state of the art, we
propose RAICC a static approach for modeling new ICC links and thus boosting
previous analysis tasks such as ICC vulnerability detection, privacy leaks
detection, malware detection, etc. We have evaluated RAICC on 20 benchmark
apps, demonstrating that it improves the precision and recall of uncovered
leaks in state of the art tools. We have also performed a large empirical
investigation showing that Atypical ICC methods are largely used in Android
apps, although not necessarily for data transfer. We also show that RAICC
increases the number of ICC links found by 61.6% on a dataset of real-world

can reproduce the quantum entanglement emerging in the case of

of Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum systems can also be reproduced by the
classical epidemic model. Every quantum system made from quantum dots and

be effectively described by classical model with very specific structure of S

fiber optoacoustic emitter (TFOE) for optoacoustic stimulation of neurons with
an unprecedented spatial resolution of 20 microns, enabling selective
activation of single neurons or subcellular structures, such as axons and
dendrites. A single acoustic pulse of 1 microsecond converted by the TFOE from
a single laser pulse of 3 nanoseconds is shown as the shortest acoustic stimuli
so far for successful neuron activation. The highly localized ultrasound
generated by the TFOE made it possible to integrate the optoacoustic
stimulation and highly stable patch clamp recording on single neurons. Direct
measurements of electrical response of single neurons to acoustic stimulation,
which is difficult for conventional ultrasound stimulation, have been
demonstrated for the first time. By coupling TFOE with ex vivo brain slice
electrophysiology, we unveil cell-type-specific response of excitatory and

research. Reducing the statistical uncertainty in these analyses is an
important objective for statisticians. Registries, prior trials, and health
records constitute a growing compendium of historical data on patients under
standard-of-care that may be exploitable to this end. However, most methods for
historical borrowing achieve reductions in variance by sacrificing strict
type-I error rate control. Here, we propose a use of historical data that
exploits linear covariate adjustment to improve the efficiency of trial
analyses without incurring bias. Specifically, we train a prognostic model on
the historical data, then estimate the treatment effect using a linear
regression while adjusting for the trial subjects' predicted outcomes (their
prognostic scores). We prove that, under certain conditions, this prognostic
covariate adjustment procedure attains the minimum variance possible among a
large class of estimators. When those conditions are not met, prognostic
covariate adjustment is still more efficient than raw covariate adjustment and
the gain in efficiency is proportional to a measure of the predictive accuracy
of the prognostic model above and beyond the linear relationship with the raw
covariates. We demonstrate the approach using simulations and a reanalysis of
an Alzheimer's Disease clinical trial and observe meaningful reductions in
mean-squared error and the estimated variance. Lastly, we provide a simplified
formula for asymptotic variance that enables power calculations that account
for these gains. Sample size reductions between 10% and 30% are attainable when
using prognostic models that explain a clinically realistic percentage of the
outcome variance.

layer determines the reduced basis for the input space, while the remaining
layers approximate the nonlinear input-output system. The training alternates
between learning the reduced basis and the nonlinear approximation, and is
shown to be more effective than fixing the reduced basis and training the

low-dimensional subspaces, that the number of parameters in the network does
not need to be large. We show that our method can be applied to scientific
problems in the data-scarce regime, which is typically not well-suited for
neural network approximations. Examples include reduced order modeling for

challenge in behavioural sciences. In the framework of evolutionary game
theory, punishing strategies are frequently used to promote cooperation in
competitive environments. Here, we introduce altruistic punishers in the
spatial public goods game. This strategy acts as a cooperator in the absence of
defectors, otherwise it will punish all defectors in their vicinity while
bearing a cost to do so. We observe three distinct behaviours in our model: i)
in the absence of punishers, cooperators (who don't punish defectors) are
driven to extinction by defectors for most parameter values; ii) clusters of
punishers thrive by sharing the punishment costs when these are low iii) for
higher punishment costs, punishers, when alone, are subject to exploitation but
in the presence of cooperators can form a symbiotic spatial structure that
benefits both. This last observation is our main finding since neither
cooperation nor punishment alone can survive the defector strategy in this
parameter region and the specificity of the symbiotic spatial configuration
shows that lattice topology plays a central role in sustaining cooperation.
Results were obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice
and subsequently confirmed by a pairwise comparison of different strategies'
payoffs in diverse group compositions, leading to a phase diagram of the
possible states.

first major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as

transformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark
classification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention
operator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex

crucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in

closer to the $E_{\gamma,{\rm peak}}-E_{\gamma,{\rm iso}}$ correlation for

synchrotron model, we derive the burst explosion properties and find a jet
opening angle of $\theta_{\rm j} \gtrsim 9-14^{\circ}$. If GRB 180418A is a
short GRB that originated from a neutron star merger, it has one of the
brightest and longest-lived afterglows along with an extremely faint host
galaxy. If instead the event is a long GRB that originated from a massive star
collapse, it has among the lowest luminosity afterglows, and lies in a peculiar

learning due to its ability to learn useful representations without labeled
data. However, contrastive learning is susceptible to feature suppression,
i.e., it may discard important information relevant to the task of interest,
and learn irrelevant features. Past work has addressed this limitation via
handcrafted data augmentations that eliminate irrelevant information. This
approach however does not work across all datasets and tasks. Further, data
augmentations fail in addressing feature suppression in multi-attribute
classification when one attribute can suppress features relevant to other
attributes. In this paper, we analyze the objective function of contrastive
learning and formally prove that it is vulnerable to feature suppression. We
then present predictive contrastive learning (PCL), a framework for learning
unsupervised representations that are robust to feature suppression. The key
idea is to force the learned representation to predict the input, and hence
prevent it from discarding important information. Extensive experiments verify
that PCL is robust to feature suppression and outperforms state-of-the-art
contrastive learning methods on a variety of datasets and tasks.

synthesized from an arbitrary viewpoint and under arbitrary lighting, e.g.
directional light, point light, or an environment map. The model is fitted to
the sequence of frames with human face-specific priors that enforce the

researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence. However, in the
classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the
decision-maker (DM) are abstract or well-structured signals rather than natural
language messages. This paper addresses the use of natural language in
persuasion games. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction
experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell
an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her a review
that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored
reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert,
and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the
review score distribution available to the expert only. We also compare the
behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar
experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the
reviews rather than the reviews' text, and observe substantial differences
which can be explained through an equilibrium analysis of the game. We consider
a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup, differing
from each other in the model type (deep neural network vs. linear classifier),
the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the
source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results
demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models can
predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a
sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied.
Further analysis of the hand-crafted textual features allows us to make initial
observations about the aspects of text that drive decision making in our setup

threshold level is defined as a percentage of the (unknown) maximum of the
objective function. For each problem, we derive the corresponding theoretic
information based acquisition function to sample the data points so as to
maximally increase the level set accuracy. Furthermore, we also analyse the
theoretical time complexity of our proposed acquisition functions, and suggest
a practical methodology to efficiently tune the network hyper-parameters to

by Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. It is based on the insight that the
collection of finite structures can be embedded, via a map they call the Stone
pairing, in a space of measures, where the desired limits can be computed. We
show that a closely related but finer grained space of (finitely additive)
measures arises -- via Stone-Priestley duality and the notion of types from
model theory -- by enriching the expressive power of first-order logic with
certain ""probabilistic operators"". We provide a sound and complete calculus for
this extended logic and expose the functorial nature of this construction.
  The consequences are two-fold. On the one hand, we identify the logical gist
of the theory of structural limits. On the other hand, our construction shows
that the duality theoretic variant of the Stone pairing captures the adding of
a layer of quantifiers, thus making a strong link to recent work on semiring
quantifiers in logic on words. In the process, we identify the model theoretic
notion of types as the unifying concept behind this link. These results
contribute to bridging the strands of logic in computer science which focus on
semantics and on more algorithmic and complexity related areas, respectively.

majority will first present to their GP symptomatically, even for cancer for
which screening programs exist. Diagnosing cancer in primary care is
challenging due to the non-specific nature of cancer symptoms and its low
prevalence. Understanding the epidemiology of cancer symptoms and patterns of
presentation in patient's medical history from primary care data could be
important to improve earlier detection and cancer outcomes. As past medical
data about a patient can be incomplete, irregular or missing, this creates
additional challenges when attempting to use the patient's history for any new
diagnosis. Our research aims to investigate the opportunities in a patient's
pathology history available to a GP, initially focused on the results within
the frequently ordered full blood count to determine relevance to a future
high-risk cancer prognosis, and treatment outcome. We investigated how past
pathology test results can lead to deriving features that can be used to
predict cancer outcomes, with emphasis on patients at risk of not surviving the
cancer within 2-year period. This initial work focuses on patients with lung
cancer, although the methodology can be applied to other types of cancer and
other data within the medical record. Our findings indicate that even in cases
of incomplete or obscure patient history, hematological measures can be useful
in generating features relevant for predicting cancer risk and survival. The
results strongly indicate to add the use of pathology test data for potential
high-risk cancer diagnosis, and the utilize additional pathology metrics or
other primary care datasets even more for similar purposes.

single crystals of Sr2Ir1-xFexO4 (0<x<0.32) and Sr2Ir1-xCoxO4 (0<x<0.22). Fe
doping retains the antiferromagnetic state but simultaneously precipitates an
emergent metallic state whereas Co doping causes a rapid collapse of both the
antiferromagnetic and Mott states, giving rise to a confined metallic state
featuring a pronounced linearity of the basal-plane resistivity up to 700 K.
The results indicate tetravalent Fe4+(3d4) ions in the intermediate spin state
with S=1 and Co4+(3d5) ions in the high spin state with S=5/2 substituting for
Ir4+(5d5) ions in Sr2IrO4, respectively. The effective magnetic moment closely
tracks the N\'eel temperature as doping increases, suggesting that the spin
state of the dopant predominately determines the magnetic properties in doped
Sr2IrO4. Furthermore, all relevant properties including charge-carrier density
(e.g., 1028/m3), Sommerfeld coefficient (e.g., 19 mJ/mole K2) and Wilson ratio
(e.g., 2.6), consistently demonstrates a metallic state that is both robust and
highly correlated in the two systems, arising from the percolation of bound
states and the weakening of structural distortions. This study strongly
suggests that the antiferromagnetic and Mott states merely coexist in a
fortuitous manner in Sr2IrO4.

discovering a social point-of-interest (POI) boundary, formed as a convex
polygon. More specifically, we present a new approach and algorithm, built upon
our earlier work on social POI boundary estimation (SoBEst). This SoBEst
approach takes into account both relevant and irrelevant records within a
geographic area, where relevant records contain a POI name or its variations in
their text field. Our study is motivated by the following empirical
observation: a fixed representative coordinate of each POI that SoBEst
basically assumes may be far away from the centroid of the estimated social POI
boundary for certain POIs. Thus, using SoBEst in such cases may possibly result
in unsatisfactory performance on the boundary estimation quality (BEQ), which
is expressed as a function of the $F$-measure. To solve this problem, we
formulate a joint optimization problem of simultaneously finding the radius of
a circle and the POI's representative coordinate $c$ by allowing to update $c$.
Subsequently, we design an iterative SoBEst (I-SoBEst) algorithm, which enables
us to achieve a higher degree of BEQ for some POIs. The computational
complexity of the proposed I-SoBEst algorithm is shown to scale linearly with
the number of records. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over
competing clustering methods including the original SoBEst.

ejections (CMEs) are thought to be caused by stresses, twists, and tangles in

plasma into interplanetary space. Even the ever-present solar wind possesses a
three-dimensional morphology shaped by the global coronal magnetic field,
forming geoeffective corotating interaction regions. CME evolution and the

violation required phase transitions or long-range interactions. More recent
research on binary networks found that an extensive number of local constraints
can also break EE, even in absence of phase transitions. Here we study for the
first time ensemble nonequivalence in weighted networks with local constraints.
Unlike their binary counterparts, these networks can undergo a form of
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) producing a core-periphery structure where a
finite fraction of the link weights concentrates in the core. This phenomenon
creates a unique setting where local constraints coexist with a phase
transition. We find surviving relative fluctuations only in the condensed
phase, as in more traditional BEC settings. However, we also find a
non-vanishing relative entropy density for all temperatures, signalling a
breakdown of EE due to the presence of an extensive number of constraints,
irrespective of BEC. Therefore, in presence of extensively many local
constraints, vanishing relative fluctuations no longer guarantee EE.

models decrease the investigator's ability to interpret and communicate the
estimated parameters. Reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space in the
estimation phase is a commonly used approach, but less work has focused on
selecting subsets of the parameters for interpreting the estimated model --
especially in settings such as Bayesian inference and model averaging.
Importantly, many models do not have straightforward interpretations and create
another layer of obfuscation. To solve this gap, we introduce a new method that
uses the Wasserstein distance to identify a low-dimensional interpretable model
projection. After the estimation of complex models, users can budget how many
parameters they wish to interpret and the proposed generates a simplified model
of the desired dimension minimizing the distance to the full model. We provide
simulation results to illustrate the method and apply it to cancer datasets.

processes that require an ever increasing amount of computational resources. In
this paper, we restrict ourselves to the design of Apodized Pupil Lyot
Coronagraphs (APLCs). To produce APLC designs for future giant space
telescopes, we require a fine sampling for the apodizer to resolve all small
features, such as segment gaps, in the telescope pupil. Additionally, we
require the coronagraph to operate in broadband light and be insensitive to
small misalignments of the Lyot stop. For future designs we want to include
passive suppression of low-order aberrations and finite stellar diameters. The
memory requirements for such an optimization would exceed multiple terabytes
for the problem matrix alone.
  We therefore want to reduce the number of variables and constraints to
minimize the size of the problem matrix. We show how symmetries in the pupil
and Lyot stop are expressed in the complete optimization problem, and allow
removal of both variables and constraints. Each mirror symmetry reduces the
problem size by a factor of four. Secondly, we introduce progressive
refinement, which uses low-resolution optimizations as a prior for higher
resolutions. This lets us remove the majority of variables from the
high-resolution optimization. Together these two improvements require up to
256x less computer memory, with a corresponding speed increase. This allows for
greater exploration of the phase space of the focal-plane mask and Lyot-stop
geometry, and easier simulation of sensitivity to Lyot-stop misalignments.
Moreover, apodizers can now be optimized at their native manufactured
resolution.

recent advances of generative adversarial network (GAN), we propose a novel
deep learning method, called ErGAN, to address the challenge. ErGAN consists of
two key components: a label generator and a discriminator which are optimized
alternatively through adversarial learning. To alleviate the issues of
overfitting and highly imbalanced distribution, we design two novel modules for
diversity and propagation, which can greatly improve the model generalization
power. We have conducted extensive experiments to empirically verify the

ErGAN beats the state-of-the-art baselines, including unsupervised,

the most pressing challenges for computational fluid dynamics. The aircraft
aerodynamics are inherently turbulent with mean-flow three-dimensionality,
often accompanied by laminar-to-turbulent transition, flow separation,
secondary flow motions at corners, and shock wave formation, to name a few.
However, the most widespread wall models are built upon the assumption of
statistically-in-equilibrium wall-bounded turbulence and do not faithfully
account for the wide variety of flow conditions described above. This raises
the question of how to devise models capable of accounting for such a vast and
rich collection of flow physics in a feasible manner. In this work, we propose
tackling the wall-modeling challenge by devising the flow as a collection of
building blocks, whose information enables the prediction of the stress as the
wall. The model relies on the assumption that simple canonical flows contain
the essential flow physics to devise accurate models. Three types of building
block units were used to train the model: turbulent channel flows, turbulent
ducts and turbulent boundary layers with separation. This limited training set
will be extended in future versions of the model. The approach is implemented
using two interconnected artificial neural networks: a classifier, which
identifies the contribution of each building block in the flow; and a
predictor, which estimates the wall stress via non-linear combinations of
building-block units. The output of the model is accompanied by the confidence
in the prediction. The latter value aids the detection of areas where the model
underperforms, such as flow regions that are not representative of the building
blocks used to train the model. The model is validated in a unseen case
representative of external aerodynamic applications: the NASA Juncture Flow
Experiment.

injury risks after head impacts. These BIC originated from different types of
head impacts (e.g., sports and car crashes) are widely used in risk evaluation.
However, the accuracy of using the BIC on brain injury risk estimation across
different types of head impacts has not been evaluated. Physiologically, brain
strain is often considered the key parameter of brain injury. To evaluate the
BIC's risk estimation accuracy across five datasets comprising different head
impact types, linear regression was used to model 95% maximum principal strain,
95% maximum principal strain at the corpus callosum, and cumulative strain
damage (15%) on each of 18 BIC respectively. The results show a significant
difference in the relationship between BIC and brain strain across datasets,
indicating the same BIC value may suggest different brain strain in different
head impact types. The accuracy of brain strain regression is generally
decreasing if the BIC regression models are fit on a dataset with a different
type of head impact rather than on the dataset with the same type. Given this
finding, this study raises concerns for applying BIC to estimate the brain
injury risks for head impacts different from the head impacts on which the BIC

the first (Pop~III) and second (Pop~II) generation of stars. However,
cosmological simulations have struggled to reproduce the observed level of
carbon enhancement of the known CEMP-no stars. Here we present new cosmological
hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of isolated UFDs that achieve a gas mass
resolution of $m_{\rm gas}\sim60$ Msun. We include enrichment from Pop~III
faint supernovae (SNe), with $ E_{\rm SN}=0.6\times10^{51}$ erg, to understand

mainly responsible for the formation of CEMP and C-normal stars respectively.
New to this study, we find that a majority of CEMP-no stars in the observed
UFDs and the MW halo can be explained by Pop~III SNe with normal explosion
energy ($ E_{\rm SN}=1.2\times10^{51}$~erg) and Pop~II enrichment, but faint
SNe might also be needed to produce CEMP-no stars with $\rm [C/Fe]\gtrsim2$,
corresponding to the absolute carbon abundance of $\rm A(C)\gtrsim6.0$.
Furthermore, we find that while we create CEMP-no stars with high carbon ratio
$\rm [C/Fe]\approx3-4$, by adopting faint SNe, it is still challenging to
reproduce CEMP-no stars with extreme level of carbon abundance of $\rm
A(C)\approx 7.0-7.5$, observed both in the MW halo and UFDs.

the design of a two-stream version of GLOW (flow-based invertible generative

health systems value deeply patient privacy and data security. De-identified
EHRs do not adequately address the needs of health systems, as de-identified

Synthetic EHRs offer a potential solution. In this paper, we propose EHR
Variational Autoencoder (EVA) for synthesizing sequences of discrete EHR
encounters (e.g., clinical visits) and encounter features (e.g., diagnoses,
medications, procedures). We illustrate that EVA can produce realistic EHR

stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo with amortized variational

user studies with knowledgeable clinicians, indicate the generated EHR

Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in

algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We
also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and
discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can

baryons in a multiphase transport (AMPT) model in order to describe the
enhanced production of multistrange hadrons observed in Pb-Pb collisions at
$\rm \sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the Large hadron Collider (LHC) and Au+Au
collisions at $\rm \sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider
(RHIC).This extended AMPT model is found to also give a reasonable description
of the multiplicity dependence of the strangeness enhancement observed in high
multiplicity events in $pp$ collisions at $\rm \sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and $p$-Pb
collisions at $\rm \sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. We find that the coalescence
factors depend on the system size but not much on whether the system is
produced from A+A or p+A collisions. The extended AMPT model thus provides a
convenient way to model the mechanism underlying the observed strangeness
enhancement in collisions of both small and large systems at RHIC and LHC
energies.

radii, particulaly for stellar, exoplanet, and Galactic studies. It is
therefore important that their precisions are known. Here we measure the
intrinsic scatter of the underlying seismic scaling relations for $\Delta\nu$
and $\nu_{\rm max}$, using two sharp features that are formed in the H--R
diagram (or related diagrams) by the red giant populations. These features are
the edge near the zero-age core-helium-burning phase, and the strong clustering
of stars at the so-called red giant branch bump. The broadening of those
features is determined by factors including the intrinsic scatter of the
scaling relations themselves, and therefore it is capable of imposing
constraints on them. We modelled Kepler stars with a Galaxia synthetic
population, upon which we applied the intrinsic scatter of the scaling
relations to match the degree of sharpness seen in the observation. We found
that the random errors from measuring $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$ provide
the dominating scatter that blurs the features. As a consequence, we conclude
that the scaling relations have intrinsic scatter of $\sim0.5\%$ ($\Delta\nu$),
$\sim1.1\%$ ($\nu_{\rm max}$), $\sim1.7\%$ ($M$) and $\sim0.4\%$ ($R$), for the
SYD pipeline measured $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$. This confirms that the
scaling relations are very powerful tools. In addition, we show that standard
evolution models fail to predict some of the structures in the observed
population of both the HeB and RGB stars. Further stellar model improvements
are needed to reproduce the exact distributions.

transformation to straighten the contact discontinuity in the new coordinates.
However, the upper nozzle wall in the subsonic region depending on the mass
flux becomes a free boundary after the transformation. Then we develop new
ideas and techniques to solve the free-boundary problem in three steps: (1) we
fix the free boundary and generate a new iteration scheme to solve the
corresponding fixed boundary value problem of the hyperbolic-elliptic mixed
type by building some powerful estimates for both the first-order hyperbolic
equation and a second-order nonlinear elliptic equation in a Lipschitz domain;
(2) we update the new free boundary by constructing a mapping that has a fixed

that the original free interface problem admits a unique piecewise smooth
transonic solution near the background state, which consists of a smooth
subsonic flow and a smooth supersonic flow with a contact discontinuity.

  Automatically Generated Counterfactuals",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spurious correlations threaten the validity of statistical classifiers. While
model accuracy may appear high when the test data is from the same distribution
as the training data, it can quickly degrade when the test distribution
changes. For example, it has been shown that classifiers perform poorly when
humans make minor modifications to change the label of an example. One solution
to increase model reliability and generalizability is to identify causal
associations between features and classes. In this paper, we propose to train a
robust text classifier by augmenting the training data with automatically
generated counterfactual data. We first identify likely causal features using a
statistical matching approach. Next, we generate counterfactual samples for the
original training data by substituting causal features with their antonyms and
then assigning opposite labels to the counterfactual samples. Finally, we
combine the original data and counterfactual data to train a robust classifier.
Experiments on two classification tasks show that a traditional classifier
trained on the original data does very poorly on human-generated counterfactual
samples (e.g., 10%-37% drop in accuracy). However, the classifier trained on
the combined data is more robust and performs well on both the original test
data and the counterfactual test data (e.g., 12%-25% increase in accuracy
compared with the traditional classifier). Detailed analysis shows that the
robust classifier makes meaningful and trustworthy predictions by emphasizing
causal features and de-emphasizing non-causal features.

the release of benchmarking datasets, such as the ModelNet and the ShapeNet.
These benchmarks assume point clouds covering complete surfaces of object
instances, for which plenty of high-performing methods have been developed.
However, their settings deviate from those often met in practice, where, due to
(self-)occlusion, a point cloud covering partial surface of an object is
captured from an arbitrary view. We show in this paper that performance of
existing point cloud classifiers drops drastically under the considered
single-view, partial setting; the phenomenon is consistent with the observation
that semantic category of a partial object surface is less ambiguous only when
its distribution on the whole surface is clearly specified. To this end, we
argue for a single-view, partial setting where supervised learning of object
pose estimation should be accompanied with classification. Technically, we
propose a baseline method of Pose-Accompanied Point cloud classification
Network (PAPNet); built upon SE(3)-equivariant convolutions, the PAPNet learns
intermediate pose transformations for equivariant features defined on vector
fields, which makes the subsequent classification easier (ideally) in the
category-level, canonical pose. By adapting existing ModelNet40 and ScanNet
datasets to the single-view, partial setting, experiment results can verify the
necessity of object pose estimation and superiority of our PAPNet to existing
classifiers.

emphasizes important features of the target image rather than simply
reproducing it (DiPaola 2007). Using adversarial or L2 losses in the RL

produces a stroke sequence that is vastly different from that which a human
would produce since the model does not have knowledge about the abstract

the model without the use of expensive human data, we introduce a new loss
function for use with the model's reward function: Content Masked Loss. In the
context of robot painting, Content Masked Loss employs an object detection
model to extract features which are used to assign higher weight to regions of
the canvas that a human would find important for recognizing content. The
results, based on 332 human evaluators, show that the digital paintings

supersonically moving object in a fluid. They move with the same velocity as
the moving object and thereby remain pinned to the object. A well known
hydrodynamical phenomenon, they have been shown to exist in numerical
simulation studies but to date have not been observed experimentally in a
plasma. In this paper we report the first experimental excitation of pinned
solitons in a dusty (complex) plasma flowing over a charged obstacle. The
experiments are performed in a {\Pi} shaped Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx)
device in which a dusty plasma is created in the background of a DC glow
discharge Ar plasma using micron sized kaolin dust particles. A biased copper
wire creates a potential structure that acts as a stationary charged object
over which the dust fluid is made to flow at a highly supersonic speed. Under
appropriate conditions nonlinear stationary structures are observed in the
laboratory frame that correspond to pinned structures moving with the speed of
the obstacle in the frame of the moving fluid. A systematic study is made of
the propagation characteristics of these solitons by carefully tuning the flow
velocity of the dust fluid by changing the height of the potential structure.
It is found that the nature of the pinned solitons changes from a single humped
one to a multi-humped one and their amplitudes increase with an increase of the
flow velocity of the dust fluid. The experimental findings are then
qualitatively compared with the numerical solutions of a model forced Korteweg
de Vries (fKdV) equation.

reaction-diffusion PDEs is analyzed in the cubic Complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation with a slowly-varying parameter. We use the classical asymptotic
methods of stationary phase and steepest descents to show that solutions which
approach the attracting quasi-steady state (QSS) before the Hopf bifurcation
remain near that state for long times after the Hopf bifurcation and the QSS
has become repelling. In the complex time plane, the phase function of the
linear PDE has a saddle point, and the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are central
to the asymptotics. The nonlinear terms are treated by applying an iterative
method to the mild form of the PDE given by perturbations about the linear
particular solution. This tracks the closeness of solutions near the attracting
and repelling QSS. Next, we show that beyond a key Stokes line through the
saddle there is a space-time buffer curve along which the particular solution
of the linear PDE ceases to be exponentially small, causing the solution of the
nonlinear PDE to diverge from the repelling QSS and exhibit large-amplitude
oscillations. The homogeneous solution also stops being exponentially small in
a spatially dependent manner, as determined also by the initial time. We find
four different cases of DHB, depending on the competition between the
homogeneous and particular solutions, and we quantify how these depend on
system parameters. Examples are presented for each case, with uni-modal,
spatially-periodic, smooth step, and algebraically-growing source terms. Also,
rich spatio-temporal dynamics are observed in the post-DHB oscillations.
Finally, it is shown that large-amplitude source terms can be designed so that
solutions spend substantially longer times near the repelling QSS, and hence
region-specific control over the delayed onset of oscillations can be achieved.

galaxy evolution since the ratio is closely tied to the growth of metallicity
and the star formation history in galaxies. Estimates for the N/O ratio are
traditionally accomplished with optical lines that could suffer from extinction
and excitation effects, so the N/O ratio is arguably measured better through
far-infrared (far-IR) fine-structure lines. Here we show that the [N
III]57$\mu$m/[O III]52$\mu$m line ratio, denoted $N3O3$, is a physically robust
probe of N/O. This parameter is insensitive to gas temperature and only weakly
dependent on electron density. Though it has a dependence on the hardness of
the ionizing radiation field, we show that it is well corrected by including
the [Ne III]15.5$\mu$m/[Ne II]12.8$\mu$m line ratio. We verify the method, and
characterize its intrinsic uncertainties by comparing the results to
photoionization models. We then apply our method to a sample of nearby galaxies
using new observations obtained with SOFIA/FIFI-LS in combination with
available Herschel/PACS data, and the results are compared with optical N/O
estimates. We find evidence for a systematic offset between the far-IR and
optically derived N/O ratio. We argue this is likely due to that our far-IR
method is biased towards younger and denser H II regions, while the optical
methods are biased towards older H II regions as well as diffuse ionized gas.

post-processing of conventional clustering-based diarization. Clustering-based
diarization methods partition frames into clusters of the number of speakers;
thus, they typically cannot handle overlapping speech because each frame is
assigned to one speaker. On the other hand, some end-to-end diarization methods
can handle overlapping speech by treating the problem as multi-label
classification. Although some methods can treat a flexible number of speakers,
they do not perform well when the number of speakers is large. To compensate
for each other's weakness, we propose to use a two-speaker end-to-end
diarization method as post-processing of the results obtained by a
clustering-based method. We iteratively select two speakers from the results
and update the results of the two speakers to improve the overlapped region.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm consistently improved the
performance of the state-of-the-art methods across CALLHOME, AMI, and DIHARD II
datasets.

of expanding supernova ejecta with a central energy source. As suggested in
previous multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, a sufficiently powerful
central energy source can blow away the expanding supernova ejecta, leading to
efficient mixing of stratified layers in the ejecta. We assume that the energy
injection is realized in the form of non-thermal radiation from the wind nebula
embedded at the center of the ejecta. We found that the multi-dimensional
mixing in the ejecta assists the injected non-thermal radiation escaping from
the ejecta. When the non-thermal radiation is absorbed by the ejecta, it is
converted into bright thermal radiation or is consumed as the kinetic energy of
the supernova ejecta. We found that central energy sources with the injection
timescale similar to the photon diffusion timescale realize an efficient
conversion of the injected energy into thermal radiation. On the other hand, a
rapid energy injection ends up accelerating the ejecta rather than giving rise
to bright thermal emission. This remarkable difference potentially explains the
diversity of energetic supernovae including broad-lined Ic and superluminous
supernovae.

dispersion by stellar velocity dispersion, we measure the kinematic outflow
size and extend the kinematic outflow size-luminosity relation reported in Kang
& Woo (2018) into a wider luminosity range (over four orders of magnitude in
[OIII] luminosity). The shallow slope of the kinematic outflow size-luminosity
relation indicates that while ionizing photons can reach out further, kinetic
energy transfer is much less efficient due to various effects, demonstrating
the importance of kinematical analysis in quantifying the outflow size and
energetics. By comparing the outflow kinematics with the host galaxy
properties, we find that AGNs with strong outflows have higher star formation

while for global motion modeling, temporal difference across segments is
incorporated to capture long-range structure for motion feature excitation. TDN

found in this class of layered structures centered at integer multiples of n0,
the density corresponding to one electron per moir\'e superlattice unit cell.
Here we report the experimental observation of ferromagnetism at fractional
filling of a flat Chern band in an ABC-TLG/hBN moir\'esuperlattice. The
ferromagnetic state exhibits prominent ferromagnetic hysteresis behavior with
large anomalous Hall resistivity in a broad region of densities, centered in
the valence miniband at n = -2.3 n0. This ferromagnetism depends very
sensitively on the control parameters in the moir\'e system: not only the
magnitude of the anomalous Hall signal, but also the sign of the hysteretic
ferromagnetic response can be modulated by tuning the carrier density and
displacement field. Our discovery of electrically tunable ferromagnetism in a
moir\'e Chern band at non-integer filling highlights the opportunities for
exploring new correlated ferromagnetic states in moir\'e heterostructures.

the overall training trails. In this paper, we develop a systematic
weight-pruning optimization approach based on Surrogate Lagrangian relaxation
(SLR), which is tailored to overcome difficulties caused by the discrete nature
of the weight-pruning problem while ensuring fast convergence. We further
accelerate the convergence of the SLR by using quadratic penalties. Model
parameters obtained by SLR during the training phase are much closer to their
optimal values as compared to those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods.

applicability of CS relies on the validity of a signal sparsity assumption and
knowing the exact sparsity level. It is customary to assume a foreknown
sparsity level. Still, this assumption is not valid in practice, especially
when applying learned dictionaries as sparsifying transforms. The problem is
more strongly pronounced with multidimensional sparsity. In this paper, we
propose an algorithm for estimating the composite sparsity lying in multiple
domains defined by learned dictionaries. The proposed algorithm estimates the
sparsity level over a dictionary by inferring it from its counterpart with
respect to a compact discrete Fourier basis. This inference is achieved by a
machine learning prediction. This setting learns the intrinsic relationship
between the columns of a dictionary and those of such a fixed basis. The
proposed algorithm is applied to estimating sparsity levels in wireless

quality of sparsity estimation leading to performances very close to the

this setting from two perspectives: (i) while granting the connection requests

obey the Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory. Here, we demonstrate that the
Maxwell Garnett theory could break down due to evanescent fields in
deep-subwavelength dielectric structures. By utilizing two- and
three-dimensional dielectric composite materials with inhomogeneities at the
scale of {\lambda}/100, we show that local evanescent fields generally occur
nearby the dielectric inhomogeneities. When tiny absorptive constituents are
placed there, the absorption and transmission of the whole composite will show
strong dependence on the positions of the absorptive constituents. The Maxwell
Garnett theory fails to predict such position-dependent characteristics,
because it averages out the evanescent fields. By taking the distribution of
the evanescent fields into consideration, we made a correction to the Maxwell
Garnett theory, such that the position-dependent characteristics become
predictable. We reveal not only the breakdown of the Maxwell Garnett theory,
but also a unique phenomenon of ""invisible"" loss induced by the prohibition of
electric fields at deep-subwavelength scales. Our work promises a route to
control the macroscopic properties of composite materials without changing

multilevel resolution associated with the multigrid iterative approach for time
advancement is used to generate several low-resolution numerical simulations.
These results are used as ensemble members to determine the correction via

purposes for users including entertainment, transportation, financial

and the consequent effect of these technologies on society, it is essential to
consider the relationship between human values and the development and
deployment of mobile apps. The many negative consequences of violating human
values such as privacy, fairness or social justice by technology have been
documented in recent times. If we can detect these violations in a timely
manner, developers can look to better address them. To understand the violation
of human values in a range of common mobile apps, we analysed 22,119 app
reviews from Google Play Store using natural language processing techniques. We
base our values violation detection approach on a widely accepted model of
human values; the Schwartz theory of basic human values. The results of our
analysis show that 26.5% of the reviews contained text indicating user
perceived violations of human values. We found that benevolence and
self-direction were the most violated value categories, and conformity and
tradition were the least violated categories. Our results also highlight the
need for a proactive approach to the alignment of values amongst stakeholders
and the use of app reviews as a valuable additional source for mining values

high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems characterised by extreme variability in
the X-ray domain. In current models, this is mainly attributed to the clumpy
nature of the stellar wind coupled with gating mechanisms involving the spin
and magnetic field of the neutron star. We studied the X-ray properties of the
supergiant HMXB XMMU J053108.3-690923 in the Large Magellanic Cloud to
understand its nature. We performed a detailed temporal and spectral analysis
of the eROSITA and XMM-Newton data of XMMU J053108.3-690923. We confirm the
putative pulsations previously reported for the source with high confidence,
certifying its nature as a neutron star in orbit with a supergiant companion.
We identify the extremely variable nature of the source in the form of flares
seen in the eROSITA light curves. The source flux exhibits a total dynamic
range of more than three orders of magnitude, which confirms its nature as an
SFXT, and is the first such direct evidence from a HMXB outside our Galaxy
exhibiting a very high dynamic range in luminosity as well as a fast flaring
behaviour. We detect changes in the hardness ratio during the flaring intervals
where the hardness ratio reaches its minimum during the peak of the flare and
increases steeply shortly afterwards. This is also supported by the results of
the spectral analysis carried out at the peak and off-flare intervals. This
scenario is consistent with the presence of dense structures in the supergiant
wind of XMMU J053108.3-690923 where the clumpy medium becomes photoionised at
the peak of the flare leading to a drop in the photo-electric absorption.
Further, we provide an estimate of the clumpiness of the medium and the
magnetic field of the neutron star assuming a spin equilibrium condition.

equations describing a population of commuters moving on a large scale
(extra-urban) with a system of diffusion equations characterizing the non
commuting population acting over a small scale (urban). The modeling approach
permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in
epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass
migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic
theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between
infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition,
in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations
through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale. A
discretization of the system based on finite volumes on unstructured grids,
combined with an asymptotic preserving method in time, shows that the model is

that general relativistic effects strongly reduce the Oppenheimer-Volkoff
Newtonian limit for very compact astrophysical objects as neutron stars. In

mass $M_c\simeq 0.59 M_{\odot}$ at the Buchdahl limit. Finally, we study
possible non commutative effects near the event horizon of a black hole.

and has to be revised since the description is missing a novel thermodynamic
coefficient. Within holographic massive gravity, we lay out a road map for
extensions of hydrodynamics to momentum dissipation. Furthermore, we study the

terms of periodically driven strongly coupled quantum field theories. Another
important non-equilibrium scenario specially important for the understanding of
our universe is quantum gravity in de-Sitter. Recently, the bold claim of the

two quenched and tempered steels at two different strength levels were tested,

deformation annealing. Consequently, the DSR provides a higher room temperature
mechanical strength obtained in both aging steps, as compared to the non
deformed and conventionally cold rolled counterparts. Furthermore, noticeable
differences in terms of stability of crystallographic orientations for ESRed or
DSRed and heat treated alloy, were noted.

  strongly heterogeneous environment: how normal?",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When studying the dynamics of trait distribution of populations in a
heterogeneous environment, classical models from quantitative genetics choose
to look at its system of moments, specifically the first two ones.
Additionally, in order to close the resulting system of equations, they often
assume that the trait distribution is Gaussian (see for instance Ronce and
Kirkpatrick 2001). The aim of this paper is to introduce a mathematical
framework that follows the whole trait distribution (without prior assumption)
to study evolutionary dynamics of sexually reproducing populations.
Specifically, it focuses on complex traits, whose inheritance can be encoded by
the infinitesimal model of segregation (Fisher 1919). We show that it allows us
to derive a regime in which our model gives the same dynamics as when assuming
a Gaussian trait distribution. To support that, we compare the stationary
problems of the system of moments derived from our model with the one given in
Ronce and Kirkpatrick 2001 and show that they are equivalent under this regime
and do not need to be otherwise. Moreover, under this regime of equivalence, we
show that a separation bewteen ecological and evolutionary time scales arises.
A fast relaxation toward monomorphism allows us to reduce the complexity of the
system of moments, using a slow-fast analysis. This reduction leads us to
complete, still in this regime, the analytical description of the bistable
asymmetrical equilibria numerically found in Ronce and Kirkpatrick 2001. More
globally, we provide explicit modelling hypotheses that allow for such local
adaptation patterns to occur.

  Terms to Revise Patent Classification Codes",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Japanese patents are assigned a patent classification code, FI (File Index),
that is unique to Japan. FI is a subdivision of the IPC, an international
patent classification code, that is related to Japanese technology. FIs are
revised to keep up with technological developments. These revisions have
already established more than 30,000 new FIs since 2006. However, these
revisions require a lot of time and workload. Moreover, these revisions are not
automated and are thus inefficient. Therefore, using machine learning to assist
in the revision of patent classification codes (FI) will lead to improved
accuracy and efficiency. This study analyzes patent documents from this new
perspective of assisting in the revision of patent classification codes with
machine learning. To analyze time-series changes in patents, we used the
dynamic topic model (DTM), which is an extension of the latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA). Also, unlike English, the Japanese language requires
morphological analysis. Patents contain many technical words that are not used
in everyday life, so morphological analysis using a common dictionary is not
sufficient. Therefore, we used a technique for extracting technical terms from
text. After extracting technical terms, we applied them to DTM. In this study,
we determined the technological progress of the lighting class F21 for 14 years
and compared it with the actual revision of patent classification codes. In
other words, we extracted technical terms from Japanese patents and applied DTM
to determine the progress of Japanese technology. Then, we analyzed the results
from the new perspective of revising patent classification codes with machine
learning. As a result, it was found that those whose topics were on the rise
were judged to be new technologies.

pixel in different spectral bands, which can be used to effectively distinguish
various objects in complex scenes. While HSI cameras have become low cost,
algorithms based on it have not been well exploited. In this paper, we focus on
a novel topic, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in cityscape via HSIs.
It is based on the idea that high-resolution HSIs in city scenes contain rich
spectral information, which can be easily associated to semantics without
manual labeling. Therefore, it enables low cost, highly reliable semantic
segmentation in complex scenes. Specifically, in this paper, we theoretically
analyze the HSIs and introduce a weakly-supervised HSI semantic segmentation
framework, which utilizes spectral information to improve the coarse labels to
a finer degree. The experimental results show that our method can obtain highly
competitive labels and even have higher edge fineness than artificial fine
labels in some classes. At the same time, the results also show that the
refined labels can effectively improve the effect of semantic segmentation. The
combination of HSIs and semantic segmentation proves that HSIs have great
potential in high-level visual tasks.

method does not produce and encode any transition or equivalence relation of

those transition or equivalence relations that are required in the verification
process of CTLK formulas. This policy can save a lot of time and space since
the number of transition or equivalence relations of states is much greater

attention for their ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In
order to solve other type of optimization problems, it is necessary to apply
certain kinds of mathematical transformations. However, linear constraints
reduce the size of problems that can be represented in quantum annealers, owing
to the sparseness of connections between qubits. For example, the quadratic
assignment problem (QAP) with linear equality constraints can be solved only up
to size 12 in the quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, which has 5640 qubits. To
overcome this obstacle, Ohzeki developed a method for relaxing the linear
equality constraints and numerically verified the effectiveness of this method
with some target problems, but others remain unsolvable. In particular, it is
difficult to obtain feasible solutions to problems with hard constraints, such
as the QAP. We therefore propose a method for solving the QAP with quantum
annealing by applying a post-processing bit-flip heuristic algorithm to
solutions obtained by the Ohzeki method. In a numerical experiment, we solved a
sparse QAP by the proposed method. This sparse QAP has been used in areas such
as item listing on an E-commerce website. We successfully solved a QAP of size
19 with high accuracy for the first time using D-Wave Advantage. We also
confirmed that the bit-flip heuristic algorithm moves infeasible solutions to
nearby feasible solutions in terms of Hamming distance with good computational
efficiency.

are successfully described by Landau Fermi liquid theory with quasi-particles
and their Fermi surfaces (FSs). The FSs sometimes become deformed or gapped at
low temperatures owing to quasi-particle interactions, known as FS
instabilities. A notable example of a FS deformation that breaks only the
rotation symmetry, namely Pomeranchuk instability, is the d-wave FS distortion,
which is also proposed as one possible origin of electron nematicity in
iron-based superconductors. However, no clear evidence has been made for its
existence, mostly owing to the mixture of multiple orders. Here we report an
unequivocally observation of the Pomeranchuk nematic order in floating
monolayer (ML) FeSe on 1 ML-FeSe/SrTiO3 substrate. By using angle-resolve
photoemission spectroscopy, we find remarkably that the dxz and dyz bands are
degenerate at the Brillouin zone center (Gamma point), while their splitting is
even larger at zone corner (M point), in stark contrast to that in bulk FeSe.
Our detailed analysis show that the momentum-dependent nematic order in
floating monolayer FeSe is coming from the d-wave Pomeranchuk instability at M
point, shedding light on the origin of the ubiquitous nematicity in iron-based
superconductors. Our results establish the single-layer high-Tc superconductors
as an excellent material platform for investigating emergent quantum physics

influencing the shape of the liquid surface prior to the impact, and the
distribution of loads created upon impact. We study the effect of trapped air
on impact loads in a simplified geometry, by slamming a horizontal flat disc
onto a stationary water bath at a well-controlled velocity. We show how air
trapping influences pressure peaks at different radial locations on the disc,
how the pressure impulses are affected, and how local pressure impulses differ
from those obtained from area-integrated (force) impulses at impact. More
specifically, we find that the air layer causes a gradual buildup of the load
before the peak value is reached, and show that this buildup follows inertial
scaling. Further, the same localised pressure impulse at the disc centre are
found to be lower than the corresponding (area-integrated) force impulse on the
entire disc. While the (area-integrated) force impulses are close to the
classical result of Batchelor (1967, section 6.10) and Glasheen & McMahon

from the lowest temperatures up to the glass transition, in terms of three
compatible phenomenological models. Resonant tunneling, the rise of the
relaxational tunneling to the tunneling plateau and the crossover to classical
relaxation are universal features of glasses and are well described by the
tunneling model and its extension to include soft vibrations and low barrier
relaxations, the soft potential model. Its further extension to non-universal
features at higher temperatures is the very flexible Gilroy-Phillips model,
which allows to determine the barrier density of the energy landscape of the
specific glass from the frequency and temperature dependence of the sound wave
absorption in the classical relaxation domain. To apply it properly at elevated
temperatures, one needs its formulation in terms of the shear compliance. As
one approaches the glass transition, universality sets in again with an
exponential rise of the barrier density reflecting the frozen fast Kohlrausch
t^beta-tail (in time t, with beta close to 1/2) of the viscous flow at the
glass temperature. The validity of the scheme is checked for literature data of
several glasses and polymers with and without secondary relaxation peaks. The
frozen Kohlrausch tail of the mechanical relaxation shows no indication of the

arising from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), provides many
opportunities for strengthening causal inference. One popular approach is to
utilize these many-dimensional measurements as instrumental variables
(instruments) for improving the causal effect estimate between other pairs of
variables. Unfortunately, searching for proper instruments in a
many-dimensional set of candidates is a daunting task due to the intractable
model space and the fact that we cannot directly test which of these candidates
are valid, so most existing search methods either rely on overly stringent
modeling assumptions or fail to capture the inherent model uncertainty in the
selection process. We show that, as long as at least some of the candidates are
(close to) valid, without knowing a priori which ones, they collectively still
pose enough restrictions on the target interaction to obtain a reliable causal
effect estimate. We propose a general and efficient causal inference algorithm
that accounts for model uncertainty by performing Bayesian model averaging over
the most promising many-dimensional instrumental variable models, while at the
same time employing weaker assumptions regarding the data generating process.
We showcase the efficiency, robustness and predictive performance of our
algorithm through experimental results on both simulated and real-world data.

threshold over time to keep it aligned with the unknown offered load of the

equilibrium along intervals of time where the normalized offered load per

distribution of the load. Furthermore, we establish a similar result when tasks
with Coxian distributed service times arrive at a constant rate and the
threshold is adjusted using only the total number of tasks in the system. The
novel proof technique developed in this paper, which differs from a traditional
fluid limit analysis, allows to handle rapid variations of the first learning

We consider a circumprimary parent body (PB) planetesimal belt that is placed
just inside the stability limit between the 2 stars and use the DyCoSS code to
follow the coupled dynamical and collisional evolution of the dust produced by
this PB belt. We explore several free parameters such as the belt's mass or the
binary's mass ratio and orbit. We use the GraTeR package to produce 2-D
luminosity maps and system-integrated SEDs. We confirm a preliminary result
obtained by earlier DyCoSS studies, which is that the coupled effect of
collisional activity, binary perturbations and stellar radiation pressure
maintains a halo of small grains in the dynamically unstable region between the
2 stars. In addition, several spatial structures are identified, notably a
single spiral arm stretching all the way from the PB belt to the companion
star. We also identify a fainter and more compact disc around the secondary
star, which is non-native and feeds off small grains from the unstable halo.
Both the halo, spiral arm and secondary disc should be detectable on resolved
images by instruments with capacities similar to SPHERE. The system as a whole
is depleted in small grains when compared to a companion-free case. This
depletion leaves an imprint on the system's integrated SED, which appears
colder than for the same parent body belt around a single star. This new
finding could explain why the SED-derived location $r_{disc}$ of some
unresolved discs-in-binaries places their primary belt in the dynamically
""forbidden"" region between the 2 stars: this apparent paradox could indeed be
due to overestimating $r_{disc}$ when using empirical prescriptions valid for a

models of gossip-like appraisal dynamics, the symmetry-influence-homophily
(SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily (SIOH) dynamics. In
these models, the appraisal network starting from any initial condition almost
surely achieves non-all-to-all triad-wise and two-faction structural balance in
finite time respectively. Moreover, the SIOH dynamics capture the co-evolution
of interpersonal appraisals and individuals' opinions. Regarding the
theoretical contributions, we show that the equilibrium set of the SIH (SIOH
resp.) dynamics corresponds to the set of all the possible triad-wise
(two-faction resp.) structural balance configurations of the appraisal
networks. Moreover, we prove that, for any initial condition, the appraisal
networks in the SIH (SIOH resp.) dynamics almost surely achieve triad-wise
(two-faction resp.) structural balance in finite time. Numerical studies of the
SIH dynamics also imply some insightful take-home messages on whether
multilateral relations reduce or exacerbate conflicts.

by the presence of shearing. The yield surfaces are found to be consistent with
the combination of two models proposed in the literature, a GTN-type model
calibrated for homogeneous yielding of random porous materials and an
inhomogeneous yielding model accounting for both coalescence with or without
shear. Finite strain simulations performed for different hardening moduli and
stress triaxialities under axisymmetric loading conditions confirm the
existence of a RVE up to the onset of inhomogeneous yielding. Coalescence

a novel Machine-Learning (ML) framework that analyses which files were modified

$e^+e^-$ collisions to observe events with missing four-momentum -- a signature
not available at hadron colliders, where only transverse imbalance is
observable. Due to low backgrounds and trigger-less operation, detectors at
$e^+e^-$ colliders can observe events with much less visible energy than what
is possible at hadron colliders. In this contribution, we will present detailed
simulation studies done with the ILD concept at the ILC. These studies include
simulation of the full SM background, as well as realistic accelerator

periodicity of $\sim12$ times the pulsar's rotational period ($P$). The
$\sim12P$ modulation is confirmed as a periodic amplitude modulation instead of
systematic drifting. The periodic amplitude modulation in the IP is found to be
anti-correlated with that in the weak preceding component of the MP (MP_I), but
correlated with that in the first two components of the MP (MP_II), which
implies that the modulation patterns in the IP and the MP are phase-locked.

weak emission exists between the MP and the IP. In addition, we confirm that
the separation between the IP and the MP is independent of radio frequency. The

active flow control (AFC) around a 2-D circular cylinder. Flow control
strategies are investigated at a diameter-based Reynolds number Re_D = 100
using advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm by means of two symmetric plasma
actuators located on the surface of the cylinder near the separation point. The
DRL agent interacts with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment
through manipulating the non-dimensional burst frequency (f^+) of the two
plasma actuators, and the time-averaged surface pressure is used as a feedback
observation to the deep neural networks (DNNs). The results show that a regular
actuation using a constant non-dimensional burst frequency gives a maximum drag
reduction of 21.8 %, while the DRL agent is able to learn a control strategy
that achieves a drag reduction of 22.6%. By analyzing the flow-field, it is
shown that the drag reduction is accompanied with a strong flow reattachment

Mendelian randomization - is a popular epidemiological method for estimating
the causal effect of an exposure (phenotype, biomarker, risk factor) on a
disease or health-related outcome from observational data. Instrumental
variables must satisfy strong, often untestable assumptions, which means that
finding good genetic instruments among a large list of potential candidates is
challenging. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that many genetic
variants influence more than one phenotype through different causal pathways, a
phenomenon called horizontal pleiotropy. This leads to errors not only in
estimating the magnitude of the causal effect but also in inferring the
direction of the putative causal link. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
approach called BayesMR that is a generalization of the Mendelian randomization
technique in which we allow for pleiotropic effects and, crucially, for the
possibility of reverse causation. The output of the method is a posterior
distribution over the target causal effect, which provides an immediate and
easily interpretable measure of the uncertainty in the estimation. More
importantly, we use Bayesian model averaging to determine how much more likely
the inferred direction is relative to the reverse direction.

catalogs. To ensure precision cosmology studies are unbiased, the correlations
in these mocks between galaxy properties and their large-scale environments
must be realistic. Since galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos, an
important first step is to include such correlations -- sometimes called
assembly bias -- for dark matter halos. However, galaxy properties correlate
with smaller scale physics in halos which large simulations struggle to
resolve. We describe an algorithm which addresses and largely mitigates this
problem. Our algorithm exploits the fact that halo assembly bias is unchanged
as long as correlations between halo property $c$ and the intermediate-scale
tidal environment $\alpha$ are preserved. Therefore, knowledge of $\alpha$ is
sufficient to assign small-scale, otherwise unresolved properties to a halo in
a way which preserves its large-scale assembly bias accurately. We demonstrate
this explicitly for halo internal properties like formation history

this paper, we formulate the drafting process as a multi-round combinatorial

Monte-Carlo tree search, named JueWuDraft. Specifically, we design a long-term
value estimation mechanism to handle the best-of-N drafting case. Taking Honor

demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of JueWuDraft when compared to

to probabilistic terminations. To favor availability against consistency in the
face of partitions, most blockchains only offer probabilistic eventual
finality: blocks may be revoked after being appended to the blockchain, yet
with decreasing probability as they sink deeper into the chain. Other
blockchains favor consistency by leveraging the immediate finality of
Consensus-a block appended is never revoked-at the cost of additional
synchronization. In this paper, we focus on necessary and sufficient conditions
to implement a blockchain with deterministic eventual finality, which ensures
that selected main chains at different processes share a common increasing
prefix. This is a much weaker form of finality that allows us to provide a
solution in an asynchronous system subject to unlimited number of byzantine
failures. We study stronger forms of eventual finality as well and show that it
is unfortunately impossible to provide a bounded displacement. By bounded
displacement we mean that the (unknown) number of blocks that can be revoked
from the current blockchain is bounded. This problem reduces to consensus or
eventual consensus depending on whether the bound is known or not. We also show
that the classical selection mechanism, such as in Bitcoin, that appends blocks
at the longest chain is not compliant with a solution to eventual finality.

molecular clouds. It is easily observable with several transitions in the
millimeter wavelength range, and has been widely used as a tracer of the gas
density in the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and external galaxies.
Chemical models fail to account for the observed CS abundances when assuming
the cosmic value for the elemental abundance of sulfur. The CS+O -> CO + S
reaction has been proposed as a relevant CS destruction mechanism at low
temperatures, and could explain the discrepancy between models and
observations. Its reaction rate has been experimentally measured at
temperatures of 150-400 K, but the extrapolation to lower temperatures is
doubtful. Here we calculate the CS+O reaction rate at temperatures <150 K which
are prevailing in the interstellar medium. We performed ab initio calculations
to obtain the three lowest PES of the CS+O system. These PESs are used to study
the reaction dynamics, using several methods to eventually calculate the CS+O
thermal reaction rates. We compare the results of our theoretical calculations
for 150-400 K with those obtained in the laboratory. Our detailed theoretical
study on the CS+O reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental data
obtained at 150-400 K, demonstrates the reliability of our approach. After a
careful analysis at lower temperatures, we find that the rate constant at 10 K
is negligible, which is consistent with the extrapolation of experimental data
using the Arrhenius expression. We use the updated chemical network to model
the sulfur chemistry in TMC1 based on molecular abundances determined from GEMS
project observations. In our model, we take into account the expected decrease
of the cosmic ray ionization rate along the cloud. The abundance of CS is still
overestimated when assuming the cosmic value for the sulfur abundance.

\solrad{} above the flare site. Emissions below $\sim$10 keV revealed a hot,
extended (11 MK, >60 arcsec) thermal source from the escaping CME core, with
densities around $10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$. In such a tenuous hot plasma, ionization
times scales are several minutes, consistent with the non-detection of the hot
CME core in SDO/AIA's 131 \AA{} filter. The non-thermal RHESSI source
originated from an even larger area ($\sim$100 arcsec) at lower densities
($10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$) located above the hot core, but still behind the CME
front. This indicates that the observed part of the non-thermal electrons are
not responsible for heating the CME core. Possibly the hot core was heated by
non-thermal electrons before it became visible from Earth, meaning that the
un-occulted part of the non-thermal emission likely originates from a more
tenuous part of the CME core, where non-thermal electrons survive long enough
to became visible from Earth. Simultaneous hard X-ray spectra from the Mars
Odyssey mission, which viewed the flare on disk, indicated that the number of

linear carbon chain (carbyne) using density functional theory (DFT) and the
random phase approximation (RPA) to the correlation energy. The studies are
performed in vacuo and for carbyne inside a carbon nano tube (CNT). In the
vacuum, semi-local DFT and RPA predict bond length alternations of about 0.04
{\AA} and 0.13 {\AA}, respectively. The frequency of the highest optical mode
at the $\Gamma$ point is 1219 cm$^{-1}$ and about 2000 cm$^{-1}$ for DFT and
the RPA. Agreement of the RPA to previous high level quantum chemistry and
diffusion Monte-Carlo results is excellent. For the RPA we calculate the
phonon-dispersion in the full Brillouine zone and find marked quantitative
differences to DFT calculations not only at the $\Gamma$ point but also
throughout the entire Brillouine zone. To model carbyne inside a carbon
nanotube, we considered a (10,0) CNT. Here the DFT calculations are even
qualitatively sensitive to the k-points sampling. At the limes of a very dense
k-points sampling, semi-local DFT predicts no bond length alternation (BLA),
whereas in the RPA a sizeable BLA of 0.09 {\AA} prevails. The reduced BLA leads
to a significant red shift of the vibrational frequencies of about 350
cm$^{-1}$, so that they are in good agreement with experimental estimates.
Overall, the good agreement between the RPA and previously reported results
from correlated wavefunction methods and experimental Raman data suggests that
the RPA provides reliable results at moderate computational costs. It hence
presents a useful addition to the repertoire of correlated wavefunction methods
and its accuracy clearly prevails for low dimensional systems, where semi-local
density functionals struggle to yield even qualitatively correct results.

or black hole) in general relativity. The body's exterior metric is calculated
in a simultaneous expansion in powers of the ratio between the distance to the
body and three distinct length scales: the radius of curvature of the external
spacetime in which the body is inserted, the scale of spatial inhomogeneity of
the curvature, and the scale of temporal variation. The metric is valid in the
body's immediate neighborhood, which excludes the external matter responsible
for the tidal environment. The body's tidal response is encapsulated in four
types of relativistic Love numbers: $k_\ell$, the familiar Love number that
measures the linear response to a static tidal field, $p_\ell$, which measures
the quadratic response to the tidal field, $\dot{k}_\ell$ and $\ddot{k}_\ell$,
associated with first and second time derivatives of the tidal field,
respectively. The Love numbers acquire an operational meaning through the
definition of tidally induced multipole moments. Previously proposed
definitions for the moments suffer from ambiguities associated with the
subtraction of a ""pure tidal field"" from the full metric. A robust operational
definition is proposed here. It relies on inserting the body's local metric
within a global metric constructed in post-Newtonian theory; the global metric
includes the external matter responsible for the tidal environment. When viewed
in the post-Newtonian spacetime, the compact body appears as a skeletonized
object with a specific multipole structure. The tidally induced multipole
moments provide a description of this structure. They manifest themselves, for
example, in the body's tidal acceleration, which is nonlinear in the tidal
field. At leading order in the tidal interaction, the acceleration is
proportional to the $k_2$ Love number as calculated in full general relativity.

problem, we propose a novel Regularized Attentive Capsule Network (RA-CapNet)
to better identify highly overlapped relations in each informal sentence. To
discover multiple relation features in an instance, we embed multi-head
attention into the capsule network as the low-level capsules, where the
subtraction of two entities acts as a new form of relation query to select
salient features regardless of their positions. To further discriminate
overlapped relation features, we devise disagreement regularization to
explicitly encourage the diversity among both multiple attention heads and
low-level capsules. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets
show that our model achieves significant improvements in relation extraction.

computation. Within concurrency theory, there is a broad divide between
interleaving models and logics, which model concurrency by non-determinism, and
`truly concurrent' models, in which concurrency (and/or causality) are directly
represented. True concurrency gives much richer models and logics, but is also
harder to work with, as the interactions of causality and concurrency can
become complex.
  In probabilistic computation, we have by now many well understood
probabilistic models and logics on interleaving models, developed over the last
thirty years or so. However, for true concurrency, adding probability has been
much harder, owing to the interactions between probabilistic independence and
causal/concurrent independence, piling both conceptual and technical
difficulties upon an already complex model. Various notions of, e.g.,
probabilistic Petri net have been introduced, but for simpler cases such as
free-choice nets.
  A significant contribution in the last decade was Abbes and Benveniste 2006,
which gave a rigorous foundation for probabilistic concurrency in terms of
Winskel's event structures, which can be seen as the lowest level of
concurrent/causal modelling. However, event structures are themselves not ideal
for representing richer high-level models such as (arbitrary) Petri nets, as
the concurrency is derived from a binary conflict relation.
  Here we develop an extension of the theory of Abbes and Benveniste to a more
general class of models, a certain subclass of `stable event structures'. This
class is sufficient to give a semantics to probabilistic Petri nets (including
the notoriously awkward notion of confusion, which is forbidden by free-choice
nets), and thereby allows the definition of general probabilistic logics for
Petri nets.

scale variation, density inconsistency, and complex background can seriously
degrade the counting accuracy. To battle the ingrained issue of accuracy
degradation, we propose a novel and powerful network called Scale Tree Network
(STNet) for accurate crowd counting. STNet consists of two key components: a
Scale-Tree Diversity Enhancer and a Semi-supervised Multi-level Auxiliator.
Specifically, the Diversity Enhancer is designed to enrich scale diversity,
which alleviates limitations of existing methods caused by insufficient level
of scales. A novel tree structure is adopted to hierarchically parse
coarse-to-fine crowd regions. Furthermore, a simple yet effective Multi-level
Auxiliator is presented to aid in exploiting generalisable shared
characteristics at multiple levels, allowing more accurate pixel-wise

without the needs for manually tuning loss weights between the main and the

This asymmetry is observed both in cycle amplitude and period. We have used

study the North--South asymmetry in sunspot activity. The monthly mean
sunspot-area showed the northern hemisphere dominated in Solar Cycles 16, 19,

13-months smoothed data indicated that in Cycle 17 and 21, the northern and
southern hemisphere showed equal amplitude. Cumulative sunspot area showed that
the northern hemisphere dominated in Cycles 18, 19, 20, and 21, with a large
difference between the two hemispheres in Cycles 19 and 20. The northern
hemisphere activity led by 12, 15, and 2 months in Cycles 20, 21, and 22,
respectively. No significant phase difference is found between the two
hemispheres in Cycles 16, 17, 18, 19, and 23. The wavelet technique is used to
find Rieger-type periodicities in the sunspot cycles. The cross-wavelet
analysis of these data sets showed several statistically significant common
periodicities like the Rieger-type periodicities and Quasi-biennial
oscillations. The Gnevyshev gap was found in both the hemispheric data in
Cycles 16, 18, 21, 22, and 23. These results are consistent with the earlier
reported characteristics of North--South asymmetry in sunspot-area data. These

spatial-channel attention module at the end of the network, which not only
captures the global interdependencies between points but also models

TDE host galaxy shows narrow optical emission lines that likely arise from star

optical. The X-ray emission becomes undetected after $\sim$125 days, and the
radio luminosity density starts to decay at frequencies above 5.4 GHz by
$\sim$180 days. Optical emission line signatures of the TDE are present up to
$\sim$250 days after the discovery of the transient. The medium to high
resolution spectra show traces of absorption lines that we propose originate in
the self-gravitating debris streams. At late times, after $\sim$200 days,
narrow Fe lines appear in the spectra. The TDE was previously classified as
N-strong, but after careful subtraction of the host galaxy's stellar
contribution, we find no evidence for these N lines in the TDE spectrum, even

emission are fully consistent with the detection of the inner regions of a

Stellar atmospheric parameters $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, and [Fe/H] were
retrieved from the literature or determined using an homogeneous method.
$M_\star$, $R_\star$, and ages were determined from isochrone fitting. We
analysed the CE distribution for the different luminosity classes and spectral
types and confirmed the existence of the very inactive stars (VIS) and very
active stars (VAS) populations at $\log R'_\text{HK}< -5.1$ and $> -4.2$ dex,

of subgiant and giant stars and that $\log R'_\text{HK}= -5.1$ dex marks a
transition in stellar evolution. There appears to be at least three regimes of
variability, for inactive, active and very active stars, with the inactive and
active regimes separated by a diagonal Vaughan-Preston gap. We show that stars
with low activity levels do not necessarily have low variability. In the case
of K dwarfs which show high CE variability, inactive and active stars have
similar levels of activity variability. This means that activity levels alone
are not enough to infer about the activity variability of a star. We also
explained the shape of the VP gap observed in the distribution of CE by using

with interactions. Many real-world problems have large state-spaces and/or
action-spaces such as in Go, StarCraft, protein folding, and robotics or are
non-Markovian, which cause significant challenges to RL algorithms. In this
work we address the large action-space problem by sequentializing actions,
which can reduce the action-space size significantly, even down to two actions
at the expense of an increased planning horizon. We provide explicit and exact
constructions and equivalence proofs for all quantities of interest for
arbitrary history-based processes. In the case of MDPs, this could help RL
algorithms that bootstrap. In this work we show how action-binarization in the
non-MDP case can significantly improve Extreme State Aggregation (ESA) bounds.
ESA allows casting any (non-MDP, non-ergodic, history-based) RL problem into a
fixed-sized non-Markovian state-space with the help of a surrogate Markovian
process. On the upside, ESA enjoys similar optimality guarantees as Markovian
models do. But a downside is that the size of the aggregated state-space
becomes exponential in the size of the action-space. In this work, we patch
this issue by binarizing the action-space. We provide an upper bound on the
number of states of this binarized ESA that is logarithmic in the original
action-space size, a double-exponential improvement.

industry. It is often necessary to run programs of exclusive experiments, i.e.,
experiments that cannot be run on the same units during the same time. These
programs implies restriction on the random sampling, as units that are
currently in an experiment cannot be sampled into a new one. Moreover, to
technically enable this type of coordination with large populations, the units
in the population are often grouped into 'buckets' and sampling is then
performed on the bucket level. This paper investigates some statistical
implications of both the restricted sampling and the bucket-level sampling. The
contribution of this paper is threefold: First, bucket sampling is connected to
the existing literature on randomized experiments in complex sampling designs
which enables establishing properties of the difference-in-means estimator of
the average treatment effect. These properties are needed for inference to the
population under random sampling of buckets. Second, the bias introduced by
restricting the sampling as imposed by programs of exclusive experiments, is
derived. Finally, simulation results supporting the theoretical findings are
presented together with recommendations on how to empirically evaluate and
handle this bias.

such contexts, an agent may decide to strategically withhold some of her
features, such as bad test scores. This is a missing data problem with a twist:
which data is missing {\em depends on the chosen classifier}, because the
specific classifier is what may create the incentive to withhold certain
feature values. We address the problem of training classifiers that are robust
to this behavior.
  We design three classification methods: {\sc Mincut}, {\sc Hill-Climbing}
({\sc HC}) and Incentive-Compatible Logistic Regression ({\sc IC-LR}). We show
that {\sc Mincut} is optimal when the true distribution of data is fully known.
However, it can produce complex decision boundaries, and hence be prone to
overfitting in some cases. Based on a characterization of truthful classifiers
(i.e., those that give no incentive to strategically hide features), we devise
a simpler alternative called {\sc HC} which consists of a hierarchical ensemble
of out-of-the-box classifiers, trained using a specialized hill-climbing
procedure which we show to be convergent. For several reasons, {\sc Mincut} and
{\sc HC} are not effective in utilizing a large number of complementarily
informative features. To this end, we present {\sc IC-LR}, a modification of
Logistic Regression that removes the incentive to strategically drop features.
We also show that our algorithms perform well in experiments on real-world data

polarizable atom moving at a constant speed parallel to a metallic plate. The
metal is described using a charged hydrodynamic model for the electrons. This
model featuring long-range interactions is appropriate for a clean metal in a
temperature range where scattering due to Coulomb interactions dominates over
the scattering of electron by impurities. We find that a quantum friction force
between the atom and the metal surface exists even in the absence of intrinsic
damping in the metal, but that it only starts once the velocity of the atom
exceeds the effective speed of sound in the metal. We argue that this condition
can be fulfilled most easily in metals with nearly empty or nearly filled
bands. We make quantitative predictions for the friction force to the second

mechanical properties such as adhesion or dissipation can be mapped. The
inhomogeneous swelling behaviour was recorded via confocal laser scanning

the local macroscopic fibril orientation and provided an overview of the fibre

one hand, it should ensure the quality of known intent identification. On the

knowledge. Current models are limited in finding the appropriate decision
boundary to balance the performances of both known intents and the open intent.
In this paper, we propose a post-processing method to learn the adaptive
decision boundary (ADB) for open intent classification. We first utilize the
labeled known intent samples to pre-train the model. Then, we automatically
learn the adaptive spherical decision boundary for each known class with the
aid of well-trained features. Specifically, we propose a new loss function to
balance both the empirical risk and the open space risk. Our method does not
need open intent samples and is free from modifying the model architecture.
Moreover, our approach is surprisingly insensitive with less labeled data and
fewer known intents. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show
that our method yields significant improvements compared with the

However, there are several challenges in financial markets hindering practical
applications of machine learning-based models. First, in financial markets,
there is no single model that can consistently make accurate prediction because
traders in markets quickly adapt to newly available information. Instead, there
are a number of ephemeral and partially correct models called ""alpha factors"".
Second, since financial markets are highly uncertain, ensuring interpretability
of prediction models is quite important to make reliable trading strategies. To
overcome these challenges, we propose the Trader-Company method, a novel
evolutionary model that mimics the roles of a financial institute and traders
belonging to it. Our method predicts future stock returns by aggregating
suggestions from multiple weak learners called Traders. A Trader holds a
collection of simple mathematical formulae, each of which represents a
candidate of an alpha factor and would be interpretable for real-world
investors. The aggregation algorithm, called a Company, maintains multiple
Traders. By randomly generating new Traders and retraining them, Companies can
efficiently find financially meaningful formulae whilst avoiding overfitting to
a transient state of the market. We show the effectiveness of our method by

and \emph{equalized odds}, try to equalize absolute measures of performance
across known groups (based on race, gender, etc.). Consequently, a group that
is inherently harder to classify may hold back the performance on other groups;
and no guarantees can be provided for unforeseen groups. Instead, we propose a
fairness notion whose guarantee, on each group $g$ in a class $\mathcal{G}$, is
relative to the performance of the best classifier on $g$. We apply this notion
to broad classes of groups, in particular, where (a) $\mathcal{G}$ consists of
all possible groups (subsets) in the data, and (b) $\mathcal{G}$ is more
streamlined.
  For the first setting, which is akin to groups being completely unknown, we
devise the {\sc PF} (Proportional Fairness) classifier, which guarantees, on
any possible group $g$, an accuracy that is proportional to that of the optimal
classifier for $g$, scaled by the relative size of $g$ in the data set. Due to
including all possible groups, some of which could be too complex to be
relevant, the worst-case theoretical guarantees here have to be proportionally
weaker for smaller subsets.
  For the second setting, we devise the {\sc BeFair} (Best-effort Fair)
framework which seeks an accuracy, on every $g \in \mathcal{G}$, which
approximates that of the optimal classifier on $g$, independent of the size of
$g$. Aiming for such a guarantee results in a non-convex problem, and we design
novel techniques to get around this difficulty when $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of
linear hypotheses. We test our algorithms on real-world data sets, and present
interesting comparative insights on their performance.

(SegGroup) to generate point-level pseudo labels under seg-level labels by
hierarchically grouping the unlabeled segments into the relevant nearby labeled
segments, so that existing point-level supervised segmentation models can
directly consume these pseudo labels for training. Experimental results show
that our seg-level supervised method (SegGroup) achieves comparable results

C2 seen on-disk for both instruments, we found an empirical relationship
between the soft X-ray (SXR) fluxes measured by both SAX and GOES. Due to the

the Q operator explicitly in terms of finite-dimensional matrices. From its
decomposition we derive truncated fusion and Wronskian relations as well as an
interpolation-type formula that has been conjectured previously. We elucidate
the Fabricius-McCoy (FM) strings and exponential degeneracies in the spectrum
of the six-vertex transfer matrix at root of unity. Using a semicyclic
auxiliary representation we give a conjecture for creation and annihilation
operators of FM strings for all roots of unity. We connect our findings with
the 'string-charge duality' in the thermodynamic limit, leading to a conjecture
for the imaginary part of the FM string centres with potential applications to
out-of-equilibrium physics.

cooperative communication network, where the IRS exploits large reflecting
elements to proactively steer the incident radio-frequency wave towards
destination terminals (DTs). As the number of reflecting elements increases,
the reflection resource allocation (RRA) will become urgently needed in this
context, which is due to the non-ignorable energy consumption. The goal of this
paper, therefore, is to realize the RRA besides the active-passive beamforming
design, where RRA is based on the introduced modular IRS architecture. The
modular IRS consists with multiple modules, each of which has multiple
reflecting elements and is equipped with a smart controller, all the
controllers can communicate with each other in a point-to-point fashion via
fiber links. Consequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize
the minimum SINR at DTs, subject to the module size constraint and both
individual source terminal (ST) transmit power and the reflecting coefficients
constraints. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due to the module size constraint,
we develop an approximate solution by introducing the mixed row block
$\ell_{1,F}$-norm to transform it into a suitable semidefinite relaxation.
Finally, numerical results demonstrate the meaningfulness of the introduced
modular IRS architecture.

In this paper, we present AdvExpander, a method that crafts new adversarial

which constituents to expand and what types of modifiers to expand with. We
then expand each constituent by inserting an adversarial modifier searched from
a CVAE-based generative model which is pre-trained on a large scale corpus. To
search adversarial modifiers, we directly search adversarial latent codes in
the latent space without tuning the pre-trained parameters. To ensure that our
adversarial examples are label-preserving for text matching, we also constrain
the modifications with a heuristic rule. Experiments on three classification
tasks verify the effectiveness of AdvExpander and the validity of our

text expansion, thereby promising to reveal new robustness issues.

In the rotating system, wind gusts lead to variations in the angle of attack at
local blade segments resulting in dynamic effects such as dynamic stall. Such
highly non-linear effects are known to produce a significant overshoot in the
lift and thus an increase in loads acting on the wind turbine, leading to
long-term fatigue. To better understand these effects, it is essential to
perform experiments under defined conditions on 2D airfoil segments in the wind
tunnel. In this study, a so-called 2D active grid is presented which allows to
generate local inflow conditions with defined fluctuations of the angle of
incidence (AoI) in wind tunnel experiments. The focus of the investigations is
on sinusoidal variations of AoI with high amplitudes generated by different
grid configurations. By changing the AoI dynamic phenomena can be induced
without the need to move the object under investigation. Inertial effects
during force measurements and a changing shadow casting due to a moving airfoil
in particle image velocimetry measurements do not appear. Additional variations
in the longitudinal velocity component are another aspect in the presented
work. Such longitudinal gusts can be combined with AoI variations in arbitrary
phase. This can be used to mimic various inflow situations such as yaw or tower
shadow effects on wind turbines.

reformulated in terms of receding horizon strategy such that a locally receding
horizon optimization is obtained for each subsystem with a pre-established
prediction horizon. The algorithm guarantees that not only the nominal overall
closed-loop system without any constraint is recoverable but also the state and
control constraints are satisfied in transient conditions. Also, considering
unfeasible reference signals, the output of any subsystem goes locally to the
nearest feasible value. The proposed dynamic constraint tightening strategy
uses a receding horizon to reduce the conservatism of conventional robust RGs.
Moreover, a decentralized implementation of the algorithms used to compute
tightened constraints and output admissible sets is introduced that allow to
deal with large scale systems. Furthermore, a set of dynamic constraints are
presented to preserve recursive feasibility of distributed optimization
problem. Feasibility, stability, convergence, and robust constraint
satisfaction of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated. The proposed
approach is verified by simulating a system composed of three cascade jacketed

multiwavelength behavior, and is one of only a few FSRQs detected at very high
energy (VHE, $E>100\,$GeV) $\gamma$-rays. VHE $\gamma$-ray observations with
H.E.S.S. and MAGIC during late May and early June 2016 resulted in the
detection of an unprecedented flare, which reveals for the first time VHE
$\gamma$-ray intranight variability in this source. While a common variability
timescale of $1.5\,$hr is found, there is a significant deviation near the end
of the flare with a timescale of $\sim 20\,$min marking the cessation of the
event. The peak flux is nearly two orders of magnitude above the low-level
emission. For the first time, curvature is detected in the VHE $\gamma$-ray
spectrum of PKS 1510-089, which is fully explained through absorption by the
extragalactic background light. Optical R-band observations with ATOM reveal a
counterpart of the $\gamma$-ray flare, even though the detailed flux evolution
differs from the VHE ightcurve. Interestingly, a steep flux decrease is
observed at the same time as the cessation of the VHE flare. In the high energy
(HE, $E>100\,$MeV) $\gamma$-ray band only a moderate flux increase is observed
with Fermi-LAT, while the HE $\gamma$-ray spectrum significantly hardens up to
a photon index of 1.6. A search for broad-line region (BLR) absorption features
in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum indicates that the emission region is located
outside of the BLR. Radio VLBI observations reveal a fast moving knot
interacting with a standing jet feature around the time of the flare. As the
standing feature is located $\sim 50\,$pc from the black hole, the emission
region of the flare may have been located at a significant distance from the
black hole. If this correlation is indeed true, VHE $\gamma$ rays have been
produced far down the jet where turbulent plasma crosses a standing shock.

superconductivity in carbonaceous sulfur hydride (CSH) systems under high

ternary CSH compounds using generic evolutionary algorithms. Judged from the
formation enthalpy of different CSH compounds, our studies conclude that
certain levels of carbon doping (~5%-6%) in sulfur hydride (H$_3$S) in its R3m
and phases gives rise to the most-stable structure (second to the H$_3$S
itself) among the various CSH systems found. The replacement of a small amount
of sulfur atoms by carbon in compounds like C$_1$S$_{15}$H$_{48}$ and
C$_1$S$_{17}$H$_{54}$ results in a stronger electron-phonon coupling and a
higher averaged phonon frequency that increases with pressure, thereby leading
to room-temperature superconductivity at ~270 GPa. The calculated
superconducting transition temperature T$_c$ of C$_1$S$_{15}$H$_{48}$ and
C$_1$S$_{17}$H$_{54}$ as a function of pressure shows reasonably good agreement
with experimental measurements. Before transition to superconducting states at

explain the observed data in conjunction data messages, thus shedding more
light on key variables and orbital characteristics that more likely lead to
conjunction events. Moreover, our technique enables the generation of

density. We find that both initial states, when coupled to a 3D event-by-event

of basic experimental data: pseudorapidity distributions, transverse momentum
spectra and elliptic flow, at both collision energies. This is a rather
surprising, given that the $\sqrt{T_A T_B}$ ansatz is functionally similar to

implementing Coin Quantum Random Walks using a Quantum Adder based Shift
Operator, with quantum circuit designs specifically for superconducting qubits.
We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of these walks, particularly circuit
depth, gate count, connectivity requirements, and scalability. We propose and
analyze a novel approach to implementing boundary conditions for these walks,
demonstrating the technique explicitly in one and two dimensions. And finally,
we present several fidelity results from running our circuits on IBM's quantum
volume 32 `Toronto' chip, showcasing the extent to which these NISQ devices can
currently handle quantum walks.

opens while the liquid of the drop decelerates and spreads on the surface of
the crater. If the density of the drop is larger than the surrounding, the
interface between the drop liquid layer and its surrounding becomes unstable,
producing mushroom-shaped plumes growing radially outward. We interpret this
instability as a spherical Rayleigh-Taylor instability associated with the
deceleration of the interface between the drop and its surrounding, which
significantly exceeds the ambient vertical gravity. We investigate
experimentally how changing the density contrast and the impact Froude number
affects the instability and the resulting mixing layer. Using backlighting and
planar laser-induced fluorescence methods, the position of the air-liquid
interface, the thickness of the mixing layer, and an estimate of the
instability wavelength are obtained. First, the evolution of the mean crater
radius is derived from an energy conservation model. The observed mixing layer
dynamics is then explained by a model involving a competition between the
geometrical expansion of the crater tending to decrease its thickness, and
mixing produced by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability tending to increase its
thickness. The estimated instability wavelength is finally compared to an
approximate linear stability analysis of a radially accelerated fluid sphere
into a less dense fluid. Mixing properties of this impact-related instability
have geophysical implications regarding the differentiation of terrestrial
planets, in particular by estimating the mass of magma ocean silicates that
equilibrates with the metal core of the impacting planetesimals.

adversarial risk in the setup of linear regression models. By discovering the
statistical minimax rate of convergence of adversarially robust estimators, we
emphasize the importance of incorporating model information, e.g., sparsity, in

adversarial learning framework, which facilitates to utilize model structure
information to improve adversarial robustness. In theory, the consistency of
the adversarially robust estimator is proven and its Bahadur representation is
also developed for the statistical inference purpose. The proposed estimator
converges in a sharp rate under either low-dimensional or sparse scenario.
Moreover, our theory confirms two phenomena in adversarially robust learning:
adversarial robustness hurts generalization, and unlabeled data help improve
the generalization. In the end, we conduct numerical simulations to verify our
theory.

scalability of blockchains by performing transactions \emph{off-chain}. In an
off-chain payment, parties deposit coins in a channel and then perform
transactions without invoking the global consensus mechanism of the blockchain.
However, the transaction value is limited by the capacity of the channel, i.e.,
the amount of funds available on a channel. These funds decrease when a
transaction is sent and increase when a transaction is received on the channel.
Recent research indicates that there is an imbalance between sending and
receiving transactions, which leads to channel depletion in the sense that one
of these operations becomes impossible over time due to the lack of available
funds.
  We incentivize the balanced use of payment channels through fees. Whereas the
current fee model depends solely on the transaction value, our fee policies
encourage transactions that have a positive effect on the balance in a channel
and discourage those that have a negative effect. This paper first defines
necessary properties of fee strategies. Then, it introduces two novel fees
strategies that provably satisfy all necessary properties. Our extensive
simulation study reveals that these incentives increase the effectiveness of
payments by $8\%$ to $19\%$.

learn interactions between two feature spaces and has experimentally
outperformed `simpler' vector operations (concatenation and
element-wise-addition/multiplication) on VQA benchmarks. Successive BLP
techniques have yielded higher performance with lower computational expense and
are often implemented alongside attention mechanisms. However, despite
significant progress in VQA, BLP methods have not been widely applied to more
recently explored video question answering (video-QA) tasks. In this paper, we
begin to bridge this research gap by applying BLP techniques to various
video-QA benchmarks, namely: TVQA, TGIF-QA, Ego-VQA and MSVD-QA. We share our
results on the TVQA baseline model, and the recently proposed
heterogeneous-memory-enchanced multimodal attention (HME) model. Our
experiments include both simply replacing feature concatenation in the existing
models with BLP, and a modified version of the TVQA baseline to accommodate BLP
we name the `dual-stream' model. We find that our relatively simple integration
of BLP does not increase, and mostly harms, performance on these video-QA
benchmarks. Using recently proposed theoretical multimodal fusion taxonomies,
we offer insight into why BLP-driven performance gain for video-QA benchmarks
may be more difficult to achieve than in earlier VQA models. We suggest a few
additional `best-practices' to consider when applying BLP to video-QA. We
stress that video-QA models should carefully consider where the complex
representational potential from BLP is actually needed to avoid computational

the Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov hydrodynamics for a single-component
superfluid at finite temperature, but particular attention should be paid to
the fact that some fraction of the neutrons are locked to the motion of the
protons in nuclei. This gives rise to an ambiguity in the definition of the two

problem that manifests itself as a chemical gauge freedom of the theory. To
ensure chemical gauge covariance of the hydrodynamic model, the
phenomenological equation of motion for a quantized vortex should contain an
extra transverse force, that is the relativistic version of the Iordanskii
force discussed in the context of superfluid Helium. Hence, we extend the
mutual friction model of Langlois et al. (1998) to account for the possible
presence of this Iordanskii-like force. Furthermore, we propose that a better
understanding of the (still not completely settled) controversy around the
presence of the Iordanskii force in superfluid Helium, as well as in neutron

better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there
is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In
this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset
covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated
from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class
classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e.,
the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the
post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their
labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing
state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in
classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model
plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the
human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias
towards target communities. We have made our code and dataset public at

Orphan $\gamma$-ray flares. These flares having high flux only in $\gamma$-ray
energies do not show significant variations in flux at lower energies. We study
the temporal and spectral profile of these Orphan $\gamma$-ray flares in detail
from three $\gamma-ray$ bright blazars, 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279 and
also their simultaneous broadband emissions. We find that the variability
timescales of the Orphan $\gamma$-ray flares were $(0.96\pm0.28)$ days,
$(3.12\pm2.40)$ hr and $(2.16\pm0.72)$ hr, for 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279,
respectively. The broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during these
flares have been modelled with a leptonic model from two emission regions. This
model suggests that Orphan $\gamma$-ray flares might have originated from
inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the seed photons from
the broad-line region or dusty torus, which is the first region. While the
second broader region, lying further down the jet, could be responsible for
X-ray and radio emissions. The possible locations of these emission regions in
the jets of the three sources have been estimated from SED modelling.

diagnostic accuracy for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia based on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, they are not yet applied in clinical
routine. One important reason for this is a lack of model comprehensibility.
Recently developed visualization methods for deriving CNN relevance maps may
help to fill this gap. We investigated whether models with higher accuracy also
rely more on discriminative brain regions predefined by prior knowledge.
  Methods: We trained a CNN for the detection of AD in N=663 T1-weighted MRI
scans of patients with dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
and verified the accuracy of the models via cross-validation and in three
independent samples including N=1655 cases. We evaluated the association of
relevance scores and hippocampus volume to validate the clinical utility of
this approach. To improve model comprehensibility, we implemented an
interactive visualization of 3D CNN relevance maps.
  Results: Across three independent datasets, group separation showed high
accuracy for AD dementia vs. controls (AUC$\geq$0.92) and moderate accuracy for
MCI vs. controls (AUC$\approx$0.75). Relevance maps indicated that hippocampal
atrophy was considered as the most informative factor for AD detection, with
additional contributions from atrophy in other cortical and subcortical
regions. Relevance scores within the hippocampus were highly correlated with
hippocampal volumes (Pearson's r$\approx$-0.86, p<0.001).
  Conclusion: The relevance maps highlighted atrophy in regions that we had
hypothesized a priori. This strengthens the comprehensibility of the CNN
models, which were trained in a purely data-driven manner based on the scans
and diagnosis labels.

by introducing a novel multi-scale 3D point fusion network that is both
lightweight and efficient. We demonstrate its versatility on two different
depth estimation problems where the 3D points have been acquired with
conventional structure-from-motion and LiDAR. In both cases, our network
performs on par with state-of-the-art depth completion methods and achieves
significantly higher accuracy when only a small number of points is used while
being more compact in terms of the number of parameters. We show that our
method outperforms some contemporary deep learning based multi-view stereo and

to parameterize the divergence of the Eliassen-Palm flux tensor (EPFT) that
arises from thickness-weighted averaging (TWA) the hydrostatic Boussinesq
equations. The TWA system of equations does not invoke approximations beyond
those for which the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations are valid, constituting a
mathematically consistent framework with clear physical interpretations. This
model is intended for the adiabatic interior of zonally symmetric flows, in the
absence of topographic features, where terms corresponding to eddy interfacial
form drag in the EPFT dominate forces. We model eddy interfacial form drag
terms for vertical flux of horizontal momentum using the gradient hypothesis,
as the product of an eddy viscosity and the vertical gradient of horizontal
momentum. We use mixing length theory to relate viscosity to an eddy length
scale and an eddy velocity, which is proportional to the eddy energy in the TWA
system. The eddy length scale is modeled as the first Rossby radius of
deformation, which we calculate as a function of the mean flow. We use a
prognostic equation for vertically integrated eddy energy at each horizontal
location, which we derive from the TWA framework, and then simplify to the
flows of interest by ignoring transport, redistribution and diabatic terms. The
prognostic vertically integrated eddy energy is projected onto the water column
using the eigenvalue of the first baroclinic mode to obtain the eddy energy at
each vertical position. The eddy viscosity has horizontal as well as vertical
structure. We diagnosed the model equations in an eddy resolving numerical
simulation of a zonally re-entrant channel representative of the Southern
Ocean. We have implemented the model parameterization in an ocean model and
tested it to simulate a parameterized simulation of this flow.

but they have not arrived in compositional data analysis. Imputation methods
for compositional data are typically applied on additive, centered or isometric
log-ratio representations of the data. Generally, methods for compositional
data analysis can only be applied to observed positive entries in a data
matrix. Therefore one tries to impute missing values or measurements that were
below a detection limit. In this paper, a new method for imputing rounded zeros
based on artificial neural networks is shown and compared with conventional
methods. We are also interested in the question whether for ANNs, a
representation of the data in log-ratios for imputation purposes, is relevant.
It can be shown, that ANNs are competitive or even performing better when
imputing rounded zeros of data sets with moderate size. They deliver better
results when data sets are big. Also, we can see that log-ratio transformations
within the artificial neural network imputation procedure nevertheless help to
improve the results. This proves that the theory of compositional data analysis
and the fulfillment of all properties of compositional data analysis is still
very important in the age of deep learning.

atmosphere, and may have been the primary condensable (as water ice) in the
protoplanetary disk. Prior to the Juno mission, in situ measurements of
Jupiter's water abundance were obtained from the Galileo Probe, which dropped
into a meteorologically anomalous site. The findings of the Galileo Probe were
inconclusive because the concentration of water was still increasing when the
probe died. Here, we initially report on the water abundance in the equatorial
region, from 0 to 4 degrees north latitude, based on 1.25 to 22 GHz data from
Juno Microwave radiometer probing approximately 0.7 to 30 bars pressure.
Because Juno discovered the deep atmosphere to be surprisingly variable as a
function of latitude, it remains to confirm whether the equatorial abundance
represents Jupiter's global water abundance. The water abundance at the
equatorial region is inferred to be $2.5_{-1.6}^{+2.2}\times10^3$ ppm, or
$2.7_{-1.7}^{+2.4}$ times the protosolar oxygen elemental ratio to H (1$\sigma$
uncertainties). If reflective of the global water abundance, the result
suggests that the planetesimals formed Jupiter are unlikely to be water-rich

utterances, fail to infer column mentions from cell values, and fail to compose
complex SQL queries. To mitigate these issues, we present a model pre-training
framework, Generation-Augmented Pre-training (GAP), that jointly learns
representations of natural language utterances and table schemas by leveraging
generation models to generate pre-train data. GAP MODEL is trained on 2M
utterance-schema pairs and 30K utterance-schema-SQL triples, whose utterances
are produced by generative models. Based on experimental results, neural
semantic parsers that leverage GAP MODEL as a representation encoder obtain new

way to improve the security of existing software. One example is the PIPE
architecture extension, which attaches metadata tags to register and memory
values and executes tag-based rules at each machine instruction to enforce a
software-defined security policy. To use PIPE effectively, engineers should be
able to write security policies in terms of source-level concepts like
functions, local variables, and structured control operators, which are not
visible at machine level. It is the job of the compiler to generate PIPE-aware
machine code that enforces these source-level policies. The compiler thus
becomes part of the monitored system's trusted computing base -- and hence a
prime candidate for verification.
  To formalize compiler correctness in this setting, we extend the source
language semantics with its own form of user-specified tag-based monitoring,
and show that the compiler preserves that monitoring behavior. The challenges
of compilation include mapping source-level monitoring policies to
instruction-level tag rules, preserving fail-stop behaviors, and satisfying the
surprisingly complex preconditions for conventional optimizations. In this
paper, we describe the design and verification of Tagine, a small prototype
compiler that translates a simple tagged WHILE language to a tagged register
transfer language and performs simple optimizations. Tagine is based on the
RTLgen and Deadcode phases of the CompCert compiler, and hence is written and
verified in Coq. This work is a first step toward verification of a full-scale

experimental physical laws: the Coulomb's law, the Ampere's force law and
Faraday's law of induction. However, theoretical basis for Ampere's force law
and Faraday's law remains unknown to this day. Furthermore, the Lorentz force
is considered as experimental phenomena, the theoretical foundation of this
force is still unknown.
  To answer these fundamental theoretical questions, we derive Lienard Wiechert
potentials, Maxwell's equations and Lorentz force from two simple postulates:
(a) when all charges are at rest the Coulomb's force acts between the charges,
and (b) that disturbances caused by charge in motion propagate away from the
source with finite velocity. The special relativity was not used in our
derivations nor the Lorentz transformation. In effect, it was shown all the
electrodynamic laws, including the Lorentz force, can be derived from Coulomb's
law and time retardation.
  This was accomplished by analysis of hypothetical experiment where test
charge is at rest and where previously moving source charge stops at some time
in the past. Then the generalized Helmholtz decomposition theorem, also derived
in this paper, was applied to reformulate Coulomb's force acting at present
time as the function of positions of source charge at previous time when the
source charge was moving. From this reformulation of Coulomb's law the Lienard
Wiechert potentials and Maxwell's equations were derived.
  In the second part of this paper, the energy conservation principle valid for
moving charges is derived from the knowledge of electrostatic energy
conservation principle valid for stationary charges. This again was
accomplished by using generalized Helmholtz decomposition theorem. From this
dynamic energy conservation principle the Lorentz force is derived.

obtained such graphs of order $n$ for $r$ = 2,3,5,7, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. In this
paper, we obtain Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of order $np^3$ w.r.t. $r =
p$, and abelian groups on these isomorphic graphs where $p$ is a prime number
and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Theorems \ref{c10} and \ref{c13} are the main results.
Using Theorem \ref{c13}, a list of $T2_{np^3,p}(C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_j))$ for
$p$ = 3,5,7,11 and $n$ = 1 to 5 and also for $p$ = 13 and $n$ = 1 to 3 are
given in the Annexure where $(T2_{np^3,p}(C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_j)), \circ)$
is an abelian group on the $p$ isomorphic circulant graphs
$C_{np^3}(R^{np^3,x+yp}_i)$ of Type-2 w.r.t. $r = p$, $1 \leq i,j \leq p$, $1

np^2-1$, $p,np^3-p\in R^{np^3,x+yp}_i$ and $i,j,n,x\in\mathbb{N}$. We also show
by Example \ref{e9} that there exist $C_n(R)$ and $C_n(S)$ which are isomorphic

dual-energy CT (DECT) provides better material differentiation but most DECT
imaging systems require dual full-angle projection data at different X-ray
spectra. Relaxing the requirement of data acquisition is a particularly
attractive research to promote the applications of DECT in a wide range of
imaging areas. In this work, we design a novel DECT imaging scheme with dual
quarter scans and propose an efficient method to reconstruct the desired DECT
images from dual limited-angle projection data, which enables DECT on imaging
configurations with half-scan and largely reduces scanning angles and radiation
doses. We first study the characteristics of image artifacts under dual quarter
scans scheme, and find that the directional limited-angle artifacts of DECT
images are complementarily distributed in image domain because the
corresponding X-rays of high- and low-energy scans are orthogonal. Inspired by
this finding, a fusion CT image is generated by integrating the limited-angle
DECT images of dual quarter scans. This strategy largely reduces the
limited-angle artifacts and preserves the image edges and inner structures.
Utilizing the capability of neural network in the modeling of nonlinear
problem, a novel Anchor network with single-entry double-out architecture is
designed in this work to yield the desired DECT images from the generated
fusion CT image. Experimental results on the simulated and real data verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Gradient Descent"" (MGA-MSGD) training algorithm that considerably improves
accuracy and efficiency of solving 3D mechanical problems described, in
strong-form, by PDEs via ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks). This presented
approach allows the selection of a number of locations of interest at which the
state variables are expected to fulfil the governing equations associated with
a physical problem. Unlike classical PDE approximation methods such as finite
differences or the finite element method, there is no need to establish and
reconstruct the physical field quantity throughout the computational domain in
order to predict the mechanical response at specific locations of interest. The
basic idea of MGA-MSGD is the manipulation of the learnable parameters'
components responsible for the error explosion so that we can train the network
with relatively larger learning rates which avoids trapping in local minima.
The proposed training approach is less sensitive to the learning rate value,
training points density and distribution, and the random initial parameters.
The distance function to minimise is where we introduce the PDEs including any
physical laws and conditions (so-called, Physics Informed ANN). The Genetic
algorithm is modified to be suitable for this type of ANN in which a
Coarse-level Stochastic Gradient Descent (CSGD) is exploited to make the
decision of the offspring qualification. Employing the presented approach, a
considerable improvement in both accuracy and efficiency, compared with
standard training algorithms such as classical SGD and Adam optimiser, is
observed. The local displacement accuracy is studied and ensured by introducing
the results of Finite Element Method (FEM) at sufficiently fine mesh as the
reference displacements. A slightly more complex problem is solved ensuring its
feasibility.

to $k_{\rm max}=0.3~h~\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we calculate the induced
parameter bias when the mildly nonlinear regime is modeled by the Halofit
fitting scheme. We find significant ($\sim5\sigma$) bias for some parameters
with a future Euclid-like survey. We also explore the contribution of different
scales to the parameter estimation for different observational setups and
cosmological scenarios, compared for the two nonlinear prescriptions of Halofit
and EFTofLSS. We include in the analysis the free parameters of the nonlinear
theory and a blind parametrization for the galaxy bias. We find that
marginalization over these nuisance parameters significantly boosts the errors
of the standard cosmological parameters. This renders the differences in the
predictions of the various nonlinear prescriptions less effective when
transferred to the parameter space. More accurate modeling of these nuisance
parameters would therefore greatly enhance the cosmological gain from the
mildly nonlinear regime.

where a clock at the origin times the outward and return trip of light
reflecting off a distant mirror. Measuring the one-way speed of light is
fraught with issues of clock synchronisation, and, as long as the average speed
of light remains $c$, the speeds on the outward and return legs could be
different. One objection to this anisotropic speed of light is that views of
the distant universe would be different in different directions, especially
with regards to the ages of observed objects and the smoothness of the Cosmic
Microwave Background. In this paper, we explore this in the Milne universe, the
limiting case of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe containing no matter,
radiation or dark energy. Given that this universe is empty, it can be mapped
onto flat Minkowski space-time, and so can be explored in terms of the one-way
speed of light. The conclusion is that the presence of an anisotropic speed of
light leads to anisotropic time dilation effects, and hence observers in the
Milne universe would be presented with an isotropic view of the distant cosmos.

theory to achieve coded aperture snapshot measurement without temporal
scanning, and the entire three-dimensional spatial-spectral data is captured by
a two-dimensional projection during a single integration period. Its core issue
is how to reconstruct the underlying hyperspectral image using compressive
sensing reconstruction algorithms. Due to the diversity in the spectral
response characteristics and wavelength range of different spectral imaging
devices, previous works are often inadequate to capture complex spectral
variations or lack the adaptive capacity to new hyperspectral imagers. In order
to address these issues, we propose an unsupervised spatial-spectral network to
reconstruct hyperspectral images only from the compressive snapshot
measurement. The proposed network acts as a conditional generative model
conditioned on the snapshot measurement, and it exploits the spatial-spectral
attention module to capture the joint spatial-spectral correlation of
hyperspectral images. The network parameters are optimized to make sure that
the network output can closely match the given snapshot measurement according
to the imaging model, thus the proposed network can adapt to different imaging
settings, which can inherently enhance the applicability of the network.
Extensive experiments upon multiple datasets demonstrate that our network can
achieve better reconstruction results than the state-of-the-art methods.

application development for wireless sensor networks. Computational complexity
of simulating wireless sensor networks can be very high and as such must be
carefully managed. Application-level code prototyping with reasonable accuracy
and fidelity can be accomplished through simulation that models only the
effects of the wireless and distributed computations which materialize mainly
as delay and drop for the messages being exchanged among the motes. This
approach employs the abstraction that all physical or communication and
protocol level operations can be represented in terms of their effects as
message delay and drop at the application level for a wireless sensor network.
This study proposes that idea of empirical modeling of delay and drop and
employing those models to affect the reception times of wirelessly communicated
messages. It further proposes the delay and drop to be modeled as random
variables with probability distributions empirically approximated based on the
data reported in the literature. The proposed approach is demonstrated through
development of a neural network application with neurons distributed across the
motes of a wireless sensor network. Delay and drop are incorporated into
wireless communications, which carry neuron output values among motes. A set of
classification data sets from the Machine Learning Repository are employed to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed system in a comparative context
with the similar studies in the literature. Results and findings indicate that
the proposed approach of abstracting wireless sensor network operation in terms
of message delay and drop at the application level is feasible to facilitate
development of applications with competitive performance profiles while
minimizing the spatio-temporal cost of simulation.

specialties to collaboratively resolve specific queries posted to the network.
In such networks, when a query reaches an expert who does not have sufficient
expertise, this query needs to be routed to other experts for further
processing until it is completely solved; therefore, query answering efficiency
is sensitive to the underlying query routing mechanism being used. Among all
possible query routing mechanisms, decentralized search, operating purely on
each expert's local information without any knowledge of network global
structure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism, which is
applicable to any network scenarios even in dynamic networks. However, there is
still a lack of fundamental understanding of the efficiency of decentralized
search in expert networks. In this regard, we investigate decentralized search
by quantifying its performance under a variety of network settings. Our key
findings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized
search can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between
$O(\log n)$ and $O(\log^2 n)$ hops, $n$: total number of experts in the
network). Based on such theoretical foundation, we further study how the unique
properties of decentralized search in expert networks is related to the
anecdotal small-world phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that
decentralized search is robust against estimation errors introduced by
misinterpreting the required expertise levels. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search
in expert networks. The developed performance bounds, confirmed by real
datasets, are able to assist in predicting network performance and designing
complex expert networks.

the recent progress of object detection algorithms in autonomous driving.
However, there exist ambiguity or even failures in object labels due to
error-prone annotation process or sensor observation noise. Current public
object detection datasets only provide deterministic object labels without
considering their inherent uncertainty, as does the common training process or
evaluation metrics for object detectors. As a result, an in-depth evaluation
among different object detection methods remains challenging, and the training
process of object detectors is sub-optimal, especially in probabilistic object
detection. In this work, we infer the uncertainty in bounding box labels from
LiDAR point clouds based on a generative model, and define a new representation
of the probabilistic bounding box through a spatial uncertainty distribution.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed model reflects complex
environmental noises in LiDAR perception and the label quality. Furthermore, we
propose Jaccard IoU (JIoU) as a new evaluation metric that extends IoU by
incorporating label uncertainty. We conduct an in-depth comparison among
several LiDAR-based object detectors using the JIoU metric. Finally, we
incorporate the proposed label uncertainty in a loss function to train a
probabilistic object detector and to improve its detection accuracy. We verify

  Translation: Masking Irrelevant Objects Helps Grounding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual context provides grounding information for multimodal machine
translation (MMT). However, previous MMT models and probing studies on visual
features suggest that visual information is less explored in MMT as it is often
redundant to textual information. In this paper, we propose an object-level
visual context modeling framework (OVC) to efficiently capture and explore
visual information for multimodal machine translation. With detected objects,
the proposed OVC encourages MMT to ground translation on desirable visual
objects by masking irrelevant objects in the visual modality. We equip the
proposed with an additional object-masking loss to achieve this goal. The
object-masking loss is estimated according to the similarity between masked
objects and the source texts so as to encourage masking source-irrelevant
objects. Additionally, in order to generate vision-consistent target words, we
further propose a vision-weighted translation loss for OVC. Experiments on MMT
datasets demonstrate that the proposed OVC model outperforms state-of-the-art
MMT models and analyses show that masking irrelevant objects helps grounding in
MMT.

are the mythological stories surrounding them, typically involving seven young
girls being chased by a man associated with the constellation Orion, so similar
in vastly separated cultures, such as the Australian Aboriginal cultures and
Greek mythology? Second, why do most cultures call them ""Seven Sisters"" even
though most people with good eyesight see only six stars? Here we show that
both these puzzles may be explained by a combination of the great antiquity of
the stories combined with the proper motion of the stars, and that these
stories may predate the departure of most modern humans out of Africa around
100,000 BC.

  Case","Master thesis, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, 63 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, network function virtualization and a software defined focus
has allowed networks to become flexible and extensible in ways not possible
previously. Although network modeling tools such as NS-2, NS-3, and OMNet++
have been extended with modules and code to support the absolute latest
wireless protocols and medium access standards - there has been a growing gap
in simulation of layers above medium access which recent 5G use cases are
designed to support. In this thesis, I extend research into the topic of
application layer modeling in wireless networks, with focus on upcoming
deployments of enhanced vehicle services. In particular, I begin in discussing
the evolution of vehicle network standards and use cases, along with the most
recent initiative `Project 5GCar`; funded by the European Commission. I go
narrower, from the macro trend of vehicular network standards evolution, to
compare the state of the art in simulation stacks, designed to support
application models in vehicle networks. Within this comparison, simulation
environments OVNIS, Veins, iTetris, and VSimRTI are compared for their
capabilities. Finally, to measure the qualitative performance of application
layer modeling in vehicle networks, I take the cooperative maneuver use case,
presented under Project 5GCar; to design an autonomous merge algorithm -
completing the steps required to program and model the application in vehicles
using the VSimRTI simulation stack.
