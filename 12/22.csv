under various conditions. In particular, gaze transition entropy (GTE) is a
popular method to quantify the predictability of fixation transitions. However,
GTE does not account for temporal dependencies beyond two consecutive fixations
and may thus underestimate a scanpath's actual predictability. Instead, we
propose to quantify scanpath predictability by estimating the active
information storage (AIS), which can account for dependencies spanning multiple
fixations. AIS is calculated as the mutual information between a processes'
multivariate past state and its next value. It is thus able to measure how much
information a sequence of past fixations provides about the next fixation,
hence covering a longer temporal horizon. Applying the proposed approach, we
were able to distinguish between induced observer states based on estimated
AIS, providing first evidence that AIS may be used in the inference of user
states to improve human-machine interaction.

  Causal Perspective","To appear in the Proceedings of AAAI 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training datasets for machine learning often have some form of missingness.
For example, to learn a model for deciding whom to give a loan, the available
training data includes individuals who were given a loan in the past, but not
those who were not. This missingness, if ignored, nullifies any fairness
guarantee of the training procedure when the model is deployed. Using causal
graphs, we characterize the missingness mechanisms in different real-world
scenarios. We show conditions under which various distributions, used in
popular fairness algorithms, can or can not be recovered from the training
data. Our theoretical results imply that many of these algorithms can not
guarantee fairness in practice. Modeling missingness also helps to identify
correct design principles for fair algorithms. For example, in multi-stage
settings where decisions are made in multiple screening rounds, we use our
framework to derive the minimal distributions required to design a fair
algorithm. Our proposed algorithm decentralizes the decision-making process and
still achieves similar performance to the optimal algorithm that requires
centralization and non-recoverable distributions.

is important in this energy regime. Two different approaches are contrasted to
each other: A clustering algorithm inspired by coalescence as well as
microscopic formation of deuterons via explicit cross-sections. The sensitivity
of directed and elliptic flow observables to the strength of the Skyrme mean

$v_4/v_2^2$ is close to the value of 0.5 expected from hydrodynamic behaviour.

how chiral optical environments can be induced in the standing-wave with no
modification of the initial bistability by controlling the polarizations of

chiral fluxes are generated, associated respectively with reactive vs.
dissipative chiral optical forces exerted on the diffusing chiral nanoparticle.
This optomechanical chiral coupling bias the thermodynamics of the thermal
activation of the barrier crossing, in ways that depend on the nanoparticle
enantiomer and on the optical field enantiomorph. We show that reactive chiral
forces, being conservative, contribute to a global, enantiospecific, change of
the Helmholtz free energy bistable landscape. In contrast, when the chiral
nanoparticle is immersed in a dissipative chiral environment, the symmetry of
the bistable potential is broken by non-conservative chiral optical forces. In
this case, the chiral electromagnetic fields continuously transfer, through
dissipation, mechanical energy to the chiral nanoparticle. For this chiral
nonequilibrium steady-state, the thermodynamic changes of the barrier crossing
take the form of heat transferred to the thermal bath and yield chiral
deracemization schemes that can be explicitly calculated within the framework
of our model. Three-dimensional stochastic simulations confirm and further
illustrate the thermodynamic impact of chirality. Our results reveal how chiral
degrees of freedom both of the nanoparticle and of the optical fields can be
transformed into true thermodynamics control parameters, thereby demonstrating
the significance of optomechanical chiral coupling in stochastic
thermodynamics.

of these surveys are conducted with only a single band, and simultaneous color
information is usually unavailable for the objects monitored during the survey.
Here we present introductions to the system of Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng
Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), which consists of an array of four optical
telescopes installed on a single equatorial mount. Such a system is designed to
get multiband photometry simultaneously for stars and transients discovered
during the survey. The optics of each telescope is a modified
Hamilton-Newtonian system, covering the wavelengths from 400 to 900 nm, with a
field of view (FoV) of about 4.5 deg2 and a plate scale of 1.86""/pixel when
combining with a 4K*4K QHY4040 CMOS detector. The TMTS system can have a FoV of
about 9 deg2 when monitoring the sky with two bands (i.e., SDSS g and r
filters) at the same time, and a maximum FoV of ~18 deg2 when four telescopes
monitor different sky areas in monochromatic filter mode. For an exposure time
of 60 s, the average 3{\sigma} detection limit of the TMTS system can reach at
~19.4 mag in Luminous filter and at ~18.7 mag in SDSS r filter. The preliminary
discovery obtained during the first few months' survey is briefly discussed. As
this telescope array is located at the Xinglong Observatory of NAOC, it can
have an excellent synergy with the spectroscopic survey by the LAMOST (with a
FoV of about 20 deg2) at the same site, which will benefit the studies of
stellar and binary physics besides the transient sciences.

periodic commensurate stacking, on the structural, electronic, and vibrational
properties, when compared to the counterpart bulk transition metal
dichalcogenide. We find that in heterostructures with dissimilar chalcogen
species there is a strong compression of the inter-layer spacing, compared to
the bulk compounds. This compression of the heterostructure is caused by an
increase in the strength of the induced polarization interaction between the
layers, but not a full charge transfer. We argue that this effect is real, not
due to the imposed commensurability, and should be observable in
heterostructures combining different chalcogens. Interestingly, we find that
incommensurate stacking of Ti-based dichalcogenides leads to the stabilization
of the charge density wave phonon mode, which is unstable in the 1T phase at
low temperature. Mixed Ti- and Zr-heterostructures are still unstable, but with

  Series Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time series classification problems exist in many fields and have been
explored for a couple of decades. However, they still remain challenging, and
their solutions need to be further improved for real-world applications in
terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
neural architecture, called Self-Attentive Recurrent Convolutional Networks
(SARCoN), to learn multi-faceted representations for univariate time series.
SARCoN is the synthesis of long short-term memory networks with self-attentive
mechanisms and Fully Convolutional Networks, which work in parallel to learn
the representations of univariate time series from different perspectives. The
component modules of the proposed architecture are trained jointly in an
end-to-end manner and they classify the input time series in a cooperative way.
Due to its domain-agnostic nature, SARCoN is able to generalize a diversity of
domain tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches for time series classification, the proposed
architecture can achieve remarkable improvements for a set of univariate time
series benchmarks from the UCR repository. Moreover, the self-attention and the
global average pooling in the proposed architecture enable visible
interpretability by facilitating the identification of the contribution regions
of the original time series. An overall analysis confirms that multi-faceted
representations of time series aid in capturing deep temporal corrections
within complex time series, which is essential for the improvement of time
series classification performance. Our work provides a novel angle that deepens
the understanding of time series classification, qualifying our proposed model
as an ideal choice for real-world applications.

sequence of instructions repeatedly executed as the core component of a loop.
  This paper introduces a dual equivalent representation: The resource mapping
of an architecture is an abstract model where, to be executed, an instruction
must use a set of abstract resources, themselves representing combinations of
execution ports. For a given architecture, finding a port mapping is an
important but difficult problem. Building a resource mapping is a more
tractable problem and provides a simpler and equivalent model. This paper
describes Palmed, a tool that automatically builds a resource mapping for

  We evaluate the pertinence of our dual representation for throughput modeling

Recent studies have shown that they are an excellent proxy to infer properties
of the perturbers, such as their mass. Here we present two different
methodologies that make use of the fully non-Gaussian density distribution of
stellar streams: a Bayesian model selection based on the probability density
function (PDF) of stellar density, and a likelihood-free gradient boosting
classifier. While the schemes do not assume a specific dark matter model, we
are mainly interested in discerning the primordial black holes cold dark matter
(PBH CDM) hypothesis form the standard particle dark matter one. Therefore, as
an application we forecast model selection strength of evidence for cold dark
matter clusters of masses $10^3$ - $10^5 M_{\odot}$ and $10^5$ - $10^9
M_{\odot}$, based on a GD-1-like stellar stream and including realistic
observational errors. Evidence for the smaller mass range, so far
under-explored, is particularly interesting for PBH CDM. We expect weak to
strong evidence for model selection based on the PDF analysis, depending on the
fiducial model. Instead, the gradient boosting model is a highly efficient
classifier (99\% accuracy) for all mass ranges here considered. As a further
test of the robustness of the method, we reach similar conclusions when
performing forecasts further dividing the largest mass range into $10^5$ -

the final states. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the outcome of
such collisions is not limited to a single hydrogenic manifold. We observe a
redistribution of population over a wide range of final states. We also find
that even the decay to states with the same $l$ as the initial state, but
different principal quantum number $n$ is possible. We model the underlying
physical process in the framework of a short-lived Rydberg quasi-molecular
complex, where a charge exchange process gives rise to an oscillating electric
field that causes transitions within the Rydberg manifold. The distribution of
final states shows a diffusive-like behavior.

fundamental to the study of phenotypic traits. Since it is well-suited for
these tasks, deep supervised learning has been prevalent in recent works
proposing better performing models at segmenting and counting leaves. Despite
good efforts from research groups, one of the main challenges for proposing
better methods is still the limitation of labelled data availability. The main
efforts of the field seem to be augmenting existing limited data sets, and some
aspects of the modelling process have been under-discussed. This paper explores
such topics and present experiments that led to the development of the
best-performing method in the Leaf Segmentation Challenge and in another
external data set of Komatsuna plants. The model has competitive performance
while been arguably simpler than other recently proposed ones. The experiments
also brought insights such as the fact that model cardinality and test-time
augmentation may have strong applications in object segmentation of single
class and high occlusion, and regarding the data distribution of recently
proposed data sets for benchmarking.

from Euclidean correlators, by combining the approach of a regulated inverse

scattering information can be extracted at large separations, can be understood
by interpreting the correlator as a spectral function, $\rho(\omega)$,
convoluted with the Euclidean kernel, $e^{- \omega t}$, which is sharply peaked
at threshold. We therefore consider a modification in which a smooth step
function, equal to one above a target energy, is inserted in the spectral
decomposition. This can be achieved either through Backus-Gilbert-like methods
or more directly using the variational approach. The result is a shifted
resolution function, such that the large $t$ limit projects onto scattering or
decay amplitudes above threshold. The utility of this method is highlighted
through large $t$ expansions of both three- and four-point functions that
include leading terms proportional to the real and imaginary parts (separately)
of the target observable. This work also presents new results relevant for the
un-modified correlator at threshold, including expressions for extracting the

control multi-trait phenotypic polymorphisms under balancing selection. Recent
advances in genomics have uncovered significant variation in both the genomic
architecture as well as the mode of origin of supergenes across diverse
organismal systems. Although the role of genomic architecture for the origin of
supergenes has been much discussed, differences in the genomic architecture
also subsequently affect the evolutionary trajectory of supergenes and the rate
of degeneration of supergene haplotypes. In this review, we synthesize recent
genomic work and historical models of supergene evolution, highlighting how the
genomic architecture of supergenes affects their evolutionary fate. We discuss
how recent findings on classic supergenes involved in governing ant colony
social form, mimicry in butterflies, and heterostyly in flowering plants relate
to theoretical expectations. Furthermore, we use forward simulations to
demonstrate that differences in genomic architecture affect the degeneration of
supergenes. Finally, we discuss implications of the evolution of supergene

This X-ray source, in the foreground with respect to the Galactic center,
brightened in X-rays during 2020, prompting our follow-up optical observations.
We found the star to contain a K4III giant with a modest but highly variable
Halpha emission, composed by a ~470 km/s wide component with superimposed a
narrow absorption, offset by a positive velocity with respect to the giant. No
orbital motion is detected for the K4III, showing an heliocentric radial
velocity stable at -12(+/-1) km/s. No flickering in excess of 0.005 mag in B
band was observed at three separate visits of 2SXPS J173508.4-292958. While
photometrically stable in 2016 through 2018, in 2019 the star developed a
limited photometric variability, that in 2020 took the form of a sinusoidal
modulation with a period of 38 days and an amplitude of 0.12 mag in V band. We
argue this variability cannot be ascribed to Roche-lobe filling by the K4III
star. No correlation is observed between the photometric variability and the
amount of emission in Halpha, the latter probably originating directly from the
accretion disk around the accreting companion. While no emission from dust is
detected at mid-IR wavelengths, an excess in U-band is probably present and
caused by direct emission from the accretion disk. We conclude that 2SXPS

to be holonomic. Such equations have been introduced in the last century for
proving and discovering combinatorial and hypergeometric identities. Given a
field K of characteristic zero, a term a(n) is called hypergeometric with
respect to K, if the ratio a(n+1)/a(n) is a rational function over K. The
solutions space of holonomic recurrence equations gained more interest in the
1990s from the well known Zeilberger's algorithm. In particular, algorithms
computing the subspace of hypergeometric term solutions which covers
polynomial, rational, and some algebraic solutions of these equations were
investigated by Marko Petkov\v{s}ek (1993) and Mark van Hoeij (1999). The
algorithm proposed by the latter is characterized by a much better efficiency
than that of the other; it computes, in Gamma representations, a basis of the
subspace of hypergeometric term solutions of any given holonomic recurrence
equation, and is considered as the current state of the art in this area. Mark
van Hoeij implemented his algorithm in the Computer Algebra System (CAS) Maple
through the command $LREtools[hypergeomsols]$.
  We propose a variant of van Hoeij's algorithm that performs the same
efficiency and gives outputs in terms of factorials and shifted factorials,
without considering certain recommendations of the original version. We have
implementations of our algorithm for the CASs Maxima and Maple. Such an
implementation is new for Maxima which is therefore used for general-purpose
examples. Our Maxima code is currently available as a third-party package for
Maxima. A comparison between van Hoeij's implementation and ours is presented
for Maple 2020. It appears that both have the same efficiency, and moreover,
for some particular cases, our code finds results where
$LREtools[hypergeomsols]$ fails.

inflation $\Lambda_{\rm inf}=\sqrt{HM_{Pl}}$ and left-right symmetry breaking

optimization which does not require first-order gradient information and uses
only function evaluations. The problem of ZO optimization has emerged in many
recent machine learning applications, where the gradient of the objective
function is either unavailable or difficult to compute. In such cases, we can
approximate the full gradients or stochastic gradients through function value
based gradient estimates. Here, we propose a novel hybrid gradient estimator
(HGE), which takes advantage of the query-efficiency of random gradient
estimates as well as the variance-reduction of coordinate-wise gradient
estimates. We show that with a graceful design in coordinate importance
sampling, the proposed HGE-based ZO optimization method is efficient both in
terms of iteration complexity as well as function query cost. We provide a
thorough theoretical analysis of the convergence of our proposed method for
non-convex, convex, and strongly-convex optimization. We show that the
convergence rate that we derive generalizes the results for some prominent
existing methods in the nonconvex case, and matches the optimal result in the
convex case. We also corroborate the theory with a real-world black-box attack

applications of memristor-based AC circuits have been rather sparse, with only
a few examples found in the literature where their use is emulated at higher

Metal-oxide memristors are found to behave as RC low-pass filters and they
present a variable cut-off frequency when their state is switched, thus
providing a window of reconfigurability when used as filters. We further study
this behaviour across distinct material systems and we show that the usable
reconfigurability window of the devices can be tailored to encompass specific

of a $N=12$ superconducting qubit array. We show that the sensitivity of the
dynamics to random samples becomes maximum at the transition point which leaves
its fingerprints in all spatial scales. By exploiting three quantities, each
with different spatial resolution, we identify the transition point with
excellent match between simulation and experiment. In addition, one can detect
the evidence of mobility edge through slight variation of the transition point
as the initial state varies. The protocol is easily scalable and can be
performed across various physical platforms.

(DNNs) for solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem in power systems.
Computing optimal generation dispatch decisions using a trained DNN takes
significantly less time when compared to using conventional optimization
solvers. However, a major drawback of existing work is that the machine
learning models are trained for a specific system topology. Hence, the DNN
predictions are only useful as long as the system topology remains unchanged.
Changes to the system topology (initiated by the system operator) would require
retraining the DNN, which incurs significant training overhead and requires an
extensive amount of training data (corresponding to the new system topology).
To overcome this drawback, we propose a DNN-based OPF predictor that is trained
using a meta-learning (MTL) approach. The key idea behind this approach is to
find a common initialization vector that enables fast training for any system
topology. The developed OPF-predictor is validated through simulations using
benchmark IEEE bus systems. The results show that the MTL approach achieves
significant training speeds-ups and requires only a few gradient steps with a
few data samples to achieve high OPF prediction accuracy.

different applications. Based on the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is
highly sensitive to structural information, the edge information extraction is
widely applied in different IQA metrics. According to previous studies, the
image gradient magnitude (GM) and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) operator are
two efficient structural features in IQA tasks. However, most of the IQA
metrics achieve good performance only when the distorted image is totally
registered with the reference image, but fail to perform on images with small
translations. In this paper, we propose an FR-IQA model with the quadratic sum
of the GM and the LOG signals, which obtains good performance in image quality
estimation considering shift-insensitive property for not well-registered
reference and distortion image pairs. Experimental results show that the
proposed model works robustly on three large scale subjective IQA databases
which contain a variety of distortion types and levels, and stays in the
state-of-the-art FR-IQA models no matter for single distortion type or across

better with shift-insensitive property compared with the CW-SSIM metric that is
considered to be shift-insensitive IQA so far. Meanwhile, the proposed model is
much simple than the CW-SSIM, which is efficient for applications.

These approaches are important and useful but reach their limits when we want
to perform real-time predictions. In this case, a static information about the
inflow is not sufficient. Instead, we need a dynamic information that can be
retrieved each time the prediction is started. Nowadays, sensor data such as
video footage or GPS tracks of a crowd are often available. If we can estimate
the number of pedestrians who stem from a certain origin from this sensor data,
we can dynamically initialize the simulation. In this study, we use density
heatmaps that can be derived from sensor data as input for a random forest
regressor to predict the origin distributions. We study three different
datasets: A simulated dataset, experimental data, and a hybrid approach with
both experimental and simulated data. In the hybrid setup, the model is trained
with simulated data and then tested on experimental data. The results
demonstrate that the random forest model is able to predict the origin
distribution based on a single density heatmap for all three configurations.
This is especially promising for applying the approach on real data since there
is often only a limited amount of data available.

insulation breakdown caused by partial discharge (PD) in overhead transmission
lines with covered conductors or electrical equipment such as generators and
motors used in various industries. Developing an effective partial discharge
detection system can lead to significant savings on maintenance and prevent
power disruptions. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and domain
expertise to identify partial discharge patterns in the electrical current.
Many data-driven deep learning-based methods have been proposed in recent years
to remove these ad hoc feature extraction. However, most of these methods
either operate in the time-domain or frequency-domain. Many research approaches
have been developed to generate phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD)
patterns from raw PD sensor data. These PRPD diagrams suggest a correlation
between partial discharge activities occurring in an alternating electrical
waveform's positive and negative half-cycles. However, this correlation
criterion between half-cycles has been remained unexplored in deep
learning-based methods. This work proposes a novel feature-fusion-based
Dual-CyCon Net that can utilize all time, frequency, and phase domain features
for joint learning in one cohesive framework. Our proposed cycle-consistency
loss exploits any relation between an alternating electrical signal's positive
and negative half-cycles to calibrate the model's sensitivity. This loss
explores cycle-invariant PD-specific features, enabling the model to learn more
robust, noise-invariant features for PD detection. A case study of our proposed
framework on a public real-world noisy measurement from high-frequency voltage
sensors to detect damaged power lines has achieved a state-of-the-art MCC score

applicability of RL. Most prior work in offline RL has focused on tasks with
compact state representations. However, the ability to learn directly from rich
observation spaces like images is critical for real-world applications such as
robotics. In this work, we build on recent advances in model-based algorithms
for offline RL, and extend them to high-dimensional visual observation spaces.
Model-based offline RL algorithms have achieved state of the art results in
state based tasks and have strong theoretical guarantees. However, they rely
crucially on the ability to quantify uncertainty in the model predictions,
which is particularly challenging with image observations. To overcome this
challenge, we propose to learn a latent-state dynamics model, and represent the
uncertainty in the latent space. Our approach is both tractable in practice and
corresponds to maximizing a lower bound of the ELBO in the unknown POMDP. In
experiments on a range of challenging image-based locomotion and manipulation
tasks, we find that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous offline

oscillating in time, induces a net rotation of the texture around $\mathbf{q}$.
This rotation is reminiscent of the motion of an Archimedean screw and is
equivalent to a translation with velocity $v_{\text{screw}}$ parallel to
$\mathbf{q}$. Due to the coupling to a Goldstone mode, this non-linear effect
arises for arbitrarily weak $\mathbf{B}_{\perp}(t) $ with $v_{\text{screw}}
\propto |\mathbf{B}_{\perp}|^2$ as long as pinning by disorder is absent. The
effect is resonantly enhanced when internal modes of the helix are excited and
the sign of $v_{\text{screw}}$ can be controlled either by changing the
frequency or the polarization of $\mathbf{B}_{\perp}(t)$. The Archimedean screw
can be used to transport spin and charge and thus the screwing motion is
predicted to induce a voltage parallel to $\mathbf{q}$. Using a combination of
numerics and Floquet spin wave theory, we show that the helix becomes unstable

longer than most materials, making graphene a promising platform for
spintronics and quantum information technologies. Here, we use first-principles
density-matrix (FPDM) dynamics simulations to show that interaction with
electric fields and substrates strongly enhance spin relaxation through
scattering with phonons. Consequently, the relaxation time at room temperature
reduces from microseconds in free-standing graphene to nanoseconds in graphene
on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate, the order of magnitude typically
measured in experiments. Further, inversion symmetry breaking by hBN introduces
a stronger asymmetry in electron and hole spin lifetimes, than predicted by the
conventional D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) model for spin relaxation. Deviations from
the conventional DP model are stronger for in-plane spin relaxation, resulting
in out-of-plane to in-plane lifetime ratios much greater than 1/2 with a
maximum close to the Dirac point. These FPDM results, independent of
symmetry-specific assumptions or material-dependent parameters, also validate
recent modifications of the DP model to explain such deviations. Overall, our
results indicate that spin-phonon relaxation in the presence of substrates may

Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). GANs
can produce realistic images, but they suffer from mode collapse and do not
provide simple ways to get the latent representation of an image. On the other
hand, VAEs do not have these problems, but they often generate images less
realistic than GANs. In this article, we explain that this lack of realism is
partially due to a common underestimation of the natural image manifold
dimensionality. To solve this issue we introduce a new framework that combines
VAE and GAN in a novel and complementary way to produce an auto-encoding model
that keeps VAEs properties while generating images of GAN-quality. We evaluate
our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on five image datasets.

  With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn
representations by training a convolutional net to reconstruct a
bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a
perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training
of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the
student network (whose role is to learn representations), along with an online
update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets). This idea
effectively enables fully online BoW-guided unsupervised learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the interest of our BoW-based strategy which surpasses
previous state-of-the-art methods (including contrastive-based ones) in several
applications. For instance, in downstream tasks such Pascal object detection,
Pascal classification and Places205 classification, our method improves over
all prior unsupervised approaches, thus establishing new state-of-the-art

problem arises widely in machine learning and statistics, with Monte-Carlo
sampling, variational inference, policy optimization, and generative
adversarial network as examples. For this problem, we propose a novel
particle-based algorithm, dubbed as variational transport, which approximately
performs Wasserstein gradient descent over the manifold of probability
distributions via iteratively pushing a set of particles. Specifically, we
prove that moving along the geodesic in the direction of functional gradient
with respect to the second-order Wasserstein distance is equivalent to applying
a pushforward mapping to a probability distribution, which can be approximated
accurately by pushing a set of particles. Specifically, in each iteration of
variational transport, we first solve the variational problem associated with
the objective functional using the particles, whose solution yields the
Wasserstein gradient direction. Then we update the current distribution by
pushing each particle along the direction specified by such a solution. By
characterizing both the statistical error incurred in estimating the
Wasserstein gradient and the progress of the optimization algorithm, we prove
that when the objective function satisfies a functional version of the
Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) (Polyak, 1963) and smoothness conditions,
variational transport converges linearly to the global minimum of the objective
functional up to a certain statistical error, which decays to zero sublinearly

anomalous Higgs trilinear coupling at the percent level, and to the Higgs
compositeness $\xi$ parameter at the per mille or sub-per mille level thanks to
the measurement of the cross-section in the di-Higgs high invariant mass tail.
High energy diboson (and tri-boson) production is sensitive to Higgs-lepton
contact interaction operators at a scale of several tens or hundred TeV,
corresponding to a reach on the Higgs compositeness scale well above the one of
any other future collider project currently under discussion. This result
follows from the unique capability of the very high energy lepton collider to

integration of distributed energy resources into the power network, allowing
local clusters of load and distributed energy resources to operate
autonomously. However, microgrid operation brings new challenges, especially in
islanded operation as frequency and voltage control are no longer provided by
large rotating machines. Instead, the power converters in the microgrid must
coordinate to regulate the frequency and voltage and ensure stability. We
consider the problem of designing controllers to achieve these objectives.
Using passivity theory to derive decentralized stability conditions for the
microgrid, we propose a control design method for grid-forming inverters. For
the analysis we use higher-order models for the inverters and also advanced
dynamic models for the lines with an arbitrarily large number of states. By
satisfying the decentralized condition formulated, plug-and-play operation can
be achieved with guaranteed stability, and performance can also be improved by
incorporating this condition as a constraint in corresponding optimization
problems formulated. In addition, our control design can improve the power
sharing properties of the microgrid compared to previous non-droop approaches.
Finally, realistic simulations confirm that the controller design improves the

multi-objective and many-objective optimization to compare two solution sets
obtained from different algorithms. The DoM indicator can differentiate the
sets for certain important features, such as convergence, spread, uniformity,
and cardinality. DoM does not use any reference, and it has an intuitive and
physical meaning, similar to the $\epsilon$-indicator, and calculates the
minimum total move of members of one set so that all elements in another set
are to be dominated or identical to at least one member of the first set.
Despite the aforementioned properties, DoM is hard to calculate, particularly
in higher dimensions. There is an efficient and exact method to calculate it in
a bi-objective case only. This work proposes a novel approach to calculate DoM
using a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach, which can handle sets with
three or more objectives and is shown to overcome the $\epsilon$-indicator's
information loss. Experiments, in the bi-objective space, are done to verify
the model's correctness. Furthermore, other experiments, using 3, 5, 10, 15,

bilinearly with a coupling of strength $J$. We investigate the vibrational
properties of its ground state at zero temperature. When $p(\kappa)$ is gapped,
the emergent $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$ is also gapped, for small $J$. Upon
increasing $J$, the gap vanishes on a critical line in the $(h,J)$ phase

pseudogap is quadratic, $\mathcal{D}(\omega)\sim\omega^2$, and its modes are
delocalized, as expected from previously investigated mean-field spin glass

$\mathcal{D}(\omega)\sim\omega^4$, populated by localized modes, emerges, the
two regimes being separated by a special point on the critical line. We thus
uncover that mean-field disordered systems can generically display both a

periodic intrinsic variability. We found 20 massive heartbeat systems, of which
seven show TEOs. The TEOs occur at harmonics of orbital frequencies in the
range between 3 and 36, with the median value equal to 9, lower than those in

intrinsic pulsations of $\beta$ Cep, SPB, $\delta$ Sct, and $\gamma$ Dor-type

composed of both liquids is roughly controlled by the hidrophobicity of the

studied low-dimensional projections of random vectors from the Euclidean unit
sphere and the simplex in high dimensions, noting that the individual
coordinates of these random vectors look like Gaussian and exponential random
variables respectively. In subsequent works, Rachev and R\""uschendorf and Naor
and Romik unified these results by establishing a connection between $\ell_p^N$
balls and a $p$-generalized Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we study
similar questions in a significantly generalized and unifying setting, looking
at low-dimensional projections of random vectors uniformly distributed on sets
of the form \[B_{\phi,t}^N := \Big\{(s_1,\ldots,s_N)\in\mathbb{R}^N : \sum_{ i

potential (including the case of Orlicz functions). Our method is different
from both Rachev-R\""uschendorf and Naor-Romik, based on a large deviation
perspective in the form of quantitative versions of Cram\'er's theorem and the
Gibbs conditioning principle, providing a natural framework beyond the
$p$-generalized Gaussian distribution while simultaneously unraveling the role
this distribution plays in relation to the geometry of $\ell_p^N$ balls. We
find that there is a critical parameter $t_{\mathrm{crit}}$ at which there is a
phase transition in the behaviour of the projections: for $t >
t_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the coordinates of random points sampled from $B_{\phi,t}^N$
behave like uniform random variables, but for $t \leq t_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the
Gibbs conditioning principle comes into play, and here there is a parameter
$\beta_t>0$ (the inverse temperature) such that the coordinates are
approximately distributed according to a density proportional to $e^{

birth years), outliers may be more easily found in terms of the histogram
smoothness where techniques such as Whipple's or Myers' indices handle
successfully only specific anomalies. This paper proposes smoothness outliers
detection among histograms by using the relation between their discrete total
variations (DTV) and their respective sample sizes. This relation is
mathematically derived to be applicable in all cases and simplified by an
accurate linear model. The deviation of the histogram's DTV from the value
predicted by the model is used as the outlier score and the proposed method is
named Total Variation Outlier Recognizer (TVOR). TVOR requires no prior
assumptions about the histograms' samples' distribution, it has no
hyperparameters that require tuning, it is not limited to only specific
patterns, and it is applicable to histograms with the same bins. Each bin can
have an arbitrary interval that can also be unbounded. TVOR finds DTV outliers
easier than Pearson's chi-squared test. In case of distribution outliers, the
opposite holds. TVOR is tested on real census data and it successfully finds
suspicious histograms. The source code is given at

patients with non-Covid-19 cases at the lowest cost and in the early stages of
the disease are one of the main challenges in the epidemic of Covid-19.
Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic methods based on
radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic
centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use
machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.
  Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases
of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020
Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning,
Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that
ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an
overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of
Covid-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep
learning. According to the finding, Deep learning Based models have an
extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the
detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, which using of them in the processing of
CT-Scan and X-Ray images, would lead to a significant increase in sensitivity
and specificity values.
  Conclusion: The Application of Deep Learning (DL) in the field of Covid-19
radiologic image processing leads to the reduction of false-positive and
negative errors in the detection and diagnosis of this disease and provides an
optimal opportunity to provide fast, cheap, and safe diagnostic services to
patients.

pulsar. Despite the wealth of data available, the power source of the
non-thermal emitter is still unknown. We use a dynamical-radiative numerical
model and multiwavelength data to constrain the properties of a pulsar wind
that may power the non-thermal emitter in LS~5039. We ran simulations of an
ultrarelativistic (low-$B$) cold $e^\pm$-wind that Compton scatters stellar
photons and that dynamically interacts with the stellar wind. The effects of
energy losses on the unshocked $e^\pm$-wind dynamics, and the geometry of the
two-wind contact discontinuity, are computed for different wind models. The
predicted unshocked $e^\pm$-wind radiation at periastron, when expected to be
highest, is compared to LS~5039 data. The minimum possible radiation from an
isotropic cold $e^\pm$-wind overpredicts the X-ray to gamma-ray fluxes at
periastron by a factor of $\sim 3$. In the anisotropic wind case X-ray and
$\gtrsim 100$ MeV data are not violated by wind radiation if the wind axis is
at $\lesssim 20-40^\circ$ from the line of sight (probability of $\lesssim
6-24$\%), depending on the anisotropic wind model, or if the wind Lorentz
factor $\in 10^2-10^3$, in which case the wind power can be higher, but it
requires $e^\pm$-multiplicities of $\sim 10^6$ and $10^9$ for a $10^{-2}$~s and
10~s pulsar period, respectively. The studied model predicts that a low-$B$
cold pulsar $e^\pm$-wind in LS~5039 should be strongly anisotropic, with either
a wind Lorentz factor $\in 10^2-10^3$ and very high multiplicities or with a
fine-tuned wind orientation. A low-$B$, cold baryon-dominated wind would be
possible, but then the multiplicities should be rather low, while the
baryon-to-$e^\pm$ energy transfer should be very efficient at wind termination.
A strongly magnetized cold wind seems to be the most favorable (least
constrained) option.

existing results to problems with potentially unbounded delays between playing
an action and receiving the corresponding feedback. In the multi-agent case,
the situation is significantly more complicated because agents may not have
access to a global clock to use as a reference point; to overcome this, we
focus on the information that is available for producing each prediction rather
than the actual delay associated with each feedback. This allows us to derive
adaptive learning strategies with optimal regret bounds, even in a fully
decentralized, asynchronous environment. Finally, we also analyze an
""optimistic"" variant of the proposed algorithm which is capable of exploiting
the predictability of problems with a slower variation and leads to improved

tasks. Such interactions involve physical contact between surfaces that is

introduce a novel Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) model that encodes proximal
relationships, called POSA for ""Pose with prOximitieS and contActs"". The
representation of interaction is body-centric, which enables it to generalize
to new scenes. Specifically, POSA augments the SMPL-X parametric human body
model such that, for every mesh vertex, it encodes (a) the contact probability
with the scene surface and (b) the corresponding semantic scene label. We learn
POSA with a VAE conditioned on the SMPL-X vertices, and train on the PROX
dataset, which contains SMPL-X meshes of people interacting with 3D scenes, and
the corresponding scene semantics from the PROX-E dataset. We demonstrate the
value of POSA with two applications. First, we automatically place 3D scans of
people in scenes. We use a SMPL-X model fit to the scan as a proxy and then
find its most likely placement in 3D. POSA provides an effective representation
to search for ""affordances"" in the scene that match the likely contact
relationships for that pose. We perform a perceptual study that shows
significant improvement over the state of the art on this task. Second, we show
that POSA's learned representation of body-scene interaction supports monocular
human pose estimation that is consistent with a 3D scene, improving on the

understanding the fine-grained contents (e.g., objects, relationships) in the
image, but also telling why -- reasoning over grounding visual cues to derive
the answer for a question. Over the last few years, we have seen significant
progress on visual question answering. Though impressive as the accuracy grows,
it still lags behind to get knowing whether these models are undertaking
grounding visual reasoning or just leveraging spurious correlations in the
training data. Recently, a number of works have attempted to answer this
question from perspectives such as grounding and robustness. However, most of
them are either focusing on the language side or coarsely studying the
pixel-level attention maps. In this paper, by leveraging the step-wise object
grounding annotations provided in the GQA dataset, we first present a
systematical object-centric diagnosis of visual reasoning on grounding and
robustness, particularly on the vision side. According to the extensive
comparisons across different models, we find that even models with high
accuracy are not good at grounding objects precisely, nor robust to visual
content perturbations. In contrast, symbolic and modular models have a
relatively better grounding and robustness, though at the cost of accuracy. To
reconcile these different aspects, we further develop a diagnostic model,
namely Graph Reasoning Machine. Our model replaces purely symbolic visual
representation with probabilistic scene graph and then applies teacher-forcing
training for the visual reasoning module. The designed model improves the
performance on all three metrics over the vanilla neural-symbolic model while
inheriting the transparency. Further ablation studies suggest that this
improvement is mainly due to more accurate image understanding and proper
intermediate reasoning supervisions.

significant impact on the electron transport behaviors, leading to remarkable
longitudinal or planar electrical and thermoelectric transport phenomena in the
presence of electromagnetic gauge fields. These phenomena are consequences of
the imbalanced chiral charge and energy induced by chiral anomaly in the
presence of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields
($\mathbf{E \cdot B }\neq 0$) or $(\mathbf{B \cdot \nabla }T\neq 0)$
($\mathbf{\nabla}T$ is the thermal gradient). We here propose another two
fascinating transport properties, namely, the nonlinear planar Nernst effect
and nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect induced by chiral anomaly in the
presence of $\mathbf{B \cdot \nabla}T\neq 0$ in WSMs. Using the semiclassical
Boltzmann transport theory, we derive the analytical expressions for the chiral
anomaly induced nonlinear Nernst and thermal Hall transport coefficients and
also evaluate the fundamental mathematical relations among them in the
nonlinear regime. The formulas we find in this current work are consistent with
that predicted for the nonlinear anomalous electrical and thermoelectric
effects induced by Berry curvature dipole recently. Additionally, in contrast
to the recent work, by utilizing the lattice Weyl Hamiltonian with intrinsic
chiral chemical potential, we find that the chiral anomaly induced nonlinear
planar effects can exist even for a pair of oppositely tilted or non-tilted
Weyl cones in both time reversal and inversion broken WSMs. The chiral anomaly
induced nonlinear planar effects predicted here along with the related
parameter dependencies are hence possible to be realized in realistic WSMs in
experiment.

values of the ground state degeneracy. Yet, there is a natural continuum limit
with a well-defined (though infinite) value of that degeneracy. We also uncover
a surprising global symmetry in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensional systems. It
originates from the underlying subsystem symmetry, but the way it is realized

mass accretion history. The stars formed in situ very early on in the initial
phase of the assembly might have originated from an extremely intense star
formation burst, and may still be found within the cores of such galaxies
today. We investigate the presence of a surviving high-$z$ compact progenitor
component in the brightest galaxy of the Hydra I cluster, NGC 3311, by mapping
its 2D kinematics and stellar population out to 2 effective radii, combining
MUSE observations, extended EMILES models, and a newly developed parametric
fully Bayesian framework using full-spectrum fitting. We present 2D maps and
radial profiles of the stellar velocity dispersion, age, total metallicity,
$\alpha$-element, sodium abundance ([Na/Fe]), and the initial mass function
(IMF) slope. All properties have significant gradients, confirming the
existence of multiple structural components, including a young, metal-rich
""blue spot"". We find that the component dominating the light budget of NGC 3311
within $R\lesssim 2.0$ kpc is the surviving $z=0$ analog of a high-$z$ compact
core. This concentrated structure has a relatively small velocity dispersion
($\sigma_*\approx 180$ km s$^{-1}$), is very old (ages$\gtrsim 11$ Gyr),
metal-rich ([Z/H]$\sim0.2$ and [Na/Fe]$\sim0.4$), and has a bottom-heavy IMF
(with slope $\Gamma_b\sim2.4$). In the outer region, stars become increasingly
hotter, younger, metal and sodium poorer, $\alpha$-element richer, and the IMF
slope becomes Chabrier-like. The multiple structural components in NGC 3311
confirm the predictions from the two-phase formation scenario for NGC 3311.
Interestingly, the outer stellar population has an overabundant [$\alpha$/Fe],
most likely because NGC 3311, located at the center of the galaxy cluster,
accreted stars from rapidly quenched satellites.[Abridged]

The diffuse X-ray emission surrounding radio galaxies is generally
interpreted either as due to inverse Compton scattering of non-thermal
radio-emitting electrons on the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB), or as the
thermal emission arising from the hot gas of the intergalactic medium (IGM)
permeating galaxy clusters hosting such galaxies, or as a combination of both.
In this work we present an imaging and spectral analysis of Chandra
observations for the radio galaxy 3C 187 to investigate its diffuse X-ray
emission and constrain the contribution of these different physical mechanisms.
Aims. The main goals of this work are: (i) to evaluate the extension of the
diffuse X-ray emission from this source, (ii) to investigate the two main
processes that can account for its origin - IC/CMB and thermal emission from
the IGM - and (iii) to test the possibility for 3C 187 to belong to a cluster
of galaxies, that can account for the observed diffuse X-ray emission. Methods.
To evaluate the extension of the X-ray emission around 3C 187 we extracted
surface flux profiles along and across the radio axis. We also extracted X-ray
spectra in the region of the radio lobes and in the cross-cone region to
estimate the contribution of the non-thermal (IC/CMB) and thermal (IGM)
processes to the observed emission, making use of radio (VLA and GMRT) data to
investigate the multi-wavelength emission arising from the lobes. We collected
Pan-STARRS photometric data to investigate the presence of a galaxy cluster
hosting 3C 187, looking for the presence of a ""red sequence"" in the source
field in the form of a tight clustering of the galaxies in the color space...

have simulated the 21-cm signal using radiative transfer code GRIZZLY, while
considering two types of sources (mini-QSOs and HMXBs) for Ly$\alpha$ coupling
and the X-ray heating of the IGM. Using this simulated signal, we have, for the
first time, estimated the CD 21-cm bispectra for all unique $k$-triangles and
for a range of $k$ modes. We observe that the redshift evolution of the
bispectra magnitude and sign follow a generic trend for both source models.
However, the redshifts at which the bispectra magnitude reach their maximum and
minimum values and show their sign reversal depends on the source model. When
the Ly$\alpha$ coupling and the X-ray heating of the IGM occur simultaneously,
we observe two consecutive sign reversals in the bispectra for small
$k$-triangles (irrespective of the source models). One arising at the beginning
of the IGM heating and the other at the end of Ly$\alpha$ coupling saturation.
This feature can be used in principle to constrain the CD history and/or to
identify the specific CD scenarios. We also quantify the impact of the spin
temperature ($T_{\rm S}$) fluctuations on the bispectra. We find that $T_{\rm
S}$ fluctuations have maximum impact on the bispectra magnitude for small
$k$-triangles and at the stage when Ly$\alpha$ coupling reaches saturation.
Furthermore, we are also the first to quantify the impact of redshift space
distortions (RSD), on the CD bispectra. We find that the impact of RSD on the
CD 21-cm bispectra is significant ($> 20\%$) and the level depends on the
stages of the CD and the $k$-triangles for which the bispectra are being
estimated.

locations of LGRBs, H-poor SLSNe, SGRBs, and Ca-rich transients. We further
find that most FRBs are not in regions of elevated local star formation rate
and stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of
their hosts. We also place upper limits to the IR flux at the FRB positions of
$m_{\rm IR}\gtrsim\!24.8-27.6$~AB~mag, constraining both satellite and

finite-frequency quantum oscillations, which can become comparable to the
extremal area of the unhybridized bulk bands. We show that this occurs when the
crystal symmetry is lowered from cubic to tetragonal in a minimal two-orbital
model. We label such surface modes as `shadow surface states'. Moreover, we
show that the sufficient next-nearest neighbor out-of-plane hybridization
leading to shadow surface states can be self-consistently stabilized for
tetragonal topological Kondo insulators. Consequently, shadow surface states
provide an important example of high-frequency quantum oscillations beyond the
context of cubic topological Kondo insulators.

unitary operations, play an important role in the foundations and applications
of quantum thermodynamics. They generalize the familiar Gibbs thermal states,
which are the sole passive states being stable under tensor product. Here, we
introduce a partial order on the set of passive states that captures the idea
of a passive state being virtually cooler than another one. This partial order,
which we build by defining the notion of relative passivity, offers a
fine-grained comparison between passive states based on virtual temperatures
(just like thermal states are compared based on their temperatures). We then
characterize the quantum operations that are closed on the set of virtually
cooler states with respect to some fixed input and output passive states.
Viewing the activity, i.e., non-passivity, of a state as a resource, our main
result is then a necessary and sufficient condition on the transformation of a
class of pure active states under these relative passivity-preserving
operations. This condition gives a quantum thermodynamical meaning to the
majorization relation on the set of non-increasing vectors due to Hoffman. The
maximum extractable work under relative passivity-preserving operations is then
shown to be equal to the ergotropy of these pure active states. Finally, we are
able to fully characterize passivity-preserving operations in the simpler case
of qubit systems, and hence to derive a state interconversion condition under
passivity-preserving qubit operations. The prospect of this work is a general
resource-theoretical framework for the extractable work via quantum operations
going beyond thermal operations.

stability of the instrumental background and operation of the SRG Observatory

this study, we discuss the rich morphology revealed by the X-ray observations
(also in combination with the SZ data) and argue that the most salient features
can be naturally explained by a recent (on-going) merger with the NGC 4839
group. In particular, we identify a faint X-ray bridge connecting the group
with the cluster, which is convincing proof that NGC 4839 has already crossed
the main cluster. The gas in the Coma core went through two shocks, first
through the shock driven by NGC 4839 during its first passage through the
cluster some Gyr ago, and, more recently, through the ""mini-accretion shock""
associated with the gas settling back to quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium in the
core. After passing through the primary shock, the gas should spend much of the
time in a rarefaction region, where radiative losses of electrons are small,
until the gas is compressed again by the mini-accretion shock. Unlike ""runway""
merger shocks, the mini-accretion shock does not feature a rarefaction region
downstream and, therefore, the radio emission can survive longer. Such a
two-stage process might explain the formation of the radio halo in the Coma
cluster.

($\delta>-28^{o}$) at a cadence of 2 days. We present PGIR light curves for 922

or declines similar to RCB stars. Majority of the candidates that are not RCB
stars are either long period variables (LPVs) or RV-Tauri stars. We identify IR
color-based criteria to better distinguish between RCB stars and LPVs. As part
of a pilot spectroscopic run, we obtained NIR spectra for 26 out of the 149

strong He I $\lambda 10830$ features in spectra of all RCB stars, likely
originating within high velocity (200-400 km-s$^{-1}$) winds in their
atmospheres. 9 of these RCB stars show $^{12}$C$^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$^{18}$O

Some of this terrestrial RFI is impulsive and bright, and relatively easy to
identify and remove. Other anthropogenic signals, however, are weaker yet
periodic, and their persistence can drown out astrophysical signals. Here we
show that Fourier-domain excision of periodic RFI is an effective and powerful
step in detecting weak cosmic signals. We find that applying the method
significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio of transient as well as
periodic pulsar signals. In live studies, we detected single pulses from
pulsars and FRBs that would otherwise have remained buried in background noise.
We show the method has no negative effects on pulsar pulse shape and that it
enhances timing campaigns. We demonstrate the method on real-life data from a
number of large radio telescopes, and conclude that Fourier-domain RFI excision
increases the effective sensitivity to astrophysical sources by a significant
fraction which can be even larger than an order of magnitude in case of strong
RFI. An accelerated implementation of the method runs on standard time-domain
radio data formats and is publicly available.

approaches: (1) swarm-based MARL, and (2) coverage-range-based MARL. The former
is trained using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)
approach whereas, a modified version of MADDPG is introduced for the latter
with a reward function that intrinsically leads to a collective behavior. Both
methods are tested and validated with different geometric shaped regions with
equal surface area (square vs. rectangle) yielding acceptable area coverage,
and benefiting from the structured learning in non-stationary environments.
Both approaches are advantageous compared to a na\""{i}ve swarming method.
However, coverage-range-based MARL outperforms the swarm-based MARL with
stronger convergence features in learning criteria and higher spreading of
agents for area coverage.

selects the desired environment, robot, objects, task and type of reward as

high-$z$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and relevant scientific topics. Since the
discovery of LAEs in the late 1990s, more than ten (one) thousand(s) of LAEs
have been identified photometrically (spectroscopically) at $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim
10$. These large samples of LAEs are useful to address two major astrophysical
issues, galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Statistical studies have
revealed the general picture of LAEs' physical properties: young stellar
populations, remarkable luminosity function evolutions, compact morphologies,
highly ionized inter-stellar media (ISM) with low metal/dust contents, low
masses of dark-matter halos. Typical LAEs represent low-mass high-$z$ galaxies,
high-$z$ analogs of dwarf galaxies, some of which are thought to be candidates
of population III galaxies. These observational studies have also pinpointed
rare bright Ly$\alpha$ sources extended over $\sim 10-100$ kpc, dubbed
Ly$\alpha$ blobs, whose physical origins are under debate. LAEs are used as
probes of cosmic reionization history through the Ly$\alpha$ damping wing
absorption given by the neutral hydrogen of the inter-galactic medium (IGM),
which complement the cosmic microwave background radiation and 21cm
observations. The low-mass and highly-ionized population of LAEs can be major
sources of cosmic reionization. The budget of ionizing photons for cosmic
reionization has been constrained, although there remain large observational
uncertainties in the parameters. Beyond galaxy formation and cosmic
reionization, several new usages of LAEs for science frontiers have been
suggested such as the distribution of {\sc Hi} gas in the circum-galactic
medium and filaments of large-scale structures. On-going programs and future
telescope projects, such as JWST, ELTs, and SKA, will push the horizons of the
science frontiers.

  Seen as such, Rosen's `proof' that no living system can be a mechanism arises
from a tension between two contrapuntal needs: on one side, the necessity to

necessity to describe a syntheticum via an universally chosen analyticum.

dynamics (AIMD) simulations of a hydrated excess proton in water to quantify
the relative occurrence of concerted hopping events and <span>rattling</span>
events, and thus to further elucidate the hopping mechanism of proton transport
in water. Contrary to results reported in certain earlier papers, the new
analysis finds that concerted hopping events do occur in all simulations, but
that the majority of events are the product of proton rattling, where the
excess proton will rattle between two or more waters. The results are
consistent with the proposed <span>special-pair dance</span> model of the
hydrated excess proton, wherein the acceptor water molecule for the proton
transfer will quickly change (resonate between three equivalent special pairs)
until a decisive proton hop occurs. To remove the misleading effect of simple
rattling, a filter was applied to the trajectory such that hopping events that
were followed by back hops to the original water are not counted. A steep
reduction in the number of multiple hopping events is found when the filter is
applied, suggesting that many multiple hopping events that occur in the
unfiltered trajectory are largely the product of rattling, contrary to prior
suggestions. Comparing the continuous correlation function of the filtered and
unfiltered trajectories, we find agreement with experimental values for the
proton hopping time and Eigen-Zundel interconversion time, respectively.

We study the intersections of a top dimensional cell with another cell (for
another basis). Such an intersection is naturally identified with a subset of
the lower nilpotent group $Lo_{n+1}^{1}$. We are particularly interested in the
homotopy type of such intersections. In this paper we define a stratification
of such intersections. As a consequence, we obtain a finite CW complex which is
homotopically equivalent to the intersection.
  We compute the homotopy type for several examples. It turns out that for $n

contractible: we prove this by explicitly constructing the corresponding CW
complexes. Conversely, for $n \ge 5$ and the top permutation, there is always a
connected component with even Euler characteristic, and therefore not
contractible. This follows from formulas for the number of cells per dimension
of the corresponding CW complex. For instance, for the top permutation $S_6$,
there exists a connected component with Euler characteristic equal to $2$. We
also give an example of a permutation in $S_6$ for which there exists a
connected component which is homotopically equivalent to the circle $S^1$.

arXiv:2006.09297, 2020]. The proposed methods use model order reduction
techniques for parametrized PDEs to significantly reduce the computational

two-dimensional forward advection-dispersion equations (ADEs), where its
performance for various P\'{e}clet numbers ($Pe$) is compared with the

  Reinforcement Learning","Presented at CORL 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in
developing feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies
to analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees
(even statistically) about robustness. The central reasons for this are largely
due to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box
nature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the
first of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite
large in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control
methods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics
that are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this
work we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools
from fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We
then show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free
reinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing
function to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality
reduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the
modified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in
general for the systems we examined.

rate greater than the Eddington rate, powerful jets and winds driven by strong
radiation pressure should form. We investigate the structure of the jet-wind
system for a model of Population III microquasar on scales beyond the jet-wind
formation region. Using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations we find that the
ratio of kinetic power between the jet and the disk wind determines the
configuration of the system. When the power is dominated by the wind, the jet
fills a narrow channel, collimated by the dense outflow. When the jet dominates
the power of the system, part of its energy is diverted turning the wind into a
quasi-equatorial flow, while the jet widens. From the results of our
simulations, we implement semi-analytical calculations of the impact of the
quasiequatorial wind on scales of the order of the size of the binary system.
Our results indicate that Population III microquasars might inject gamma rays
and relativistic particles into the early intergalactic medium, contributing to
its reionization at large distances from the binary system.

related to face masks have been essential in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.
We assessed the prevalence and correlates of mask usage during the pandemic.
  Methods: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily
cross-sectional representative online survey in 38 countries who completed from
April 23, 2020 to October 31, 2020 and reported having been in public at least
once during the last seven days. The outcome was individual face mask usage in
public settings, and the predictors were country fixed effects, country-level
mask policy stringency, calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and
health prevention behaviors. Associations were modelled using survey-weighted
multivariable logistic regression.
  Findings: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While
some countries consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other
countries mask usage increased gradually, and a few other countries remained at
low prevalence. Controlling for time and country fixed effects,
sociodemographic factors (older age, female gender, education, urbanicity) and
stricter mask-related policies were significantly associated with higher mask
usage in public settings, while social behaviors considered risky in the
context of the pandemic (going out to large events, restaurants, shopping
centers, and socializing outside of the household) were associated with lower
mask use.
  Interpretation: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is
significantly associated with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors,
and mask policies. This has important implications for health prevention
policies and messaging, including the potential need for more targeted policy
and messaging design.

characterization of the identified set. Therefore, empirical works often
construct confidence region based on an outer set of the identified set.
Because an outer set is always a superset of the identified set, this practice
is often viewed as conservative yet valid. However, this paper shows that, when
the model is refuted by the data, a nonempty outer set could deliver
conflicting results with another outer set derived from the same underlying
model structure, so that the results of outer sets could be misleading in the
presence of misspecification. We provide a sufficient condition for the
existence of discordant outer sets which covers models characterized by
intersection bounds and the Artstein (1983) inequalities. We also derive
sufficient conditions for the non-existence of discordant submodels, therefore
providing a class of models for which constructing outer sets cannot lead to
misleading interpretations. In the case of discordancy, we follow Masten and
Poirier (2021) by developing a method to salvage misspecified models, but
unlike them we focus on discrete relaxations. We consider all minimum
relaxations of a refuted model which restores data-consistency. We find that

for comparing flow fields with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results, and
model design and validation. However, PIV features a complex measurement chain
with coupled, non-linear error sources, and quantifying the uncertainty is
challenging. Multiple assessments show that none of the current methods can
reliably measure the actual uncertainty across a wide range of experiments.
Because the current methods differ in assumptions regarding the measurement
process and calculation procedures, it is not clear which method is best to use
for an experiment. To address this issue, we propose a method to estimate an
uncertainty method's sensitivity and reliability, termed the Meta-Uncertainty.
The novel approach is automated, local, and instantaneous, and based on
perturbation of the recorded particle images. We developed an image
perturbation scheme based on adding random unmatched particles to the
interrogation window pair considering the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the
correlation plane. Each uncertainty scheme's response to several trials of
random particle addition is used to estimate a reliability metric, defined as
the rate of change of the inter-quartile range (IQR) of the uncertainties with
increasing levels of particle addition. We also propose applying the
meta-uncertainty as a weighting metric to combine uncertainty estimates from
individual schemes, based on ideas from the consensus forecasting literature.
We use PIV measurements across a range of canonical flows to assess the
performance of the uncertainty schemes.The results show that the combined
uncertainty method outperforms the individual methods, and establish the
meta-uncertainty as a useful reliability assessment tool for PIV uncertainty
quantification.

overflow. We present a phase-resolved X-ray spectral and timing analysis of two
pointed XMM-Newton observations. The first one took place during a normal state
of the source, when it has a luminosity $L_{\rm X}\sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
This observation covered orbital phases $\phi= 0.00-0.37$, i.e. the egress from
the eclipse. The egress lightcurve is highly structured, showing distinctive
intervals. We argue that different intervals correspond to the emergence of
different emitting structures. The lightcurve analysis enables us to estimate
the size of such structures around the compact star, the most conspicuous of
which has a size $\sim 0.3R_{*}$, of the order of the Roche lobe radius. During
the egress, the equivalent width of Fe emission lines, from highly ionized
species, decreases as the X-ray continuum grows. On the other hand, the
equivalent width of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, from near neutral Fe, strengthens.
This line is likely formed due to the X-ray illumination of the accretion
stream. The second observation was taken when the source was 10 times X-ray
brighter and covered the orbital phases $\phi= 0.36-0.80$. The X-ray lightcurve
in the high state shows dips. These dips are not caused by absorption but can
be due to instabilities in the accretion stream. The typical dip duration, of
about 1000~s, is much longer than the timescale attributed to the accretion of
the clumpy stellar wind of the massive donor star, but is similar to the
viscous timescale at the inner radius of the accretion disk.

natural and balanced distributions of the training set in deep learning (DL)

WSIs are considered as the gold standard for cancer diagnosis. In recent years,
researchers have turned their attention to DL models to automate and accelerate
the diagnosis process. In the training of such DL models, filtering out the
non-regions-of-interest from the WSIs and adopting an artificial distribution
(usually, a balanced distribution) is a common trend. In our analysis, we show
that keeping the WSIs data in their usual distribution (which we call natural

comparable false negatives (FNs) than the artificially-obtained balanced
distribution. We conduct an empirical comparative study with 10 random folds
for each distribution, comparing the resulting average performance levels in
terms of five different evaluation metrics. Experimental results show the

performance improvements in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural

different from these other application areas. A common form of IR involves
ranking of documents--or short passages--in response to keyword-based queries.
Effective IR systems must deal with query-document vocabulary mismatch problem,
by modeling relationships between different query and document terms and how
they indicate relevance. Models should also consider lexical matches when the
query contains rare terms--such as a person's name or a product model
number--not seen during training, and to avoid retrieving semantically related
but irrelevant results. In many real-life IR tasks, the retrieval involves
extremely large collections--such as the document index of a commercial Web
search engine--containing billions of documents. Efficient IR methods should
take advantage of specialized IR data structures, such as inverted index, to
efficiently retrieve from large collections. Given an information need, the IR
system also mediates how much exposure an information artifact receives by
deciding whether it should be displayed, and where it should be positioned,
among other results. Exposure-aware IR systems may optimize for additional
objectives, besides relevance, such as parity of exposure for retrieved items
and content publishers. In this thesis, we present novel neural architectures
and methods motivated by the specific needs and challenges of IR tasks.

new optical candidates across 5 GW events which we are unable to rule out after
searching for additional information and comparing to kilonova models. Using

components that are most likely to be vulnerable. Typically, this problem is
tackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. Unfortunately,
recent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the
following two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the
inherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered
much later than they are introduced. This misleads classifiers as they learn to
recognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. To tackle these
issues, we propose TROVON, a technique that learns from known vulnerable
components rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as
typically performed. We perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and
their respective fixed components. This way, TROVON manages to learn from the
things we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and
unbalanced data. We evaluate TROVON by comparing it with existing techniques on
three security-critical open source systems, i.e., Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, and
Wireshark, with historical vulnerabilities that have been reported in the
National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Our evaluation demonstrates that the
prediction capability of TROVON significantly outperforms existing
vulnerability prediction techniques such as Software Metrics, Imports, Function
Calls, Text Mining, Devign, LSTM, and LSTM-RF with an improvement of 40.84% in

In each stage, a set of intermediate parallel data flows (Coflow) is produced
and transferred between servers to enable starting of next stage. While there
has been much research on scheduling isolated coflows, the dependency between
coflows in multi-stage jobs has been largely ignored. In this paper, we
consider scheduling coflows of multi-stage jobs represented by general DAGs
(Directed Acyclic Graphs) in a shared data center network, so as to minimize
the total weighted completion time of jobs. This problem is significantly more
challenging than the traditional coflow scheduling, as scheduling even a single
multi-stage job to minimize its completion time is shown to be NP-hard.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation
ratio of $O(\mu\log(m)/\log(\log(m)))$, where $\mu$ is the maximum number of
coflows in a job and $m$ is the number of servers. For the special case that
the jobs' underlying dependency graphs are rooted trees, we modify the
algorithm and improve its approximation ratio. To verify the performance of our
algorithms, we present simulation results using real traffic traces that show
up to $53 \%$ improvement over the prior approach. We conclude the paper by
providing a result concerning an optimality gap for scheduling coflows with

long standing problems, which date back to the work of D. Lynden-Bell on
violent relaxation and extends to the issue of virialization of dark matter
(DM) halos. An important prediction of such a relaxation process is that
spherical equilibrium states can be described by a Fermi-Dirac phase-space
distribution, when the extremization of a coarse-grained entropy is reached. In
the case of DM fermions, the most general solution develops a degenerate
compact core surrounded by a diluted halo. As shown recently, the latter is
able to explain the galaxy rotation curves while the DM core can mimic the
central black hole. A yet open problem is whether this kind of astrophysical
core-halo configurations can form at all, and if they remain stable within
cosmological timescales. We assess these issues by performing a thermodynamic
stability analysis in the microcanonical ensemble for solutions with given
particle number at halo virialization in a cosmological framework. For the
first time we demonstrate that the above core-halo DM profiles are stable (i.e.
maxima of entropy) and extremely long lived. We find the existence of a
critical point at the onset of instability of the core-halo solutions, where
the fermion-core collapses towards a supermassive black hole. For particle
masses in the keV range, the core-collapse can only occur for $M_{\rm vir}

advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot
navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representations
learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop
predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises
from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with
ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes
from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from ""positive"" examples, it is
difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of ""negative"" examples
like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly
modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social
contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by
discerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii)
we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare
but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision
rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement
learning algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/social-nce.

the emissivity and temperature of a body, and increases monotonically with the
temperature rise at any emitted wavelength. Nonthermal radiation, such as
photoluminescence, is a fundamental light matter interaction that
conventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,
and the emission of a redshifted photon. Such a quantum process is governed by
rate conservation, which is contingent on the quantum efficiency. In the past,
the role of rate conservation for significant thermal excitation had not been
studied. Recently, we presented the theory and an experimental demonstration
that showed, in contrast to thermal emission, that the PL rate is conserved
when the temperature increases while each photon is blueshifted. A further rise
in temperature leads to an abrupt transition to thermal emission where the
photon rate increases sharply. We also demonstrated how such thermally enhanced
PL, TEPL, generates orders of magnitude more energetic photons than thermal
emission at similar temperatures. These findings show that TEPL is an ideal
optical heat pump that can harvest thermal losses in photovoltaics with a
maximal theoretical efficiency of 70%, and practical concepts potentially
reaching 45% efficiency. Here we move the TEPL concept onto the engineering
level and present Cr:Nd:YAG as device grade PL material, absorbing solar
radiation up to 1 micrometer wavelength and heated by thermalization of
energetic photons. Its blueshifted emission, which can match GaAs cells, is 20%
of the absorbed power. Based on a detailed balance simulation, such a material
coupled with proper photonic management can reach 34% power conversion
efficiency. These results raise confidence in the potential of TEPL becoming a
disruptive technology in photovoltaics.

chosen neighbors (copy their state) only if all $q$ neighbors are in the same
state. Additionally, a voter can act independently, taking a randomly chosen
state, which introduces disorder to the system. We consider two types of
disorder: (1) annealed, which means that each voter can act independently with
probability $p$ and with complementary probability $1-p$ conform to others, and
(2) quenched, which means that there is a fraction $p$ of all voters, which are
permanently independent and the rest of them are conformists. We analyze the
model on the complete graph analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations. We
show that for the number of states $s>2$ model displays discontinuous phase
transitions for any $q>1$, on contrary to the model with binary opinions, in

unlike the case of $s=2$, for $s>2$ discontinuous phase transitions survive
under the quenched disorder, although they are less sharp than under the
annealed one.

delays of radio waves, parametrized by the dispersion measure (DM),
particularly if these delays are variable in time. In a previous paper we
studied the Solar-wind (SW) models used in pulsar timing to mitigate the excess
of DM annually induced by the SW, and found these to be insufficient for
high-precision pulsar timing. Here we analyze additional pulsar datasets to
further investigate which aspects of the SW models currently used in pulsar
timing can be readily improved, and at what levels of timing precision SW
mitigation is possible. Our goals are to verify: a) whether the data are better
described by a spherical model of the SW with a time-variable amplitude rather
than a time-invariant one as suggested in literature, b) whether a temporal
trend of such a model's amplitudes can be detected. We use the pulsar-timing
technique on low-frequency pulsar observations to estimate the DM and quantify
how this value changes as the Earth moves around the Sun. Specifically, we
monitor the DM in weekly to monthly observations of 14 pulsars taken with LOFAR
across time spans of up to 6 years. We develop an informed algorithm to
separate the interstellar variations in DM from those caused by the SW and
demonstrate the functionality of this algorithm with extensive simulations.
Assuming a spherically symmetric model for the SW density, we derive the
amplitude of this model for each year of observations. We show that a spherical
model with time-variable amplitude models the observations better than a
spherical model with constant amplitude, but that both approaches leave
significant SW induced delays uncorrected in a number of pulsars in the sample.
The amplitude of the spherical model is found to be variable in time, as
opposed to what has been previously suggested.

fundamentals from quantum calculations with the higher accuracy of experimental

the noise in the experimental test data, known as the aleatoric uncertainty. On
a random test split, a mean absolute error of 0.21 kcal/mol is achieved. This
is a significant improvement compared to the mean absolute error of the quantum

density estimation. The methods based on the density power divergence (DPD)
represent the current standard in this area of research. In this paper, we will
present a more generalized divergence that subsumes the DPD as a special case
and produces several new options providing better compromises between

Using spatially resolved visible-wavelength spectra of Europa obtained with the

hemisphere and compare their geographies with the distributions of large-scale
geology, magnetospheric bombardment, and surface color. Based on such
comparisons, we interpret some aspects of our spectra as indicative of purely
exogenous sulfur radiolysis products and other aspects as indicative of
radiolysis products formed from a mixture of endogenous material and
magnetospheric sulfur. The spatial distributions of two of the absorptions seen
in our spectra -- a widespread downturn toward the near-UV and a distinct
feature at 530 nm -- appear consistent with sulfur allotropes previously
suggested from ground-based spectrophotometry. However, the geographies of two
additional features -- an absorption feature at 360 nm and the spectral slope
at red wavelengths -- are more consistent with endogenous material that has
been altered by sulfur radiolysis. We suggest irradiated sulfate salts as
potential candidates for this material, but we are unable to identify
particular species with the available data.

However, the UV flux is partly unobservable due to interstellar absorption,
particularly in the EUV range (100--912 A). It is therefore necessary to
reconstruct the unobservable spectra in order to characterize the radiation
environment of exoplanets. In the present work, we use a radiative transfer
code SSRPM to build one-dimensional semi-empirical models of two M dwarf
exoplanet hosts, GJ 832 and GJ 581, and synthesize their spectra. SSRPM is
equipped with an extensive atomic and molecular database and full-NLTE
capabilities. We use observations in the visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray ranges
to constrain atmospheric structures of the modeled stars. The synthesized
integrated EUV fluxes are found to be in good agreement with other
reconstruction techniques, but the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
disagree significantly across the EUV range. More than 2/3 of the EUV flux is
formed above $10^5$ K. We find that the far ultraviolet (FUV) continuum
contributes 42--54 % of the entire FUV flux between 1450--1700 A. The
comparison of stellar structures of GJ 832 and GJ 581 suggests that GJ 832 is a

best previously found bound of $2^{\sim 0.468 t}$. We numerically demonstrate
this reduction. This constructively produces the most efficient strong
simulation algorithm of the Clifford+$T$ gateset to relative or multiplicative

rank, which is a slight generalization of the stabilizer rank and is a lower
bound on its asymptotic scaling. We demonstrate that this lower bound appears
to be tight at low $t$-counts, which suggests that the stabilizer rank found at
the twelve-qubit state can be lowered further to $2^{\sim 0.449 t}$ and we
prove and numerically show that this is the case for single-Pauli measurements.
Our construction directly shows how the reduction at $12$ qubits is iteratively
based on the reduction obtained at $6$, $3$, $2$, and $1$ qubits. This explains
why novel reductions are found at tensor factors for these number of qubit
primitives, an explanation lacking previously in the literature. Furthermore,
in the process we observe an interesting relationship between the T gate magic

computational sub-basis tensored with single-qubit states that produce minimal

\{\,c^\intercal x\ \colon\ Ax=b, x\geq 0\}$, where $A$ is a multistage
stochastic matrix in the following sense: the primal treedepth of $A$ is
bounded by a parameter $d$, which means that the columns of $A$ can be
organized into a rooted forest of depth at most $d$ so that columns not bound
by the ancestor/descendant relation in the forest do not have non-zero entries
in the same row. We give an algorithm that solves this problem in
fixed-parameter time $f(d,\|A\|_{\infty})\cdot n\log^{O(2^d)} n$, where $f$ is
a computable function and $n$ is the number of rows of $A$. The algorithm works
in the strong model, where the running time only measures unit arithmetic
operations on the input numbers and does not depend on their bitlength. This is
the first fpt algorithm for multistage stochastic integer programming to
achieve almost linear running time in the strong sense. For the case of
two-stage stochastic integer programs, our algorithm works in time
$2^{(2\|A\|_\infty)^{O(r(r+s))}}\cdot n\log^{O(rs)} n$. The algorithm can be
also parallelized: we give an implementation in the PRAM model that achieves
running time $f(d,\|A\|_{\infty})\cdot \log^{O(2^d)} n$ using $n$ processors.
  The main conceptual ingredient in our algorithms is a new proximity result
for multistage stochastic integer programs. We prove that if we consider an
integer program $P$, say with a constraint matrix $A$, then for every optimum
solution to the linear relaxation of $P$ there exists an optimum (integral)
solution to $P$ that lies, in the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm, within distance bounded
by a function of $\|A\|_{\infty}$ and the primal treedepth of $A$. On the way
to achieve this result, we prove a generalization and considerable improvement
of a structural result of Klein for multistage stochastic integer programs.

X-ray scattering ring observed so far. Dust scattering halos, in particular the
rings found around transient sources, offer the possibility of precise distance
measurements towards the original X-ray sources. We combine data from
SRG/eROSITA, XMM-Newton, MAXI, and Gaia to measure the geometrical distance of
MAXI J1348-630. The Gaia data place the scattering dust at a distance of 2050
pc, from the measured time lags and the geometry of the ring, we find MAXI
J1348-630 at a distance of 3390 pc with a statistical uncertainty of only 1.1%
and a systematic uncertainty of 10% caused mainly by the parallax offset of
Gaia. This result makes MAXI J1348-630 one of the black hole transients with
the best determined distances. The new distance leads to a revised mass
estimate for the black hole of 11+-2 solar masses, the transition to the soft

variables in addition to the variable of primary interest. These latent
variables often affect a large number of features (e.g., genes) and thus give
rise to dense latent variation, which presents both challenges and
opportunities for classification. Some of these latent variables may be
partially correlated with the phenotype of interest and therefore helpful,
while others may be uncorrelated and thus merely contribute additional noise.
Moreover, whether potentially helpful or not, these latent variables may
obscure weaker effects that impact only a small number of features but more
directly capture the signal of primary interest. We propose the
cross-residualization classifier to better account for the latent variables in
genomic data. Through an adjustment and ensemble procedure, the
cross-residualization classifier essentially estimates the latent variables and
residualizes out their effects, trains a classifier on the residuals, and then
re-integrates the the latent variables in a final ensemble classifier. Thus,
the latent variables are accounted for without discarding any potentially
predictive information that they may contribute. We apply the method to
simulated data as well as a variety of genomic datasets from multiple
platforms. In general, we find that the cross-residualization classifier
performs well relative to existing classifiers and sometimes offers substantial
gains.

the behavior of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Neural Networks (NNs), where
verification entails determining whether the NN satisfies convex polytopic
specifications. Specifically, we show that for two different NN architectures
-- shallow NNs and Two-Level Lattice (TLL) NNs -- the verification problem with
(convex) polytopic constraints is polynomial in the number of neurons in the NN
to be verified, when all other aspects of the verification problem held fixed.
We achieve these complexity results by exhibiting explicit (but similar)
verification algorithms for each type of architecture. Both algorithms
efficiently translate the NN parameters into a partitioning of the NN's input
space by means of hyperplanes; this has the effect of partitioning the original
verification problem into polynomially many sub-verification problems derived
from the geometry of the neurons. We show that these sub-problems may be chosen
so that the NN is purely affine within each, and hence each sub-problem is
solvable in polynomial time by means of a Linear Program (LP). Thus, a
polynomial-time algorithm for the original verification problem can be obtained
using known algorithms for enumerating the regions in a hyperplane arrangement.
Finally, we adapt our proposed algorithms to the verification of dynamical
systems, specifically when these NN architectures are used as state-feedback
controllers for LTI systems. We further evaluate the viability of this approach
numerically.

exhibits non-trivial time-dependence. In this work, we show how time-rescaling

absorbed into the effective potentials through a judiciously chosen unitary
transformation. This is demonstrated for two experimentally relevant scenarios,

by a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological invariant had a lasting effect on the study of

topology can be found in the band-like excitations of magnetic insulators, and
recently models supporting $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topological invariants have been
proposed for both magnon [Kondo et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 041110(R) (2019)] and
triplet [D. G. Joshi and A. P. Schnyder, Phys. Rev. B 100, 020407 (2019)]
excitations. In both cases, magnetic excitations form time--reversal (TR)
partners, which mimic the Kramers pairs of electrons in the Kane-Mele model but
do not enjoy the same type of symmetry protection. In this paper, we revisit
this problem in the context of the triplet excitations of a spin model on the
bilayer kagome lattice. Here the triplet excitations provide a faithful analog
of the Kane-Mele model as long as the Hamiltonian preserves the TR$\times$U(1)
symmetry. We find that exchange anisotropies, allowed by the point group and
typical in realistic models, break the required TR$\times$U(1) symmetry and
instantly destroy the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ band topology. We further consider the
effects of TR breaking by an applied magnetic field. In this case, the lifting
of spin-degeneracy leads to a triplet Chern insulator, which is stable against
the breaking of TR$\times$U(1) symmetry. Kagome bands realize both a quadratic
and a linear band touching, and we provide a thorough characterization of the
Berry curvature associated with both cases. We also calculate the
triplet-mediated spin Nernst and thermal Hall signals which could be measured
in experiments. These results suggest that the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ topology of
band-like excitations in magnets may be intrinsically fragile compared to their

hypergraphs, tournaments, permutations, etc. However, these quasirandomness
variants have been done in an ad-hoc case-by-case manner. In this paper, we
propose three new hierarchies of quasirandomness properties that can be
naturally defined for arbitrary combinatorial objects. Our properties are also
""natural"" in more formal sense: they are preserved by local combinatorial
constructions (encoded by open interpretations). We show that our
quasirandomness properties have several different but equivalent
characterizations that are similar to hypergraph quasirandomness properties. We
also prove several implications and separations comparing them to each other
and to what has been known for hypergraphs.
  The main notion explored by our statements and proofs is that of unique
coupleability: two limit objects are uniquely coupleable if there is a unique
limit object in the combined theory that is an alignment (i.e., a coupling) of
these two objects.

dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) is demonstrated. This approach provides a scheme
to realize multipartite high-dimensional entangled states in the microwave (MW)
and terahertz (THz) regimes, through the modulation in a MW-resonator coupled
to an optical microresonator supporting temporal optical solitons. The states
at the MW-resonator evolve from the ground state, realizing real-photons from
the virtual photons at the ground state. The periodic modulation of the
MW-resonator through a Kerr-induced refractive index change in the optical
microresonator, along with the localized spatial distribution of the
dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs), enables photon-pair generation and inter-mode
coupling at the MW-resonator. This allows generating highly persistent
multipartite high-dimensional entangled states in a wide range of spectrum. The
proposed approach paves the way for a hybrid integrated platform for generation
of multipartite entangled qudits (high-dimensional qubits) at the MW and THz
regimes using highly coherent ultra-short optical pulses in a monolithic
integrated platform. This architecture can act as an entangled state source, as
a necessary resource for exploiting a wide range of quantum protocols from
fault-tolerant computing to enhanced sensing and teleportation.

critical order parameter. At low energies, this physics can be described by an
effective model with the dynamical electron-electron interaction $V(\Omega_m)
\propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$, up to some upper cutoff $\Lambda$. The case
$\gamma =0$ corresponds to BCS theory, and can be solved by summing up
geometric series of Cooper logarithms. We show that for a finite $\gamma$, the
pairing problem is still marginal (i.e., perturbation series are logarithmic),
but one needs to go beyond logarithmic approximation to find the pairing
instability. We discuss specifics of the pairing at $\gamma >0$ in some detail
and also analyze the marginal case $\gamma = 0+$, when $V(\Omega_m) = \lambda

radiation. However, black holes differ from standard astrophysical objects: in
the absence of absorption and scattering, an observer sees a series of
increasingly demagnified echos of each emitting location. These echos
correspond to rays that orbit the black hole one or more times before reaching
the observer. This multi-path propagation introduces spatial and temporal
correlations into the electric field that encode properties of the black hole,
irrespective of intrinsic variability. We explore the coherent temporal
autocorrelation function measured at a single telescope. Specifically, we study
the simplified toy problem of scalar field correlation functions $\langle
\Psi(t) \Psi(0) \rangle$ sourced by fluctuating matter located near a
Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the correlation function is peaked at
times equal to integer multiples of the photon orbit period; the corresponding
power spectral density vanishes like $\lambda/r_{\rm g}$ where $r_{\rm g} = G M

millimeter wavelengths, the power in echos is suppressed relative to direct
emission by $\sim 10^{-13} \lambda_{\rm mm}/M_{6}$, where $\lambda_{\rm mm} =

Explanation (CE), also known as Actionable Recourse, which provides a user with
a perturbation vector of features that alters the prediction result. Given a
perturbation vector, a user can interpret it as an ""action"" for obtaining one's
desired decision result. In practice, however, showing only a perturbation
vector is often insufficient for users to execute the action. The reason is
that if there is an asymmetric interaction among features, such as causality,
the total cost of the action is expected to depend on the order of changing
features. Therefore, practical CE methods are required to provide an
appropriate order of changing features in addition to a perturbation vector.
For this purpose, we propose a new framework called Ordered Counterfactual
Explanation (OrdCE). We introduce a new objective function that evaluates a
pair of an action and an order based on feature interaction. To extract an
optimal pair, we propose a mixed-integer linear optimization approach with our
objective function. Numerical experiments on real datasets demonstrated the

further show that bottleneck objective such as the minimum SINR along the route
can also be optimized effectively using reinforcement learning. Specifically,
we propose a scalable approach in which a single agent is associated with each

frontier nodes. The agent is trained according to the physical-layer

solve sequential optimization problems that involve high dimensional

constraints expressed by inequality constraints. This study focuses on using RL
to solve constrained optimal control problems. Most RL application studies have
dealt with inequality constraints by adding soft penalty terms for violating
the constraints to the reward function. However, while training neural networks
to learn the value (or Q) function, one can run into computational issues
caused by the sharp change in the function value at the constraint boundary due
to the large penalty imposed. This difficulty during training can lead to
convergence problems and ultimately lead to poor closed-loop performance. To
address this issue, this study proposes a dynamic penalty (DP) approach where
the penalty factor is gradually and systematically increased during training as
the iteration episodes proceed. We first examine the ability of a neural
network to represent a value function when uniform, linear, or DP functions are
added to prevent constraint violation. The agent trained by a Deep Q Network
(DQN) algorithm with the DP function approach was compared with agents with
other constant penalty functions in a simple vehicle control problem. Results
show that the proposed approach can improve the neural network approximation
accuracy and provide faster convergence when close to a solution.

maintained throughout, and the amplitudes get projected naturally into the
basis of five tensors introduced by Costantini et al. in 1971. Since in many
applications of the ""four-photon box"" some of the photons can be taken in the
low-energy limit, and the formalism makes it easy to integrate out any such
leg, apart from the case of general kinematics (part 4) we also treat the
special cases of one (part 3) or two (part 2) photons taken at low energy. In
this first part of the series, we summarize the application of the worldline
formalism to the N-photon amplitudes and its relation to Feynman diagrams,
derive the optimized tensor-decomposed integrands of the four-photon amplitudes
in scalar and spinor QED, and outline the computational strategy to be followed
in parts 2 to 4.

a human-robot teaming framework. The right explanation provides the rationale
behind an AI agent's decision-making. However, to maintain the human teammate's
cognitive demand to comprehend the provided explanations, prior works have
focused on providing explanations in a specific order or intertwining the
explanation generation with plan execution. Moreover, these approaches do not
consider the degree of details required to share throughout the provided
explanations. In this work, we argue that the agent-generated explanations,
especially the complex ones, should be abstracted to be aligned with the level
of details the human teammate desires to maintain the recipient's cognitive
load. Therefore, learning a hierarchical explanations model is a challenging
task. Moreover, the agent needs to follow a consistent high-level policy to
transfer the learned teammate preferences to a new scenario while lower-level
detailed plans are different. Our evaluation confirmed the process of
understanding an explanation, especially a complex and detailed explanation, is
hierarchical. The human preference that reflected this aspect corresponded
exactly to creating and employing abstraction for knowledge assimilation hidden
deeper in our cognitive process. We showed that hierarchical explanations
achieved better task performance and behavior interpretability while reduced
cognitive load. These results shed light on designing explainable agents
utilizing reinforcement learning and planning across various domains.

non-trivial task for time series data, due to the complex dependence among the

We present in this work a PDE Informed Kriging model (PIK), which introduces
PDE information via a set of PDE points and conducts posterior prediction
similar to the standard kriging method. The proposed PIK model can incorporate
physical knowledge from both linear and nonlinear PDEs. To further improve

PDE points to leverage the PDE information based on the PIK model and

updated explicitly. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification that
this numerical algorithm has a unique solution, such that the positivity is
always preserved for the phase variable at a point-wise level, so that a

connections and provides more information beyond human joints. The two GCNs
work together to estimate the spatial frame-wise 3D poses and can make use of
both visible joint and bone information in the target frame to estimate the
occluded or missing human-part information. To further refine the 3D pose
estimation, we use our temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to enforce the
temporal and human-dynamics constraints. We use a joint-TCN to estimate
person-centric 3D poses across frames, and propose a velocity-TCN to estimate
the speed of 3D joints to ensure the consistency of the 3D pose estimation in

benefit of being able to distinguish homonyms and acronyms given their context.
However, static embeddings are still relevant in low resource settings (e.g.,

a novel training method to train the DINN and it has no re-training overhead

regularizing the temporal behavior. However, the current rigid-body KF
implementations are computationally burdensome and hence, takes long execution
time which hinders real-time surgical tracking. This paper introduces a fast
and computationally efficient implementation of linear KF to improve the
measurement accuracy of an optical tracking system with high temporal
resolution. Instead of the surgical tool as a whole, our KF framework tracks
each individual fiducial mounted on it using a Newtonian model. In addition to
simulated dataset, we validate our technique against real data obtained from a
high frame-rate commercial optical tracking system. The proposed KF framework
substantially stabilizes the tracking behavior in all of our experiments and
reduces the mean-squared error (MSE) from the order of $10^{-2}$ $mm^{2}$ to

  Introduction: Recognizing the cause behind emotions in text is a fundamental
yet under-explored area of research in NLP. Advances in this area hold the
potential to improve interpretability and performance in affect-based models.
Identifying emotion causes at the utterance level in conversations is
particularly challenging due to the intermingling dynamics among the

10,000 utterance cause-effect pairs. Furthermore, we define different cause
types based on the source of the causes, and establish strong Transformer-based
baselines to address two different sub-tasks on this dataset: causal span
extraction and causal emotion entailment.
  Result: Our Transformer-based baselines, which leverage contextual
pre-trained embeddings, such as RoBERTa, outperform the state-of-the-art
emotion cause extraction approaches
  Conclusion: We introduce a new task highly relevant for (explainable)
emotion-aware artificial intelligence: recognizing emotion cause in
conversations, provide a new highly challenging publicly available
dialogue-level dataset for this task, and give strong baseline results on this
dataset.

the occurrence of dissipative quantum phase transition to self-organized exotic

statistics. However, estimation of the parameters of $N_p(\mu,\Sigma)$ under
joint constraints such as $\Sigma\mu = \mu$ has not received much attention. It
can be viewed as a multivariate counterpart of the classical estimation problem
in the $N(\theta,\theta^2)$ distribution. In addition to the usual inference
challenges under such non-linear constraints among the parameters (curved
exponential family), one has to deal with the basic requirements of symmetry
and positive definiteness when estimating a covariance matrix. We derive the
non-linear likelihood equations for the constrained maximum likelihood
estimator of $(\mu,\Sigma)$ and solve them using iterative methods. Generally,
the MLE of covariance matrices computed using iterative methods do not satisfy
the constraints. We propose a novel algorithm to modify such (infeasible)
estimators or any other (reasonable) estimator. The key step is to re-align the
mean vector along the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using the idea of
regression. In using the Lagrangian function for constrained MLE (Aitchison et
al. 1958), the Lagrange multiplier entangles with the parameters of interest
and presents another computational challenge. We handle this by either
iterative or explicit calculation of the Lagrange multiplier. The existence and
nature of location of the constrained MLE are explored within a data-dependent
convex set using recent results from random matrix theory. A simulation study
illustrates our methodology and shows that the modified estimators perform
better than the initial estimators from the iterative methods.

first part of the paper deals with the occurrence of curvature singularities of

theories, even though the curvature scalars of the metric are regular,
invariants involving derivatives of curvatures can still diverge. Indeed, we
prove that if the action contains $2n+6$ derivatives of the metric in both the
scalar and the spin-2 sectors, then all the curvature-derivative invariants
with at most $2n$ covariant derivatives of the curvatures are regular, while
there exist scalars with $2n+2$ derivatives that are singular. The regularity
of all these invariants can be achieved in some classes of nonlocal gravity

quantum corrections do not change the regularity of the Newtonian limit.
Finally, we also consider the infrared limit of these solutions and verify the

a careful analysis to examine whether new neutrino self-interactions solve or

strategies to improve the photon trapping effect while enhancing the speed of

simultaneous broadband absorption efficiency enhancement up to 1000% and a
capacitance reduction of more than 50% has been achieved. Such work also allows
to present empirical equations to correlate the quantum efficiency of

to reduce the problem of bad cycle consistency, in which a bidirectional GAN

Recent studies employed one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) to discover

prerequisite for their trusted deployment in medical settings. Here we apply

shown that networks pertained on CXR images outperform networks pretrained on

Recently, many existing studies regard the cold-start personalized preference
prediction as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is the task and
recommended items are the classes, and the gradient-based meta learning method
(MAML) is leveraged to address this challenge. However, in real-world
application, the users are not uniformly distributed (i.e., different users may
have different browsing history, recommended items, and user profiles. We
define the major users as the users in the groups with large numbers of users
sharing similar user information, and other users are the minor users),
existing MAML approaches tend to fit the major users and ignore the minor
users. To address this cold-start task-overfitting problem, we propose a novel
personalized adaptive meta learning approach to consider both the major and the
minor users with three key contributions: 1) We are the first to present a
personalized adaptive learning rate meta-learning approach to improve the
performance of MAML by focusing on both the major and minor users. 2) To
provide better personalized learning rates for each user, we introduce a
similarity-based method to find similar users as a reference and a tree-based
method to store users' features for fast search. 3) To reduce the memory usage,
we design a memory agnostic regularizer to further reduce the space complexity
to constant while maintain the performance. Experiments on MovieLens,

is essential for continual learning and is challenging in controlling the DNNs.
Such forgetting is crucial also in a practical sense since the deployed DNNs
may be trained on the data with outliers, poisoned by attackers, or with
leaked/sensitive information. In this paper, we formulate selective forgetting
for classification tasks at a finer level than the samples' level. We specify
the finer level based on four datasets distinguished by two conditions: whether
they contain information to be forgotten and whether they are available for the
forgetting procedure. Additionally, we reveal the need for such formulation
with the datasets by showing concrete and practical situations. Moreover, we
introduce the forgetting procedure as an optimization problem on three
criteria; the forgetting, the correction, and the remembering term.
Experimental results show that the proposed methods can make the model forget
to use specific information for classification. Notably, in specific cases, our
methods improved the model's accuracy on the datasets, which contains
information to be forgotten but is unavailable in the forgetting procedure.
Such data are unexpectedly found and misclassified in actual situations.

propose a method for predicting the click through rate (CTR) of video

we demonstrate an optimized framework for accurately predicting the effects by
taking advantage of the multimodal nature of online video advertisements
including video, text, and metadata features. In particular, the two types of
metadata, i.e., categorical and continuous, are properly separated and
normalized. To avoid overfitting, which is crucial in our task because the
training data are not very rich, additional regularization layers are inserted.
Experimental results show that our approach can achieve a correlation

Accepted as an oral paper by CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of label noise often misleads the training of deep neural
networks. Departing from the recent literature which largely assumes the label
noise rate is only determined by the true label class, the errors in
human-annotated labels are more likely to be dependent on the difficulty levels
of tasks, resulting in settings with instance-dependent label noise. We first
provide evidences that the heterogeneous instance-dependent label noise is
effectively down-weighting the examples with higher noise rates in a
non-uniform way and thus causes imbalances, rendering the strategy of directly
applying methods for class-dependent label noise questionable. Built on a
recent work peer loss [24], we then propose and study the potentials of a
second-order approach that leverages the estimation of several covariance terms
defined between the instance-dependent noise rates and the Bayes optimal label.
We show that this set of second-order statistics successfully captures the
induced imbalances. We further proceed to show that with the help of the
estimated second-order statistics, we identify a new loss function whose
expected risk of a classifier under instance-dependent label noise is
equivalent to a new problem with only class-dependent label noise. This fact
allows us to apply existing solutions to handle this better-studied setting. We
provide an efficient procedure to estimate these second-order statistics
without accessing either ground truth labels or prior knowledge of the noise
rates. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with synthetic instance-dependent
label noise and Clothing1M with real-world human label noise verify our
approach. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/CAL.

properties for the solution of the MTIP are presented, showing that the
solution path must lie in a sufficient family of 4 candidates. In addition,
necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of each candidate are
established. When the target's velocity is constant, by employing the geometric
properties, those 4 candidates are transformed to a class of sufficiently

efficient and robust algorithm to find all the zeros of sufficiently smooth
real-valued functions is developed. Since the MTIP with a constant target's

sandwiched between a thin film of LaAlO3 and a substrate of SrTiO3. Our
calculations within the framework of density-functional theory + Hubbard U +
spin-orbit coupling reveal a two-dimensional conducting layer with electron and
hole pockets at the interface, exhibiting a strong anisotropic
Rashba-Dresselhaus effect along with noncollinear antiferromagnetism,
indicating the possibility of realizing a spin-orbit torque. An insightful
physical model for the anisotropic Rashba-Dresselhaus effect nicely interprets
our results, providing an estimate for the Rashba-Dresselhaus coefficients and
illustrating pseudospin orientation.We also observe a proximity-induced
prominent Rashba-like effect for Ti 3d empty bands. Our results suggest that
the heterostructure may possess the essential ingredients for antiferromagnetic

a trade-off between maximal unambiguous range and velocity. Several techniques,
like the multiple PRFs (MPRF) method, have been proposed to mitigate this
problem. The drawback of the MPRF method is that the received samples are not
processed jointly, decreasing signal to noise ratio (SNR). To overcome the
drawbacks of MPRF, we employ a random pulse phase coding approach to increase
the unambiguous range region while preserving the unambiguous Doppler region.
Our method encodes each pulse with a random phase, varying from pulse to pulse,
and then processes the received samples jointly to resolve the range ambiguity.
This technique increases the SNR through joint processing without the parameter
matching procedures required in the MPRF method. The recovery algorithm is
designed based on orthogonal matching pursuit so that it can be directly
applied to either Nyquist or sub-Nyquist samples. The unambiguous delay-Doppler
recovery condition is derived with compressed sensing theory in noiseless
settings. In particular, an upper bound to the number of targets is given, with
respect to the number of samples in each pulse repetition interval and the
number of transmit pulses. Simulations show that in both regimes of Nyquist and
sub-Nyquist samples our method outperforms the popular MPRF approach in terms

conceiving its monitoring intention, due to typically non-convex propulsion and
thrust power functions. This paper presents a novel framework to jointly

keeping and altitude changing, which measures the disguising of the monitor.
Based on the practical power models of the UAV propulsion, thrust and hovering,
and the model of the harvested solar power, the problem is non-convex and
intangible for existing solvers. We convexify the propulsion power by variable
substitution, and linearize the solar power. With successive convex
approximation, the resultant problem is then transformed with tightened
constraints and efficiently solved by the proximal difference-of-convex
algorithm with extrapolation in polynomial time. The proposed scheme can be
also applied online. Extensive simulations corroborate the merits of the

freedom of changing the potential shape in a wide range, that allows one to
choose an exactly-solvable model close to characteristics of the

symmetry characteristics of the potential (symmetric or deformed) without
changing the main part of the spectrum; engaging a smart basis of states, that
dramatically decreases the dimensionality of matrices used in the

disease caused by viral infection. The clinical symptoms and transmission
routes of the two diseases are similar. However, there are no relevant studies
on laboratory diagnostic models to discriminate COVID-19 and influenza A. This
study aims at establishing a signature of laboratory findings to tell patients
with COVID-19 apart from those with influenza A perfectly. Materials: In this
study, 56 COVID-19 patients and 54 influenza A patients were included.
Laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were
obtained from electronic medical record databases. Elastic network models,
followed by a stepwise logistic regression model were implemented to identify
indicators capable of discriminating COVID-19 and influenza A. A nomogram is
diagramed to show the resulting discriminative model. Results: The majority of
hematological and biochemical parameters in COVID-19 patients were
significantly different from those in influenza A patients. In the final model,
albumin/globulin (A/G), total bilirubin (TBIL) and erythrocyte specific volume

validated to perform well. Conclusion: A diagnostic model of laboratory
findings was established, in which A/G, TBIL and HCT were included as highly
relevant indicators for the segmentation of COVID-19 and influenza A, providing
a complimentary means for the precise diagnosis of these two diseases.

(i.e., logic operations, addition). However, in order to enable the full
adoption of processing-using-DRAM, it is necessary to provide support for more
complex operations. In this paper, we propose SIMDRAM, a flexible
general-purpose processing-using-DRAM framework that enables massively-parallel
computation of a wide range of operations by using each DRAM column as an
independent SIMD lane to perform bit-serial operations. SIMDRAM consists of
three key steps to enable a desired operation in DRAM: (1) building an
efficient majority-based representation of the desired operation, (2) mapping
the operation input and output operands to DRAM rows and to the required DRAM
commands that produce the desired operation, and (3) executing the operation.
These three steps ensure efficient computation of any arbitrary and complex
operation in DRAM. The first two steps give users the flexibility to
efficiently implement and compute any desired operation in DRAM. The third step
controls the execution flow of the in-DRAM computation, transparently from the
user. We comprehensively evaluate SIMDRAM's reliability, area overhead,
operation throughput, and energy efficiency using a wide range of operations
and seven diverse real-world kernels to demonstrate its generality. Our results
show that SIMDRAM provides up to 5.1x higher operation throughput and 2.5x
higher energy efficiency than a state-of-the-art in-DRAM computing mechanism,
and up to 2.5x speedup for real-world kernels while incurring less than 1% DRAM
chip area overhead. Compared to a CPU and a high-end GPU, SIMDRAM is 257x and
31x more energy-efficient, while providing 93x and 6x higher operation
throughput, respectively.

Surrogate fluid models based on neural networks have the potential to achieve

  In this work, we present significant extensions to a recently proposed deep

Furthermore, we condition the neural fluid model on additional information

  Our method allows to train fluid models without requiring fluid simulation

a fluid state and boundary conditions at a moment t to a subsequent fluid state
at t+dt. We obtain real-time fluid simulations on a 128x64x64 grid that include
various fluid phenomena such as the Magnus effect or Karman vortex streets and
generalize to domain geometries not considered during training. Our method

impressive progress in recent years. However, in many cases, obtaining the

research hotspot. Few researches about NR-PCQA are carried out due to the lack
of a large-scale PCQA dataset. In this paper, we first build a large-scale PCQA
dataset named LS-PCQA, which includes 104 reference point clouds and more than
22,000 distorted samples. In the dataset, each reference point cloud is
augmented with 31 types of impairments (e.g., Gaussian noise, contrast
distortion, local missing, and compression loss) at 7 distortion levels.
Besides, each distorted point cloud is assigned with a pseudo quality score as
its substitute of Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Inspired by the hierarchical
perception system and considering the intrinsic attributes of point clouds, we
propose a NR metric ResSCNN based on sparse convolutional neural network (CNN)
to accurately estimate the subjective quality of point clouds. We conduct
several experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed NR metric. The
results demonstrate that ResSCNN exhibits the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance among all the existing NR-PCQA metrics and even outperforms some FR

low-resource target language data cannot well train an ASR model. To solve this
issue, meta-learning formulates ASR for each source language into many small
ASR tasks and meta-learns a model initialization on all tasks from different
source languages to access fast adaptation on unseen target languages. However,
for different source languages, the quantity and difficulty vary greatly
because of their different data scales and diverse phonological systems, which
leads to task-quantity and task-difficulty imbalance issues and thus a failure
of multilingual meta-learning ASR (MML-ASR). In this work, we solve this
problem by developing a novel adversarial meta sampling (AMS) approach to
improve MML-ASR. When sampling tasks in MML-ASR, AMS adaptively determines the
task sampling probability for each source language. Specifically, for each
source language, if the query loss is large, it means that its tasks are not
well sampled to train ASR model in terms of its quantity and difficulty and
thus should be sampled more frequently for extra learning. Inspired by this
fact, we feed the historical task query loss of all source language domain into
a network to learn a task sampling policy for adversarially increasing the
current query loss of MML-ASR. Thus, the learnt task sampling policy can master
the learning situation of each language and thus predicts good task sampling
probability for each language for more effective learning. Finally, experiment
results on two multilingual datasets show significant performance improvement
when applying our AMS on MML-ASR, and also demonstrate the applicability of AMS
to other low-resource speech tasks and transfer learning ASR approaches.

proposal to extend the application of QT to reconstruction of complete quantum

diffraction imaging and pump-probe spectroscopy of molecules. This interest was
elevated with the advent of ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction techniques
using electron accelerators and X-ray free electron lasers to add temporal
resolution to the observed nuclear and electron distributions. However, the
great interest in this area has been tempered by the illustration of an
impossibility theorem, known as the dimension problem. Not being able to
associate unitary evolution to every DOF of molecular motion, quantum
tomography could not be used beyond 1D and categorically excludes most

find that: a) emission line brightness from K shell transitions, corresponding
to near neutral species, directly correlates with continuum illumination.
However, these lines do not greatly diminish during eclipse. This is readily
explained if fluorescence K$\alpha$ emission comes from the bulk of the wind.
b) The highly ionised Fexxv and Fexxvi Ly$\alpha$ diminish during eclipse.
Thus, they must be produced in the vicinity of the compact object where $\log
\xi >3$. c) to describe the emission line spectrum, the sum of two self
consistent photo ionisation models with low ionisation ($\log \xi\sim -1$) and
high ionisation ($\log \xi\sim 2.4$) is required. From their emission measures,
the clump-to-interclump density ratio can be estimated to be $n_c/n_i\sim 300$.

explaining decisions made by artificial intelligence systems is becoming a more
and more important topic. Especially for image classification tasks, many
state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting
of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation
systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image
in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By
doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a
completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for
generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are
still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often
consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual
images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes.
In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such
counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image
translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our
approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen
medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better
results regarding mental models, explanation satisfaction, trust, emotions, and
self-efficacy than two state-of-the-art systems that work with saliency maps,
namely LIME and LRP.

structures of model parameters that are uniquely determined by observed
time-series data and unidentifiable state-space models, explicitly and
exhaustively. State-space models are often constructed based on the domain, for
example, physical or biological. Such models include parameters that are
assigned specific meanings in relation to the system under consideration, which
is examined by estimating the parameters using the corresponding data. As the
parameters of unidentifiable models cannot be uniquely determined from the
given data, it is difficult to examine the systems described by such models. To
overcome this difficulty, multiple possible sets of parameters are estimated
and analysed in the exiting approaches; however, in general, all the possible
parameters cannot be explored; therefore, considerations on the system using
the estimated parameters become insufficient. In this study, focusing on
certain structures determined by the observed data and models uniquely, even if
they are unidentifiable, we introduce the concept of parameter variety. This is
newly defined and proven to form algebraic varieties, in general. A
computational algebraic method that relies on the Groebner basis for deriving
the explicit representation of the varieties is presented along with the
supporting theory. Furthermore, its application in the analysis of a model that
describes virus dynamics is presented. With this, new insight on the dynamics
overlooked by the conventional approach are discovered, confirming the
applicability of our idea and the proposed method.

Rev. D",,,,"astro-ph.HE hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark
objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark
objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of
self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as
test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with
three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that
the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger
remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital
motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range
of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and
high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the
orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find
relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency
of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects
during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be
used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the
assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the
GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM
component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM
components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW
instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M_sun. We
emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A
forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits
are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.

  Class-Imbalanced Chest X-rays Dataset","21 pages, 4 figures, 12 Tables, TO BE PUBLISHED",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pneumothorax, a life threatening disease, needs to be diagnosed immediately
and efficiently. The prognosis in this case is not only time consuming but also
prone to human errors. So an automatic way of accurate diagnosis using chest
X-rays is the utmost requirement. To-date, most of the available medical images
datasets have class-imbalance issue. The main theme of this study is to solve
this problem along with proposing an automated way of detecting pneumothorax.
We first compare the existing approaches to tackle the class-imbalance issue
and find that data-level-ensemble (i.e. ensemble of subsets of dataset)
outperforms other approaches. Thus, we propose a novel framework named as VDV
model, which is a complex model-level-ensemble of data-level-ensembles and uses
three convolutional neural networks (CNN) including VGG16, VGG-19 and
DenseNet-121 as fixed feature extractors. In each data-level-ensemble features
extracted from one of the pre-defined CNN are fed to support vector machine
(SVM) classifier, and output from each data-level-ensemble is calculated using
voting method. Once outputs from the three data-level-ensembles with three
different CNN architectures are obtained, then, again, voting method is used to
calculate the final prediction. Our proposed framework is tested on SIIM ACR
Pneumothorax dataset and Random Sample of NIH Chest X-ray dataset (RS-NIH). For
the first dataset, 85.17% Recall with 86.0% Area under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve (AUC) is attained. For the second dataset, 90.9% Recall
with 95.0% AUC is achieved with random split of data while 85.45% recall with
77.06% AUC is obtained with patient-wise split of data. For RS-NIH, the
obtained results are higher as compared to previous results from literature
However, for first dataset, direct comparison cannot be made, since this
dataset has not been used earlier for Pneumothorax classification.

points in the four-dimensional Pl\""ucker space of lines in $R^3$, in an
irreducible variety $T$ of constant degree which is \emph{non-degenerate} with
respect to $L$ (see below). We show:
  \medskip \noindent{\bf (1)} If $T$ is two-dimensional, the number of $r$-rich
points (points incident to at least $r$ lines of $L$) is
$O(n^{4/3+\epsilon}/r^2)$, for $r \ge 3$ and for any $\epsilon>0$, and, if at
most $n^{1/3}$ lines of $L$ lie on any common regulus, there are at most
$O(n^{4/3+\epsilon})$ $2$-rich points. For $r$ larger than some sufficiently
large constant, the number of $r$-rich points is also $O(n/r)$.
  As an application, we deduce (with an $\epsilon$-loss in the exponent) the
bound obtained by Pach and de Zeeuw (2107) on the number of distinct distances
determined by $n$ points on an irreducible algebraic curve of constant degree
in the plane that is not a line nor a circle.

number of incidences between $L$ and a set of $m$ points in $R^3$ is
$O\left(m^{3/5}n^{3/5} + (m^{11/15}n^{2/5} + m^{1/3}n^{2/3})s^{1/3} + m + n
\right)$, provided that no plane contains more than $s$ of the points. When $s
= O(\min\{n^{3/5}/m^{2/5}, m^{1/2}\})$, the bound becomes
$O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$.
  As an application, we prove that the number of incidences between $m$ points
and $n$ lines in $R^4$ contained in a quadratic hypersurface (which does not
contain a hyperplane) is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5} + m + n)$.
  The proofs use, in addition to various tools from algebraic geometry, recent
bounds on the number of incidences between points and algebraic curves in the
plane.

team have the possibility of scoring points throughout the match. While the
overall match winner and result is interesting, it conveys little information
about the underlying scoring trends throughout the match. Modeling approaches
that accommodate a finer granularity of the score difference throughout the
match is needed to evaluate in-game strategies, discuss scoring streaks, teams
strengths, and other aspects of the game.
  We propose a latent Gaussian process to model the score difference between
two teams and introduce the Trend Direction Index as an easily interpretable
probabilistic measure of the current trend in the match as well as a measure of
post-game trend evaluation. In addition we propose the Excitement Trend Index -
the expected number of monotonicity changes in the running score difference -
as a measure of overall game excitement.
  Our proposed methodology is applied to all 1143 matches from the 2019-2020

interpreted in individual games and how the excitement score can be used to
cluster teams according to how exciting they are to watch.

  Particles",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it has been discovered that systems of Active Brownian particles
(APB) at high density organise their velocities into coherent domains showing
large spatial structures in the velocity field. Such a collective behavior
occurs spontaneously, i.e. is not caused by any specific interparticle force
favoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in
the absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces
could be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations
and theoretical analysis that the velocity alignment is a robust property of
ABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal
fluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the
P\'eclet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled
particles, is not sufficient to fully characterize such a phenomenon neither in
the regimes of large viscosity nor small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity
domains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity
correlation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases while decreases
as the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that the spatial velocity
correlation depends on the inertia but, contrary to common belief, are
non-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We
conclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems,
variations of the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as
independent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of
the spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent
and active temperatures.

luminosity of LMC X-1 varies from $7-10\%$ of Eddington luminosity ($L_{Edd}$)
and for LMC X-3 is in the range $7-13\%$ of $L_{Edd}$. We study the long-term
variation of the light curve using MAXI data and find the fractional variance

temporal properties of both sources and obtain fractional rms variability of
PDS in the frequency range $0.002-10$ Hz to be $\sim9\%-17\%$ for LMC X-1, and
$\sim7\%-11\%$ for LMC X-3. The `spectro-temporal' properties indicate both
sources are in thermally dominated soft state. By modelling the spectra with
relativistic accretion disc model, we determine the mass of LMC X-1 and LMC X-3
in the range $7.64-10.00$ $M_{\odot}$ and $5.35-6.22$ $M_{\odot}$ respectively.

charged Ca$^{2+}$ defects and $e$-$e$ interactions control the emergence of
defect states inside the Mott gap. The quadrupolar components of the Coulomb
fields of doped holes induce anisotropic orbital rotations of degenerate
orbitals. These rotations modify the spin-orbital polaron clouds and compete
with orbital rotations induced by defects. Both mechanisms lead to a mixing of
orbitals, and cause the suppression of the asymmetry of kinetic energy in the
$C$-type magnetic phase. We find that the gradual decline of orbital order with
doping, a characteristic feature of the vanadates, however, has its origin not
predominantly in the charge carriers, but in the off-diagonal couplings of

  Categories","6 pages, submitted to IEEE ICC'21 - MWN Symposium",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is one of the promising
technology contributing to the next generation smart radio environment. The
application scenarios include massive connectivity support, signal enhancement,
and security protection. One crucial difficulty of analyzing the RIS-assisted
networks is that the channel performance is sensitive to the change of user
receiving direction. This paper tackles the problem by categorizing the RIS
illuminated space into four categories: perfect alignment, coherent alignment,
random alignment, and destructive alignment. These four categories cover all
the possible phase alignment conditions that a user could experience within the
overall $2$ pi solid angle of RIS-illuminated space. We perform analysis for
each of these categories, deriving analytical expressions for the outage
probability and diversity order. Simulation results are presented to confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed analytical results.

self-absorption is observed in this filament, causing the $^{13}$CO morphology
to be different from the filamentary structure traced by C$^{18}$O and
C$^{17}$O. Our excitation analysis suggests that the opacities of C$^{18}$O
transitions become higher than unity in most regions, and this analysis
confirms the presence of widespread CO depletion. Further we show that the
local velocity gradients have a tendency to be perpendicular to the filament's
long axis in the outskirts and parallel to the large-scale magnetic field
direction. The magnitudes of the local velocity gradients decrease toward the
filament's crest. The observed velocity structure can be a result of
gravity-driven accretion flows. The isochronic evolutionary track of the
C$^{18}$O freeze-out process indicates the filament is young with an age of
$\lesssim$2 Myr. We propose that the Serpens filament is a newly-formed
slightly-supercritical structure which appears to be actively accreting
material from its ambient gas.

structural differences to the associative Clifford analysis setting. The
non-associativity requires special attention in the definition of an
appropriate inner product and hence in the definition of a generalized Szeg\""o
projection. Whenever we want to apply classical theorems from reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces we first need to switch to the consideration of
real-valued inner products where the Riesz representation theorem holds. Then
we introduce a generalization of the dual Cauchy transform for octonionic
monogenic functions which represents the adjoint transform with respect to the
real-valued inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_0$ together with an
associated octonionic Kerzman-Stein operator and related kernel functions.
  Also in the octonionic setting, the Kerzman-Stein operator that we introduce
turns out to be a compact operator. A motivation behind this approach is to
find an approximative method to compute the Szeg\""o projection of octonionic
monogenic functions offering a possibility to tackle BVP in the octonions
without the explicit knowledge of the octonionic Szeg\""o kernel which is
extremely difficult to determine in general. We also discuss the particular
cases of the octonionic unit ball and the half-space. Finally, we relate our
octonionic Kerzman-Stein operator to the Hilbert transform and particularly to
the Hilbert-Riesz transform in the half-space case.

Since the discovery of near-surface haze layer during the Voyager fly in 1989,
the haze formation mechanism has not been investigated in detail. Here, we
provide the first haze microphysical model on Triton. Our model solves the
evolution of both size and porosity distributions of haze particles in a
self-consistent manner. We simulated the formation of sphere and aggregate
hazes with and without condensation of the C$_2$H$_4$ ice. The haze particles
can grow into fractal aggregates with mass-equivalent sphere sizes of
$\sim0.1$--$1~{\rm {\mu}m}$ and fractal dimension of $D_{\rm f} = 1.8$--$2.2$.
The ice-free hazes cannot simultaneously explain both UV and visible
observations of Voyager 2, while including the condensation of C$_2$H$_4$ ices
provides two better solutions. For ice aggregates, the required total haze mass
flux is $\sim2\times{10}^{-15}~{\rm g~{cm}^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. For the icy sphere
scenario, the column integrated C$_2$H$_4$ production rate is
$\sim8\times{10}^{-15}~{\rm g~{cm}^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, and the ice-free mass flux of
$\sim6\times{10}^{-17}~{\rm g~{cm}^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. The UV occultation
observations at short wavelength $<0.15~{\rm {\mu}m}$ may slightly favor the
icy aggregates. Observations of the haze optical depth and the degree of
forward scattering in UV and visible should be able to distinguish whether
Triton's hazes are icy spheres or ice aggregates in future Triton missions.

insufficient interpretability of neural network models. We have tackled this
issue by developing interpretable DL models in the context of online detection
of epileptic seizure, based on EEG signal. This has conditioned the preparation
of the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the
output in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the
discussion on three main aspects: 1) how to aggregate the classification
results on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale,
at the seizure-level; 2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in
the first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the
delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual
interpretation of EEG is based; and 3) the identification of the signal
waveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the
activation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method. Results show that
the kernel size in the first layer determines the interpretability of the
extracted features and the sensitivity of the trained models, even though the
final performance is very similar after post-processing. Also, we found that
amplitude is the main feature leading to an ictal prediction, suggesting that a
larger patient population would be required to learn more complex frequency
patterns. Still, our methodology was successfully able to generalize patient
inter-variability for the majority of the studied population with a
classification F1-score of 0.873 and detecting 90% of the seizures.

6D pose estimation from RGB-D data based on spatial structure characteristics
of 3D keypoints. We adopt point-wise dense feature embedding to vote for 3D
keypoints, which makes full use of the structure information of the rigid body.
After the direction vectors pointing to the keypoints are predicted by CNN, we
use RANSAC voting to calculate the coordinate of the 3D keypoints, then the
pose transformation can be easily obtained by the least square method. In
addition, a spatial dimension sampling strategy for points is employed, which
makes the method achieve excellent performance on small training sets. The
proposed method is verified on two benchmark datasets, LINEMOD and OCCLUSION
LINEMOD. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, achieves ADD(-S) accuracy of 98.7\% on LINEMOD
dataset and 52.6\% on OCCLUSION LINEMOD dataset in real-time.

an intriguing topic of research. An prominent example is the pressure-induced
uncollapsed to collapsed tetragonal phase transition observed in
CaFe$_2$As$_2$, which is accompanied with the emergence of superconductivity in
the collapsed phase. Recently, a very similar structural phase transition was
discovered in LaFe$_2$As$_2$, but in contrast to CaFe$_2$As$_2$,
superconductivity was only observed in the uncollapsed phase, not the collapsed
phase. Previous studies have attributed this puzzling observation to the
differences in the two materials' band coherence, orbital occupation, and Fermi
surface topology. Here, we present a comparative study of LaFe$_2$As$_2$ and
CaFe$_2$As$_2$ using the DFT+DMFT method. Surprisingly, we find that although
La appears to have a valence higher than Ca, the doped one electron actually
primarily resides on the La site. This leads to almost the same total Fe-$3d$
occupancy and electronic correlation strength as well as similar Lifshiftz
transition in the Fermi surface topology for the two materials. In addition, we
show that the two materials in both structural phases belong to the category of
Hund's metals. Our results indicate that the electronic structures of
LaFe$_2$As$_2$ and CaFe$_2$As$_2$ are not too different, which further suggest
that superconductivity might also be induced in the collapsed phase of
LaFe$_2$As$_2$ under similar non-hydrostatic conditions as for CaFe$_2$As$_2$.

from Mt. Abu Infrared Observatory and Fairborn Observatory; archival
observations from the WASP project were also included. Furthermore, the
continuous, high quality light curve from the TESS project was extensively used

of 23 frequencies with four independent modes, 13 harmonics of the main
pulsation frequency of 8.296943$\pm$0.000002 d$^{-1}$ and their combinations.

revised by optimizations of stellar pulsation models with the observed

topological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi

topological textures are developed. The minimal mathematical background in
topology (essentially on homotopy groups and fiber bundles) is provided when
needed. Topics rarely reviewed include: periodic versus canonical Bloch

This usually consumes a large number of resources to train the LSTM model.
Also, LSTM models suffer from computational inefficiency in the inference
phase. Existing model compression methods (e.g., model pruning) can only
discriminate based on the magnitude of model parameters, ignoring the issue of
importance distribution based on the model information. Here we introduce the
MPO decomposition, which describes the local correlation of quantum states in
quantum many-body physics and is used to represent the large model parameter
matrix in a neural network, which can compress the neural network by truncating
the unimportant information in the weight matrix. In this paper, we propose a
matrix product operator(MPO) based neural network architecture to replace the
LSTM model. The effective representation of neural networks by MPO can
effectively reduce the computational consumption of training LSTM models on the
one hand, and speed up the computation in the inference phase of the model on
the other hand. We compare the MPO-LSTM model-based compression model with the
traditional LSTM model with pruning methods on sequence classification,
sequence prediction, and speech enhancement tasks in our experiments. The
experimental results show that our proposed neural network architecture based

Amplified spontaneous emission could potentially boost the intensity of beacons

an electronic transition that is optically-thick to stimulated emission.
Potential excitation mechanisms include continuous wave pumping, pulsed

underexplored in the literature, as well as its effectiveness in combination

VRFB to control the power output of the PV installation, maintaining the ramp
rate within a non-violation limit and within a battery state of charge (SOC)
range, appropriate to perform the ramp rate management. Based on the model

The $\gamma$-ray strength functions (GSFs) extracted from primary

method and with the Shape method demonstrate excellent agreement with those
deduced from forward-angle inelastic proton scattering at relativistic beam

has recently been the focus of significant research interest. The current
methods for the link prediction taskhavetwonaturalproblems:1)the relation
distributions in KGs are usually unbalanced, and 2) there are many unseen
relations that occur in practical situations. These two problems limit the
training effectiveness and practical applications of the existing link
prediction models. We advocate a holistic understanding of KGs and we propose
in this work a unified Generalized Relation Learning framework GRL to address
the above two problems, which can be plugged into existing link prediction
models. GRL conducts a generalized relation learning, which is aware of
semantic correlations between relations that serve as a bridge to connect
semantically similar relations. After training with GRL, the closeness of
semantically similar relations in vector space and the discrimination of
dissimilar relations are improved. We perform comprehensive experiments on six
benchmarks to demonstrate the superior capability of GRL in the link prediction
task. In particular, GRL is found to enhance the existing link prediction
models making them insensitive to unbalanced relation distributions and capable
of learning unseen relations.

many point vortical defects, we are able to cast the viscous dynamics of the

situation, the flows generate additional defects of positive index. For the
simpler situation of two vortices, we analytically predict the location of
these stagnation points. At the low curvature limit, the dynamics resemble that

curvatures. The geometric formulation allows us to construct the
spatio-temporal evolution of streamline topology of the flows resulting from

global rotation to the many-vortex system, with the individual vortices still

uncertainties in the MN rates. Numerical experiments in a large grid of 1D
model atmospheres, and a smaller set of 3D models, indicate that neglect of MN

relevant MN rates as constrained by experiments correspond to uncertainties in

maximization in a discrete time dynamic setup. Using robust representations of
CAIs in terms of a family of dynamic coherent risk measures (DCRMs), we
establish an intriguing dichotomy: if the corresponding family of DCRMs is
recursive (i.e. strongly time consistent) and assuming some recursive structure
of the market model, then the acceptability maximization problem reduces to
just a one period problem and the maximal acceptability is constant across all
states and times. On the other hand, if the family of DCRMs is not recursive,
which is often the case, then the acceptability maximization problem ordinarily

mean-variance criteria. To overcome this form of time-inconsistency, we adapt

high-quality dynamic multi-coil MR reconstruction by learning a complementary
time-frequency domain network that exploits spatio-temporal correlations
simultaneously from complementary domains.
  Theory and Methods: Dynamic parallel MR image reconstruction is formulated as
a multi-variable minimisation problem, where the data is regularised in
combined temporal Fourier and spatial (x-f) domain as well as in
spatio-temporal image (x-t) domain. An iterative algorithm based on variable
splitting technique is derived, which alternates among signal de-aliasing steps
in x-f and x-t spaces, a closed-form point-wise data consistency step and a
weighted coupling step. The iterative model is embedded into a deep recurrent
neural network which learns to recover the image via exploiting spatio-temporal
redundancies in complementary domains.
  Results: Experiments were performed on two datasets of highly undersampled
multi-coil short-axis cardiac cine MRI scans. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed model can also generalise well
to data acquired from a different scanner and data with pathologies that were
not seen in the training set.
  Conclusion: The work shows the benefit of reconstructing dynamic parallel MRI
in complementary time-frequency domains with deep neural networks. The method
can effectively and robustly reconstruct high-quality images from highly
undersampled dynamic multi-coil data ($16 \times$ and $24 \times$ yielding 15s
and 10s scan times respectively) with fast reconstruction speed (2.8s). This
could potentially facilitate achieving fast single-breath-hold clinical 2D
cardiac cine imaging.

We present an isogeometric Kirchhoff-Love shell framework that treats every

single trimmed B-spline surface provides a sufficiently smooth geometry, and
the non-symmetric Nitsche method enforces the boundary conditions. A
higher-order accurate reparametrization of cut knot spans in the parameter

function evaluations. Algorithms that achieve the optimal number of function
evaluations for a given precision level typically rely on explicitly
constructing an approximation of the function which is then minimized with
algorithms that have exponential running-time complexity. In this paper, we
consider an approach that jointly models the function to approximate and finds
a global minimum. This is done by using infinite sums of square smooth
functions and has strong links with polynomial sum-of-squares hierarchies.
Leveraging recent representation properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces, the infinite-dimensional optimization problem can be solved by
subsampling in time polynomial in the number of function evaluations, and with
theoretical guarantees on the obtained minimum.
  Given $n$ samples, the computational cost is $O(n^{3.5})$ in time, $O(n^2)$
in space, and we achieve a convergence rate to the global optimum that is
$O(n^{-m/d + 1/2 + 3/d})$ where $m$ is the degree of differentiability of the
function and $d$ the number of dimensions. The rate is nearly optimal in the
case of Sobolev functions and more generally makes the proposed method
particularly suitable for functions that have a large number of derivatives.
Indeed, when $m$ is in the order of $d$, the convergence rate to the global
optimum does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which affects only
the worst-case constants (that we track explicitly through the paper).

alleviates the needs of a large number of dialogues. More importantly, by
dynamically evolving disease-symptom graphs, GEML also well addresses the
real-world challenges that the disease-symptom correlations of each disease may
vary or evolve along with more diagnostic cases. Extensive experiment results

to infer the properties of the magnetic field of the source and its
environment. However at low frequencies, Faraday rotation substantially
depolarizes the emission, meaning that comparatively few polarized radio
galaxies are known at low frequencies. Using the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey at
150 MHz and at 20 arcsec resolution, we select 342 radio galaxies brighter than
50 mJy and larger than 100 arcsec in angular size, of which 67 are polarized
(18 per cent detection fraction). These are predominantly Fanaroff Riley type
II (FR-II) sources. The detection fraction increases with total flux density,
and exceeds 50 per cent for sources brighter than 1 Jy. We compare the sources
in our sample detected by LOFAR to those also detected in NVSS at 1400 MHz, and
find that our selection bias toward bright radio galaxies drives a tendency for
sources depolarized between 1400 and 150 MHz to have flatter spectra over that
frequency range than those that remain polarized at 150 MHz. By comparing
observed rotation measures with an analytic model we find that we are
preferentially sensitive to sources in low mass environments. We also infer
that sources with one polarized hotspot are inclined by a small angle to the
line of sight, while sources with hotspots in both lobes lie in the plane of
the sky. We conclude that low frequency polarization in radio galaxies is
related to a combination of environment, flux density and jet orientation.

freedom of quantum systems have drawn attention due to their properties of
working as quantum batteries. However, one can identify a number of problems
that need to be adequately solved before a real manufacturing process of these
devices. In particular, it is important paying attention to the ability of
quantum batteries in storing energy when no consumption center is connected to
them. In this paper, by considering quantum batteries disconnected from
external charging fields and consumption center, we study the decoherence
effects that lead to charge leakage to the surrounding environment. We identify
this phenomena as a self-discharging of QBs, in analogy to the inherent decay
of the stored charge of conventional classical batteries in a open-circuit
configuration. The quantum advantage concerning the classical counterpart is
highlighted for single- and multi-cell quantum batteries.

performed. Three types of bond rearrangement reactions are found by MD
simulations at 3000 K in odd fullerenes which contain an extra sp atom among
all other sp$^2$ atoms. The first type is sto-chastic sp-defect migration
analogous to exchange mechanism of adatom migration on a surface. The second
type cor-responds to changes in the ring configuration of the sp$^2$-structure
assisted by the sp atom which can lead to annealing of seven-membered rings or
separation of five-membered rings. The third type is formation of short-living
one-coordinated atoms or two additional sp atoms. Annihilation of a pair of sp
defects has been also observed in the MD simulations. It is shown that the
frequency of sp-defect migration at a lower temperature, as estimated from
performed density functional theory calculations of the barriers of sp-defect
migration events, is sufficient to deliver the sp atom to defects of sp$^2$

propose to supplement the self-organization paradigm of fullerene formation by
the following four-stage atomistic mechanism of formation of abundant isomers

comprises an alternation between a learner and a verifier to find a valid
Lyapunov function inside a convex set of Lyapunov function candidates. In each
iteration, the learner uses a collection of state samples to select a Lyapunov
function candidate through a convex program in the parameter space. The
verifier then solves a mixed-integer quadratic program in the state space to
either validate the proposed Lyapunov function candidate or reject it with a
counterexample, i.e., a state where the Lyapunov condition fails. This
counterexample is then added to the sample set of the learner to refine the set
of Lyapunov function candidates. By designing the learner and the verifier
according to the analytic center cutting-plane method from convex optimization,
we show that when the set of Lyapunov functions is full-dimensional in the
parameter space, our method finds a Lyapunov function in a finite number of
steps. We demonstrate our stability analysis method on closed-loop MPC
dynamical systems and a ReLU neural network controlled PWA system.

Specifically, we use the resistive GLM-MHD equations, which include a
divergence cleaning mechanism that is based on a generalized Lagrange
multiplier (GLM). For the continuous entropy analysis to hold, and due to the
divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, the GLM-MHD system requires
the use of non-conservative terms, which need special treatment.
  Hennemann et al. [DOI:10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109935] recently presented an
entropy stable shock-capturing strategy for DGSEM discretizations of the Euler
equations that blends the DGSEM scheme with a subcell first-order finite volume
(FV) method. Our first contribution is the extension of the method of Hennemann
et al. to systems with non-conservative terms, such as the GLM-MHD equations.
In our approach, the advective and non-conservative terms of the equations are
discretized with a hybrid FV/DGSEM scheme, whereas the visco-resistive terms
are discretized only with the high-order DGSEM method. We prove that the
extended method is entropy stable on three-dimensional unstructured curvilinear
meshes. Our second contribution is the derivation and analysis of a second
entropy stable shock-capturing method that provides enhanced resolution by
using a subcell reconstruction procedure that is carefully built to ensure
entropy stability.
  We provide a numerical verification of the properties of the hybrid FV/DGSEM
schemes on curvilinear meshes and show their robustness and accuracy with
common benchmark cases, such as the Orszag-Tang vortex and the GEM reconnection
challenge. Finally, we simulate a space physics application: the interaction of

contractible sets. But it is not a trivial task to compute |H^0|. The way to do
it is to consider the intersection lattice of the hyperplanes and compute its
M\""obius function. The result is that the number of components is the sum of
the absolut values of the M\""obius function (Zaslavsky 1975).

induce a second-order topological insulator from a topologically trivial phase

analysis of a representative sample of nearby spiral and early-type galaxies

The method and corrections for projection and dust effects previously obtained
are used to derive intrinsic photometric and structural bulge parameters. We
show the main bulge scaling relations and the black hole relations, both
observed and intrinsic ones, in B band. We find dust and inclination effects to
produce more important changes in the parameters of the Kormendy relation for
spiral galaxies, with the respective bulges of late-type galaxies residing on a
steeper slope relation that the early-type galaxies. We observe that the
Kormendy relation in combination with a bulge S\'{e}rsic index ($n_{b}$)
threshold, does not produce a conclusive morphological separation of bulges.
The $n_{b}$- bulge-to-total flux ratio ($B/T$) and $B/T$-stellar mass could be
used to discriminate between late-type and early-type galaxies, while a further
use of these parameters to divide bulges with different morphologies is
problematic due to overlaps in the two distributions or large spread in values.
We confirm the existence of two distinct intrinsic relations between the bulge
luminosity (or absolute magnitude) and S\'{e}rsic index for late- and
early-type galaxies, while the relations between the black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$)
and bulge luminosity are not found to be statistically different at p<0.05.
Within errors, we find statistically similar intrinsic $M_{BH}-n_{b}$ relations

rational way the Reynolds equations, namely to express the tensor of turbulent
stress as a function of the time average of the velocity field. Based on the
idea that dissipation in fully developed turbulence is by singular events
resulting from an evolution described by the Euler equations, it has been
recently observed that the closure problem is strongly restricted, and that it
implies that the turbulent stress is a non local function in space of the
average velocity field, a kind of extension of classical Boussinesq theory of
turbulent viscosity. This leads to rather complex nonlinear integral
equation(s) for the time averaged velocity field. This one satisfies some
symmetries of the Euler equations. Such symmetries were used by Prandtl and
Landau to make various predictions about the shape of the turbulent domain in
simple geometries. We explore specifically the case of mixing layer for which
the average velocity field only depends on the angle in the wedge behind the
splitter plate. This solution yields a pressure difference between the two
sides of the splitter which contributes to the lift felt by the plate.
Moreover, because of the structure of the equations for the turbulent stress,
one can satisfy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, also called the realizability
conditions, for this turbulent stress. Such realizability conditions cannot be
satisfied with a simple turbulent viscosity.

formalize strategies of attacker and defender in the context of information

of our games is that their utility is given by information leakage, which in
some cases may behave in a non-linear way. This causes a significant deviation
from classic game theory, in which utility functions are linear with respect to
players' strategies. Hence, a key contribution of this paper is the
establishment of the foundations of information leakage games. We consider two
kinds of games, depending on the notion of leakage considered. The first kind,
the QIF-games, is tailored for the theory of quantitative information flow
(QIF). The second one, the DP-games, corresponds to differential privacy (DP).

we have performed a set of direct numerical simulations of Boussinesq
convection in a rotating full sphere. The domain is internally heated with
fixed temperature and stress-free boundary conditions, but fixed heat flux and
no-slip boundary conditions are also briefly considered. We particularly focus
on the large-scale coherent structures and the mean zonal flows that can
develop in the system. At Prandtl number of unity, as the thermal forcing
(measured by the Rayleigh number) is increased above the value for the onset of
convection, we find a relaxation oscillation regime, followed by a geostrophic
turbulence regime. Beyond this we see for the first time the existence of
large-scale coherent vortices that form on the rotation axis. All regime
boundaries are well described by critical values of the convective Rossby
number $Ro_c$, with transitions from oscillatory to geostrophic turbulence, and
then to the large-scale vortex regime at values $Ro_c\approx 0.2$ and
$Ro_c\approx 1.5$, respectively. The zonal flow is controlled by the convective
Rossby number and changes its direction when the flow transitions from the
geostrophic turbulence regime to the large-scale vortex regime. While the
non-zonal flow speed and heat transfer can be described by the so-called
inertial scaling in the geostrophic turbulence regime, the formation of
large-scale vortices appears to reduce both the non-zonal flow speed and the
efficiency of convective heat transfer.

with single-agent reinforcement learning problems (SARL). The key idea of DQV
algorithms is to jointly learn an approximation of the state-value function
$V$, alongside an approximation of the state-action value function $Q$. We
follow this principle and generalise these algorithms by introducing two fully
decentralised MARL algorithms (IQV and IQV-Max) and two algorithms that are
based on the centralised training with decentralised execution training
paradigm (QVMix and QVMix-Max). We compare our algorithms with state-of-the-art

even outperform them on some of the tested environments, being the algorithm
which performs best overall. We hypothesise that this is due to the fact that

and terahertz (THz) requires channel estimation for very large bandwidths at
low SNR. Hence, allocating an orthogonal pilot tone for each coherence
bandwidth leads to excessive number of pilots. We leverage generative
adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately estimate frequency selective channels
with few pilots at low SNR. The proposed estimator first learns to produce
channel samples from the true but unknown channel distribution via training the
generative network, and then uses this trained network as a prior to estimate
the current channel by optimizing the network's input vector in light of the
current received signal. Our results show that at an SNR of -5 dB, even if a
transceiver with one-bit phase shifters is employed, our design achieves the
same channel estimation error as an LS estimator with SNR = 20 dB or the LMMSE
estimator at 2.5 dB, both with fully digital architectures. Additionally, the
GAN-based estimator reduces the required number of pilots by about 70% without
significantly increasing the estimation error and required SNR. We also show
that the generative network does not appear to require retraining even if the
number of clusters and rays change considerably.

New modular-type transformations when $a$ is a non-zero even integer are

explicitly seen in these transformations. These include a novel companion to
Ramanujan's famous formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$. The Wigert-Bellman identity

an odd integer, the well-known modular transformations of the Eisenstein series

Vorono\""{\dotlessi} summation formula and an integral evaluation of
N.~S.~Koshliakov involving a generalization of the modified Bessel function
$K_{\nu}(z)$. Koshliakov's integral evaluation is proved for the first time. It

the reflection fraction also undergo an evolution, exactly coincident to the
period when the inferred spin transition takes place. The unphysical evolution
of the spin is attributed to the evolution of the inner disc, which is caused
by the collapse of a hot corona due to condensation mechanism or may be related
to the deceleration of a jet-like corona. The studies of the inner disc radius
and the relation between the disc luminosity and the inner disc radius suggest
that, only at a particular epoch, did the inner edge of the disc reach the
innermost stable circular orbit and the spin measurement is reliable. We then
constrain the spin of MAXI J1820+070 to be a*=0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}. Such a slowly

  using free electrons","5 figs, 20 pages + Supplementary Material",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the birth of quantum optics, the measurement of quantum states of
nonclassical light has been of tremendous importance for advancement in the
field. To date, conventional detectors such as photomultipliers, avalanche
photodiodes, and superconducting nanowires, all rely at their core on linear
excitation of bound electrons with light, posing fundamental restrictions on
the detection. In contrast, the interaction of free electrons with light in the
context of quantum optics is highly nonlinear and offers exciting
possibilities. The first experiments that promoted this direction appeared over
the past decade as part of photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy
(PINEM), wherein free electrons are capable of high-order multi-photon
absorption and emission. Here we propose using free electrons for
quantum-optical detection of the complete quantum state of light. We show how
the precise control of the electron before and after its interaction with
quantum light enables to extract the photon statistics and implement full
quantum state tomography using PINEM. This technique can reach sub-attosecond
time resolutions, measure temporal coherence of any degree (e.g., g(1), g(2)),
and simultaneously detect large numbers of photons with each electron.
Importantly, the interaction of the electron with light is non-destructive,
thereby leaving the photonic state (modified by the interaction) intact, which
is conceptually different from conventional detectors. By using a pulse of
multiple electrons, we envision how PINEM quantum detectors could achieve a
single-shot measurement of the complete state of quantum light, even for
non-reproducible emission events. Altogether, our work paves the way to novel
kinds of photodetectors that utilize the ultrafast duration, high nonlinearity,
and non-destructive nature of electron-light interactions.

significant adverse effects. To address this issue, data have been combined
from six longitudinal birth cohort studies in the United States that assessed
the effects of PAE on cognitive outcomes measured from early school age through
adolescence. Structural equation models (SEMs) are commonly used to capture the
association among multiple observed outcomes in order to characterise the
underlying variable of interest (in this case, cognition) and then relate it to

on $AdS_5\times S^5$. Combining Mellin space techniques, the large $p$ limit,
and data about the spectrum of two-particle operators at tree level in
supergravity, we design a bootstrap algorithm which heavily constrains its
$\alpha'$ expansion. We use crossing symmetry, polynomiality in the Mellin

away from the ten-dimensional flat space limit. Then we analyse the spectrum of
exchanged two-particle operators at fixed order in the $\alpha'$ expansion. We
impose that the ten-dimensional spin of the spectrum visible at that order is
bounded above in the same way as in the flat space amplitude. This constraint
determines the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in $AdS_5\times S^5$ up to a small
number of ambiguities at each order and we compute it explicitly for
$(\alpha')^{5,6,7,8,9}$. As the order of $\alpha'$ grows, the ten dimensional
spin grows, and the set of visible two-particle operators opens up. Operators
illuminated for the first time receive a string correction to their anomalous

degeneracy of tree level supergravity due to ten-dimensional conformal
symmetry. We encode the lifting of the residual degeneracy in a characteristic

classical general relativity this geometrical interpretation significantly
simplifies calculations and also illuminates the relation between dynamics in
the `integrable' (anti)self-dual sector and in the full theory. For quantum
gravity, it provides a point of departure to complete the Dirac quantization
program for general relativity in a more satisfactory fashion. This gauge
theory perspective may also be helpful in extending the `double copy' ideas
relating the Einstein and Yang-Mills dynamics to a non-perturbative regime.
Finally, the notion of generalized, gauge covariant Lie derivative may also be
of interest to the mathematical physics community as it hints at some
potentially rich structures that have not been explored.

Brownian particles. At each branching event the particle farthest from the
origin is removed, so that the number of particles remains constant at all
times. Berestycki et al. (2020) proved that, at $N\to \infty$, the
coarse-grained spatial density of this particle system lives in a spherically
symmetric domain and is described by the solution of a free boundary problem
for a deterministic reaction-diffusion equation. Further, they showed that, at
long times, this solution approaches a unique spherically symmetric steady
state with compact support: a sphere which radius $\ell_0$ depends on the
spatial dimension $d$. Here we study fluctuations in this system in the limit
of large $N$ due to the stochastic character of the branching Brownian motion,
and we focus on persistent fluctuations of the swarm size. We evaluate the
probability density $\mathcal{P}(\ell,N,T)$ that the maximum distance of a
particle from the origin remains smaller than a specified value $\ell<\ell_0$,
or larger than a specified value $\ell>\ell_0$, on a time interval $0<t<T$,
where $T$ is very large. We argue that $\mathcal{P}(\ell,N,T)$ exhibits the
large-deviation form $-\ln \mathcal{P} \simeq N T R_d(\ell)$. For all $d$ we
obtain asymptotics of the rate function $R_d(\ell)$ in the regimes $\ell \ll
\ell_0$, $\ell\gg \ell_0$ and $|\ell-\ell_0|\ll \ell_0$. For $d=1$ the whole
rate function can be calculated analytically. We obtain these results by
determining the optimal (most probable) density profile of the swarm,
conditioned on the specified $\ell$, and by arguing that this density profile
is spherically symmetric with its center at the origin.

the use of mode-resolved measurement techniques to make the first direct

equipartition takes place among degenerate groups of modes - all in full accord

epidemic. To this end, we exploit a simple SIS-like
(susceptible-infected-susceptible) model with negative feedback between the
infected population size and a collective economic resource associated with the
average amount of money or income per economic agent. The coupling mechanism in
such a system is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate
governed by the Arrhenius-like law. In this case, economic resource formally
plays the role of effective market temperature and the minimum level of
resource consumption is associated with activation energy. Such a coupling can
result in the collapsing effect opposite to thermal explosion, so that the
epidemic could ultimately drive the system to a collapse at nonzero activation
energy because of the limited resource. In this case, the system can no longer
stabilize and return to the stable pre-epidemic state or a poorer post-epidemic
state. We demonstrate that the system's collapse can partially be mitigated by
external subsidies meaning constant resource inflow from some external source
or by means of debt interpreted as a negative resource. We also consider a
simple quarantine scenario and show that it can lead to different socioeconomic
outcomes, depending on initial resource (market temperature) and the minimum
level of resource consumption (activation energy).

elements of the scene is of utmost importance for enabling self driving cars to
drive safely. In this paper, we tackle the problem of drivable road boundary
extraction from LiDAR and camera imagery. Towards this goal, we design a
structured model where a fully convolutional network obtains deep features
encoding the location and direction of road boundaries and then, a
convolutional recurrent network outputs a polyline representation for each one
of them. Importantly, our method is fully automatic and does not require a user
in the loop. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a large North
American city where we obtain perfect topology of road boundaries 99.3% of the
time at a high precision and recall.

  comparative performance analysis",,,,,"math.OC cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digital Annealer (DA) is a computer architecture designed for tackling
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) models. In this paper, we present the results of an
extensive computational study to evaluate the performance of DA in a systematic
way in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art solvers for different problem
classes. We examine pure QUBO models, as well as QUBO reformulations of three
constrained problems, namely quadratic assignment, quadratic cycle partition,
and selective graph coloring, with the last two being new applications for DA.
For the selective graph coloring problem, we also present a size reduction
heuristic that significantly increases the number of eligible instances for DA.
Our experimental results show that despite being in its development stage, DA
can provide high-quality solutions quickly and in that regard rivals the state
of the art, particularly for large instances. Moreover, as opposed to
established solvers, within its limit on the number of decision variables, DA's
solution times are not affected by the increase in instance size. These
findings illustrate that DA has the potential to become a successful technology
in tackling combinatorial optimization problems.

protoplanetary disks. We used ALMA CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of CT Cha

physical properties of their disks with a Bayesian-based radiative transfer
modeling code $pdspy$. We found that the posterior distributions of the masses
from the two transitions are inconsistent at the 2-4 $\sigma$ level. These
systematic errors may originate from assumptions in the disk model, or perhaps
the modest spatial or spectral resolutions used in this study. Regardless, this
indicates that dynamical mass measurements using disk kinematics should be
treated with caution when using only a single transition line because of these
systematic errors.

of near-field diffraction. When integrated over long optical path lengths,
amplitude aberrations (seen as scintillation) can nullify local areas in the
recorded image of a coherent beam, complicating the wavefront reconstruction
process. To estimate phase aberrations experienced by a telescope beam control
system in the presence of strong turbulence, the wavefront sensor (WFS) of an
adaptive optics must be robust to scintillation. We have designed and built a
WFS, which we refer to as a ""Fresnel sensor,"" that uses near-field diffraction
to measure phase errors under moderate to strong turbulent conditions.
Systematic studies of its sensitivity were performed with laboratory
experiments using a point source beacon. The results were then compared to a
Shack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS). When the SHWFS experiences irradiance fade in the
presence of moderate turbulence, the Fresnel WFS continues to routinely extract
phase information. For a scintillation index of $S = 0.55$, we show that the
Fresnel WFS offers a factor of $9\times$ gain in sensitivity over the SHWFS. We
find that the Fresnel WFS is capable of operating with extremely low light
levels, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of only $\mbox{SNR}\approx
2-3$ per pixel. Such a device is well-suited for coherent beam propagation,
laser communications, remote sensing, and applications involving long optical
path-lengths, site-lines along the horizon, and faint signals.

demonstrate sub-millimeter accuracy of the two-way Time of Flight (ToF)-based

localization. Finally, we provide the localization context for a number of

  Fine-Tuning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although pretrained language models can be fine-tuned to produce
state-of-the-art results for a very wide range of language understanding tasks,
the dynamics of this process are not well understood, especially in the low
data regime. Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms
(e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions
of parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples?
In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of
intrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to
explain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained
models have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low
dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full
parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters
randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to
achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we
empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension
and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension
after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their
extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low
dimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to
provide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of
the full parameter count.

define digital me as autonomous, decision-making, and learning agent,
representing an individual and having practically immortal own life. It is
assumed that digital me is equipped with the big-five personality model,
ensuring that it provides a model of some aspects of a strong AI:
consciousness, free will, and intentionality. As computer-based personality
judgments are more accurate than those made by humans, digital me can judge the
personality of the individual represented by the digital me, other individuals'
personalities, and other digital me-s. We describe seven ontological qualities
of digital me: a) double-layer status of Digital Being versus digital me, b)
digital me versus real me, c) mind-digital me and body-digital me, d) digital
me versus doppelganger (shadow digital me), e) non-human time concept, f)
social quality, g) practical immortality. We argue that with the advancement of
AI's sciences and technologies, there exist two digital me thresholds. The
first threshold defines digital me having some (rudimentarily) form of
consciousness, free will, and intentionality. The second threshold assumes that
digital me is equipped with moral learning capabilities, implying that, in
principle, digital me could develop their own ethics which significantly
differs from human's understanding of ethics. Finally we discuss the
implications of digital me metaethics, normative and applied ethics, the
implementation of the Golden Rule in digital me-s, and we suggest two sets of
normative principles for digital me: consequentialist and duty based digital me
principles.

Roofpedia Index, a derivative of the registry, to benchmark the cities by the
extent of sustainable roofscape in term of solar and green roof penetration.
This project, partly inspired by its street greenery counterpart `Treepedia',
is made possible by a multi-step pipeline that combines deep learning and
geospatial techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of an automated
methodology that generalises successfully across cities with an accuracy of
detecting sustainable roofs of up to 100% in some cities. We offer our results
as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers,
local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable
rooftops across cities, track and monitor the current use of rooftops,
complement studies on their potential, evaluate the effectiveness of existing

estimate carbon offset capacities of cities, and ultimately support better
policies and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to
the sustainable development of cities.

Referrals screen candidates and lead to better matches and increased

referrals also lead to immobility: a demographic group's low current employment
rate leads that group to have relatively low future employment as well. We
identify conditions under which distributing referrals more evenly across a
population not only reduces inequality, but also improves future productivity
and economic mobility. We use the model to examine optimal policies, showing
that one-time affirmative action policies involve short-run production losses,

biological, and social disciplines. Such models often assume a particular
network-generating mechanism, which when fit to data produces estimates of
mechanism-specific parameters that describe how systems function. For instance,
a social network model might assume new individuals connect to others with
probability proportional to their number of pre-existing connections
('preferential attachment'), and then estimate the disparity in interactions
between famous and obscure individuals with similar qualifications. However,
without a means of testing the relevance of the assumed mechanism, conclusions
from such models could be misleading. Here we introduce a simple empirical
approach which can mechanistically classify arbitrary network data. Our
approach compares empirical networks to model networks from a user-provided
candidate set of mechanisms, and classifies each network--with high
accuracy--as originating from either one of the mechanisms or none of them. We
tested 373 empirical networks against five of the most widely studied network
mechanisms and found that most (228) were unlike any of these mechanisms. This
raises the possibility that some empirical networks arise from mixtures of
mechanisms. We show that mixtures are often unidentifiable because different
mixtures can produce functionally equivalent networks. In such systems, which
are governed by multiple mechanisms, our approach can still accurately predict
out-of-sample functional properties.

novel approaches have been designed to monitor ongoing processes, i.e., online

execution from a normative process model at the moment they occur. Thereby,
countermeasures can be taken immediately to prevent a process deviation from
causing further, undesired consequences. Most online approaches only allow to
detect approximations of deviations. This causes the problem of falsely
detected deviations, i.e., detected deviations that are actually no deviations.
We have, therefore, recently introduced a novel approach to compute exact
conformance checking results in an online environment. In this paper, we focus
on the practical application and present a scalable, distributed implementation
of the proposed online conformance checking approach. Moreover, we present two
extensions to said approach to reduce its computational effort and its
practical applicability. We evaluate our implementation using data sets
