  talk of G. M. D'Ariano at Oxford Conference: ""Models of Consciousness""",,,,"quant-ph physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We explore definite theoretical assertions about consciousness, starting from
a non-reductive psycho-informational solution of David Chalmers's 'hard
problem', based on the hypothesis that a fundamental property of 'information'
is its experience by the supporting 'system'. The kind of information involved
in consciousness needs to be quantum for multiple reasons, including its
intrinsic privacy and its power of building up thoughts by entangling qualia
states. As a result we reach a quantum-information-based panpsychism, with
classical physics supervening on quantum physics, quantum physics supervening
on quantum information, and quantum information supervening on consciousness.
We then argue that the internally experienced quantum state, since it
corresponds to a definite experience-not to a random choice-must be pure, and
we call it ontic, in contrast with the state predictable from the outside (i.e.
the state describing the knowledge of the experience from the point of view of
an external observer) which we call epistemic and is generally mixed. Purity of
the ontic state requires an evolution that is purity preserving, namely a
so-called 'atomic' quantum operation. The latter is generally probabilistic,
and its particular outcome is interpreted as the free will, which is
unpredictable even in principle since quantum probability cannot be interpreted
as lack of knowledge. The same purity of state and evolution allows solving the
'combination problem' of panpsychism. Quantum state evolution accounts for a
short-term buffer of experience and contains itself quantum-to-classical and
classical-to-quantum information transfers. Long term memory, on the other
hand, is classical, and needs memorization and recall processes that are
quantum-to-classical and classical-to-quantum, respectively...

Thus, all non-trivial zeros up to the $n$th order must be known in order to
generate the $n$th+1 non-trivial zero. All the presented formulas are based on
certain closed-form representations of the secondary zeta function family,
which are already available in the literature. We also present a formula to
generate the non-trivial zeros directly from primes. Thus all primes can be
converted into an individual non-trivial zero, and we also give a set of
formulas to convert all non-trivial zeros into an individual prime. We also
extend the presented results to other Dirichlet-L functions, and in particular,
we develop an analytical recurrence formula for non-trivial zeros of the
Dirichlet beta function. Throughout this article, we also numerically compute
these formulas to high precision for various test cases and review the computed
results.

pandemic and leads to infodemic. Predicting the popularity of online content,
known as cascade prediction, allows for not only catching in advance hot
information that deserves attention, but also identifying false information
that will widely spread and require quick response to mitigate its impact.
Among the various information diffusion patterns leveraged in previous works,
the spillover effect of the information exposed to users on their decision to
participate in diffusing certain information is still not studied. In this
paper, we focus on the diffusion of information related to COVID-19 preventive
measures. Through our collected Twitter dataset, we validated the existence of
this spillover effect. Building on the finding, we proposed extensions to three
cascade prediction methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Experiments
conducted on our dataset demonstrated that the use of the identified spillover
effect significantly improves the state-of-the-art GNNs methods in predicting
the popularity of not only preventive measure messages, but also other COVID-19

on linear functionals and their functions of two semicontinuous populations.
The distribution of each population is usually characterized by a mixture of a
discrete point mass at zero and a continuous skewed positive component, and
hence such distribution is semicontinuous in the nature. To utilize the
information from both populations, we model the positive components of the two
mixture distributions via a semiparametric density ratio model. Under this
model setup, we construct the maximum empirical likelihood estimators of the
linear functionals and their functions, and establish the asymptotic normality
of the proposed estimators. We show the proposed estimators of the linear
functionals are more efficient than the fully nonparametric ones. The developed
asymptotic results enable us to construct confidence regions and perform
hypothesis tests for the linear functionals and their functions. We further
apply these results to several important summary quantities such as the
moments, the mean ratio, the coefficient of variation, and the generalized
entropy class of inequality measures. Simulation studies demonstrate the
advantages of our proposed semiparametric method over some existing methods.
Two real data examples are provided for illustration.

mass function (IMF) becomes increasingly top-heavy (i.e., overabundant in
high-mass stars with mass $m > 1M_{\odot}$) with decreasing metallicity and
increasing gas density of the forming object. This affects the evolution of
globular clusters (GCs) owing to the different mass-loss rates and the number
of black holes formed. Previous numerical modeling of GCs usually assumed an
invariant canonical IMF. Using the state-of-the-art $NBODY6$ code, we perform a
comprehensive series of direct $N$-body simulations to study the evolution of
star clusters, starting with a top-heavy IMF and undergoing early gas
expulsion. Utilizing the embedded cluster mass-radius relation of Marks &
Kroupa (2012) for initializing the models, and by varying the degree of
top-heaviness, we calculate the minimum cluster mass needed for the cluster to
survive longer than 12 Gyr. We document how the evolution of different
characteristics of star clusters such as the total mass, the final size, the
density, the mass-to-light ratio, the population of stellar remnants, and the
survival of GCs is influenced by the degree of top-heaviness. We find that the
lifetimes of clusters with different IMFs moving on the same orbit are
proportional to the relaxation time to a power of $x$ that is in the range of
0.8 to 1. The observed correlation between concentration and the mass function
slope in Galactic GCs can be accounted for excellently in models starting with
a top-heavy IMF and undergoing an early phase of rapid gas expulsion.

patch location is designed and our learning process is in a non-contrastive
way. The weights learned by HSJP pretext task are utilised as backbones of 2D

electron density $n_s$ in the region of low $T$ (1-20 K). As $\theta$
approaches magic angle $\theta_m$, the $S^g$ and $S^d$ are found to be strongly
enhanced, which is manifestation of great suppression of Fermi velocity
${\nu_F}^*$ of electrons in moire flat band near $\theta_m$. This enhancement
decreases with increasing $\theta$ and $T$. In the Bloch- Gruneisen (BG)
regime, it is found that $S^g \sim {\nu_F}^{* -2}$, $T^3$ and ${n_s}^{-1/2}$.
As $T$ increases, the exponent $\delta$ in $S^g \sim T^\delta$, changes from 3
to nearly zero and a maximum $S^g$ value of $\sim$ 10 mV/K at $\sim$ 20 K is
estimated. $S^g$ is larger (smaller) for smaller $n_s$ in low (high)
temperature region. On the other hand, $S^d$, taken to be governed by Mott
formula, $\sim {\nu_F}^{* -1}$, $T$ and ${n_s}^{-1/2}$ and $S^d<<S^g$ for $T >
\sim$ 2 K. The power factor $PF$ is also found to be strongly $\theta$

of merit is discussed.In tBLG, $\theta$ acts as a strong tuning parameter of
both $S^g$ and $S^d$ and $PF$ in addition to $T$ and $n_s$. Our results are

  minutes to days explain changes in seizure evolutions",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epilepsy is recognised as a dynamic disease, where both seizure
susceptibility and seizure characteristics themselves change over time.
Specifically, we recently quantified the variable electrographic
spatio-temporal seizure evolutions that exist within individual patients. This
variability appears to follow subject-specific circadian, or longer, timescale
modulations. It is therefore important to know whether continuously-recorded
interictal iEEG features can capture signatures of these modulations over
different timescales.
  In this work, we analyse continuous intracranial electroencephalographic
(iEEG) recordings from video-telemetry units and find fluctuations in iEEG band
power over timescales ranging from minutes up to twelve days.
  As expected and in agreement with previous studies, we find that all subjects
show a circadian fluctuation in their iEEG band power. We additionally find
other fluctuations of similar magnitude on subject-specific timescales.
Importantly, we find that a combination of these fluctuations on different
timescales can explain changes in seizure evolutions in most subjects above
chance level.
  These results suggest that subject-specific fluctuations in iEEG band power
over timescales of minutes to days may serve as markers of seizure modulating
processes. We hope that future work can link these detected fluctuations to
their biological driver(s). There is a critical need to better understand
seizure modulating processes, as this will enable the development of novel
treatment strategies that could minimise the seizure spread, duration, or
severity and therefore the clinical impact of seizures.

Reasoning is an expensive resource that should be used on demand whenever the
expectations of the robot do not match the situation of the world and the
execution of the task is broken down; in such scenarios the robot must perform
the common sense daily life inference cycle consisting on diagnosing what
happened, deciding what to do about it, and inducing and executing a plan,
recurring in such behavior until the service task can be resumed. Here we
examine two strategies to implement this cycle: (1) a pipe-line strategy
involving abduction, decision-making and planning, which we call deliberative
inference and (2) the use of the knowledge and preferences stored in the
robot's knowledge-base, which we call conceptual inference. The former involves
an explicit definition of a problem space that is explored through heuristic
search, and the latter is based on conceptual knowledge including the human
user preferences, and its representation requires a non-monotonic
knowledge-based system. We compare the strengths and limitations of both
approaches. We also describe a service robot conceptual model and architecture
capable of supporting the daily life inference cycle during the execution of a
robotics service task. The model is centered in the declarative specification

interactions through a fluid: beating cilia, swimming sperm and worms, and
flapping wings, all display synchronization behavior through fluid mechanical
interactions. However, as the density of a collective increases individuals may
also interact with each other through physical contact. In the field of ""active
matter"" systems, it is well known that inelastic contact between individuals
can produce long-range correlations in position, orientation, and velocity. In
this work we demonstrate that contact interactions between undulating robots
yield novel phase dynamics such as synchronized motions. We consider undulatory
systems in which rhythmic motion emerges from time-independent oscillators that
sense and respond to undulatory bending angle and speed. In pair experiments we
demonstrate that robot joints will synchronize to in-phase and anti-phase
oscillations through collisions and a phase-oscillator model describes the
stability of these modes. To understand how contact interactions influence the
phase dynamics of larger groups we perform simulations and experiments of
simple three-link undulatory robots that interact only through contact.
Collectives synchronize their movements through contact as predicted by the
theory and when the robots can adjust their position in response to contact we
no longer observe anti-phase synchronization. Lastly we demonstrate that
synchronization dramatically reduces the interaction forces within confined
groups of undulatory robots indicating significant energetic and safety
benefits from group synchronization. The theory and experiments in this study
illustrate how contact interactions in undulatory active matter can lead to
novel collective motion and synchronization.

the magnetic field energy contribution to the binding energies and diamagnetic

the energy contribution of direct and indirect magnetoexcitons by the magnetic

using magnetic field and opens an additional degree of freedom to tailor the

reduced-order linear, bilinear or quadratic time invariant dynamical model
reproducing the underlying phenomena. The approach is essentially based on
linear dynamical systems and approximation theory. More specifically, it
sequentially involves the interpolatory Pencil and Loewner framework, known to
be both very versatile and scalable to large-scale data sets, and a linear
least square problem involving the raw data and reduced internal variables.
With respect to intrusive methods, no prior knowledge on the operator is
needed. In addition, compared to the traditional non-intrusive operator
inference ones, the proposed approach alleviates the need of measuring the
original full-order model internal variables. It is thus applicable to a wider
application range than standard intrusive and non-intrusive methods. The
rationale is successfully applied on a large eddy simulation of a pollutants
dispersion case over an airport area involving multi-scale and multi-physics
dynamical phenomena. Despite the simplicity of the resulting low complexity
model, the proposed approach shows satisfactory results to predict the
pollutants plume pattern while being significantly faster to simulate.

incur slight violations in capacities, ($1 + \epsilon$) for the problems

($1 + \epsilon$) in outliers. Due to the hardness of the underlying problems,
the violations are inevitable. Thus we achieve the best possible by rounding

will provide strong microlensing constraints on dark compact objects (DCOs) in
our Galaxy. However, most current forecasts limit their analysis to Primordial
Black Holes (PBH). It is unclear how well LSST microlensing will be able to
constrain alternative models of DCOs with different Galactic spatial profile
distributions at a subdominant DM fraction. In this work, we investigate how
well LSST microlensing will constrain spherical or disk-like Galactic spatial
distributions of DCOs, taking into account extended observing times, baryonic
microlensing background, and sky distribution of LSST sources. These extensions
represent significant improvements over existing microlensing forecasts in
terms of both accuracy and versatility. We demonstrate this power by deriving
new LSST sensitivity projections for DCOs in spherical and disk-like
distributions. We forecast that LSST will be able to constrain one solar mass
PBHs to have a DM fraction under $4.1\times10^{-4}$. One-solar-mass objects in
a dark disk distribution with the same dimensions as the Galactic disk will be
constrained below $3.1\times10^{-4}$, while those with $m = 10^5M_{\odot}$ will
be constrained to below $3.4\times10^{-5}$. We find that compressed dark disks
can be constrained up to a factor of $\sim10$ better than ones with identical
dimensions to the baryonic disk. We also find that dark disks become less
tightly constrained when they are tilted with respect to our own disk. This
forecasting software is a versatile tool, capable of constraining any model of
DCOs in the Milky Way with microlensing, and is made publically available at

Conventional textual-based causality knowledge acquisition methods typically
require laborious and expensive human annotations. As a result, their scale is
often limited. Moreover, as no context is provided during the annotation, the
resulting causality knowledge records (e.g., ConceptNet) typically do not take
the context into consideration. To explore a more scalable way of acquiring
causality knowledge, in this paper, we jump out of the textual domain and
investigate the possibility of learning contextual causality from the visual
signal. Compared with pure text-based approaches, learning causality from the
visual signal has the following advantages: (1) Causality knowledge belongs to
the commonsense knowledge, which is rarely expressed in the text but rich in
videos; (2) Most events in the video are naturally time-ordered, which provides
a rich resource for us to mine causality knowledge from; (3) All the objects in
the video can be used as context to study the contextual property of causal
relations. In detail, we first propose a high-quality dataset Vis-Causal and
then conduct experiments to demonstrate that with good language and visual
representation models as well as enough training signals, it is possible to
automatically discover meaningful causal knowledge from the videos. Further
analysis also shows that the contextual property of causal relations indeed
exists, taking which into consideration might be crucial if we want to use the
causality knowledge in real applications, and the visual signal could serve as
a good resource for learning such contextual causality.

quantum computing is an actively debated topic. We study a strongly-frustrated
quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising model on a two-leg ladder to elucidate how
a first-order phase transition with a topological origin is affected by
interactions of the $\pm XX$-type. Such interactions are sometimes known as
stoquastic (negative sign) and nonstoquastic (positive sign) ""catalysts"".
Carrying out a symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization group analysis
and extensive density-matrix renormalization group computations, we show that
the phase diagrams obtained by these two methods are in qualitative agreement
with each other and reveal that the first-order quantum phase transition of a
topological nature remains stable against the introduction of both $XX$-type
catalysts. This is the first study of the effects of nonstoquasticity on a
first-order phase transition between topologically distinct phases. Our results
indicate that nonstoquastic catalysts are generally insufficient for removing
topological obstacles in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computing.

implementations of complex imaging and machine learning pipelines, directly
from high-level Halide algorithm code. It is fully automatic, requiring no
schedule templates or hand-optimized kernels, and it targets a diverse range of
computations which is significantly broader than existing autoschedulers. We
address the scalability challenge of extending previous approaches to schedule
large real world programs, while enabling a broad set of program rewrites that
take into account the nested parallelism and memory hierarchy introduced by GPU
architectures. We achieve this using a hierarchical sampling strategy that
groups programs into buckets based on their structural similarity, then samples
representatives to be evaluated, allowing us to explore a large space by only
considering a subset of the space, and a pre-pass that 'freezes' decisions for
the lowest cost sections of a program, allowing more time to be spent on the
important stages. We then apply an efficient cost model combining machine
learning, program analysis, and GPU architecture knowledge. Our method scales
combinatorially better with respect to the deeper nested parallelism required
by GPUs compared to previous work. We evaluate its performance on a diverse
suite of real-world imaging and machine learning pipelines. We demonstrate
results that are on average 1.66X faster than existing automatic solutions (up
to 5X), and competitive with what the best human experts were able to achieve
in an active effort to beat our automatic results.

with protons ($pp$), with aluminum nuclei ($p\rm{Al}$) and with gold nuclei
($p\rm{Au}$) at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV. Neutral
pions are observed in the forward direction relative to the transversely
polarized proton beam, in the pseudo-rapidity region $2.7<\eta<3.8$. Results
are presented for $\pi^0$s observed in the STAR FMS electromagnetic calorimeter
in narrow Feynman x ($x_F$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$) bins, spanning the
range $0.17<x_F<0.81$ and $1.7<p_{T}<6.0$ GeV/$c$. For fixed $x_F<0.47$, the
asymmetries are found to rise with increasing transverse momentum. For larger
$x_F$, the asymmetry flattens or falls as ${p_T}$ increases. Parametrizing the
ratio $r(A) \equiv A_N(pA)/A_N(pp)=A^P$ over the kinematic range, the ratio
$r(A)$ is found to depend only weakly on $A$, with ${\langle}P{\rangle} =
-0.027 \pm 0.005$. No significant difference in $P$ is observed between the
low-$p_T$ region, $p_T<2.5$ GeV/$c$, where gluon saturation effects may play a
role, and the high-$p_T$ region, $p_T>2.5$ GeV/$c$. It is further observed that
the value of $A_N$ is significantly larger for events with a large-$p_T$
isolated $\pi^0$ than for events with a non-isolated $\pi^0$ accompanied by
additional jet-like fragments. The nuclear dependence $r(A)$ is similar for
isolated and non-isolated $\pi^0$ events.

momentum do not precess. However, post-Newtonian calculations predict that
""up-down"" binaries, in which the spin of the heavier (lighter) black hole is
aligned (antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum, are unstable when the
spins are slightly perturbed from perfect alignment. This instability provides
a possible mechanism for the formation of precessing binaries in environments
where sources are preferentially formed with (anti) aligned spins. In this
paper, we present the first full numerical relativity simulations capturing
this instability. These simulations span $\sim 100$ orbits and $\sim 3$-$5$
precession cycles before merger, making them some of the longest numerical
relativity simulations to date. Initialized with a small perturbation of
$1^{\circ}$-$10^{\circ}$, the instability causes a dramatic growth of the spin
misalignments, which can reach $\sim 90^{\circ}$ near merger. We show that this
leaves a strong imprint on the subdominant modes of the gravitational wave
signal, which can potentially be used to distinguish up-down binaries from
other sources. Finally, we show that post-Newtonian and effective-one-body
approximants are able to reproduce the unstable dynamics of up-down binaries
extracted from numerical relativity.

schemes are inspired by the rapidly-growing research on metagratings, typically
used to manipulate wave trajectories in free-space. These sparse configurations
of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms) are designed by careful
tailoring of inter-element near-field and far-field interactions, relying on
analytical models to resolve the required meta-atom distribution and geometry
to facilitate a desired interference pattern when excited by the incident wave.
Utilizing these metagrating design concepts, we develop a modal formalism for
obtaining a collection of locations inside the bend junction, in which a
passive scatterer may be placed to zero out the return loss. Subsequently, we
propose two different shapes for the scatterer and discuss, for each of them,
the ways in which their geometrical characteristics may be retrieved. This
versatile and efficient methodology, verified via full-wave simulations, can be
utilized to eliminate reflection loss in diverse bend configurations, often
found in complex wave-guiding systems used for antenna feeding and power

the transport and resuspension of sediments in oceanic conditions. In
particular, when these waves undergo a \textit{critical reflection} phenomenon,
the reflected wave can produce a very large shear. Separating the reflected
wave from the incident wave is a technical challenge since the two waves share
the same temporal frequency. In our study, we present a series of experimental
measurements of internal waves in \textit{critical reflection} configuration
and we analyze them using the 2D-VMD-prox decomposition method. This
decomposition method was adapted to specifically decompose waves in an internal
wave critical reflection, showing an improvement in its performance with
respect to preexisting internal wave decomposition methods. Being able to
confidently isolate the reflected wave allowed us to compare our results to a
viscous and non-linear model for critical reflection, that correctly describes
the dependence of the shear rate produced in the boundary as a function of the
experimental parameters.

of homological algebra, called Hopfological algebra. Since then, several
attempts have been made to import tools and techiniques from homological
algebra to Hopfological algebra. For example, Qi arXiv:1205.1814 introduced the
notion of cofibrant objects in the category $\mathbf{C}_{A,H}^{H}$ of
$H$-equivariant modules over an $H$-module algebra $A$, which is a counterpart
to the category of modules over a dg algebra, although he did not define a
model structure on $\mathbf{C}_{A,H}^{H}$.
  In this paper, we show that there exists an Abelian model structure on
$\mathbf{C}_{A,H}^{H}$ in which cofibrant objects agree with Qi's cofibrant
objects under a slight modification. This is done by constructing cotorsion
pairs in $\mathbf{C}_{A,H}^{H}$ which form a Hovey triple in the sense of
Gillespie arXiv:1512.06001. This can be regarded as a Hopfological analogues of
the works of Enochs, Jenda, and Xu and of Avramov, Foxby, and Halperin. By
restricting to compact cofibrant objects, we obtain a Waldhausen category
$\mathcal{P}\mathrm{erf}_{A,H}^{H}$ of perfect objects. By taking invariants of
this Waldhausen category, such as algebraic $K$-theory, Hochschild homology,
cyclic homology, and so on, we obtain Hopfological analogues of these
invariants.

resolution in soft X-rays. These properties, along with the large arrays and
small pixel sizes available with modern-day CCDs, make them a potential
candidate for next generation astronomical X-ray missions equipped with large
collecting areas, high angular resolutions and wide fields of view, enabling
observation of the faint, diffuse and high redshift X-ray universe. However,
such high collecting area (about 30 times Chandra) requires these detectors to
have an order of magnitude faster readout than current CCDs to avoid saturation
and pile up effects. In this context, Stanford University and MIT have
initiated the development of fast readout X-ray cameras. As a tool for this
development, we have designed a fast readout, low noise electronics board
(intended to work at a 5 Megapixel per second data rate) coupled with an STA
Archon controller to readout a 512 x 512 CCD (from MIT Lincoln Laboratory).
This versatile setup allows us to study a number of parameters and operation
conditions including the option for digital shaping. In this paper, we describe
the characterization test stand, the concept and development of the readout
electronics, and simulation results. We also report the first measurements of
read noise, energy resolution and other parameters from this set up. While this
is very much a prototype, we plan to use larger, multi-node CCD devices in the
future with dedicated ASIC readout systems to enable faster, parallel readout
of the CCDs.

fractal structures with a single fractal dimension $D$ in relativistic settings

volume-limited samples corresponding to the redshift limits in each redshift
bins for absolute magnitude is presented. Fractal analysis using the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is applied to a reduced subsample in the range
$0.1\le z \le 4$, and the entire sample within $0.1\le z\le 6$. Three
relativistic distances are used, the luminosity distance $d_L$, redshift
distance $d_z$ and galaxy area distance $d_G$, because for data at $z\gtrsim
0.3$ relativistic effects are such that for the same $z$ these distance
definitions yield different values. The results show two consecutive and
distinct redshift ranges in both the reduced and complete samples where the
data behave as a single fractal galaxy structure. For the reduced subsample we
found that the fractal dimension is $D=\left(1.58\pm0.20\right)$ for $z<1$, and
$D=\left(0.59\pm0.28\right)$ for $1\le z\le 4$. The complete sample yielded
$D=\left(1.63\pm0.20\right)$ for $z<1$ and $D=\left(0.52\pm0.29\right)$ for
$1\le z\le6$. These results are consistent with those found by Conde-Saavedra
et al. (2015; arXiv:1409.5409v1), where a similar analysis was applied to a
much more limited survey at equivalent redshift depths, and suggest that either
there are yet unclear observational biases causing such decrease in the fractal

to the case where the momentum components also satisfy noncommutative

case, i.e. when only the spatial noncommutativity is present, the underlying
mathematical structure is reminiscent of the Unruh effect, as observed by a
Rindler observer whose acceleration now gets related to the noncommutative

rare object categories is an important challenge in computer vision. Leveraging
data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge.
Here, we perform a systematic study of the Copy-Paste augmentation ([13, 12])
for instance segmentation where we randomly paste objects onto an image. Prior
studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for
pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting
objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong
baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised
methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training).
On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an
improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.
We further demonstrate that Copy-Paste can lead to significant improvements on
the LVIS benchmark. Our baseline model outperforms the LVIS 2020 Challenge
winning entry by +3.6 mask AP on rare categories.

speaker verification (SV). First, we examine a simple contrastive learning
approach (SimCLR) with a momentum contrastive (MoCo) learning framework, where
the MoCo speaker embedding system utilizes a queue to maintain a large set of
negative examples. We show that better speaker embeddings can be learned by
momentum contrastive learning. Next, alternative augmentation strategies are
explored to normalize extrinsic speaker variabilities of two random segments
from the same speech utterance. Specifically, augmentation in the waveform
largely improves the speaker representations for SV tasks. The proposed MoCo
speaker embedding is further improved when a prototypical memory bank is
introduced, which encourages the speaker embeddings to be closer to their
assigned prototypes with an intermediate clustering step. In addition, we
generalize the self-supervised framework to a semi-supervised scenario where
only a small portion of the data is labeled. Comprehensive experiments on the
Voxceleb dataset demonstrate that our proposed self-supervised approach
achieves competitive performance compared with existing techniques, and can
approach fully supervised results with partially labeled data.

(SNe Ia) at high-redshift depends on the accurate photometric classification of
the SN events detected. Generating realistic simulations of photometric SN
surveys constitutes an essential step for training and testing photometric
classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced by selection
effects and contamination arising from core collapse SNe in the photometric SN
Ia samples. We use published SN time-series spectrophotometric templates,
rates, luminosity functions and empirical relationships between SNe and their
host galaxies to construct a framework for simulating photometric SN surveys.
We present this framework in the context of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year
photometric SN sample, comparing our simulations of DES with the observed DES
transient populations. We demonstrate excellent agreement in many
distributions, including Hubble residuals, between our simulations and data. We
estimate the core collapse fraction expected in the DES SN sample after
selection requirements are applied and before photometric classification. After
testing different modelling choices and astrophysical assumptions underlying
our simulation, we find that the predicted contamination varies from 5.8 to 9.3
per cent, with an average of 7.0 per cent and r.m.s. of 1.1 per cent. Our
simulations are the first to reproduce the observed photometric SN and host
galaxy properties in high-redshift surveys without fine-tuning the input
parameters. The simulation methods presented here will be a critical component
of the cosmology analysis of the DES photometric SN Ia sample: correcting for
biases arising from contamination, and evaluating the associated systematic
uncertainty.

attention. In this paper, we propose and study a task named Meticulous Object
Segmentation (MOS), which is focused on segmenting well-defined foreground
objects with elaborate shapes in high resolution images (e.g. 2k - 4k). To this
end, we propose the MeticulousNet which leverages a dedicated decoder to
capture the object boundary details. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical
Point-wise Refining (HierPR) block to better delineate object boundaries, and
reformulate the decoding process as a recursive coarse to fine refinement of
the object mask. To evaluate segmentation quality near object boundaries, we
propose the Meticulosity Quality (MQ) score considering both the mask coverage
and boundary precision. In addition, we collect a MOS benchmark dataset
including 600 high quality images with complex objects. We provide
comprehensive empirical evidence showing that MeticulousNet can reveal
pixel-accurate segmentation boundaries and is superior to state-of-the-art
methods for high resolution object segmentation tasks.

privacy-preserving decentralized aggregation protocol for federated learning.
We formulate the distributed aggregation protocol with the Alternating

prior work that use Differential Privacy or homomorphic encryption for privacy,
we develop a protocol that controls communication among participants in each
round of aggregation to minimize privacy leakage. We establish its privacy
guarantee against an honest-but-curious adversary. We also propose an efficient
algorithm to construct such a communication pattern, inspired by combinatorial
block design theory. Our secure aggregation protocol based on this novel group
communication pattern design leads to an efficient algorithm for federated
training with privacy guarantees. We evaluate our federated training algorithm
on image classification and next-word prediction applications over benchmark
datasets with 9 and 15 distributed sites. Evaluation results show that our
algorithm performs comparably to the standard centralized federated learning
method while preserving privacy; the degradation in test accuracy is only up to

Ozsvath-Szabo's bordered knot Floer homology. We equip them with the structure
of 2-representations of the categorified negative half U^- of U_q(gl(1|1)),
1-morphisms of such, and 2-morphisms respectively, and show that they
categorify representations of U_q(gl(1|1)^-) and maps between them. Unlike with
Ozsvath-Szabo's algebras, the algebras considered here can be built from a
higher tensor product operation recently introduced by Rouquier and the author.
  Our bimodules are all motivated by holomorphic disk counts in Heegaard
diagrams; for positive and negative crossings, the bimodules can also be
expressed as mapping cones involving a singular-crossing bimodule and the
identity bimodule. In fact, they arise from an action of the monoidal category
of Soergel bimodules via Rouquier complexes in the usual way, the first time
(to the author's knowledge) such an expression has been obtained for braiding
bimodules in Heegaard Floer homology.
  Furthermore, the singular crossing bimodule naturally factors into two
bimodules for trivalent vertices; such bimodules have not appeared in previous
bordered-Floer approaches to knot Floer homology. The action of the Soergel
category comes from an action of categorified quantum gl(2) on the
2-representation 2-category of U^- in line with the ideas of skew Howe duality,
where the trivalent vertex bimodules are associated to 1-morphisms E, F in

following two major constraints on the programs to incorporate knowledge
reasoning: i) multiple knowledge triplets can be related to the question, but
only one knowledge relates to the image object. This can enforce the VQA model

electromagnetic radiation spanning the radio to MeV gamma-ray bands provided
the first direct evidence that short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can originate from
binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. On the other hand, the properties of short
GRBs in high-energy gamma rays are still poorly constrained, with only $\sim$20
events detected in the GeV band, and none in the TeV band. GRB~160821B is one
of the nearest short GRBs known at $z=0.162$. Recent analyses of the
multiwavelength observational data of its afterglow emission revealed an
optical-infrared kilonova component, characteristic of heavy-element
nucleosynthesis in a BNS merger. Aiming to better clarify the nature of short
GRBs, this burst was automatically followed up with the MAGIC telescopes,
starting from 24 seconds after the burst trigger. Evidence of a gamma-ray
signal is found above $\sim$0.5 TeV at a significance of $\sim3\,\sigma$ during
observations that lasted until 4 hours after the burst. Assuming that the
observed excess events correspond to gamma-ray emission from GRB 160821B, in
conjunction with data at other wavelengths, we investigate its origin in the
framework of GRB afterglow models. The simplest interpretation with one-zone
models of synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the external forward shock has
difficulty accounting for the putative TeV flux. Alternative scenarios are
discussed where the TeV emission can be relatively enhanced. The role of future
GeV-TeV observations of short GRBs in advancing our understanding of BNS
mergers and related topics is briefly addressed.

consider a fermionic singlet that is produced through its interactions with a

the Universe, as well as the scaling of the temperature, which significantly
affects the evolution of both the number density and the mean momentum of the
dark matter particle. We identify and discuss in detail the effects of the
evolution of these quantities by considering several examples representing dark
matter production at different stages of expansion and entropy injection. We
find that, since the dark matter density is reduced when the entropy injection
to the plasma continues after freeze-in, in order to reproduce its
observational value an enhanced rate of dark matter production is required
relative to standard cosmology. Furthermore, the impact of the assumed
non-standard cosmological history on the dark matter mean momentum can result
in either a relaxed or a tightened bound on the dark matter mass from large

Specifically, we consider the dependence of the approximation rate on the

increase in order to take advantage of the dimension dependent smoothness of

major factors in the aggregation of multiple ground truth annotations: (1)
handling contradictory annotations in the training data originating from

  Multiplexing","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gold standard of a wireless network is that the throughput increases
linearly with the density of access points (APs). However, such a linear
throughput gain is suspended in the 5G mmWave network mainly due to the short
communication distances in mmWave bands and the dense deployments of mmWave
APs. As being operated in the interference-limited regime, the aggregate
interference resulted from the increasing mmWave APs will gradually become the
network performance bottleneck, which leads to the saturation of the
throughput. In this paper, we propose to overcome the densification plateau of
a mmWave network by employing spatial multiplexing at APs. To study the effect
of spatial multiplexing on mmWave networks, we first derive the coverage
probability as a function of spatial multiplexing gain. The fixed-rate coding
scheme is then used to provide the network throughput. We also introduce the
concept of densification gain to capture the improvement in network throughput
achieved through the AP densification. Our results indicate that without the
spatial multiplexing at APs, the throughput of mmWave networks will reach the
plateau when the density of APs becomes sufficiently large. By enabling the
spatial multiplexing at APs, however, the mmWave network can continuously
harvest the throughput gains as the number of APs grows. By deriving the upper
bound for the throughput of mmWave networks, we quantify the potential
throughput improvement as the spatial multiplexing gain increases. However, our
numerical results show that such a potential throughput gain cannot be explored
by the fixed-rate coding scheme. We then demonstrate the necessity for
deploying the multi-rate coding scheme in mmWave networks, especially when the
spatial multiplexing gain at mmWave APs is large.

scattering of electrons and long-lived particles with MeV mass and high-speed.
We consider a tangible model composed of two scalar MeV dark matter (DM)
particles $S_A$ and $S_B$ to interpret the XENON1T keV excess via boosted
$S_B$. A small mass splitting $m_{S_A}-m_{S_B}>0$ is introduced and the boosted
$S_B$ can be produced by the dark annihilation process of $S_A S_A^\dagger \to
\phi \to S_B S_B^\dagger$ via a resonant scalar $\phi$. The $S_B-$electron
scattering is intermediated by a vector boson $X$. Although the constraints
from BBN, CMB and low-energy experiments set the $X-$mediated $S_B-$electron
scattering cross section to be $\lesssim 10^{-35} \mathrm{cm}^2$, the MeV scale
DM with a resonance enhanced dark annihilation today can still provide enough
boosted $S_B$ and induce the XENON1T keV excess. The relic density of $S_B$ is
significantly reduced by the $s$-wave process of $S_B S_B^\dagger \to X X$
which is allowed by the constraints from CMB and 21-cm absorption. A very small
relic fraction of $S_B$ is compatible with the stringent bounds on un-boosted
$S_B$-electron scattering in DM direct detection and the $S_A$-electron
scattering is also allowed.

approximately record the frequency or estimate the cardinality of flows. At
their cores, sketches usually maintain one or multiple counter array(s), and
rely on hash functions to select the counter(s) for each flow. Then the
space-efficient sketches from the distributed measurement nodes are aggregated
to provide statistics of the undergoing flows. Currently, tremendous redesigns

measurement performance. However, existing reviews or surveys mainly focus on

previous environments. After that, a multi-task evolutionary algorithm is
employed to simultaneously optimize the problems in the past environments
assisted by the ensemble surrogate. This way, the optimization tasks in the
previous environments can be used to accelerate the tracking of the optimum in
the current environment. Since the real fitness function is not available for
verifying the surrogates in offline data-driven optimization, a support vector
domain description that was designed for outlier detection is introduced to
select a reliable solution. Empirical results on six dynamic optimization
benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
compared with four state-of-the-art data-driven optimization algorithms.

over all alternatives, for these partial rankings it is necessary to conduct
preference completion. Specifically, the personalized preference of each agent
over all the alternatives can be estimated with partial rankings from
neighboring agents over subsets of alternatives. However, since the agents'
rankings are nondeterministic, where they may provide rankings with noise, it
is necessary and important to conduct the trustworthy preference completion.
Hence, in this paper firstly, a trust-based anchor-kNN algorithm is proposed to
find $k$-nearest trustworthy neighbors of the agent with trust-oriented
Kendall-Tau distances, which will handle the cases when an agent exhibits
irrational behaviors or provides only noisy rankings. Then, for alternative
pairs, a bijection can be built from the ranking space to the preference space,
and its certainty and conflict can be evaluated based on a well-built
statistical measurement Probability-Certainty Density Function. Therefore, a
certain common voting rule for the first $k$ trustworthy neighboring agents
based on certainty and conflict can be taken to conduct the trustworthy
preference completion. The properties of the proposed certainty and conflict
have been studied empirically, and the proposed approach has been
experimentally validated compared to state-of-arts approaches with several data

two-valued variables (generally stored in the form of 0 or 1 value) often exist

effectively handled by traditional monitoring methods such as LDA, PCA and PLS.
Recently, a mixed hidden naive Bayesian model (MHNBM) is developed for the
first time to utilize both two-valued and continuous variables for abnormality
monitoring. Although MHNBM is effective, it still has some shortcomings that
need to be improved. For MHNBM, the variables with greater correlation to other
variables have greater weights, which cannot guarantee greater weights are
assigned to the more discriminating variables. In addition, the conditional
probability must be computed based on the historical data. When the training
data is scarce, the conditional probability between continuous variables tends
to be uniformly distributed, which affects the performance of MHNBM. Here a
novel feature weighted mixed naive Bayes model (FWMNBM) is developed to
overcome the above shortcomings. For FWMNBM, the variables that are more
correlated to the class have greater weights, which makes the more
discriminating variables contribute more to the model. At the same time, FWMNBM
does not have to calculate the conditional probability between variables, thus
it is less restricted by the number of training data samples. Compared with
MHNBM, FWMNBM has better performance, and its effectiveness is validated
through the numerical cases of a simulation example and a practical case of

practice. In particular, previous theory work considers mostly easy problems
that are composed of unimodal objectives.
  As a first step towards a deeper understanding of how evolutionary algorithms
solve multimodal multiobjective problems, we propose the OJZJ problem, a
bi-objective problem composed of two objectives isomorphic to the classic jump
function benchmark. We prove that SEMO with probability one does not compute
the full Pareto front, regardless of the runtime. In contrast, for all problem
sizes $n$ and all jump sizes ${k \in [4..\frac n2 - 1]}$, the global SEMO
(GSEMO) covers the Pareto front in an expected number of $\Theta((n-2k)n^{k})$
iterations. For $k = o(n)$, we also show the tighter bound $\frac 32 e n^{k+1}
\pm o(n^{k+1})$, which might be the first runtime bound for an MOEA that is
tight apart from lower-order terms. We also combine the GSEMO with two
approaches that showed advantages in single-objective multimodal problems. When
using the GSEMO with a heavy-tailed mutation operator, the expected runtime
improves by a factor of at least $k^{\Omega(k)}$. When adapting the recent
stagnation-detection strategy of Rajabi and Witt (2022) to the GSEMO, the
expected runtime also improves by a factor of at least $k^{\Omega(k)}$ and
surpasses the heavy-tailed GSEMO by a small polynomial factor in $k$. Via an
experimental analysis, we show that these asymptotic differences are visible
already for small problem sizes: A factor-$5$ speed-up from heavy-tailed
mutation and a factor-$10$ speed-up from stagnation detection can be observed
already for jump size~$4$ and problem sizes between $10$ and $50$. Overall, our
results show that the ideas recently developed to aid single-objective
evolutionary algorithms to cope with local optima can be effectively employed
also in multiobjective optimization.

quantum spin chain near criticality, where the low-energy physics is described
by a relativistic (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. Such a bubble can be
thought of as a confined kink-antikink pair (a meson). We carefully construct
bubbles so that particle production does not occur until the walls collide. To
achieve this in the presence of strong correlations, we extend a Matrix Product
State (MPS) ansatz for quasiparticle wavepackets [Van Damme et al.,
arXiv:1907.02474 (2019)] to the case of confined, topological quasiparticles.
By choosing the wavepacket width and the bubble size appropriately, we avoid
strong lattice effects and observe relativistic kink-antikink collisions. We
use the MPS quasiparticle ansatz to detect scattering outcomes: In the Ising
model, with transverse and longitudinal fields, we do not observe particle
production despite nonintegrability (supporting recent observations of
nonthermalizing mesonic states). With additional interactions, we see
production of confined and unconfined particle pairs. Although we simulated
these low-energy, few-particle events with moderate resources, we observe
significant growth of entanglement with energy and with the number of
collisions, suggesting that increasing either will ultimately exhaust our

framework for modeling physical simulations without explicitly defining the
ODEs governing the system, but instead learning them via machine learning.
However, the question: ""Can Bayesian learning frameworks be integrated with
Neural ODE's to robustly quantify the uncertainty in the weights of a Neural
ODE?"" remains unanswered. In an effort to address this question, we primarily
evaluate the following categories of inference methods: (a) The No-U-Turn MCMC
sampler (NUTS), (b) Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) and (c)
Stochastic Langevin Gradient Descent (SGLD). We demonstrate the successful
integration of Neural ODEs with the above Bayesian inference frameworks on
classical physical systems, as well as on standard machine learning datasets
like MNIST, using GPU acceleration. On the MNIST dataset, we achieve a
posterior sample accuracy of 98.5% on the test ensemble of 10,000 images.
Subsequently, for the first time, we demonstrate the successful integration of
variational inference with normalizing flows and Neural ODEs, leading to a
powerful Bayesian Neural ODE object. Finally, considering a predator-prey model
and an epidemiological system, we demonstrate the probabilistic identification
of model specification in partially-described dynamical systems using universal
ordinary differential equations. Together, this gives a scientific machine
learning tool for probabilistic estimation of epistemic uncertainties.

deteriorate the system performance. Here we show a stratification for a
2.5-dimensional method-of-moment simulator Sonnet EM that enables accurate
simulations of the radiative resonant behavior of submillimeter-wave coplanar
resonators and straight coplanar waveguides (CPWs). The Sonnet simulation
agrees well with the measurement of the transmission through a coplanar
resonant filter at 374.6 GHz. Our Sonnet stratification utilizes artificial
lossy layers below the lossless substrate to absorb the radiation, and we use
co-calibrated internal ports for de-embedding. With this type of
stratification, Sonnet can be used to model superconducting
millimeter-submillimeter wave circuits even when radiation loss is a potential
concern.

between the equivalent widths of BAL and the continuum luminosity, reveals that
the variation of BAL trough is dominated by the photoionization. The
photoionization model predicts that when the time interval $\Delta T$ between
two observations is longer than the recombination timescale $t_{\rm rec}$, the
BAL variations can be detected. This can be characterized as a ""sharp rise"" in
the detection rate of BAL variation at $\Delta T=t_{\rm rec}$. For the first
time, we detect such a ""sharp rise"" signature in the detection rate of BAL
variations. As a result, we propose that the $t_{\rm rec}$ can be obtained from
the ""sharp rise"" of the detection rate of BAL variation. It is worth mentioning
that the BAL variations are detected at the time-intervals less than the
$t_{\rm rec}$ for half an order of magnitude in two individual troughs. This
result indicates that there may be multiple components with different $t_{\rm

Visualization can be a useful tool to assess learning scenarios by

allowing users to understand the MIL datasets in an intuitive way. In addition,
we propose two new instance selection methods for MIL, which help users improve

support of the MILTree layout, the initial classification model was updated by
changing the training set, which is composed of the prototype instances.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that

which prohibits the 3D CNNs from sufficiently large receptive fields to capture
the global cues in the entire image. In this work, we propose a hybrid
representation learning approach to address this challenge. The main idea is to
use CNNs to learn local appearances of vessels in image crops while using
another point-cloud network to learn the global geometry of vessels in the
entire image. In inference, the proposed approach extracts local segments of
vessels using CNNs, classifies each segment based on global geometry using the
point-cloud network, and finally connects all the segments that belong to the
same vessel using the shortest-path algorithm. This combination results in an
efficient, fully-automatic and template-free approach to centerline extraction
from 3D images. We validate the proposed approach on CTA datasets and

a foliation structure. That is, inside the 3+1D model, there are hidden layers

often reveal nontrivial features associated with a layered structure. In this
paper, we study the X-cube model on lattices with screw dislocations. In
particular, we find that a screw dislocation results in a finite change in the

be traced back to the effect of screw dislocations in a simple stack of 2+1D
topological states, hence corroborating the foliation structure in the model.
The other part of the change comes from the induced motion of fractons or

the field of glass research. Strong deviations from the Arrhenius law make the
interpretation of the activation energy difficult. In the present study, a
reasonable interpretation of the apparent activation energy is demonstrated
along similar lines as those adopted in solid-state physics and chemistry. In
contrast to the widely held view that phase transition in glass occurs at the
reference temperature $T_{0}$ according to the Vogel--Fulcher--Tammann formula,
in the present work the transition observed at the glass-transition temperature
$T_{g}$ is regarded as a phase transition from the liquid to solid phases. A
distinct feature of glass is that the energy barrier significantly changes in
the transition range with width $\Delta T_{g}$. This change in the energy
barrier alters the manner in which the apparent activation energy constitutes
the Arrhenius form. Analysis of available experimental data showed that the
actual energy barrier is significantly smaller than the apparent activation
energy, and importantly, the values obtained were in the reasonable range of
energy expected for chemical bonds. The overestimation of the apparent
activation energy depends on the ratio $T_{g}/\Delta T_{g}$, which explains the
existence of two types of glasses strong and fragile glasses. The fragility can
be re-interpreted as an indication of the degree of increase in the energy
barrier when approaching $T_{g}$ from high temperatures. Since no divergence in
viscosity was observed below $T_{g}$, it is unlikely that a transition occurs
at $T_{0}$.

delivery have recently been developed further to support grid frequency
regulation (GFR). This paper proposes a new control strategy for a
line-commutated converter-based (LCC) HVDC system, wherein the DC-link voltage
and current are optimally regulated to improve real-time GFR in both rectifier-
and inverter-side AC networks. A dynamic model of an LCC HVDC system is
developed using the DC voltage and current as input variables, and is
integrated with feedback loops for inertia emulation and droop control. A
linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is also designed for optimal
secondary frequency control, while mitigating conflict between the droop
controllers of the HVDC converters. An eigenvalue analysis is then conducted,
focusing on the effects of model parameters and controller gains on the
proposed strategy. Simulation case studies are also performed using the
Jeju-Haenam HVDC system as a test bed. The results of the case study confirm
that the proposed strategy enables the HVDC system to improve GFR, in
coordination with generators in both-side grids, by exploiting the fast
dynamics of HVDC converters. The proposed strategy is also effective under
various conditions for the LQG weighting coefficients, inertia emulation, and

convergence maps whose power agree with theoretical lensing power spectra up to
$L{=}10000$ within the accuracy limits of HaloFit. This is made possible by a
combination of a highly parallelizable particle-mesh algorithm, a sub-evolution
scheme in the lensing projection, and a machine-learning inspired sharpening
step. Further, MADLens is fully differentiable with respect to the initial
conditions of the underlying particle-mesh simulations and a number of
cosmological parameters. These properties allow MADLens to be used as a forward

this paper, we present Multi-SpectroGAN (MSG), which can train the
multi-speaker model with only the adversarial feedback by conditioning a
self-supervised hidden representation of the generator to a conditional
discriminator. This leads to better guidance for generator training. Moreover,
we also propose adversarial style combination (ASC) for better generalization
in the unseen speaking style and transcript, which can learn latent
representations of the combined style embedding from multiple mel-spectrograms.
Trained with ASC and feature matching, the MSG synthesizes a high-diversity

models to represent the building thermal dynamics and game theoretic

strategy for a distribution system operator (DSO) to determine optimal
electricity prices, considering the optimal DR of HVAC systems in commercial
buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained with building energy
data and represented using an explicit set of linear and nonlinear equations,
without physics-based model parameters. An optimization problem for price-based
DR is then formulated using this equation set and repeatedly solved offline,
producing data on optimal DR schedules for various conditions of electricity
prices and building thermal environments. Another ANN is then trained online to
directly predict DR schedules for day-ahead electricity prices, which is
referred to as meta-prediction (MP). By replacing the DR optimization problem
with the MP-enabled ANN, an optimal electricity pricing strategy can be
implemented using a single-level decision-making structure, which is simpler
and more practical than a bi-level one. In simulation case studies, the
proposed single-level strategy is verified to successfully reflect the game
theoretic relations between the DSO and commercial building operators, so that
they effectively exploit the operational flexibility of the HVAC systems to
make the DR application profitable, while ensuring the grid voltage stability

However, selecting a fixed approval strategy, a priori, can be difficult

vary in their ""optimism''---where more optimistic policies have faster approval
rates---and searches over this family using an exponentially weighted average
forecaster. To control the cumulative risk of the deployed model, we give L2A
the option to abstain from making a prediction and incur some fixed abstention
cost instead. We derive bounds on the average risk of the model deployed by
L2A, assuming the distributional shifts are smooth. In simulation studies and
empirical analyses, L2A tailors the level of optimism for each problem-setting:
It learns to abstain when performance drops are common and approve beneficial
modifications quickly when the distribution is stable.

trained with teacher forcing with the ground truth label given at each time
step, without being exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training,
which hurts its generalization to unseen inputs, that is known as the ""exposure
bias"" problem. In this work, we propose to mitigate the conditional text
generation problem by contrasting positive pairs with negative pairs, such that
the model is exposed to various valid or incorrect perturbations of the inputs,
for improved generalization. However, training the model with naive contrastive
learning framework using random non-target sequences as negative examples is
suboptimal, since they are easily distinguishable from the correct output,
especially so with models pretrained with large text corpora. Also, generating
positive examples requires domain-specific augmentation heuristics which may
not generalize over diverse domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a
principled method to generate positive and negative samples for contrastive
learning of seq2seq models. Specifically, we generate negative examples by
adding small perturbations to the input sequence to minimize its conditional
likelihood, and positive examples by adding large perturbations while enforcing
it to have a high conditional likelihood. Such ""hard"" positive and negative
pairs generated using our method guides the model to better distinguish correct
outputs from incorrect ones. We empirically show that our proposed method
significantly improves the generalization of the seq2seq on three text
generation tasks - machine translation, text summarization, and question

oscillon is well-known to be a coherent, particle-like solution when introduced
as an Ansatz in the $\varphi^4$ theory. Here, we show that oscillons also arise
naturally in the dynamics of the theory, in particular as the result of
kink-antikink collisions in the presence of an impurity. We show that in
addition to the scattering of kinks and the formation of a breather, both bound
oscillon pairs and propagating oscillons may emerge from the collision. We
discuss their resonances and critical velocity as a function of impurity
strength and highlight the role played by the impurity in the scattering
process.

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While
contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path
to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate
the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores
either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume
uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on
reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.
Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign
relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging
high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.
While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an
individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary
mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,
we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility
behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via
simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain
spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide
useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.

post-selected data is always a matter of concern. This is because conditioning
on the outcomes is a source of non-causal correlations, known as a selection
bias, rising doubts whether the conclusion concerns the actual causal process
or maybe it is just an effect of processing the data. Yet, even in the
idealised case without detection inefficiencies, post-selection is an integral
part of experimental designs, not least because it is a part of the
entanglement generation process itself. In this paper we discuss a broad class
of scenarios with post-selection on multiple spatially distributed outcomes. A
simple criterion is worked out, called the all-but-one principle, showing when
the conclusions about nonlocality from breaking Bell inequalities with
post-selected data remain in force. Generality of this result, attained by
adopting the high-level diagrammatic tools of causal inference, provides safe
grounds for systematic reasoning based on the standard form of multipartite
Bell inequalities in a wide array of entanglement generation schemes, without
worrying about the dangers of selection bias. In particular, it can be applied
to post-selection defined by single-particle events in each detection chanel
when the number of particles in the system is conserved.

nonlinear magnetic calibration with the help of neural networks to obtain more
accurate magnetic fields. We employed the data from Hinode/SP to construct a
training, validation and test dataset. The narrow-band Stokes I, Q, U, and V
maps at one wavelength point were selected from all the 112 wavelength points
observed by SP so as to simulate the single-wavelength observations of the
filter-based magnetograph. We used the residual network to model the nonlinear
relationship between the Stokes maps and the vector magnetic fields. After an
extensive performance analysis, it is found that the trained models could infer
the longitudinal magnetic flux density, the transverse magnetic flux density,
and the azimuth angle from the narrow-band Stokes maps with a precision
comparable to the inversion results using 112 wavelength points. Moreover, the
maps that were produced are much cleaner than the inversion results. The method
can effectively overcome the magnetic saturation effect and infer the strong
magnetic region much better than the linear calibration method. The residual
errors of test samples to standard data are mostly about 50 G for both the
longitudinal and transverse magnetic flux density. The values are about 100 G
with our previous method of multilayer perceptron, indicating that the new

optimization problem in a frequency division duplexing system. The base station

coefficients, quantizes the gain and the direction of the estimated channel and
sends them back to the BS. Suppose that the channel state information at the
transmitter is imperfectly known mainly due to the channel direction
quantization errors, channel estimation errors and outdated channel effects.
The actual channel is modeled as in an uncertainty set composed of two
inequality homogeneous and one equality inhomogeneous quadratic constraints, in
order to account for the aforementioned errors and effects. Then the transmit
power minimization problem is formulated subject to robust
signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio constraints. Each robust constraint is
transformed equivalently into a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI) constraint
with respect to the beamforming vectors. The transformation is accomplished by
an equivalent phase rotation process and the strong duality result for a
quadratically constrained quadratic program. The minimization problem is
accordingly turned into a QMI problem, and the problem is solved by a
restricted linear matrix inequality relaxation with additional valid convex
constraints. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed method, and show the efficiency of the restricted relaxation.

category of object shapes. For example, we may have the common knowledge that a
plane has wings, and a chair has legs. Given the large shape variations among
different instances of a same category, we are formally interested in
developing a quantity defined for individual points on a continuous object
surface; the quantity specifies how individual surface points contribute to the
formation of the shape as the category. We term such a quantity as
category-level shape saliency or shape saliency for short. Technically, we
propose to learn saliency maps for shape instances of a same category from a
deep implicit surface network; sensible saliency scores for sampled points in
the implicit surface field are predicted by constraining the capacity of input
latent code. We also enhance the saliency prediction with an additional loss of
contrastive training. We expect such learned surface maps of shape saliency to
have the properties of smoothness, symmetry, and semantic representativeness.
We verify these properties by comparing our method with alternative ways of
saliency computation. Notably, we show that by leveraging the learned shape
saliency, we are able to reconstruct either category-salient or
instance-specific parts of object surfaces; semantic representativeness of the
learned saliency is also reflected in its efficacy to guide the selection of
surface points for better point cloud classification.

high-dimensional feature into groups of low-dimensional features and captures
the inter-group dependency. A separation module with a significantly smaller

containing a context encoder and a context decoder, is designed as a learnable
downsampling and upsampling module to decrease the length of a sequential
feature processed by the separation module. The combination of the group
communication and the context codec modules is referred to as the GC3 design.
Experimental results show that applying GC3 on multiple network architectures
for speech separation can achieve on-par or better performance with as small as
2.5% model size and 17.6% model complexity, respectively.

signals from decaying particles that convert directly into photons at different
epochs during cosmic history, focusing on injection energies
$E_\mathrm{inj}\lesssim 20\,\mathrm{keV}$. We deliver a comprehensive library
of SD solutions that can be used to study a wide range of particle physics
scenarios. We use {\tt CosmoTherm} to compute the SD signals, including effects
on the ionization history and opacities of the Universe. We also consider the
effect of blackbody-induced stimulated decay, which can modify the injection
history significantly. Then, we use data from COBE/FIRAS and EDGES to constrain
the properties of the decaying particles. We explore scenarios where these
provide a dark matter (DM) candidate or constitute only a small fraction of DM.
We complement the SD constraints with CMB anisotropy constraints, highlighting
new effects from injections at very-low photon energies ($h\nu\lesssim
10^{-4}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our model-independent constraints exhibit rich

on axions and axion-like particles that convert directly into two photons,
revising existing SD constraints in the literature. Our limits are competitive
with other constraints for axion masses $m_a c^2\gtrsim 27\,\mathrm{eV}$ and we
find that simple estimates based on the overall energetics are generally

privacy concerns. This paper aims to tackle a realistic setting with only a
classification model available trained over, instead of accessing to, the
source data. To effectively utilize the source model for adaptation, we propose
a novel approach called Source HypOthesis Transfer (SHOT), which learns the
feature extraction module for the target domain by fitting the target data
features to the frozen source classification module (representing
classification hypothesis). Specifically, SHOT exploits both information
maximization and self-supervised learning for the feature extraction module
learning to ensure the target features are implicitly aligned with the features
of unseen source data via the same hypothesis. Furthermore, we propose a new
labeling transfer strategy, which separates the target data into two splits
based on the confidence of predictions (labeling information), and then employ
semi-supervised learning to improve the accuracy of less-confident predictions
in the target domain. We denote labeling transfer as SHOT++ if the predictions

information from numerous chat messages. Unlike conventional documents, chat
logs usually have fragmented and evolving topics. In addition, these logs
contain a quantity of elliptical and interrogative sentences, which make the
chat summarization highly context dependent. In this work, we propose a novel
unsupervised framework called RankAE to perform chat summarization without
employing manually labeled data. RankAE consists of a topic-oriented ranking
strategy that selects topic utterances according to centrality and diversity
simultaneously, as well as a denoising auto-encoder that is carefully designed
to generate succinct but context-informative summaries based on the selected
utterances. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect a large-scale dataset
of chat logs from a customer service environment and build an annotated set
only for model evaluation. Experimental results show that RankAE significantly
outperforms other unsupervised methods and is able to generate high-quality
summaries in terms of relevance and topic coverage.

that the power-law slope of GPs (with fluence $\geq$130 Jy ms) is
$2.85\pm0.10$. The energy distribution of FRB 121102 can be well fitted by a
smooth broken power-law function. For the bursts of FRB 121102 above the break

blinks, lip synchronization and movements of various facial action units along
with temporal smoothness. Synthesizing highly expressive facial videos from the

adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal adaptive
normalization(MAN) based architecture to synthesize a talking person video of
arbitrary length using as input: an audio signal and a single image of a
person. The architecture uses the multi-modal adaptive normalization, keypoint
heatmap predictor, optical flow predictor and class activation map[58] based
layers to learn movements of expressive facial components and hence generates a
highly expressive talking-head video of the given person. The multi-modal
adaptive normalization uses the various features of audio and video such as Mel
spectrogram, pitch, energy from audio signals and predicted keypoint
heatmap/optical flow and a single image to learn the respective affine
parameters to generate highly expressive video. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates superior performance of the proposed method as compared to
Realistic Speech-Driven Facial Animation with GANs(RSDGAN) [53], Speech2Vid

A large
part of the wind energy cost is due to the cost of maintaining the wind power
equipment. To further reduce the maintenance cost, one can improve the design
of the wind turbine components. One can also reduce the maintenance costs by
optimal scheduling of the component replacements. The latter task is the main
motivation for this paper.
  When a wind turbine component fails to function, it might need to be replaced
under less than ideal circumstances. This is known as corrective maintenance.
To minimize the unnecessary costs, a more active maintenance policy based on
the life expectancy of the key components is preferred. Optimal scheduling of
preventive maintenance activities requires advanced mathematical modeling.
  In this paper, an optimization model is developed using the renewal-reward
theorem. In the multi-component setting, our approach involves a new idea of
virtual maintenance which allows us to treat each replacement event as a
renewal event even if some components are not replaced by new ones.
  The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to a four-component model of a
wind turbine and the optimal maintenance plans are computed for various initial
conditions. The modeling results showed clearly the benefit of PM planning
compared to pure CM strategy (about 8.5% lower maintenance cost). When we
compare it with another state-of-art optimization model, it shows similar
scheduling with a much faster CPU time. The comparison demonstrated that our
model is both fast and accurate.

cluster with stars count ratio of 24:13 for BHB1 and BHB2. The effective
temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$) of BHB1 and BHB2 were derived using

age BaSTI-IAC isochrones on optical and UV-optical CMDs.

community that a final solution is selected by a decision maker from a
non-dominated solution set obtained by an EMO algorithm. The number of
solutions to be presented to the decision maker can be totally different. In
some cases, the decision maker may want to examine only a few representative
solutions from which a final solution is selected. In other cases, a large
number of non-dominated solutions may be needed to visualize the Pareto front.
In this paper, we suggest the use of a general EMO framework with three
solution sets to handle various situations with respect to the required number
of solutions. The three solution sets are the main population of an EMO
algorithm, an external archive to store promising solutions, and a final
solution set which is presented to the decision maker. The final solution set
is selected from the archive. Thus the population size and the archive size can
be arbitrarily specified as long as the archive size is not smaller than the
required number of solutions. The final population is not necessarily to be a
good solution set since it is not presented to the decision maker. Through
computational experiments, we show the advantages of this framework over the
standard final population and final archive frameworks. We also discuss how to
select a final solution set and how to explain the reason for the selection,
which is the first attempt towards an explainable EMO framework.

last few years. For practical reasons, their applications have focused on
transforming narrowly scoped use-cases in isolation. This has led to a
proliferation of niche, isolated networks that are quickly becoming data and
value silos. To increase value across the broader ecosystem, these networks
must seamlessly integrate with existing systems and interoperate with one
another. A fundamental requirement for enabling crosschain communication is the
ability to prove the validity of the internal state of a ledger to an external
party. However, due to the closed nature of permissioned ledgers, their
internal state is opaque to an external observer. This makes consuming and
verifying states from these networks a non-trivial problem.
  This paper addresses this fundamental requirement for state sharing across
permissioned ledgers. In particular, we address two key problems for external
clients: (i) assurances on the validity of state in a permissioned ledger and
(ii) the ability to reason about the currency of state. We assume an
adversarial model where the members of the committee managing the permissioned
ledger can be malicious in the absence of detectability and accountability. We
present a formalization of the problem for state sharing and examine its
security properties under different adversarial conditions. We propose the
design of a protocol that uses a secure public ledger for providing guarantees
on safety and the ability to reason about time, with at least one honest member
in the committee. We then provide a formal security analysis of our design and

sub-graph isomorphism when each set is described by a weighted graph. Spectral
graph theory can be used to map these graphs onto lower dimensional spaces and
match shapes by aligning their embeddings in virtue of their invariance to
change of pose. Classical graph isomorphism schemes relying on the ordering of
the eigenvalues to align the eigenspaces fail when handling large data-sets or
noisy data. We derive a new formulation that finds the best alignment between
two congruent $K$-dimensional sets of points by selecting the best subset of
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian matrix. The selection is done by matching
eigenfunction signatures built with histograms, and the retained set provides a
smart initialization for the alignment problem with a considerable impact on
the overall performance. Dense shape matching casted into graph matching
reduces then, to point registration of embeddings under orthogonal
transformations; the registration is solved using the framework of unsupervised
clustering and the EM algorithm. Maximal subset matching of non identical
shapes is handled by defining an appropriate outlier class. Experimental
results on challenging examples show how the algorithm naturally treats changes
of topology, shape variations and different sampling densities.

species. Here we explore the practical impact of kernelization (i.e. data
reduction) on the NP-hard problem of computing the TBR distance between two
unrooted binary phylogenetic trees. This problem is better-known in the
literature as the maximum agreement forest problem, where the goal is to
partition the two trees into a minimum number of common, non-overlapping
subtrees. We have implemented two well-known reduction rules, the subtree and
chain reduction, and five more recent, theoretically stronger reduction rules,
and compare the reduction achieved with and without the stronger rules. We find
that the new rules yield smaller reduced instances and thus have clear
practical added value. In many cases they also cause the TBR distance to
decrease in a controlled fashion. Next, we compare the achieved reduction to
the known worst-case theoretical bounds of 15k-9 and 11k-9 respectively, on the
number of leaves of the two reduced trees, where k is the TBR distance,
observing in both cases a far larger reduction in practice. As a by-product of
our experimental framework we obtain a number of new insights into the actual
computation of TBR distance. We find, for example, that very strong lower
bounds on TBR distance can be obtained efficiently by randomly sampling certain
carefully constructed partitions of the leaf labels, and identify instances
which seem particularly challenging to solve exactly. The reduction rules have
been implemented within our new solver Tubro which combines kernelization with
an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach. Tubro also incorporates a number
of additional features, such as a cluster reduction and a practical
upper-bounding heuristic, and it can leverage combinatorial insights emerging
from the proofs of correctness of the reduction rules to simplify the ILP.

D 103, 104008 (2021)","10.1103/PhysRevD.103.104008",,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the Einstein-Cartan framework the torsion-free conditions arise within the
Hamiltonian treatment as second-class constraints. The standard strategy is to
solve these constraints, eliminating the torsion from the classical theory,
before quantization. Here we advocate leaving the torsion inside the other
constraints before quantization, leading at first to wave functions that can be
called ``kinematical'' with regards to the torsion, but not the other
constraints. The torsion-free condition can then be imposed as a condition upon
the physical wave packets one constructs, satisfying the usual uncertainty
relations, and so with room for quantum fluctuations in the torsion. This
alternative strategy has the surprising effect of clarifying the sense in which
the wave functions solving an explicitly real theory are ``delta-function
normalizable''. Such solutions with zero (or any fixed) torsion, should be
interpreted as plane waves in torsion space. Properly constructed wave packets
are therefore normalizable in the standard sense. Given that they are canonical
duals, this statement applies equally well to the Chern-Simons state
(connection representation) and the Hartle-Hawking wave function (metric
representation). We show how, when torsion is taken into account, the
Hartle-Hawking wave function is replaced by a Gauss-Airy function, with finite
norm, which we call the Hartle-Hawking beam. The Chern-Simons state, instead,
becomes a packet with a Gaussian probability distribution in connection space.
We conclude the paper with two sections explaining how to generalize these
results beyond minisuperspace.

very high-precision measurements. There can exist a number of obscure forces
that can interfere with the atoms used in this instrument. In the present work,
we are probing possible roles of one such important forces, known as
``blackbody friction force (BBFF)'', that may affect the precisions in the
measurements made using atom interferometers based on the Rb and Cs atoms. The
BBFF can be generated on atoms due to the black-body radiations emitted by the
stray electromagnetic fields present in the experimental set-up and other
metallic shielding. The strength of the BBFF can be calculated by integrating
the complex parts of the dynamic polarizabilities of atoms, which show varying
behaviour at the resonant and non-resonant transitions in the above atoms. Our
analyses suggest that the off-resonant atomic transitions make significant
contributions to the BBFF at low temperatures in the Rb and Cs atom
interferometers. Present study also advocates that it is imperative to carry
out the integration over a wide spectrum of frequencies for correct evaluation
of the BBFF; specially at higher temperatures.

extremely sensitive to outliers. In fact, a single adversarially-picked outlier

propose an outlier-robust formulation of OT. Our formulation is convex but
challenging to scale at a first glance. Our main contribution is deriving an

information that is relevant for predicting the target random variable from the
source random variable, which is typically implemented by optimizing the IB
Lagrangian that balances the compression and prediction terms. However, the IB
Lagrangian is hard to optimize, and multiple trials for tuning values of
Lagrangian multiplier are required. Moreover, we show that the prediction
performance strictly decreases as the compression gets stronger during
optimizing the IB Lagrangian. In this paper, we implement the IB method from
the perspective of supervised disentangling. Specifically, we introduce
Disentangled Information Bottleneck (DisenIB) that is consistent on compressing
source maximally without target prediction performance loss (maximum
compression). Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that our method
is consistent on maximum compression, and performs well in terms of
generalization, robustness to adversarial attack, out-of-distribution
detection, and supervised disentangling.

blind narrow-band Halpha+[NII] imaging survey of the Virgo cluster. The deep
narrow-band (NB) image reveals a very pertubed ionised gas distribution,
characterised by a prominent banana-shaped structure in the front of the galaxy
formed of giant HII regions crossing the stellar disc, with star forming
structures at ~8 kpc from the edges of the stellar disc, detected also in a
deep FUV ASTROSAT/UVIT image. This particular morphology indicates that the
galaxy is undergoing an almost edge-on ram pressure stripping event. The NB
image also shows that the star formation activity is totally quenched in the
leading edge of the disc, where the gas has been removed during the
interaction. The SED fitting analysis indicates that this quenching episode is
very recent (~50 Myr), and roughly corresponds to an increase of the star
formation activity in the inner regions with respect to what expected for
secular evolution. The analysis of these data, whose angular resolution allows
the study of the induced effects of the perturbation down to the scale of
individual HII regions, also suggests that the increase of the star formation
activity is due to the compression of the gas along the stellar disc of the
galaxy, which is able to increase its mean electron density and boost the star
formation process producing bright HII regions. The hydrodynamic interaction
has deeply perturbed the velocity field of the ionised gas component while
leaving unaffected that of the stellar disc. The comparison of the data with
hydrodynamic simulations accounting for the different gas phases (atomic,
molecular, ionised) consistently indicates that the perturbing event is very
recent, once again confirming that ram pressure stripping is a violent
phenomenon able to perturb on short timescales the evolution of galaxies in
rich environments.

magnitude-only Fourier measurements, and underlies numerous imaging modalities,
such as Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI). A variant of this setup, known as
holography, includes a reference object that is placed adjacent to the specimen
of interest before measurements are collected. The resulting inverse problem,
known as holographic phase retrieval, is well-known to have improved problem
conditioning relative to the original. This innovation, i.e. Holographic CDI,
becomes crucial at the nanoscale, where imaging specimens such as viruses,
proteins, and crystals require low-photon measurements. This data is highly
corrupted by Poisson shot noise, and often lacks low-frequency content as well.
In this work, we introduce a dataset-free deep learning framework for
holographic phase retrieval adapted to these challenges. The key ingredients of
our approach are the explicit and flexible incorporation of the physical
forward model into an automatic differentiation procedure, the Poisson
log-likelihood objective function, and an optional untrained deep image prior.
We perform extensive evaluation under realistic conditions. Compared to
competing classical methods, our method recovers signal from higher noise
levels and is more resilient to suboptimal reference design, as well as to
large missing regions of low frequencies in the observations. Finally, we show
that these properties carry over to experimental data acquired on optical
wavelengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider a
dataset-free machine learning approach for holographic phase retrieval.

unlabelled speech is the only available resource, some of the best AWE
approaches rely on weak top-down constraints in the form of automatically
discovered word-like segments. Rather than learning embeddings at the segment
level, another line of zero-resource research has looked at representation
learning at the short-time frame level. Recent approaches include
self-supervised predictive coding and correspondence autoencoder (CAE) models.
In this paper we consider whether these frame-level features are beneficial
when used as inputs for training to an unsupervised AWE model. We compare
frame-level features from contrastive predictive coding (CPC), autoregressive
predictive coding and a CAE to conventional MFCCs. These are used as inputs to
a recurrent CAE-based AWE model. In a word discrimination task on English and

improvement over uniform signaling. It was recently discovered that long blocks
are not required to achieve maximum shaping gain when transmitting over the
nonlinear fiber channel because short-length PCS effectively mitigates fiber
nonlinear interference (NLI). The reason for this behavior is that short-length
PCS implicitly induces some temporal properties in the shaped transmit sequence
that are beneficial for the fiber-optic channel. To achieve robust data-aided
digital signal processing of high-order QAM, periodic quaternary phase shift
keying pilots are typically inserted into the high-order QAM transmit sequence.
In this work, we investigate in simulations the effect of such pilot-aided
signaling on NLI mitigation. Albeit modifying the temporal properties of the
shaped transmit sequence, a pilot rate of 1/32 is found to not alter the
beneficial effects of short-length PCS. The operation meaning of this finding
is that even with pilot-aided signaling, long PCS block lengths are not

theory of some unknown UV-complete theory of gravity. Using the spin-2 ghost
pathology that occurs in Quadratic Gravity, we derive maximum value for the
classical cut-off of the low energy effective field theory in various
configurations. We then add on higher order, bottom-up, effective terms. At
each order we allow the introduction of non-minimally coupled scalar field
terms, and we calculate the vacuum expectation value of the theory under an
assumed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking of the scalar field. This symmetry
breaking leads us to introduce a constant in the action which is required to
ensure that the physical spin-2 degree of freedom is massless in the flat space
approximation, an implicit assumption we make throughout the work. We then
consider the case in which we do not fine tune the introduced constant, which
leads to an (Anti-)de Sitter solution about which we can then expand. The sign
of the chosen cosmological constant is the major factor in determining whether
the geometry is de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter. Then expanding about this geometry
allows us to increase the theoretical classical cut-off as compared to the flat
space case by an amount that is proportional to the free cosmological constant
parameter.

speeds equal to that needed to reach a height of one grain diameter, as people
widely accepted, but with much smaller angles toward the bed surface and much
larger velocities. The entrainment rate does not exhibit a quadratic dependence
with the shear velocity, but a nearly linear one, because the velocity of
entrained particle increases linearly with shear velocity. Moreover,
inter-particle cohesion increases the fluid entrainment threshold
significantly, but has no effect on the entrainment rate, as well as the
take-off velocity and angle distributions of entrained particles, because the

contraction to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
However, it was early abandoned in favour of SR due to the apparent arbitrary
introduction of the Lorentz factor. The aether has thereafter been assumed not
to exist as it is seemingly undetectable and not needed for the SR. In this
discussion paper it is argued that this reasoning to reject the aether is
unfounded since the Lorentz factor also appears as an increased resistance term
in fluid dynamics when the speed of sound is approached. This means that, for
example, particle accelerator tests of the Lorentz factor can be interpreted as
a form of detection of a fluidic aether. Furthermore, it is shown that the
mass-energy equivalence is identical to the energy for compression of a fluid

the aether not only exists but that it also is the matter all particles are

focused on the omitted information in the dialog. Enlightened by the multi-task
learning scheme, we propose a joint framework that unifies these two tasks,
sharing the same encoder to extract the common and task-invariant features with
different decoders to learn task-specific features. To better fusing

write and examine a large-scale dialog reading comprehension dataset. Extensive
experiments are conducted on this dataset, and the results show that the

inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome
requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the
implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a
ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be
accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective
mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist
and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent
training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider
practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective
mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional
variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting
surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in
both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output
diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical
motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed
CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective
mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with
known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural
language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical
surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one
mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for
graph-to-text tasks. Our code is available at github.com/QipengGuo/CycleGT

including energy storage, water purification, and adsorption of volatile
organic compounds. Most of their applications rely upon the adsorption of
molecules or ions within the interior pore volume of the carbon particles.
Understanding the behaviour and properties of adsorbate species on the
molecular level is therefore key for optimising porous carbon materials, but
this is very challenging owing to the complexity of the disordered carbon
structure and the presence of multiple phases in the system. In recent years,
NMR spectroscopy has emerged as one of the few experimental techniques that can
resolve adsorbed species from those outside the pore network. Adsorbed, or
""in-pore"" species give rise to resonances that appear at lower chemical shifts
compared to their free (or ""ex-pore"") counterparts. This shielding effect
arises primarily due to ring currents in the carbon structure in the presence
of a magnetic field, such that the observed chemical shift differences upon
adsorption are nucleus-independent to a first approximation. Theoretical
modelling has played an important role in rationalising and explaining these
experimental observations. Together, experiments and simulations have enabled a
large amount of information to be gained on the adsorption and diffusion of
adsorbed species, as well as on the structural and magnetic properties of the
porous carbon adsorbent. Here, we review the methodological developments and
applications of NMR spectroscopy and related modelling in this field, and
provide perspectives on possible future applications and research directions.

paper, we propose a Disentanglement-based Attractive Headline Generator (DAHG)
that generates headline which captures the attractive content following the
attractive style. Concretely, we first devise a disentanglement module to
divide the style and content of an attractive prototype headline into latent
spaces, with two auxiliary constraints to ensure the two spaces are indeed
disentangled. The latent content information is then used to further polish the
document representation and help capture the salient part. Finally, the
generator takes the polished document as input to generate headline under the
guidance of the attractive style. Extensive experiments on the public Kuaibao
dataset show that DAHG achieves state-of-the-art performance. Human evaluation
also demonstrates that DAHG triggers 22% more clicks than existing models.

universe. With new facilities such as JWST we may soon have the first
observations of the earliest stellar populations, but to understand these
observations we require detailed theoretical models. Here we compute a grid of
stellar evolution models using the Geneva code with the aim to improve our
understanding of the evolution of zero-metallicity stars, with particular
interest in how rotation affects surface properties, interior structure, and
metal enrichment. We produce a range of models of initial masses (Mini) from
1.7 Msun to 120 Msun, focusing on massive models of 9 Msun < Mini < 120 Msun.
Our grid includes models with and without rotation, with rotating models having
an initial velocity of 40% of the critical velocity. We find that rotation
strongly impacts the evolution of the first stars, mainly through increased
core size and stronger H-burning shells during core He-burning. Without
radiative mass loss, angular momentum builds at the surface in rotating models,
thus models of initial masses Mini > 60 Msun reach critical rotation on the
main sequence and experience mass loss. We find that rotational mixing strongly
affects metal enrichment, but does not always increase metal production as we
see at higher metallicities. This is because rotation leads to an earlier CNO
boost to the H shell during He-burning, which may hinder metal enrichment
depending on initial mass and rotational velocity. Electronic tables of this
new grid of Population III models are publicly available.

approximation (LA) is a popular tool that speeds up such computation and equips
strong model selection properties. However, when the sample size is large or
one considers many models the cost of the required optimizations becomes
impractical. ALA reduces the cost to that of solving a least-squares problem
for each model. Further, it enables efficient computation across models such as
sharing pre-computed sufficient statistics and certain operations in matrix
decompositions. We prove that in generalized (possibly non-linear) models ALA
achieves a strong form of model selection consistency for a suitably-defined
optimal model, at the same functional rates as exact computation. We consider
fixed- and high-dimensional problems, group and hierarchical constraints, and
the possibility that all models are misspecified. We also obtain ALA rates for
Gaussian regression under non-local priors, an important example where the LA
can be costly and does not consistently estimate the integrated likelihood. Our

Lie with continuous set of roots. In this paper we establish a general relation
between chain complexes and continual Lie algebras. First, by defining and
appropriate product among a chain complex spaces we endow it with the structure
of an exterior differential graded algebra $\mathcal C$. The natural
orthogonality condition with respect to a product bring about to $\mathcal C$
the structure of a graded algebra with differential relations and compatibility
conditions for elements of chain complex spaces. By considering the union of
all relations for independent elements in the tree graph structure of the

the structure of a continual Lie algebra with the root space determined by
parameters for the complex. This provides a new source of examples of continual
Lie algebras. Finally, as an example, we consider the case of \v{C}ech-de Rham
complex associated to a foliation on a smooth manifold. In a particular case of

Linux kernel (which is the kernel of the Linux operating system, as well as of
Android) and demonstrate that this PRNG is weak. The prandom PRNG is in use by
many ""consumers"" in the Linux kernel. We focused on three consumers at the
network level -- the UDP source port generation algorithm, the IPv6 flow label
generation algorithm and the IPv4 ID generation algorithm. The flawed prandom
PRNG is shared by all these consumers, which enables us to mount ""cross layer
attacks"" against the Linux kernel. In these attacks, we infer the internal
state of the prandom PRNG from one OSI layer, and use it to either predict the
values of the PRNG employed by the other OSI layer, or to correlate it to an
internal state of the PRNG inferred from the other protocol.
  Using this approach we can mount a very efficient DNS cache poisoning attack
against Linux. We collect TCP/IPv6 flow label values, or UDP source ports, or
TCP/IPv4 IP ID values, reconstruct the internal PRNG state, then predict an
outbound DNS query UDP source port, which speeds up the attack by a factor of
x3000 to x6000. This attack works remotely, but can also be mounted locally,
across Linux users and across containers, and (depending on the stub resolver)
can poison the cache with an arbitrary DNS record. Additionally, we can
identify and track Linux and Android devices -- we collect TCP/IPv6 flow label
values and/or UDP source port values and/or TCP/IPv4 ID fields, reconstruct the
PRNG internal state and correlate this new state to previously extracted PRNG
states to identify the same device.

and only becomes approximately quadratic in the vicinity of a minimum, the use
of second order information by L-BFGS can be unreliable during the initial
phase of training, i.e. when far from a minimum. Therefore, to control the

Using six discriminative modelling benchmark problems we show empirically that

time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model,
which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between
output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of
Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several
severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable
to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent
limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we
design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with
three distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism,
which achieves $O(L \log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has
comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the
self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading
layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the
generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long
time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way,
which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions.
Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer
significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the

from subgraphs with less annotated information, which is fundamentally
different from contrastive learning in other fields. However, existing GCL

apply GCL evenly to the whole graph. To remedy this issue and further improve

down to [Fe/H] ~ -3.0. In the stars where Be has been detected at this

reported. This scatter could indicate a flattening of the relation between Be
and [Fe/H]. Our aim is to perform a new investigation of Be abundances in
extremely metal-poor stars and try to clarify whether a Be abundance plateau
exists. We revisited the Be abundances in a sample of nine dwarfs with [Fe/H] ~
-3.0. Additionally, we analysed the Be lines in the spectra of stars BPS BS
16968-0061 and CD-33 1173 for the first time. We took advantage of Gaia DR2
parallaxes to refine values of the surface gravity of the stars. Abundances of
Be were determined using spectrum synthesis. Some of the stars indeed suggest a
flattening. Between [Fe/H] ~ -2.70 and -3.26, the Be abundances stay mostly
constant at log(Be/H) ~ -13.2 dex. Nevertheless, for several stars we could
only place upper limits that are below that level. Most of the sample stars are
consistent with having been formed at the progenitor of the so-called
Gaia-Enceladus merger. Two out of the three stars likely formed in-situ are the
ones that deviate the most from the linear relation. The mixed origin of these
stars offers a clue to understanding the flattening. We suggest that our
observations can be understood as a consequence of the inhomogeneous star
forming conditions in the early Galaxy. Without efficient mixing, the early ISM
would be characterised by a large scatter in Fe abundances at a given moment.
Beryllium, on the other hand, because of its origins in cosmic-ray spallation,
would have more homogeneous abundances (in a Galaxy-wide sense). We therefore
suggest that the observed flattening of the Be-versus-Fe relation reflects a
stronger scatter in the Galactic Fe abundances at a given age [abridged].

routinely interferometric images to uncover the morphological complexity of
different objects at high angular resolution. Image reconstruction is, however,
not a fully automated process. Here we focus on a specific science case, namely
the complex circumbinary environments of a subset of evolved binaries, for
which interferometric imaging provides the spatial resolution required to
resolve the immediate circumbinary environment.
  Indeed, many binaries where the main star is in the post-asymptotic giant
branch (post-AGB) phase are surrounded by circumbinary disks. Those disks were
first inferred from the infrared excess produced by dust. Snapshot
interferometric observations in the infrared confirmed disk-like morphology and
revealed high spatial complexity of the emission that the use of geometrical
models could not recover without being strongly biased. Arguably, the most
convincing proof of the disk-like shape of the circumbinary environment came
from the first interferometric image of such a system (IRAS08544-4431) using
the PIONIER instrument at the VLTI. This image was obtained using the SPARCO
image reconstruction approach that enables to subtract a model of a component
of the image and reconstruct an image of its environment only. In the case of
IRAS08544-4431, the model involved a binary and the image of the remaining
signal revealed several unexpected features. Then, a second image revealed a
different but also complex circumstellar morphology around HD101584 that was
well studied by ALMA. To exploit the VLTI imaging capability to understand

paper, we propose FedHome, a novel cloud-edge based federated learning
framework for in-home health monitoring, which learns a shared global model in
the cloud from multiple homes at the network edges and achieves data privacy
protection by keeping user data locally. To cope with the imbalanced and
non-IID distribution inherent in user's monitoring data, we design a generative
convolutional autoencoder (GCAE), which aims to achieve accurate and
personalized health monitoring by refining the model with a generated
class-balanced dataset from user's personal data. Besides, GCAE is lightweight
to transfer between the cloud and edges, which is useful to reduce the
communication cost of federated learning in FedHome. Extensive experiments
based on realistic human activity recognition data traces corroborate that
FedHome significantly outperforms existing widely-adopted methods.

  Millimeter-Wave Communications","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2010.14653",,,,"cs.NI cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the motion energy minimization problem for a robot
that uses millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications assisted by an intelligent
reflective surface (IRS). The robot must perform tasks within given deadlines
and it is subject to uplink quality of service (QoS) constraints. This problem
is crucial for fully automated factories that are governed by the binomial of
autonomous robots and new generations of mobile communications, i.e., 5G and
6G. In this new context, robot energy efficiency and communication reliability
remain fundamental problems that couple in optimizing robot trajectory and
communication QoS. More precisely, to account for the mutual dependency between
robot position and communication QoS, robot trajectory and beamforming at the
IRS and access point all need to be optimized. We present a solution that can
decouple the two problems by exploiting mm-wave channel characteristics. Then,
a closed-form solution is obtained for the beamforming optimization problem,
whereas the trajectory is optimized by a novel successive-convex
optimization-based algorithm that can deal with abrupt line-of-sight (LOS) to
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transitions. Specifically, the algorithm uses a radio
map to avoid collisions with obstacles and poorly covered areas. We prove that
the algorithm can converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions. The simulation results show a fast convergence rate of the
algorithm and a dramatic reduction of the motion energy consumption with
respect to methods that aim to find maximum-rate trajectories. Moreover, we
show that the use of passive IRSs represents a powerful solution to improve the
radio coverage and motion energy efficiency of robots.

attention due to the recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM). The
design flexibility comes, however, with the complexity of the underlying
physics. In fact, metal additive manufacturing introduces process-induced
geometrical defects that mainly result in deviations of the effective geometry
from the nominal one. This change in the final printed shape is the primary
cause of the gap between the as-designed and as-manufactured mechanical
behavior of AM products. Thus, the possibility to incorporate the precise
manufactured geometries into the computational analysis is crucial for the
quality and performance assessment of the final parts. Computed tomography (CT)
is an accurate method for the acquisition of the manufactured shape. However,
it is often not feasible to integrate the CT-based geometrical information into
the traditional computational analysis due to the complexity of the meshing
procedure for such high-resolution geometrical models and the prohibitive
numerical costs. In this work, an embedded numerical framework is applied to
efficiently simulate and compare the mechanical behavior of as-designed to
as-manufactured octet-truss lattice structures. The parts are produced using
laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Employing an immersed boundary method, namely
the Finite Cell Method (FCM), we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
first-order numerical homogenization analysis of a tensile test for a 3D
printed octet-truss structure. Numerical results based on CT scan
(as-manufactured geometry) show an excellent agreement with experimental
measurements, whereas both DNS and first-order numerical homogenization
performed directly on the 3D virtual model (as-designed geometry) of the
structure show a significant deviation from experimental data.

and transition region. While it has generally been proposed that magnetic
reconnection is responsible for this small-scale dynamism, persistent flaring
activity lasting several hours from the same spatial location on a sunspot
light bridge, has rarely been reported. We combine observations from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory to investigate homologous flaring activity over a
small sunspot light bridge in an emerging flux region. The homologous flares
all produced broad, collimated jets, including a B6.4 class flare. The jets
rise at a speed of about 200 km/s, reach projected heights of about 98 Mm, and
emerge from the same spatial location for nearly 14 hrs, after which they cease
completely. A non-linear force free extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic
field shows a low-lying flux rope connecting the light bridge to a remote
opposite-polarity network. The persistent flares occur as a result of the rapid
horizontal motion of the leading sunspot that causes the relatively vertical
magnetic fields in the adjacent umbra to reconnect with the low-lying flux rope
in the light bridge. Our results indicate that the flaring ceases once the flux
rope has lost sufficient twist through repeated reconnections.

Orbiter at a heliocentric distance of about 0.8 AU. The CME was later observed
in situ on April 20th by the Wind and BepiColombo spacecraft whilst BepiColombo
was located very close to Earth. This CME presents a good opportunity for a
triple radial alignment study, as the spacecraft were separated by less than
5$^\circ$ in longitude. The source of the CME, which was launched on April
15th, was an almost entirely isolated streamer blowout. STEREO-A observed the
event remotely from -75.1$^\circ$ longitude, which is an exceptionally well
suited viewpoint for heliospheric imaging of an Earth directed CME. The
configuration of the four spacecraft has provided an exceptionally clean link
between remote imaging and in situ observations of the CME. We have used the in
situ observations of the CME at Solar Orbiter, Wind, and BepiColombo, and the
remote observations of the CME at STEREO-A in combination with flux rope models
to determine the global shape of the CME and its evolution as it propagated
through the inner heliosphere. A clear flattening of the CME cross-section has
been observed by STEREO-A, and further confirmed by comparing profiles of the
flux rope models to the in situ data, where the distorted flux rope
cross-section qualitatively agrees most with in situ observations of the
magnetic field at Solar Orbiter. Comparing in situ observations of the magnetic
field between spacecraft, we find that the dependence of the maximum (mean)
magnetic field strength decreases with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.24 \pm
0.50}$ ($r^{-1.12 \pm 0.14}$), in disagreement with previous studies. Further
assessment of the axial and poloidal magnetic field strength dependencies
suggests that the expansion of the CME is likely neither self-similar nor
cylindrically symmetric.

drawing of an input graph $G$ and is asked to complete the drawing while
maintaining certain properties. A prominent area where such problems arise is
that of crossing minimization. For plane drawings and various relaxations of
these, there is a number of tractability as well as lower-bound results
exploring the computational complexity of crossing-sensitive drawing extension
problems. In contrast, comparatively few results are known on extension
problems for the fundamental and broad class of simple drawings, that is,
drawings in which each pair of edges intersects in at most one point. In fact,
only recently it has been shown that the extension problem of simple drawings
is NP-hard even when the task is to insert a single edge.
  In this paper we present tractability results for the crossing-sensitive
extension problem of simple drawings. In particular, we show that the problem
of inserting edges into a simple drawing is fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the number of edges to insert and an upper bound on newly
created crossings. Using the same proof techniques, we are also able to answer
several closely related variants of this problem, among others the extension
problem for $k$-plane drawings. Moreover, using a different approach, we
provide a single-exponential fixed-parameter algorithm for the case in which we
are only trying to insert a single edge into the drawing.

advances the state-of-the-art Langrangian Reachability and its associated tool

First, it uses for the first time an analytically computed metric for the
propagated ball which is proven to minimize the ball's volume. We emphasize
that the metric computation is the centerpiece of all bloating-based
techniques. Secondly, it computes the next reachset as the intersection of two
balls: one based on the Cartesian metric and the other on the new metric. While
the two metrics were previously considered opposing approaches, their joint use
considerably tightens the reachtubes. Thirdly, it avoids the ""wrapping effect""
associated with the validated integration of the center of the reachset, by
optimally absorbing the interval approximation in the radius of the next ball.
From a tool-development perspective, LRT-NG is superior to LRT in two ways.
First, it is a standalone tool that no longer relies on CAPD. This required the
implementation of the Lohner method and a Runge-Kutta time-propagation method.
Secondly, it has an improved interface, allowing the input model and initial
conditions to be provided as external input files. Our experiments on a

training and evaluation data that is often attributable to speaker differences.
Speaker adaptation techniques play a vital role to reduce the mismatch.
Model-based speaker adaptation approaches often require sufficient amounts of
target speaker data to ensure robustness. When the amount of speaker level data
is limited, speaker adaptation is prone to overfitting and poor generalization.
To address the issue, this paper proposes a full Bayesian learning based DNN
speaker adaptation framework to model speaker-dependent (SD) parameter
uncertainty given limited speaker specific adaptation data. This framework is
investigated in three forms of model based DNN adaptation techniques: Bayesian
learning of hidden unit contributions (BLHUC), Bayesian parameterized
activation functions (BPAct), and Bayesian hidden unit bias vectors (BHUB). In
the three methods, deterministic SD parameters are replaced by latent variable
posterior distributions for each speaker, whose parameters are efficiently
estimated using a variational inference based approach. Experiments conducted
on 300-hour speed perturbed Switchboard corpus trained LF-MMI TDNN/CNN-TDNN
systems suggest the proposed Bayesian adaptation approaches consistently
outperform the deterministic adaptation on the NIST Hub5'00 and RT03 evaluation
sets. When using only the first five utterances from each speaker as adaptation
data, significant word error rate reductions up to 1.4% absolute (7.2%
relative) were obtained on the CallHome subset. The efficacy of the proposed
Bayesian adaptation techniques is further demonstrated in a comparison against
the state-of-the-art performance obtained on the same task using the most

empirical advances in NLP, the large size of networks makes finetuning
difficult to deploy in multi-task, memory-constrained settings. We propose diff
pruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning
within the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as
learning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained
parameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The
diff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable
approximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning
becomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires
storing only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each
task, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.
It further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it
attractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is
unknown. We find that models finetuned with diff pruning can match the
performance of fully finetuned baselines on the GLUE benchmark while only
modifying 0.5% of the pretrained model's parameters per task.

modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. Such contacts are, however, often
plagued by strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect which reduces the tunability
of the Schottky barrier height (SBH) and degrades the performance of
2D-semiconductor-based devices. In this work, we show that monolayer
MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$ - a recently synthesized 2D material class with
exceptional mechanical and electronic properties - exhibit strongly suppressed
FLP and wide-range tunable SBH when contacted by metals. An exceptionally large
SBH slope parameter of S=0.7 is obtained, which outperform the vast majority of
other 2D semiconductors. Such surprising behavior arises from the unique
morphology of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$. The outlying Si-N layer forms a
native atomic layer that protects the semiconducting inner-core from the
perturbance of metal contacts, thus suppressing the FLP. Our findings reveal
the potential of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayers as a novel 2D
material platform for designing high-performance and energy-efficient 2D
nanodevices.

transition (MCT) of two-dimensional systems of active Brownian particles (ABP).
We specifically discuss the case of a single ABP tracer in a glass-forming
passive host suspension; a case that has recently been studied in experiments
on colloidal Janus particles. We employ event-driven Brownian dynamics (ED-BD)
computer simulations to test the ABP-MCT, and find good agreement between the
two for the MSD. The ED-BD simulation results also compare well to experimental
data, although a peculiar non-monotonic mapping of self-propulsion velocities
is required. The ABP-MCT predicts a specific self-propulsion dependence of the
Stokes-Einstein relation between the long-time diffusion coefficient and the
host-system viscosity that matches well the results from simulation. An
application of ABP-MCT within the integration-through transients (ITT)
framework to calculate the density-renormalized effective swim velocity of the
interacting ABP agrees qualitatively with the ED-BD simulation data at
densities close to the glass transition, and quantitatively for the full
density range only after the mapping of packing fractions employed for the
passive system.

human-level performance on conversational speech under relatively clean
listening conditions. In more demanding situations involving distant
microphones, overlapped speech, background noise, or natural dialogue
structures, the ASR error rate is at least an order of magnitude higher. The
visual modality of speech carries the potential to partially overcome these
challenges and contribute to the sub-tasks of speaker diarisation, voice
activity detection, and the recovery of the place of articulation, and can
compensate for up to 15dB of noise on average. This article develops AV Taris,
a fully differentiable neural network model capable of decoding audio-visual
speech in real time. We achieve this by connecting two recently proposed models
for audio-visual speech integration and online speech recognition, namely AV
Align and Taris. We evaluate AV Taris under the same conditions as AV Align and
Taris on one of the largest publicly available audio-visual speech datasets,
LRS2. Our results show that AV Taris is superior to the audio-only variant of
Taris, demonstrating the utility of the visual modality to speech recognition
within the real time decoding framework defined by Taris. Compared to an
equivalent Transformer-based AV Align model that takes advantage of full
sentences without meeting the real-time requirement, we report an absolute
degradation of approximately 3% with AV Taris. As opposed to the more popular
alternative for online speech recognition, namely the RNN Transducer, Taris
offers a greatly simplified fully differentiable training pipeline. As a
consequence, AV Taris has the potential to popularise the adoption of
Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) technology and overcome the inherent
limitations of the audio modality in less optimal listening conditions.

which turns to first-order for $h/\Gamma \to \infty$, $\Gamma$ being the
strength of the transverse field. Here we will re-examine the critical
properties along the phase transition line. During a quantum block
renormalization group calculation, the TIM fixed point for $h/\Gamma>0$ is

the energy consumption of IoT devices, the network performance suffers from
high intra-network interference in dense deployments. Contrarily, synchronous
access can improve throughput and fairness, but it requires time
synchronization. Unfortunately, maintaining synchronization over the narrowband
LPWANs wastes channel time and transmission opportunities. In this paper, we
propose the use of out-of-band time-dissemination to relatively synchronize
LoRa devices and thereby facilitate resource-efficient slotted uplink
communication. To this end, we conceptualize and analyze a co-designed
synchronization and random access mechanism that can effectively exploit
technologies providing limited time accuracy, such as FM radio data system
(FM-RDS). While considering the LoRa-specific parameters, we derive the
throughput of the proposed mechanism, compare it to a generic synchronous
random access using in-band synchronization, and design the communication
parameters under time uncertainty. We scrutinize the transmission time
uncertainty of a device by introducing a clock error model that accounts for
the errors in the synchronization source, local clock, propagation delay, and
transceiver's transmission time uncertainty. We characterize the time
uncertainty of FM-RDS with hardware measurements and perform simulations to
evaluate the proposed solution. The results, presented in terms of success
probability, throughput, and fairness for a single-cell scenario, suggest that
FM-RDS, despite its poor absolute synchronization, can be used effectively to
realize slotted LoRa communication with performance similar to that of more

effects of sparsity in linear and nonlinear optimization, which is of great
importance in many scientific areas such as image and signal processing,
medical imaging, compressed sensing, and machine learning (e.g., for the
training of neural networks). Sparsity is an important feature to ensure
robustness against noisy data, but also to find models that are interpretable
and easy to analyze due to the small number of relevant terms. It is common
practice to enforce sparsity by adding the $\ell_1$-norm as a weighted penalty
term. In order to gain a better understanding and to allow for an informed
model selection, we directly solve the corresponding multiobjective
optimization problem (MOP) that arises when we minimize the main objective and
the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. As this MOP is in general non-convex for
nonlinear objectives, the weighting method will fail to provide all optimal
compromises. To avoid this issue, we present a continuation method which is
specifically tailored to MOPs with two objective functions one of which is the

W. Zhang, V. Kirk, and J. Sneyd, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 11 (2012),
1149--1199] once suggested that the periodic waves from fold-Hopf bifurcations
in a caricature calcium model are spectrally unstable, yet without a proof.
After analyzing the linearization about periodic waves by the relatively
bounded perturbation, we prove the instability of small-amplitude periodic
waves through a perturbation of the unstable spectra for the linearizations
about the fold-Hopf equilibria. As an application, we prove the existence and
stability of small-amplitude periodic waves from fold-Hopf bifurcations in the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system with an applied current.

work due to small sample size or species identity error. In the literatures,
most richness estimators were only proposed to tackle the underestimation of
the size-limited sample. However, species identity error almost occurs in each
species survey and seriously reduces the accuracy of observed, singleton, and
doubleton richness in turns to influence the behavior of richness estimator.
Therefore, to estimate the true richness, the biased collected data due to
species identity error should be modified before processing the richness
estimation work. In the manuscript, we propose a new approach to correct the
bias of richness estimation due to species identity error. First, a species
list inventory from a subplot obtained by the investigator was used to estimate
the species identity error rate. Then, we can correct the biased observed,
singleton, and doubleton richness of the raw sampling data from the interesting
area. Finally, the richness estimators proposed in the literature could be
supplied to get the more correct estimates based on adjusted observed data. To
investigate the behavior of the proposed method, we performed simulations by
generating data sets from various species models with different species
identity error rates. For the purpose of illustration, the real data was
supplied to demonstrate our proposed approach. A presence/absence weeds species
was surveyed in the organic farmland located at Soft Bridge County in the North

simultaneously clustering data samples and fitting the models to the samples.
It often succeeds in forming clusters thanks to the geometry of the
$\ell_1$-regularizer employed therein, but there might be limitations because
of the convexity of the regularizer. This paper focuses on the cluster
structure that NL yields and reinforces it by developing a non-convex
extension, which we call Network Trimmed Lasso (NTL for short). Specifically,
we first study a sufficient condition that guarantees the recovery of the
latent cluster structure of NL on the basis of the result of Sun et al. (2021)
for Convex Clustering, which is a special case of NL for clustering. Second, we
extend NL to NTL to incorporate a cardinality (or, $\ell_0$-)constraint and
rewrite the constrained optimization problem defined with the $\ell_0$ norm, a
discontinuous function, into an equivalent unconstrained continuous
optimization problem. We develop ADMM algorithms to solve NTL and provide its
convergence results. Numerical illustrations demonstrate that the non-convex
extension provides a more clear-cut cluster structure when NL fails to form
clusters without incorporating prior knowledge of the associated parameters.

accuracy, stability, and convergence properties compare favorably with other
successful scattering methods. It is an algebraic method, which is built on the
utilization of orthogonal polynomials that satisfy three-term recursion
relations and on the manipulation of tridiagonal matrices. Recently, we
extended the method to the treatment of 1/r^2 singular short-range potentials
but confined ourselves to the sub-critical coupling regime where the coupling
parameter strength of the 1/r^2 singularity is greater than -1/8. In this work,
we expand our study to include the supercritical coupling in which the coupling
parameter strength is less than -1/8. However, to accomplish that we had to
extend the formulation of the method to objects that satisfy five-term
recursion relations and matrices that are penta-diagonal. It is remarkable that
we could develop the theory without regularization or self-adjoint extension,
which are normally needed in the treatment of such highly singular potentials.
Nonetheless, we had to pay the price by extending the formulation of the method
into this larger representation and by coping with slower than usual
convergence. In a follow-up study, we intend to apply the method to obtain
scattering information for realistic potential models.

the form $\rho_x \propto \rho_d^\alpha$, where $\rho_x$ and $\rho_d$ are the
energy densities of dark energy and dark matter components, respectively, and
$\alpha$ is a free parameter. For a dark energy equation of state parameter
$w=-1$ we found that, if $\alpha=0$, the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
recovered, where the coincidence problem is unsolved. For $0<\alpha<1$, the CP
would be alleviated and for $\alpha\sim 1$, the CP would be solved. The dark
energy component is analyzed with both $w=-1$ and $w \neq -1$. Using Supernovae
type Ia and Hubble parameter data constraints, in the case $w=-1$ we find
$\alpha=0.109^{+0.062}_{-0.072}$ at 68% C.L., and the CP is alleviated. For
$w\neq -1$, a degeneracy arises on the $w$ - $\alpha$ plane. In order to break
such degeneracy we add cosmic microwave background distance priors and baryonic
acoustic oscillations data to the constraints, yielding $\alpha=-0.075\pm
0.046$ at 68% C.L.. In this case we find that the CP is not alleviated even for
2$\sigma$ interval for $\alpha$. Furthermore, this last model is discarded
against flat $\Lambda$CDM according to BIC analysis.

that FFT nullifies the OFDM throughput on $N$ unless the $N$-point discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) problem verifies as $\Omega(N)$, which remains a
""fascinating"" open question in theoretical computer science. Also, because FFT
demands $N$ to be a power of two $2^i$ ($i>0$), the spectrum widening leads to
an exponential complexity on $i$, i.e. $O(2^ii)$. To overcome these
limitations, {\color{\corcorrecao} we consider the alternative frequency-time
transform formulation of vector OFDM (V-OFDM), in which an $N$-point FFT is
replaced by $N/L$ ($L$$>$$0$) smaller {\color{\corcorrecao}$L$-point} FFTs to
mitigate the cyclic prefix overhead of OFDM. Building on that, we replace FFT
by the straightforward DFT algorithm to release the V-OFDM parameters from
growing as powers of two and to benefit from flexible numerology (e.g., $L=3$,
$N=156$). Besides, by setting $L$ to $\Theta(1)$, the resulting solution can
run linearly on $N$ (rather than exponentially on $i$) while sustaining a non

fundamental challenge in vision and graphics research. Classical methods
consider analytic shape priors; however, their performance degraded when the

Important progress has been recently made by data-driven approaches, which
learn global and/or local models of implicit surface representations from
auxiliary sets of training shapes. Motivated from a universal phenomenon that
self-similar shape patterns of local surface patches repeat across the entire
surface of an object, we aim to push forward the data-driven strategies and
propose to learn a local implicit surface network for a shared, adaptive
modeling of the entire surface for a direct surface reconstruction from raw
point cloud; we also enhance the leveraging of surface self-similarities by
improving correlations among the optimized latent codes of individual surface
patches. Given that orientations of raw points could be unavailable or noisy,
we extend sign agnostic learning into our local implicit model, which enables
our recovery of signed implicit fields of local surfaces from the unsigned
inputs. We term our framework as Sign-Agnostic Implicit Learning of Surface
Self-Similarities (SAIL-S3). With a global post-optimization of local sign
flipping, SAIL-S3 is able to directly model raw, un-oriented point clouds and
reconstruct high-quality object surfaces. Experiments show its superiority over

Error-Correction Learning (ECL). A process of generalization underlies the
abstractions linguists operate with, and we probed whether MBL and ECL could
give rise to a type of language knowledge that resembles linguistic
abstractions. Each model was presented with a significant amount of
pre-processed speech produced by one speaker. We assessed the consistency or

environment perception. In many works, it has been observed that neural
networks can predict false positive instances with high confidence values and
true positives with low ones. Thus, it is important to accurately model the
uncertainties of neural networks in order to prevent safety issues and foster
interpretability. In applications such as automated driving, the reliability of
neural networks is of highest interest. In this paper, we present a
time-dynamic approach to model uncertainties of instance segmentation networks
and apply this to the detection of false positives as well as the estimation of
prediction quality. The availability of image sequences in online applications
allows for tracking instances over multiple frames. Based on an instances
history of shape and uncertainty information, we construct temporal
instance-wise aggregated metrics. The latter are used as input to
post-processing models that estimate the prediction quality in terms of
instance-wise intersection over union. The proposed method only requires a
readily trained neural network (that may operate on single frames) and video
sequence input. In our experiments, we further demonstrate the use of the
proposed method by replacing the traditional score value from object detection
and thereby improving the overall performance of the instance segmentation

study the filed-driven spin reversal processes on them. With the
antiferromagnetic interactions between the Ising spins attached to the nodes,
this assembly ideally supports the geometric frustration, which is recognized

changes the shape of the hysteresis loop. Meanwhile, the fluctuations in the

introduce an effective GCN module, Dilated Temporal Graph Reasoning Module

relations via constructing multi-level dilated temporal graphs where the nodes
represent frames from different moments in video. Moreover, to enhance temporal

proposed to encourage the dilated temporal graph reasoning module to find and

performing a series of conditional independence (CI) tests between observed

independence and causal relations entailed from the resulting graph, after any
iteration, is correct and becomes more informative with successive iteration.
Essentially, we tie the size of the CI condition set to its distance from the
tested nodes on the resulting graph. Each iteration refines the skeleton and
orientation by performing CI tests having condition sets that are larger than
in the preceding iteration. In an iteration, condition sets of CI tests are
constructed from nodes that are within a specified search distance, and the
sizes of these condition sets is equal to this search distance. The algorithm
then iteratively increases the search distance along with the condition set
sizes. Thus, each iteration refines a graph, that was recovered by previous
iterations having smaller condition sets -- having a higher statistical power.
We demonstrate that our algorithm requires significantly fewer CI tests and
smaller condition sets compared to the FCI algorithm. This is evident for both
recovering the true underlying graph using a perfect CI oracle, and accurately
estimating the graph using limited observed data.

molecules (H2O, CO2, N2O, CH4, O3), the possible impact of weak E2 and M1 bands
to the modeling of the Earth and planetary atmospheres has to be addressed.
This is especially important in the case of carbon dioxide for which E2 and M1
bands may be located in spectral windows of weak E1 absorption. In the present
work, a high sensitivity absorption spectrum of CO2 was recorded by optical
feedback cavity enhanced absorption Spectroscopy (OFCEAS) in the 3.3 micron
transparency window of carbon dioxide. The studied spectral interval
corresponds to the region where M1 transitions of the n2+n3 band of carbon
dioxide were recently identified in the spectrum of the Martian atmosphere.
Here, both M1 and E2 transitions of the n2+n3 band were detected by OFCEAS.
Using recent ab initio calculations of the E2 spectrum of 12C16O2, intensity
measurements of five M1 lines and three E2 lines allow us to disentangle the M1
and E2 contributions. Indeed, E2 intensity values (on the order of a few 10-29
cm per molecule) are found in reasonable agreement with ab initio calculations
while the intensity of the M1 lines (including an E2 contribution) agree very
well with recent very long path measurements by Fourier Transform spectroscopy.
We thus conclude that both E2 and M1 transitions should be systematically

a homogeneous 2SC condensate, if the dispersion relations in the absence of
color superconductivity are known. In our calculations, we employ two different
Ans\""atze for the inhomogeneous chiral condensate, the CDW as well as the
real-kink crystal (RKC). Depending on the value of the diquark coupling we find
a region of the phase diagram where the inhomogeneous chiral and the 2SC
condensates coexist, confirming results of Refs. [1, 2]. Decreasing the diquark
coupling favors the inhomogeneous phase over the coexistence phase. On the
other hand, increasing the diquark coupling leads to a larger 2SC phase, while
the inhomogeneous chiral and the coexistence phases become smaller. In
agreement with previous studies the RKC Ansatz is energetically preferred over
the CDW Ansatz. Both Ans\""atze lead to a qualitatively similar phase diagram,

contributions. First, we show that linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS),
relying on splitting unicast messages into common and private parts, encoding
the common parts together with the multicast message and linearly precoding at
the transmitter, can achieve larger rate regions than DPC-assisted NOUM with

marries RS and DPC. We show that the rate region of DPCRS-assisted NOUM is
enlarged beyond that of conventional DPC-assisted NOUM and that of linearly

applications to address the negative effects of the curse of dimensionality and
collinearity on model performance and computational complexity, to denoise the

desirable to reduce the input dimensions by choosing a subset of variables that
best represents the entire set without any a priori information available.
Unsupervised variable selection techniques provide a solution to this second
problem. An autoencoder, if properly regularized, can solve both unsupervised
dimensionality reduction and variable selection, but the training of large
neural networks can be prohibitive in time sensitive applications. We present
an approach called Recovery of Linear Components (RLC), which serves as a
middle ground between linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction
techniques, reducing autoencoder training times while enhancing performance
over purely linear techniques. With the aid of synthetic and real world case
studies, we show that the RLC, when compared with an autoencoder of similar
complexity, shows higher accuracy, similar robustness to overfitting, and
faster training times. Additionally, at the cost of a relatively small increase
in computational complexity, RLC is shown to outperform the current

The results are compared with ground truth measurements provided by a laser
tracker. Our main findings are: (1) When applying the complementary calibration
approaches in isolation, the self-contact approach yields the best and most
stable results. (2) All combinations of more than one approach were always
superior to using any single approach in terms of calibration errors and the
observability of the estimated parameters. Combining more approaches delivers
robot parameters that better generalize to the workspace parts not used for the
calibration. (3) Sequential calibration, i.e. calibrating cameras first and
then robot kinematics, is more effective than simultaneous calibration of all
parameters. In real experiments, we employ two industrial manipulators mounted
on a common base. The manipulators are equipped with force/torque sensors at
their wrists, with two cameras attached to the robot base, and with special end
effectors with fiducial markers. We collect a new comprehensive dataset for
robot kinematic calibration and make it publicly available. The dataset and its
analysis provide quantitative and qualitative insights that go beyond the
specific manipulators used in this work and apply to self-contained robot

Excitation pulses of 40 kVp X-rays were provided by a light-excited X-ray tube

times decrease by typically a factor of ten with increasing free carrier

fundamental problem in computing and optimization. In this paper, we propose a
generic successive projection (SP) framework for this problem. The SP
sequentially projects the current iterate onto the constraint set corresponding
to each nonlinear (in)equality. It extends von Neumann's alternating projection
for finding a point in the intersection of two linear subspaces, Bregman's
method for finding a common point of convex sets and the Kaczmarz method for
solving systems of linear equations to the more general case of multiple
nonlinear and nonconvex sets. The existing convergence analyses on randomized
Kaczmarz are merely applicable to linear case. There are no theoretical
convergence results of the SP for solving nonlinear equations. This paper
presents the first proof that the SP locally converges to a solution of
nonlinear equations/inequalities at a linear rate. Our work establishes the
convergence theory of the SP for the case of multiple nonlinear and nonconvex
sets. Besides cyclic and randomized projections, we devise two new greedy
projection approaches that significantly accelerate the convergence.
Furthermore, the theoretical bounds of the convergence rates are derived. We
reveal that the convergence rates are related to the Hoffman constants of the
Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear functions at the solution. Applying the SP to
solve the graph realization problem, which attracts much attention in
theoretical computer science, is discussed.

increasing power: restricted and monkey moves. When we allow both moves, we
present the first universal reconfiguration algorithm, which transforms between

strongly contrasts the analogous problem for squares, where there are rigid
examples that do not have a single pivoting move preserving connectivity. On
the other hand, if we only allow restricted moves, we prove that the
reconfiguration problem becomes PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we show that, in
contrast to hexagons, the reconfiguration problem for pivoting squares is
PSPACE-complete regardless of the set of pivoting moves allowed. In the

reviewed, paying special attention to areas of common misconception. The
micro-physics of charged particles interacting with slab turbulence are
investigated to illustrate the concept of pitch-angle scattering, where after
the distribution function and focused transport equation are introduced as
theoretical tools to describe the transport processes and it is discussed how
observable quantities can be calculated from the distribution function. In
particular, two approximations, the diffusion-advection and the telegraph
equation, are compared in simplified situations to the full solution of the
focused transport equation describing particle motion along a magnetic field
line. It is shown that these approximations are insufficient to capture the
complexity of the physical processes involved. To overcome such limitations, a

solve the focused transport equation. The use of the model is briefly discussed
and it is shown how the model can be applied to reproduce an observed solar
energetic electron event, providing insights into the acceleration and
transport processes involved. Past work and literature on the application of
these concepts are also reviewed, starting with the most basic models and

new, the advent of LPWANs has recently started changing the game. Simple,
robust, narrowband modulation schemes permit the implementation of low-cost
radio devices offering high receiver sensitivity, thus improving the overall
link budget. The several technologies belonging to the LPWAN family, including
the well-known LoRaWAN solution, provide a cost-effective answer to many
Internet-of-things (IoT) applications, requiring wireless communication capable
of supporting large networks of many devices (e.g., smart metering). Generally,
the adopted MAC strategy is based on pure ALOHA, which, among other things,
allows to minimize the traffic overhead under constrained duty cycle
limitations of the unlicensed bands. Unfortunately, ALOHA suffers from poor
scalability, rapidly collapsing in dense networks. This work investigates the
design of an improved LoRaWAN MAC scheme based on slotted ALOHA. In particular,
the required time dissemination is provided by out-of-band communications
leveraging on FM-RDS broadcasting. An experimental setup based on low-cost
hardware is used to characterize the obtainable synchronization performance and
derive a timing error model. Consequently, improvements in success probability
and energy efficiency have been validated by means of simulations in very large
networks with up to 10000 nodes. It is shown that the advantage of the proposed
scheme over conventional LoRaWAN communication is up to 100% when short update
time and large payload are required. Similar results are obtained regarding the
energy efficiency improvement, which is close to 100% for relatively short
transmission intervals and long message duration; however, due to the
additional overhead for listening to the time dissemination messages,
efficiency gain can be negative for short-duration messages fastly repeating.

fabricated at low temperatures, which makes them compatible with
back-end-of-the-line CMOS processing. For its applications, the frequency
stability of each device is crucial, in particular for synchronization of
oscillator arrays. In this work, we focus on the influence of a realistic grain
structure on the SHNO frequency stability using both measurements as well as
micromagnetic simulations. Grains in the thin ferromagnetic metal films can
influence the output characteristic of the SHNO since the exchange coupling is
reduced locally at the grain boundaries. This work provides a novel
micromagnetic simulation method, for systematic investigation of frequency
instability or variability from device-to-device. Experimentally, a
device-to-device frequency variability of ~270 MHz was found and in some
extreme cases, a double-mode oscillation was observed in the high current
operation range. This oscillation behavior was reproduced in simulations, where
the inclusion of grains resulted in a frequency variability of ~100 MHz and
double-mode oscillations for some particular configurations. The double modes
are consistent with a partial decoupling, or non-coherent operation, of two
oscillating regions located at the nano-constriction edges.

can be stacked with many hidden layers, e.g., up to 100 layers on real-world
recommendation datasets. Training such a deep network is difficult because it
can be computationally very expensive and takes much longer time, especially in
situations where there are tens of billions of user-item interactions. To deal
with such a challenge, we present StackRec, a simple, yet very effective and
efficient training framework for deep SR models by iterative layer stacking.
Specifically, we first offer an important insight that hidden layers/blocks in
a well-trained deep SR model have very similar distributions. Enlightened by
this, we propose the stacking operation on the pre-trained layers/blocks to
transfer knowledge from a shallower model to a deep model, then we perform
iterative stacking so as to yield a much deeper but easier-to-train SR model.
We validate the performance of StackRec by instantiating it with four
state-of-the-art SR models in three practical scenarios with real-world
datasets. Extensive experiments show that StackRec achieves not only comparable
performance, but also substantial acceleration in training time, compared to SR
models that are trained from scratch. Codes are available at

continuous Bose-Einstein condensation by creating a continuous-wave (CW)

is sustained by amplification through Bose-stimulated gain of atoms from a
thermal bath. By steadily replenishing this bath while achieving 1000x higher

atom lasers, atomic counterparts of CW optical lasers that have become
ubiquitous in technology and society. The coherence of such atom lasers will no
longer be fundamentally limited by the atom number in a BEC and can ultimately
reach the standard quantum limit. Our development provides a new, hitherto

  Relaxation of Barbalat's Lemma","26 pages, submitted to Automatica for possible publication",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asymptotic output stability (AOS) is an interesting property when addressing
control applications in which not all state variables are requested to converge
to the origin. AOS is often established by invoking classical tools such as
Barbashin-Krasovskii-LaSalle's invariance principle or Barbalat's lemma.
Nevertheless, none of these tools allow to predict whether the output
convergence is uniform on bounded sets of initial conditions, which may lead to
practical issues related to convergence speed and robustness. The contribution
of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a testable sufficient condition
under which this uniform convergence holds. Second, we provide an extension of
Barbalat's lemma, which relaxes the uniform continuity requirement. Both these
results are first stated in a finite-dimensional context and then extended to
infinite-dimensional systems. We provide academic examples to illustrate the
usefulness of these results and show that they can be invoked to establish
uniform AOS for systems under adaptive control.

forcing of their parameters with multiple dynamical behaviours, ranging from
seasonal cycles to chaos. Seasonal forcing is predominantly modelled as a sine
wave but the transition between seasons is often more sudden. Some studies
mentioned the robustness of their results to the shape of the forcing signal,
without detailed analyses. Therefore, whether and how the shape of seasonal
forcing affects the dynamics of coupled dynamical systems remains unclear,
while abrupt seasonal transitions are widespread in ecological systems. To
provide some answers, we conduct a numerical analysis of the dynamical response
of predator--prey communities to the shape of the forcing signal by exploring
the joint effect of two features of seasonal forcing: the magnitude of the
signal, which is classically the only one studied, and the shape of the signal,
abrupt or sinusoidal. We consider both linear and saturating functional
responses, and focus on seasonal forcing of the predator's discovery rate,
which fluctuates with changing environmental conditions and prey's ability to
escape predation. Our numerical results highlight that a more abrupt seasonal
forcing mostly alters the magnitude of population fluctuations and triggers
period--doubling bifurcations, as well as the emergence of chaos, at lower
forcing strength than for sine waves. Controlling the variance of the forcing
signal mitigates this trend but does not fully suppress it, which suggests that
the variance is not the only feature of the shape of seasonal forcing that acts
on community dynamics. Although theoretical studies may predict correctly the
sequence of bifurcations using sine waves as a representation of seasonality,
there is a rationale for applied studies to implement as realistic seasonal
forcing as possible to make precise predictions of community dynamics.

less stringent than the one on delay-sensitive data. Different coding schemes
are proposed, and the corresponding MG pairs for delay-sensitive and

for Wyner's two-dimensional hexagonal network with and without sectorization.
For Wyner's linear symmetric also an information-theoretic converse is
established and shown to be exact whenever the cooperation rates are
sufficiently large or the delay-sensitive MG is small or moderate. These
results show that on Wyner's symmetric linear network and for sufficiently
large cooperation rates, the largest MG for delay-sensitive data can be
achieved without penalizing the maximum sum-MG of both delay-sensitive and

only for the model with sectorization. In the model without sectorization, a
penalty in sum-MG is incurred whenever one insists on a positive

Analyzing watermark removal helps to reinforce the anti-attack techniques in an

combat this, we combine traditional watermarked image decomposition into a
two-stage generator, called Watermark-Decomposition Network (WDNet), where the
first stage predicts a rough decomposition from the whole watermarked image and
the second stage specifically centers on the watermarked area to refine the

watermarks from the images rather than simply removing them. We further show
that these separated watermarks can serve as extra nutrients for building a
larger training dataset and further improving removal performance. Besides, we
construct a large-scale dataset named CLWD, which mainly contains colored
watermarks, to fill the vacuum of colored watermark removal dataset. Extensive
experiments on the public gray-scale dataset LVW and CLWD consistently show
that the proposed WDNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in

retrieval results, which have been widely adopted as a post-processing tool for
image retrieval tasks. However, we notice one main flaw of re-ranking, i.e.,
high computational complexity, which leads to an unaffordable time cost for
real-world applications. In this paper, we revisit re-ranking and demonstrate
that re-ranking can be reformulated as a high-parallelism Graph Neural Network
(GNN) function. In particular, we divide the conventional re-ranking process
into two phases, i.e., retrieving high-quality gallery samples and updating
features. We argue that the first phase equals building the k-nearest neighbor
graph, while the second phase can be viewed as spreading the message within the
graph. In practice, GNN only needs to concern vertices with the connected
edges. Since the graph is sparse, we can efficiently update the vertex
features. On the Market-1501 dataset, we accelerate the re-ranking processing

photoexcitation can be used to generate high densities of electron-hole pairs.
Due to optical nonlinearities, which originate from Pauli blocking and
many-body effects of the excited carriers, the generated carrier density will
deviate from a linear increase in pump fluence. In this paper, we use a
theoretical approach that combines results from ab-initio electronic-state
calculations with a many-body treatment of optical excitation to describe
nonlinear absorption properties and the resulting excited carrier dynamics. We
determine the validity range of a linear approximation for the excited carrier
density vs. pump power and identify the role and magnitude of optical
nonlinearities at elevated excitation carrier densities for MoS2, MoSe2, WS2,
and WSe2 considering various excitation conditions. We find that for
above-band-gap photoexcitation, the use of a linear absorption coefficient of
the unexcited system can strongly underestimate the achievable carrier density
for a wide range of pump fluences due to many-body renormalizations of the
two-particle density-of-states.

$(16-20)$~GeV$^{-2}$ and $(4-4.8)$~GeV$^{-2}$ in the regions $ -t \la 0.5
$~GeV$^2$ and $ -t \ga 1$~GeV$^2$, respectively. We suggest a simple model of
the $pp$ elastic scattering with two types of particle exchanges: 1) when the
exchanged particle transfers the momentum $\veQ$ from a quark of the proton
$p_1$ to one quark in another proton $p_2$, producing the slope $B_1$; 2) when
the transfer occurs from two quarks in the $p_1$ to two quarks in the $p_2$,
giving the exponent with the slope $B_2$. The resulting amplitude is
proportional to the product of the form factors of two protons, depending on
$\veQ$, but with different coefficients in the cases 1) and 2). Using the only
parameter - the proton charge radius $r^2_{ch}= 0.93$~fm$^2$, one obtains $B_1
= 16$~GeV$^{-2}$,~$ B_2 = 4$~GeV$^{-2}$ with the strict value of the ratio,
$\frac{B_1}{B_2} = 4.0$, independent of $r_{ch}$. These predictions are
surprisingly close to the data both in the $pp$ and in the $\bar p p$

approaches is discussed, together with possible implications for the future

algebraic nature of the statically condensed HDG trace system makes the choice
of smoother in the system AMG part critical for the convergence and performance
of the block preconditioner. Our numerical experiments show GMRES
preconditioned by ILU(0) of overlap zero as a smoother inside system AMG
performs best in terms of robustness, time per nonlinear iteration and memory

segmenting characters in a word. Automatic spelling error detection and
context-sensitive error correction can be used to improve accuracy by
post-processing the text generated by these OCR systems. A majority of

have been context-free. In this paper, we present Vartani Spellcheck - a

distance algorithm, popularly known as Edit Distance. We use a lookup
dictionary and context-based named entity recognition (NER) for detection of
possible spelling errors in the text. Our proposed technique has been tested on
a large corpus of text generated by the widely used Tesseract OCR on the Hindi
epic Ramayana. With an accuracy of 81%, the results show a significant
improvement over some of the previously established context-sensitive error
correction mechanisms for Hindi. We also explain how Vartani Spellcheck may be
used for on-the-fly autocorrect suggestion during continuous typing in a text

fluid and solid mechanics to modeling non-Newtonian flows and in particular to
modeling the stress-driven solid-fluid transformations in flows of viscoplastic
fluids, also called yield-stress fluids. In contrast to the conventional
approaches relying on the non-linear viscosity concept of the Navier-Stokes
theory and representation of the solid state as an infinitely rigid
non-deformable solid, the solid state in our theory is deformable and the fluid
state is considered rather as a ""melted"" solid via a certain procedure of
relaxation of tangential stresses similar to Maxwell's visco-elasticity theory.
The model is formulated as a system of first-order hyperbolic partial
differential equations with possibly stiff non-linear relaxation source terms.
The computational strategy is based on a staggered semi-implicit scheme which
can be applied in particular to low-Mach number flows as usually required for
flows of non-Newtonian fluids. The applicability of the model and numerical
scheme is demonstrated on a few standard benchmark test cases such as Couette,
Hagen-Poiseuille, and lid-driven cavity flows. The numerical solution is
compared with analytical or numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes theory
with the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model for nonlinear viscosity.

high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in many

representations related to natural mouth motion. A temporal network is
subsequently finetuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data in
order to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to
low-level, manipulation-specific artefacts. Extensive experiments show that
this simple approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of

parallel-server systems such as cloud networks and data centers. A fundamental
challenge in the design of load balancing algorithms is to achieve an optimal
trade-off between delay performance and implementation overhead (e.g.
communication or memory usage). This trade-off has primarily been studied so
far from the angle of the amount of overhead required to achieve asymptotically
optimal performance, particularly vanishing delay in large-scale systems. In
contrast, in the present paper, we focus on an arbitrarily sparse communication
budget, possibly well below the minimum requirement for vanishing delay,
referred to as the hyper-scalable operating region. Furthermore, jobs may only
be admitted when a specific limit on the queue position of the job can be
guaranteed.
  The centerpiece of our analysis is a universal upper bound for the achievable
throughput of any dispatcher-driven algorithm for a given communication budget
and queue limit. We also propose a specific hyper-scalable scheme which can
operate at any given message rate and enforce any given queue limit, while
allowing the server states to be captured via a closed product-form network, in
which servers act as customers traversing various nodes. The product-form
distribution is leveraged to prove that the bound is tight and that the
proposed hyper-scalable scheme is throughput-optimal in a many-server regime
given the communication and queue limit constraints. Extensive simulation
experiments are conducted to illustrate the results.

considerable current interest. Typically, invertibility is assumed to be
non-essential for Markovianity of the open-quantum-system dynamical maps.
Nevertheless, in this paper we distinguish a class of physically important
dynamical maps (processes) for which invertibility is a necessary condition for
Markovianity. Since every quantum-state tomography directly provides
information on invertibility of the map, no optimization procedure is necessary
for determining non-Markovianity regarding the considered class of dynamical
processes. On this basis we are able to provide a systematic insight and to
distinguish mutual relations of the various approaches to quantum Markovianity.
Notably, for the processes out of the considered class of dynamical maps,
various relations are allowed between divisibility, invertibility and
Markovianity of the dynamical maps.

  Compressive Imaging",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems aim to capture high-dimensional
($\ge3$D) images in a single shot using 2D detectors. SCI devices include two
main parts: a hardware encoder and a software decoder. The hardware encoder
typically consists of an (optical) imaging system designed to capture
{compressed measurements}. The software decoder on the other hand refers to a
reconstruction algorithm that retrieves the desired high-dimensional signal
from those measurements. In this paper, using deep unfolding ideas, we propose
an SCI recovery algorithm, namely GAP-net, which unfolds the generalized
alternating projection (GAP) algorithm. At each stage, GAP-net passes its
current estimate of the desired signal through a trained convolutional neural
network (CNN). The CNN operates as a denoiser that projects the estimate back
to the desired signal space. For the GAP-net that employs trained
auto-encoder-based denoisers, we prove a probabilistic global convergence
result. Finally, we investigate the performance of GAP-net in solving video SCI
and spectral SCI problems. In both cases, GAP-net demonstrates competitive
performance on both synthetic and real data. In addition to having high
accuracy and high speed, we show that GAP-net is flexible with respect to
signal modulation implying that a trained GAP-net decoder can be applied in
different systems. Our code is at https://github.com/mengziyi64/ADMM-net.

developed an iOS app to record subjects with the frontal camera during pro- and
anti-saccade tasks. We further developed automated algorithms for measuring
saccade latency and error rate that take into account the possibility that it
might not always be possible to determine the eye movement from app-based
recordings. Results: To measure saccade latency on a tablet, we ensured that
the absolute timing error between on-screen task presentation and the camera
recording is within 5 ms. We collected over 235,000 eye movements in 80
subjects ranging in age from 20 to 92 years, with 96% of recorded eye movements
either declared good or directional errors. Our error detection code achieved a
sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.97. Confirming prior reports, we
observed a positive correlation between saccade latency and age while the
relationship between error rate and age was not significant. Finally, we
observed significant intra- and inter-subject variations in saccade latency and
error rate distributions, which highlights the importance of individualized
tracking of these visual digital biomarkers. Conclusion and Significance: Our
system and algorithms allow ubiquitous tracking of saccade latency and error
rate, which opens up the possibility of quantifying patient state on a finer
timescale in a broader population than previously possible.

interacting through classical Coulomb friction via numerical simulations. The
effect of the initial particle shape is discussed by comparing packings of
pentagons with packings of soft circular particles. We characterize the
evolution of the packing fraction, the elastic modulus, and the microstructure
(particle rearrangement, connectivity, contact force and particle stress
distributions) as a function of the applied stresses. Both systems behave
similarly; the packing fraction increases and tends asymptotically to a maximum
value $\phi_{max}$, where the bulk modulus diverges. At the microscopic scale
we show that particle rearrangements occur even beyond the jammed state, the
mean coordination increases as a square root of the packing fraction and, the
force and stress distributions become more homogeneous as the packing fraction
increases. Soft pentagons present larger particle rearrangements than circular
ones, and such behavior decreases proportionally to the friction.
Interestingly, the friction between particles also contributes to a better
homogenization of the contact force network in both systems. From the
expression of the granular stress tensor, we develop a model that describes the
compaction behavior as a function of the applied pressure, the Young modulus
and the initial shape of the particles. This model, settled on the joint
evolution of the particle connectivity and the contact stress, provides
outstanding predictions from the jamming point up to very high densities.

AMiner as the basis with an aim at linking any external experts to the

arbitrary external sources, we explore the problem of zero-shot expert linking.
In this paper, we propose CODE, which first pre-trains an expert linking model
by contrastive learning on AMiner such that it can capture the representation
and matching patterns of experts without supervised signals, then it is
fine-tuned between AMiner and external sources to enhance the models
transferability in an adversarial manner. For evaluation, we first design two
intrinsic tasks, author identification and paper clustering, to validate the
representation and matching capability endowed by contrastive learning. Then
the final external expert linking performance on two genres of external sources
also implies the superiority of the adversarial fine-tuning method.
Additionally, we show the online deployment of CODE, and continuously improve
