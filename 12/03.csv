  and Design, Vancouver, Canada",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the advancement of deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) has made
many breakthroughs in recent years and achieved superhuman performance in
various tasks such as object detection, reading comprehension, and video games.
Generative Modeling, such as various Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
models, has been applied to generate paintings and music. Research in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) also had a leap forward in 2018 since the release of
the pre-trained contextual neural language models such as BERT and recently
released GPT3. Despite the exciting AI applications aforementioned, AI is still
significantly lagging behind humans in creativity, which is often considered
the ultimate moonshot for AI. Our work is inspired by Chinese calligraphy,
which is a unique form of visual art where the character itself is an aesthetic
painting. We also draw inspirations from paintings of the Abstract
Expressionist movement in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the work by American
painter Franz Kline. In this paper, we present a creative framework based on
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language
Model to generate abstract artworks that have intrinsic meaning and aesthetic
value, which is different from the existing work, such as image captioning and
text-to-image generation, where the texts are the descriptions of the images.
In addition, we have publicly released a Chinese calligraphy image dataset and
demonstrate our framework using a prototype system and a user study.

models they use. As Machine Learning models fall under increased regulatory
scrutiny and begin to see more applications in high-stakes situations, it
becomes critical to explain our models. Piecewise Linear Neural Networks (PLNN)
with the ReLU activation function have quickly become extremely popular models
due to many appealing properties; however, they still present many challenges
in the areas of robustness and interpretation. To this end, we introduce novel
methodology toward simplification and increased interpretability of Piecewise
Linear Neural Networks for classification tasks. Our methods include the use of
a trained, deep network to produce a well-performing, single-hidden-layer
network without further stochastic training, in addition to an algorithm to
reduce flat networks to a smaller, more interpretable size with minimal loss in
performance. On these methods, we conduct preliminary studies of model
performance, as well as a case study on Wells Fargo's Home Lending dataset,
together with visual model interpretation.

the ADM mass and the Hamiltonian constraint that must be satisfied during the
spacetime dynamics. In general, both error measures converge exponentially in
all subdomains. As a useful illustration of placing more subdomains near the

(fMRI) studies, meta-analysis databases and models have become an integral part

built by automatically extracting both coordinates of reported peak activations
and term associations using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Solving term-based queries on these databases make it possible to obtain
statistical maps of the brain related to specific cognitive processes. However,
with tools like Neurosynth, only singleterm queries lead to statistically
reliable results. When solving richer queries, too few studies from the
database contribute to the statistical estimations. We design a probabilistic
domain-specific language (DSL) standing on Datalog and one of its probabilistic
extensions, CP-Logic, for expressing and solving rich logic-based queries. We
encode a CBMA database into a probabilistic program. Using the joint
distribution of its Bayesian network translation, we show that solutions of
queries on this program compute the right probability distributions of voxel
activations. We explain how recent lifted query processing algorithms make it
possible to scale to the size of large neuroimaging data, where state of the
art knowledge compilation (KC) techniques fail to solve queries fast enough for
practical applications. Finally, we introduce a method for relating studies to
terms probabilistically, leading to better solutions for conjunctive queries on
smaller databases. We demonstrate results for two-term conjunctive queries,

vortex (TGV) flow at Re=3000. A new form of the closure is proposed, in which
the PANS procedure is applied to a variant of the BHR turbulence model. The TGV
is a benchmark case for transitional flows in which the onset of turbulence is
driven by vortex-stretching and reconnection mechanisms. Since these physical
phenomena are observed in numerous flows of variable-density, this study
constitutes the first step toward extending the PANS method to such a class of
problems. We start by deriving the governing equations of the model and analyze
the selection of the parameters controlling its physical resolution, fe and fk,
through a-priori testing. Afterward, we conduct PANS computations at different
constant physical resolutions to evaluate the model's accuracy and cost
predicting the TGV flow. This is performed through simple verification and
validation exercises, and the physical and modeling interpretation of the
numerical predictions. The results confirm that PANS can efficiently (accuracy
vs. cost) predict the present flow problem. Yet, this is closely dependent on
the physical resolution of the model. Whereas high-physical resolution
(fk<0.50) computations are in good agreement with the reference DNS studies,
low-physical resolution (fk>=0.50) simulations lead to large discrepancies with
the reference data. The physical and modeling interpretation of the results
demonstrates that the origin of these distinct behaviors lies in the model's
ability to resolve the phenomena driving the onset of turbulence not amenable
to modeling by the closure. The comparison of the computations' cost indicates
that high-physical resolution PANS achieves the accuracy of DNS (fk=0.00) at a
fraction of the cost. We observe a cost reduction of one order of magnitude at
the current Re, which is expected to grow with Re.

Restricting the number of nested negations defines an infinite hierarchy; its

of a canonical scalar field, for which at early times the effective Lagrangian
of the theory becomes that of a rescaled canonical scalar field with the
Einstein-Hilbert term becoming $\sim \alpha R$, with $\alpha$ a dimensionless
constant. This rescaled Einstein-Hilbert scalar field theory at early times
alters the inflationary phenomenology of well-known scalar field models of
inflation, but more importantly, in the context of this rescaled theory, the
Swampland criteria are easily satisfied, assuming that the scalar field is
slowly rolling. We consider two models of inflation to exemplify our study, a
fibre inflation model and a model that belongs to the general class of
supergravity $\alpha$-attractor models. The inflationary phenomenology of the
models is demonstrated to be viable, and for the same set of values of the free
parameters of each model which ensure their inflationary viability, all the
known Swampland criteria are satisfied too, and we need to note that we assumed
that the first Swampland criterion is marginally satisfied by the scalar field,
so $\phi\sim M_p$ during the inflationary era. Finally, we examine the
late-time phenomenology of the fibre inflation potential in the presence of the
full $f(R)$ gravity, and we demonstrate that the resulting model produces a
viable dark energy era, which resembles the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Mater model.
Thus in the modified gravity model we present, the Universe is described by a
rescaled Einstein-Hilbert gravity at early times, hence in some sense the
modified gravity effect is minimal primordially, and the scalar field controls
mainly the dynamics with a rescaled Ricci scalar gravity. However $f(R)$
gravity dominates at late-times, where it controls the dynamics,
synergistically with the scalar field.

containing $59\,\%$ La, single-phase films were obtained at substrate
temperatures below $775^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and at oxygen partial pressures of
up to $4\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{mbar}$ due to a large homogeneity region towards

$450\,\mathrm{nm}$. DyBCO films on LMO reach
$J_\mathrm{c}=0.83\,\mathrm{MA/cm^2}$ at $77\,\mathrm{K}$ in zero applied

hematologists to analyze RBC lab results in a reduced time and cost. However,
overlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be
separated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple
classes with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging
because normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper
presents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,
specifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing
on overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates
ellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then
finds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood
smear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.
However, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was
34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of
machine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence
more challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal
with this problem. The best accuracy and F1-score were 0.921 and 0.8679,
respectively, using EfficientNet-B1 with augmentation. Experimental results
showed that the weight balancing technique with augmentation had the potential
to deal with imbalance problems by improving the F1-score on minority classes,
while data augmentation significantly improved the overall classification
performance.

scientific community due to its application in different metal-semiconductor
electronic devices and solar driven water splitting cells. Silicon, fabricated
on gold layer, is prone to gold atom diffusion at its surface. In this study,
detailed analysis of mechanical properties of gold coated silicon nanowafer is
studied by performing molecular dynamics tensile and compressive simulations.
The effects of temperature, gold coating thickness, strain rate and
crystallographic orientation of silicon on the mechanical properties are
observed for the nanowafer. It is found that both the ultimate tensile and
compressive strength show inverse relationship with temperature. The nanowafer
fails mainly by slipping along {110} plane due to excessive shear when loaded
in [100] direction while a mixed slip and crack type failure occurs for 300K.
Interesting crystallographic transformation from fcc to hcp crystal is observed
in gold layer for the highest gold layer thickness during tension. The effects
of strain rate in tension and compression is also studied. Finally, the crystal
orientation of silicon is varied and the tension-compression asymmetry inn the
gold coated silicon nanowafer is investigated. Reverse tension-compression
asymmetry is observed in case of loading along [110] crystal orientation. The
failure mechanism reveals that interesting crystal transformation of silicon
occurs during compression leading to early yielding of the material.

the brain, by combining the relationships between the current state of the
organism and the consequences of future actions? Recent work has shown that
recurrent neural networks trained on goal based tasks can develop
representations resembling those found in the brain, entorhinal cortex grid
cells, for instance. Here we explore the evolution of the dynamics of their
internal representations and compare this with experimental data. We observe
that once a recurrent network is trained to learn the structure of its
environment solely based on sensory prediction, an attractor based landscape
forms in the network's representation, which parallels hippocampal place cells
in structure and function. Next, we extend the predictive objective to include
Q-learning for a reward task, where rewarding actions are dependent on delayed
cue modulation. Mirroring experimental findings in hippocampus recordings in
rodents performing the same task, this training paradigm causes nonlocal neural
activity to sweep forward in space at decision points, anticipating the future
path to a rewarded location. Moreover, prevalent choice and cue-selective
neurons form in this network, again recapitulating experimental findings.
Together, these results indicate that combining predictive, unsupervised
learning of the structure of an environment with reinforcement learning can
help understand the formation of hippocampus-like representations containing
both spatial and task-relevant information.

carbon using the ASTE 10 m sub-mm telescope towards RCW38, the youngest super
star cluster in the Milky Way. The detected [CI] emission is compared with the
CO $J$ = 1-0 image cube presented in Fukui et al. (2016) which has an angular
resolution of 40$^{\prime \prime}$ ($\sim$ 0.33 pc). The overall distribution
of the [CI] emission in this cluster is similar to that of the $^{13}$CO
emission. The optical depth of the [CI] emission was found to be $\tau$ =
0.1-0.6, suggesting mostly optically thin emission. An empirical conversion
factor from the [CI] integrated intensity to the H$_2$ column density was
estimated as $X_{\rm [CI]}$ = 6.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$
km$^{-1}$ s (for visual extinction: $A_V$ $\le$ 10 mag) and 1.4 $\times$
10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s (for $A_V$ of 10-100 mag). The column
density ratio of the [CI] to CO ($N_{\rm [CI]}/N_{\rm CO}$) was derived as
$\sim$ 0.1 for $A_V$ of 10-100 mag, which is consistent with that of the Orion
cloud presented in Ikeda et al. (2002). However, our results cover an $A_V$
regime of up to 100 mag, which is wider than the coverage found in Orion, which
reach up to $\sim$ 60 mag. Such a high [CI]/CO ratio in a high $A_V$ region is
difficult to be explained by the plane-parallel photodissociation region (PDR)
model, which predicts that this ratio is close to 0 due to the heavy shielding
of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Our results suggest that the molecular gas
in this cluster is highly clumpy, allowing deep penetration of UV radiation
even at averaged $A_V$ values of 100 mag. Recent theoretical works have
presented models consistent with such clumped gas distribution with a sub-pc
clump size (e.g., Tachihara et al. 2018).

super-soft sources, largely detached from the rest of sources on the

  transitional millisecond pulsars to rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars","Accepted for publication on New Astronomy Reviews as invited
  contribution",,"10.1016/j.newar.2020.101544",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last 25 years, a new generation of X-ray satellites imparted a
significant leap forward in our knowledge of X-ray pulsars. The discovery of
accreting and transitional millisecond pulsars proved that disk accretion can
spin up a neutron star to a very high rotation speed. The detection of MeV-GeV
pulsed emission from a few hundreds of rotation-powered pulsars probed particle
acceleration in the outer magnetosphere, or even beyond. Also, a population of
two dozens of magnetars has emerged. INTEGRAL played a central role to achieve
these results by providing instruments with high temporal resolution up to the
hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band and a large field of view imager with good
angular resolution to spot hard X-ray transients. In this article, we review
the main contributions by INTEGRAL to our understanding of the pulsating hard
X-ray sky, such as the discovery and characterization of several accreting and
transitional millisecond pulsars, the generation of the first catalog of hard
X-ray/soft gamma-ray rotation-powered pulsars, the detection of polarization in
the hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar, and the discovery of persistent
hard X-ray emission from several magnetars.

observatory is to map hot gas structures in the universe, such as clusters and
groups of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. These deep observations of
faint diffuse sources require low background and the best possible knowledge of
that background. The WFI Background Working Group is approaching this problem
from a variety of directions. Here we present analysis of Geant4 simulations of
cosmic ray particles interacting with the structures aboard Athena, producing
signal in the WFI. We search for phenomenological correlations between these
particle tracks and detected events that would otherwise be categorized as
X-rays, and explore ways to exploit these correlations to flag or reject such
events in ground processing. In addition to reducing the Athena WFI
instrumental background, these results are applicable to understanding the
particle component in any silicon-based X-ray detector in space.

correlations of the nearby (z=0.031) blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) using data
from Mets\""{a}hovi, Swift, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, FACT and other collaborations and
instruments from November 2014 till June 2016. Mrk 421 did not show any
prominent flaring activity, but exhibited periods of historically low activity
above 1 TeV (F$_{>1\mathrm{TeV}}<$ 1.7$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$)
and in the 2-10 keV (X-ray) band (F$_{2-10 \mathrm{keV}}<$3.6$\times$10$^{-11}$
erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$), during which the Swift-BAT data suggests an additional
spectral component beyond the regular synchrotron emission. The highest flux
variability occurs in X-rays and very-high-energy (E$>$0.1 TeV) $\gamma$-rays,
which, despite the low activity, show a significant positive correlation with
no time lag. The HR$_\mathrm{keV}$ and HR$_\mathrm{TeV}$ show the
harder-when-brighter trend observed in many blazars, but the trend flattens at
the highest fluxes, which suggests a change in the processes dominating the
blazar variability. Enlarging our data set with data from years 2007 to 2014,
we measured a positive correlation between the optical and the GeV emission
over a range of about 60 days centered at time lag zero, and a positive
correlation between the optical/GeV and the radio emission over a range of
about 60 days centered at a time lag of $43^{+9}_{-6}$ days.This observation is
consistent with the radio-bright zone being located about 0.2 parsec downstream
from the optical/GeV emission regions of the jet. The flux distributions are
better described with a LogNormal function in most of the energy bands probed,
indicating that the variability in Mrk 421 is likely produced by a
multiplicative process.

input variables and the errors are autocorrelated in time. The motivation for
the research stems from modeling wind power curves. Using existing model
selection methods, like cross validation, results in model overfitting in
presence of temporal autocorrelation. This phenomenon is referred to as
temporal overfitting, which causes loss of performance while predicting
responses for a time domain different from the training time domain. We propose
a Gaussian process (GP)-based method to tackle the temporal overfitting
problem. Our model is partitioned into two parts -- a time-invariant component
and a time-varying component, each of which is modeled through a GP. We modify
the inference method to a thinning-based strategy, an idea borrowed from Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling, to overcome temporal overfitting and estimate the
time-invariant component. We extensively compare our proposed method with both
existing power curve models and available ideas for handling temporal
overfitting on real wind turbine datasets. Our approach yields significant
improvement when predicting response for a time period different from the
training time period. Supplementary material and computer code for this article
is available online.

elements of gravitational radiation physics within a simple Newtonian orbital
dynamics and the linearized gravity theory, describing the adiabatic

theoretical gravitational waveforms in practice. We next lay out the
gravitational waveforms in the post-Newtonian approximation to General

slowly evolving, spinning, nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes,
namely, post-Newtonian energy, fluxes and the (absorption-corrected) balance
equation. The post-Newtonian inspiral templates are then presented both in the

ringdown phase, we briefly survey the two families of the full waveform models

correlated pion-proton pairs from 2 billion Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} =
2.42 GeV collected with HADES. In this energy regime the population of
\Delta(1232) resonances plays an important role in the way energy is
distributed between intrinsic excitation energy and kinetic energy of the
hadrons in the fireball. The triple differential d3N/dM{\pi}pdpTdy
distributions of correlated {\pi}p pairs have been determined by subtracting
the {\pi}p combinatorial background using an iterative method. The
invariant-mass distributions in the \Delta(1232) mass region show strong
deviations from a Breit-Wigner function with vacuum width and mass. The yield
of correlated pion-proton pairs exhibits a complex isospin, rapidity and
transverse-momentum dependence. In the invariant mass range 1.1 < Minv (GeV/c2)
< 1.4, the yield is found to be similar for {\pi}+p and {\pi}-p pairs, and to
follow a power law <Apart>^{\alpha}, where <Apart> is the mean number of
participating nucleons. The exponent {\alpha} depends strongly on the pair
transverse momentum (pT) while its pT-integrated and charge-averaged value is
{\alpha} = 1.5 \pm 0.08stat \pm 0.2sys.

self-driving cars, around the globe. A critical challenge to our -- and any --
autonomous machine is accurate and efficient localization under resource
constraints, which has fueled specialized localization accelerators recently.
Prior acceleration efforts are point solutions in that they each specialize for
a specific localization algorithm. In real-world commercial deployments,
however, autonomous machines routinely operate under different environments and
no single localization algorithm fits all the environments. Simply stacking
together point solutions not only leads to cost and power budget overrun, but
also results in an overly complicated software stack.
  This paper demonstrates our new software-hardware co-designed framework for
autonomous machine localization, which adapts to different operating scenarios
by fusing fundamental algorithmic primitives. Through characterizing the
software framework, we identify ideal acceleration candidates that contribute
significantly to the end-to-end latency and/or latency variation. We show how
to co-design a hardware accelerator to systematically exploit the parallelisms,
locality, and common building blocks inherent in the localization framework. We
build, deploy, and evaluate an FPGA prototype on our next-generation
self-driving cars. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we also
instantiate another FPGA prototype targeting drones, which represent mobile
autonomous machines. We achieve about 2x speedup and 4x energy reduction
compared to widely-deployed, optimized implementations on general-purpose
platforms.

such as coupled oscillators which have recently been explored as a hardware
platform for application in computing. In this work, we experimentally
investigate the effect of noise on the synchronization of relaxation
oscillators and their computational properties. Specifically, in contrast to
its typically expected adverse effect, we first demonstrate that a common white
noise input induces global frequency synchronization among uncoupled
oscillators. Experiments show that the minimum noise voltage required to induce
synchronization increases linearly with the amplitude of the oscillator output
whereas it decreases with increasing number of oscillators. Further, our work
reveals that in a coupled system of oscillators - relevant to solving
computational problems such as graph coloring, the injection of white noise
helps reduce the minimum required capacitive coupling strength. With the
injection of noise, the coupled system demonstrates frequency synchronization
along with the desired phase-based computational properties at 5x lower
coupling strength than that required when no external noise is introduced.
Consequently, this can reduce the footprint of the coupling element and the
corresponding area-intensive coupling architecture. Our work shows that noise
can be utilized as an effective knob to optimize the implementation of coupled
oscillator-based computing platforms.

done for choosing the optimal point of grasping. An intelligent approach based

material, the material class reduces the Young's modulus to a range from 79% to
58%, but improves the uniaxial buckling strength to a range from 180% to 767%.
Based on small deformation theory, material stiffness is evaluated using the
homogenization method. Buckling strength under a given macroscopic stress state
is estimated using linear buckling analysis with Block-Floquet boundary
conditions to capture both short and long wavelength buckling modes. The 3D
isotropic single-scale materials with tunable properties are designed using
topology optimization, and are then further simplified using shape

holomorphic change of coordinates on $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that the $G$-action
becomes linear. Equivalently, is there a $G$-equivariant biholomorphism $\Phi
\colon X\to V$ where $V$ is a $G$-module? There is an intrinsic stratification
of the categorical quotient $X /\!/G$, called the Luna stratification, where
the strata are labeled by isomorphism classes of representations of reductive
subgroups of $G$. Suppose that there is a $\Phi$ as above. Then $\Phi$ induces
a biholomorphism $\phi\colon X/\!/G\to V/\!/G$ which is stratified, i.e., the
stratum of $ X/\!/G$ with a given label is sent isomorphically to the stratum
of $V/\!/G$ with the same label.
  The counterexamples to the Linearization Problem construct an action of $G$

theorem shows that, for a reductive group $G$ with $G^0=\mathbb{C}^*$, the

  Multi-Domain Learning","8 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nowadays, one practical limitation of deep neural network (DNN) is its high
degree of specialization to a single task or domain (e.g., one visual domain).
It motivates researchers to develop algorithms that can adapt DNN model to
multiple domains sequentially, while still performing well on the past domains,
which is known as multi-domain learning. Almost all conventional methods only
focus on improving accuracy with minimal parameter update, while ignoring high
computing and memory cost during training, which makes it difficult to deploy
multi-domain learning into more and more widely used resource-limited edge
devices, like mobile phones, IoT, embedded systems, etc. We observe that large
memory used for activation storage is the bottleneck that largely limits the
training time and cost on edge devices. To reduce training memory usage, while
keeping the domain adaption accuracy performance, we propose Dynamic Additive
Attention Adaption ($DA^3$), a novel memory-efficient on-device multi-domain
learning method. $DA^3$ learns a novel additive attention adaptor module, while
freezing the weights of the pre-trained backbone model for each domain.
Differentiating from prior works, such module not only mitigates activation
memory buffering for reducing memory usage during training but also serves as a
dynamic gating mechanism to reduce the computation cost for fast inference. We
validate $DA^3$ on multiple datasets against state-of-the-art methods, which
shows great improvement in both accuracy and training time. Moreover, we
deployed $DA^3$ into the popular NIVDIA Jetson Nano edge GPU, where the
measured experimental results show our proposed $DA^3$ reduces the on-device
training memory consumption by 19-37x, and training time by 2x, in comparison

Furthermore, triggered by these discrepancies we reexamine the charge asymmetry
of the top quark and its decay products in the $t\bar{t}W^\pm$ production
process. In the case of charge asymmetries, that are uniquely sensitive to the
chiral nature of possible new physics in this channel, theoretical

particular, BMS algorithm is able to solve problems of this type having large
search space at the expense of low computational cost. Notably, the traditional
DCOP formulation does not consider those constraints that must be
satisfied(also known as hard constraints), rather it concentrates only on soft

temperatures, imply the presence of ongoing heating that balances the strong
radiative and thermal conduction losses expected in the solar atmosphere. It
has been theorized for decades that the required heating mechanisms of the
chromospheric and coronal parts of the active regions, quiet-Sun, and coronal
holes are associated with the solar magnetic fields. However, the exact
physical process that transport and dissipate the magnetic energy which
ultimately leads to the solar plasma heating are not yet fully understood. The
current understanding of coronal heating relies on two main mechanism:
reconnection and MHD waves that may have various degrees of importance in
different coronal regions. In this review we focus on recent advances in our
understanding of MHD wave heating mechanisms. First, we focus on giving an
overview of observational results, where we show that different wave modes have
been discovered in the corona in the last decade, many of which are associated
with a significant energy flux, either generated in situ or pumped from the
lower solar atmosphere. Afterwards, we summarise the recent findings of
numerical modelling of waves, motivated by the observational results. Despite
the advances, only 3D MHD models with Alfv\'en wave heating in an unstructured
corona can explain the observed coronal temperatures compatible with the quiet
Sun, while 3D MHD wave heating models including cross-field density structuring
are not yet able to account for the heating of coronal loops in active regions
to their observed temperature.

of mixed reality and robotics systems. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on
local features to establish correspondences between images. In this paper, we
present three novel scenarios for localization and mapping which require the
continuous update of feature representations and the ability to match across
different feature types. While localization and mapping is a fundamental
computer vision problem, the traditional setup supposes the same local features
are used throughout the evolution of a map. Thus, whenever the underlying
features are changed, the whole process is repeated from scratch. However, this
is typically impossible in practice, because raw images are often not stored
and re-building the maps could lead to loss of the attached digital content. To
overcome the limitations of current approaches, we present the first principled
solution to cross-descriptor localization and mapping. Our data-driven approach
is agnostic to the feature descriptor type, has low computational requirements,
and scales linearly with the number of description algorithms. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on state-of-the-art

informative local signals to enhance feature learning, rather than
oversmoothing the global graph signals into just ""white noise"". We
theoretically justify why the combination of deep GNNs with shallow samplers
yields the best learning performance. We then propose various sampling

digital case, a user's actions are automatically recorded. The recording of
user's interactions presents a problem because this information can be used
outside the control of the person whom it concerns. This issue is only
exacerbated by the centralisation of these aforementioned services'

interaction between a power system and grid-connected entities, called the
followers, such as data centers. Most existing approaches assume that such
followers' response behaviors are made available to the power system in the
operation decision-making, which may be untenable in reality. This work
presents a novel idea of solving bilevel optimization problems without assuming
power systems' omniscience. The followers' responses will be represented by a
function of the power system's decisions using Gaussian Process Regression.
Then the two layers in the bilevel problem can be solved separately by the
power system and its followers. This not only avoids the omniscience
assumption, but also significantly increases the computational efficiency
without compromising accuracy, especially for the problems with a complex lower
layer. Moreover, a bilevel critical load restoration model is developed to test
the proposed technique. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed
restoration model considers the load-side operation and the varying load
marginal value, and can accurately estimate load-side loss and achieve better
restoration solutions. Two case studies validate the advantages of the proposed
approaches from different perspectives.

magnetosphere. Particles with different energies vary simultaneously at each
spacecraft, implying a non-dispersive particle response to the shock.
Spacecraft located at lower L-shells did not record any significant signatures.
The observations indicate a local time dependence of the response associated
with the shock inclination, with the clearest signatures being observed in the
dusk-midnight sector. Simulations underestimate the amplitude of the magnetic
field variations observed on the nightside. The observed decreases in the
electron intensities result from a combination of radial gradient and adiabatic
effects. The radial gradients in the spectral index appear to be the dominant
contributor to the observed variations of electrons seen on the dayside (near
noon and dusk) and on the nightside (near midnight). This study shows that even
an FRS can affect the radiation belts significantly and provides an opportunity
to understand their dynamic response to a sudden expansion of the
magnetosphere.

1D Coulomb systems. The long range nature of the inter-ion interactions comes
about due to the dielectric constants mismatch between the water and lipids,
confining the electric filed to stay mostly within the water-filled channel.
Statistical mechanics of such Coulomb systems is dominated by entropic effects
which may be accurately accounted for by mapping onto an effective quantum
mechanics. In presence of multivalent ions the corresponding quantum mechanics
appears to be non-Hermitian. In this review we discuss a framework for
semiclassical calculations for corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
Non-Hermiticity elevates WKB action integrals from the real line to closed
cycles on a complex Riemann surfaces where direct calculations are not
attainable. We circumvent this issue by applying tools from algebraic topology,
such as the Picard-Fuchs equation. We discuss how its solutions relate to the
thermodynamics and correlation functions of multivalent solutions within long

requires perception at a level of spatial detail that has not been attempted in
the action recognition literature to date. We extend the fine-grained activity
recognition setting to address the task of assembly action recognition in its
full generality by unifying assembly actions and kinematic structures within a
single framework. We use this framework to develop a general method for
recognizing assembly actions from observation sequences, along with observation
features that take advantage of a spatial assembly's special structure.
Finally, we evaluate our method empirically on two application-driven data

framewise accuracy of 70% and an average normalized edit distance of 10%. On

turbulence in the absence of a mean magnetic field. We demonstrate that such
turbulence is governed by the reconnection of magnetic structures, and not by
ideal dynamics, as has previously been assumed. We obtain predictions for the
magnetic-energy decay laws by proposing that turbulence decays on reconnection
timescales, while respecting the conservation of certain integral invariants
representing topological constraints satisfied by the reconnecting magnetic
field. As is well known, the magnetic helicity is such an invariant for
initially helical field configurations, but does not constrain non-helical
decay, where the volume-averaged magnetic-helicity density vanishes. For such a
decay, we propose a new integral invariant, analogous to the Loitsyansky and
Saffman invariants of hydrodynamic turbulence, that expresses the conservation
of the random (scaling as $\mathrm{volume}^{1/2}$) magnetic helicity contained
in any sufficiently large volume. Our treatment leads to novel predictions for
the magnetic-energy decay laws: in particular, while we expect the canonical
$t^{-2/3}$ power law for helical turbulence when reconnection is fast (i.e.,
plasmoid-dominated or stochastic), we find a shallower $t^{-4/7}$ decay in the
slow `Sweet-Parker' reconnection regime, in better agreement with existing
numerical simulations. For non-helical fields, for which there currently exists
no definitive theory, we predict power laws of $t^{-10/9}$ and $t^{-20/17}$ in
the fast- and slow-reconnection regimes, respectively. We formulate a general
principle of decay of turbulent systems subject to conservation of Saffman-like
invariants, and propose how it may be applied to MHD turbulence with a strong
mean magnetic field and to isotropic MHD turbulence with initial equipartition
between the magnetic and kinetic energies.

modular flavor structure and show a different flavor(mixing) pattern at the GUT
scale. So, in realistic modular flavor models with SUSY completion, constraints
from the collider and DM constraints can also be used to constrain the possible
values of the modulus parameter. In the first part of this work, we discuss the
possibility that the $S_3$ modular symmetry can be preserved by the fixed
points of $T^2/Z_N$ orbifold, especially from $T^2/Z_2$. To illustrate the
additional constraints from collider etc on modular flavor symmetry models, we
take the simplest UV SUSY-completion $S_3$ modular invariance SU(5) GUT model
as an example with generalized gravity mediation SUSY breaking mechanism. We
find that such constraints can indeed be useful to rule out a large portion of
the modulus parameters. Our numerical results show that the UV-completed model
can account for both the SM (plus neutrino) flavor structure and the collider,
DM constraints. Such discussions can also be applied straightforwardly to other

$2d$ systems such as the Coulomb gas, the Villain model or the integer-valued
Gaussian free field. In the case of the $2d$ Villain model, we prove that the
fluctuations induced by the vortices are at least of the same order of
magnitude as the ones produced by the spin-wave. We obtain the following
quantitative upper-bound on the two-point correlation in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ when
$\beta>1$ \[ \langle\sigma_x \sigma_y\rangle_{\beta}^{Villain} \leq C \, \left(
\frac 1 {\|x-y\|_2}\right)^{\frac 1 {2\pi \beta}\left ( 1+\beta
e^{-\frac{(2\pi)^2}{2} \beta}\right )} \] The proof is entirely
non-perturbative. Furthermore it provides a new and algorithmically efficient
way of sampling the $2d$ Coulomb gas. For the $2d$ Coulomb gas, we obtain the
following lower bound on its fluctuations at high inverse temperature \[
\mathbb{E}_\beta^{Coul}[\langle \Delta^{-1}q, g\rangle] \geq \exp(-\pi^2 \beta
+ o(\beta)) \langle g,(-\Delta)^{-1}g \rangle \] This estimate coincides with
the predictions based on a RG analysis from [JKKN77] and suggests that the
Coulomb potential $\Delta^{-1}q$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ should scale
like a Gaussian free field of inverse temperature of order $\exp(\pi^2 \beta)$.
Finally, we transfer the above vortex fluctuations via a duality identity to
the integer-valued GFF by showing that its maximum deviates in a quantitative
way from the maximum of a usual GFF. More precisely, we show that with high
probability when $\beta>1$ \[ \max_{x\in [-n,n]^2} \Psi_n(x) \leq
\sqrt{\frac{2\beta}{\pi} \big(1 - \beta e^{- \frac{(2\pi)^2\beta} {2} } \big)}

inverse temperature $\beta^{-1}$. Applications to the free-energies of the
Coulomb gas, the Villain model and the integer-valued GFF are also considered.

magnetization of the Ising model. This means the dark energy is an emergent
phenomenon and we named it critically emergent dark energy model, CEDE. In
CEDE, dark energy emerges at a transition redshift, $z_c$, corresponding to the
critical temperature in critical phenomena. Combining the Planck CMB data and
local measurement of the Hubble constant from Riess et al. (2019) we find
statistically significant support for this transition with respect to the case
of very early transition that represents effectively the cosmological constant.
This is understandable since CEDE model naturally prefers larger values of
Hubble constant consistent with local measurements. Since CEDE prefers a
non-trivial transition when we consider both high redshift Planck CMB data and

capacity at the edge of chaos, the parameter at which their behavior
transitioned from ordered to chaotic. This same concept has been applied to
reservoir computers; a number of researchers have stated that the highest
computational capacity for a reservoir computer is at the edge of chaos,
although others have suggested that this rule is not universally true. Because
many reservoir computers do not show chaotic behavior but merely become
unstable, it is felt that a more accurate term for this instability transition
is the ""edge of stability""Here I find two examples where the computational
capacity of a reservoir computer decreases as the edge of stability is
approached; in one case, because generalized synchronization breaks down, and
in the other case because the reservoir computer is a poor match to the problem
being solved. The edge of stability as an optimal operating point for a

CR propagation with constant diffusivity can make gaseous disks more stable by
increasing the midplane pressure, large-scale CR pressure gradients cannot
prevent local fragmentation when the disk is unstable. In contrast, when CR
diffusivity is suppressed in star-forming regions, the accumulation of CRs in
these regions results in strong local pressure gradients that prevent the
formation of massive gaseous clumps. As a result, the distribution of dense gas
and star formation changes qualitatively: a globally unstable gaseous disk does
not violently fragment into massive star-forming clumps but maintains a regular
grand-design spiral structure. This effect regulates star formation and disk
structure and is qualitatively different from and complementary to the global
role of CRs in vertical hydrostatic support of the gaseous disk and in driving
galactic winds.

to perform accurate radiative transfer calculations, disseminating accurate
radiative data has become almost as much a challenge as computing it.
Considering that many planetary science applications are only looking for
heating rates or mid-to-low resolution spectra, any approach enabling such
computations in an accurate and flexible way at a fraction of the computing and
storage costs is highly valuable. For many of these reasons, the correlated-k
approach has become very popular. Its major weakness has been the lack of ways
to adapt the spectral grid/resolution of precomputed k-coefficients, making it
difficult to distribute a generic database suited for many different
applications. Currently, most users still need to have access to a line-by-line
transfer code with the relevant line lists or high-resolution cross sections to
compute k-coefficient tables at the desired resolution. In this work, we
demonstrate that precomputed k-coefficients can be binned to a lower spectral
resolution without any additional assumptions, and show how this can be done in
practice. We then show that this binning procedure does not introduce any
significant loss in accuracy. Along the way, we quantify how such an approach
compares very favorably with the sampled cross section approach. This opens up
a new avenue to deliver accurate radiative transfer data by providing
mid-resolution k-coefficient tables to users who can later tailor those tables
to their needs on the fly. To help with this final step, we briefly present
Exo_k, an open-access, open-source Python library designed to handle, tailor,

universal, as argued in the literature in the last three decades. Several
relations among the low-mass end of the IMF slope and other stellar population,
photometric or kinematic parameters of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) have
been proposed, but a consolidated agreement on a factual cause of the observed
variations has not been reached yet. We investigate the relations between the
IMF and other stellar population parameters in NGC 3311, the central galaxy of
the Hydra I cluster. NGC 3311 is characterized by old and metal-rich stars,
like other massive ETGs, but has unusual increasing stellar velocity dispersion
and [$\alpha/$Fe] profiles. We use spatially resolved MUSE observations to
obtain stellar population properties using Bayesian full-spectrum fitting in
the central part of NGC 3311 to compare the IMF slope against other stellar
parameters with the goal of assessing their relations/dependencies. For NGC
3311, we unambiguously invalidate the previously observed direct correlation
between the IMF slope and the local stellar velocity dispersion, confirming
some doubts already raised in the literature. This relation may arise as a
spatial coincidence only, between the region with the largest stellar velocity
dispersion, with that where the oldest, $\textit{in situ}$ population is found
and dominates. We also show robust evidence that the proposed IMF-metallicity
relation is contaminated by the degeneracy between these two parameters. The
tightest correlations we found are those between stellar age and IMF and
between galactocentric radius and IMF. The variation of the IMF is not due to
kinematical, dynamical, or global properties in NGC 3311. We speculate that IMF
might be dwarf-dominated in the ""red-nuggets"" formed at high redshifts that
ended up being the central cores of today's giant ellipticals. [Abridged]

(log$_{10}$M$_{\rm{*}}/\rm{M}_\odot>$11.3) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.5$.
These data represent the largest sample using CO emission to trace molecular
gas in quiescent galaxies above $z>1$, achieving an average 3$\sigma$
sensitivity of M$_{\rm{H_{2}}}\sim10^{10}\rm{M}_\odot$. We detect one galaxy at
4$\sigma$ significance and place upper limits on the molecular gas reservoirs
of the other 5, finding molecular gas mass fractions
M$_{\rm{H_{2}}}$/M$_{\rm{*}}$=f$_{\rm{H_{2}}}<2-6$% (3$\sigma$ upper limits).
This is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than coeval star-forming galaxies at
similar stellar mass, and comparable to galaxies at $z=0$ with similarly low
sSFR. This indicates that their molecular gas reservoirs were rapidly and
efficiently used up or destroyed, and that gas fractions are uniformly low
($<$6%) despite the structural diversity of our sample. The implied rapid
depletion time of molecular gas (t$_{\rm{dep}}<0.6$ Gyr) disagrees with
extrapolations of empirical scaling relations to low sSFR. We find that our low
gas fractions are instead in agreement with predictions from both the recent
SIMBA cosmological simulation, and from analytical ""bathtub"" models for gas
accretion onto galaxies in massive dark matter halos
(log$_{10}M_{\rm{halo}}/\rm{M}_\odot\sim14$ at $z=0$). Such high mass halos
reach a critical mass of log$_{10}M_{\rm{halo}}/\rm{M}_\odot>12$ by $z\sim4$
that halt the accretion of baryons early in the Universe. Our data is
consistent with a simple picture where galaxies truncate accretion and then
consume the existing gas at or faster than typical main sequence rates.
Alternatively, we cannot rule out that these galaxies reside in lower mass
halos, and low gas fractions may instead reflect either stronger feedback, or
more efficient gas consumption.

one where robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured. Here we
realize a new moir\'e superconductor, mirror symmetric magic-angle twisted
trilayer graphene (MATTG) with dramatically richer tunability in electronic
structure and superconducting properties. Hall effect and quantum oscillations
measurements as a function of density and electric field allow us to determine
the system's tunable phase boundaries in the normal state. Zero magnetic field
resistivity measurements then reveal that the existence of superconductivity is
intimately connected to the broken symmetry phase emerging from two carriers
per moir\'e unit cell. Strikingly, we find that the superconducting phase gets
suppressed and bounded at the van Hove singularities (vHs) partially
surrounding the broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with
weak-coupling BCS theory. Moreover, the extensive in situ tunability of our
system allows us to achieve the ultra-strong coupling regime, characterized by
a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length reaching the average inter-particle distance
and very large $T_\mathrm{BKT}/T_{F}$ ratios in excess of 0.1, where
$T_\mathrm{BKT}$ and $T_F$ are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition

be electrically tuned close to the two-dimensional BCS-BEC crossover. Our
results establish a new generation of tunable moir\'e superconductors with the

predicts a `ramp' of increasing variance in the connected part of the spectral

dynamics of the spectral form factor is much richer, with the pure random
matrix ramp appearing only at sufficiently late time. In this article, we
present a hydrodynamic theory of the connected spectral form factor prior to
the inverse level spacing time. We start from a discussion of exact symmetries
and spectral stretching and folding. We then derive a general formula for the
spectral form factor of a system with almost-conserved sectors in terms of
return probabilities and spectral form factors within each sector. Next we
argue that the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics can be adapted from the
usual Schwinger-Keldysh contour to the periodic time setting needed for the
spectral form factor, and we show explicitly that the general formula is
recovered in the case of energy diffusion. We also initiate a study of
interaction effects in this modified hydrodynamic framework and show how the
Thouless time, defined as the time required for the spectral form factor to
approach the pure random matrix result, is controlled by the slow hydrodynamics
modes.

the crucial point of the debate is whether it is possible to conclude anything

Typically, this question has been addressed by assuming a specific physical

characterise the set of possible gravitational theories which are compatible
with the observation of entanglement has been proposed. Here, we remedy this by
introducing the framework of Generalised Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) to the

systematically study all theories compatible with the detection of entanglement
generated via the gravitational interaction between two systems. We prove a
no-go theorem stating that the following statements are incompatible: i)
gravity is able to generate entanglement; ii) gravity mediates the interaction
between the systems; iii) gravity is classical. We analyse the violation of
each condition, in particular with respect to alternative non-linear models
such as the Schr\""odinger-Newton equation and Collapse Models.

partially composite particles that obtain their masses through the inverse
seesaw mechanism. We focus on the scenario in which the strong dynamics is
approximately conformal in the ultraviolet, and the compositeness scale lies at
or below the weak scale. The small parameters in the Lagrangian necessary to
realize the observed neutrino masses can naturally arise as a consequence of
the scaling dimensions of operators in the conformal field theory. We show that
this class of models has interesting implications for a wide variety of
experiments, including colliders and beam dumps, searches for lepton flavor
violation and neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmological observations. At
colliders and beam dumps, this scenario can give rise to striking signals
involving multiple displaced vertices. The exchange of hidden sector states can
lead to observable rates for flavor violating processes such as $\mu
\rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. If the compositeness
scale lies at or below a hundred MeV, the rate for neutrinoless double beta
decay is suppressed by form factors and may be reduced by an order of magnitude

$t'=-t_{\perp}/2$ removes the nesting property of the Fermi surface and
stabilizes a paramagnetic metal phase in the weak-coupling regime. In the
isotropic and moderately anisotropic regions, a growing spin entropy in the
metal phase is quenched out at a critical interaction strength by the onset of

rise to a first-order metal-insulator transition consistent with the

studied the molecular gas and dust in the galaxy HerBS-89a, at z=2.95. High
angular resolution images reveal a partial 1.0"" diameter Einstein ring in the
dust continuum emission and the molecular emission lines of 12CO(9-8) and
H2O(2_02-1_11). We report the detection of the three fundamental transitions of
the molecular ion OH+, seen in absorption; the molecular ion CH+(1-0) seen in
absorption (and tentatively in emission); two transitions of amidogen (NH2),
seen in emission; and HCN(11-10) and/or NH(1_2-0_1) seen in absorption. The
NOEMA data are complemented with VLA data tracing the 12CO(1-0) emission line,
which provides a measurement of the total mass of molecular gas and an anchor
for a CO excitation analysis. In addition, we present HST imaging that reveals
the foreground lensing galaxy in the near-infrared. Together with data from the
GTC, we derive a photometric redshift of z(phot)~0.9 for the foreground lensing
galaxy. Modelling the lensing of HerBS-89a, we reconstruct the dust continuum
and molecular emission lines (magnified by a factor ~4-5) in the source plane.
The 12CO(9-8) and H2O emission lines have comparable spatial and kinematic
distributions; the source-plane reconstructions do not clearly distinguish
between a one-component and a two-component scenario, but the latter accounts
for the observed broad line widths. HerBS-89a is a powerful star forming galaxy
with a dust-to-gas ratio delta(GDR)~80, a SFR = 614 +/- 59 Msun/yr and a
depletion timescale tau(depl) = (3.4 +/- 1.0) 1e8 years. The OH+ and CH+
absorption lines, all have their main velocity component red-shifted by
\Delta(V)~100 km/s relative to the global CO reservoir. We argue that these
absorption lines trace a rare example of gas inflow towards the center of the
galaxy.

correlated, reflecting their deterministic nature and rendering the problem

protostars easily fragment in the accretion phase before the protostars accrete
less than a solar mass. To understand why the gravitational instability
generally causes the fragmentation so early, we develop a one-dimensional (1D)
non-steady model of the circumstellar disk that takes the mass supply from an
accretion envelope into account. We also compare the model results to a
three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation performed with a code employing the
adaptive mesh refinement. Our model shows that the self-gravitating disk,
through which the Toomre $Q$ parameter is nearly constant at $Q \sim 1$,
gradually spreads as the disk is fed by the gas infalling from the envelope. We
further find that the accretion rate onto the star is an order of magnitude
smaller than the mass supply rate onto the disk. This discrepancy makes the
disk more massive than the protostar in an early evolutionary stage. Most of
the infalling gas is used to extend the outer part of the self-gravitating disk
rather than transferred inward toward the star through the disk. We find that
similar evolution also occurs in the 3D simulation, where the disk becomes
three times more massive than the star before the first fragmentation occurs.
Our 1D disk model well explains the evolution of the disk-to-star mass ratio
observed in the simulation. We argue that the formation of such a massive disk
leads to the early disk fragmentation.

10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ have been discovered at $z \gtrsim 6$. One promising
pathway for the formation of SMBHs is through the collapse of supermassive
stars (SMSs) with masses $\sim 10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ into seed black
holes which could grow upto few times $10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ SMBHs observed
at $z\sim 7$. In this paper, we explore how SMSs with masses $\sim
10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ could be formed via gas accretion and runaway
stellar collisions in high-redshift, metal-poor nuclear star clusters (NSCs)
using idealised N-body simulations. We explore physically motivated accretion
scenarios, e.g. Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and Eddington accretion, as
well as simplified scenarios such as constant accretions. While gas is present,
the accretion timescale remains considerably shorter than the timescale for
collisions with the most massive object (MMO). However, overall the timescale
for collisions between any two stars in the cluster can become comparable or
shorter than the accretion timescale, hence collisions still play a crucial
role in determining the final mass of the SMSs. We find that the problem is
highly sensitive to the initial conditions and our assumed recipe for the
accretion, due to the highly chaotic nature of the problem. The key variables
that determine the mass growth mechanism are the mass of the MMO and the gas
reservoir that is available for the accretion. Depending on different
conditions, SMSs of masses $\sim10^{3-5} \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can form for all
three accretion scenarios considered in this work.

perturbative QCD, for the evolution of a jet in a dense quark-gluon plasma. In
the original formulation, the plasma was assumed to be homogeneous and static.
In this work, we extend our description and its Monte Carlo implementation to a
plasma obeying Bjorken longitudinal expansion. Our key observation is that the
factorisation between vacuum-like and medium-induced emissions, derived in the
static case, still holds for an expanding medium, albeit with modified rates
for medium-induced emissions and transverse momentum broadening, and with a
modified phase-space for vacuum-like emissions. We highlight a scaling relation
valid for the energy spectrum of medium-induced emissions, through which the
case of an expanding medium is mapped onto an effective static medium. We find
that scaling violations due to vacuum-like emissions and transverse momentum
broadening are numerically small. Our new predictions for the nuclear
modification factor for jets $R_{AA}$, the in-medium fragmentation functions,
and substructure distributions are very similar to our previous estimates for a
static medium, maintaining the overall good qualitative agreement with existing
LHC measurements. In the case of $R_{AA}$, we find that the agreement with the

believed to be the central engines of the luminous quasars observed at
$z\gtrsim6$, but their astrophysical origin remains elusive. The $z\gtrsim$
quasars reside in rare density peaks, which poses several challenges to uniform
hydrodynamic simulations. To investigate the formation of these distant
quasars, we perform a suite of zoom-in simulations on a favorable halo, with a
mass of $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$ at $z = 6$ and a history of multiple major
mergers, ideal for BH growth. We test BH seeds of $10 - 10^6\, M_\odot$, and
various accretion and feedback models, including thin-disk and slim-disk
accretion. We find, contrary to previous studies, that light seeds of $\lesssim
10^3\, M_\odot$ fail to grow to $10^8\, M_\odot$ by $z\sim 6$ even with
super-critical accretion; that the hyper-Eddington mode leads to lower
accretion rates than the Eddington-limited case due to stronger feedback,
resulting in significantly smaller BHs by two orders of magnitude; and that
while the super-critical model boosts the growth of low-spin BHs, for high-spin
BHs the mass may be reduced due to increased radiative feedback. Our
simulations show that the first $10^8 - 10^9\, M_\odot$ SMBHs may grow from
heavy seeds of $\gtrsim 10^4\, M_\odot$ via Eddington-limited or mild
super-critical accretion facilitated by gas-rich mergers and self-regulated by
feedback, and they co-evolve with their host galaxies, producing bright quasars
such as those at $z\sim$6 and ULAS J1342+0928, currently the most distant

standardization parameters on a set of 103 Sloan Digital Sky Survey II SNe Ia.
We investigate the influences of host stellar mass, along with both localized
($r<3$ kpc) and host-integrated average stellar ages, derived from stellar
population synthesis modeling. We find that the standardization for the
light-curve shape ($\alpha$) is correlated with host galaxy standardization
terms ($\gamma_i$) requiring simultaneous fitting. In addition, we find that
these correlations themselves are dependent on host galaxy stellar mass that
includes a shift in the color term ($\beta$) of $0.8 \mathrm{mag}$, only
significant at $1.2\sigma$ due to the small sample. We find a linear host mass
standardization term at the $3.7\sigma$ level, that by itself does not
significantly improve the precision of an individual SN Ia distance. However, a
standardization that uses both stellar mass and average local stellar age is
found to be significant at $>3\sigma$ in the two-dimensional posterior space.
In addition, the unexplained scatter of SNe Ia absolute magnitude post
standardization, is reduced from $0.122^{+0.019}_{-0.018}$ to $0.109\pm0.017$

searched for variations in the values of these physical parameters with respect
to their proximity to the spiral arms, but find no evidence for any enhancement
that might be attributable to the spiral arms. The combined results from a
number of similar studies based on different surveys indicate that, while
spiral-arm location plays a role in cloud formation and HI to H$_2$ conversion,
the subsequent star formation processes appear to depend more on local
environment effects. This leads us to conclude that the enhanced star formation
activity seen towards the spiral arms is the result of source crowding rather
than the consequence of a any physical process.

most challenging problems that the extragalactic community is already facing,
and it is expected to be even tougher in the near future with the increasing
depth of optical surveys. To address this problem, we have performed a
photometric characterization of Galactic cirri in the IAC Stripe82 Legacy
Survey using g, r, i and z SDSS bands. Through comprehensive image processing
techniques we show that, in most cases, the colors of the cirri differ
significantly from the colors of extragalactic sources. This could be a
promising way to discern extragalactic features from dust of the Milky-Way. We
suggest that the use of multi-band and ultra-deep optical photometry produced
by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be very efficient in detecting the
Galactic dust with a higher spatial resolution than those provided by far
infrared observations.

decouple the creation of a latent representation, and then privatize the data

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to create a compact latent representation of the

then train a small generative filter to perturb the latent representation based

The small filter is trained via a GAN-type robust optimization that can take
place on a distributed device such as a phone or tablet. Under special

solving many sub-tasks such as motion representation, object localization and

solutions to this task have focused on the mapping between video frames and
their low-dimensional features, while ignoring the spatial connections of those

using hard clustering techniques, such as K-Means, or applying neural networks

stage towards accurate diagnosis and severity measurement of COVID-19.
Traditional U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture and its variants suffer from
diminutions of contextual information in pooling/upsampling operations with
increased semantic gaps among encoded and decoded feature maps as well as
instigate vanishing gradient problems for its sequential gradient propagation
that result in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, operating with 3D CT-volume
poses further limitations due to the exponential increase of computational
complexity making the optimization difficult. In this paper, an automated
COVID-19 lesion segmentation scheme is proposed utilizing a highly efficient
neural network architecture, namely CovSegNet, to overcome these limitations.
Additionally, a two-phase training scheme is introduced where a deeper
2D-network is employed for generating ROI-enhanced CT-volume followed by a
shallower 3D-network for further enhancement with more contextual information
without increasing computational burden. Along with the traditional vertical
expansion of Unet, we have introduced horizontal expansion with multi-stage
encoder-decoder modules for achieving optimum performance. Additionally,
multi-scale feature maps are integrated into the scale transition process to
overcome the loss of contextual information. Moreover, a multi-scale fusion
module is introduced with a pyramid fusion scheme to reduce the semantic gaps
between subsequent encoder/decoder modules while facilitating the parallel
optimization for efficient gradient propagation. Outstanding performances have
been achieved in three publicly available datasets that largely outperform
other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed scheme can be easily extended
for achieving optimum segmentation performances in a wide variety of
applications.

(determined based on reputation), and lose less reputation when they chose to
not forward packets from non-cooperative users. Under this framework, we model
the behavior of users as an evolutionary game and provide conditions that

of much recent interest; one of our goals here is to give a survey of some of
this material, relating to groups with the same Gruenberg-Kegel graph. However,
our main aim is to prove several new results. Among them are the following.
  - There are infinitely many finite groups with the same Gruenberg-Kegel graph
as the Gruenberg-Kegel of a finite group $G$ if and only if there is a finite
group $H$ with non-trivial solvable radical such that $\Gamma(G)=\Gamma(H)$.
  - There is a function $F$ on the natural numbers with the property that if a
finite $n$-vertex graph whose vertices are labelled by pairwise distinct primes
is the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of more than $F(n)$ finite groups, then it is the
Gruenberg-Kegel graph of infinitely many finite groups. (The function we give
satisfies $F(n)=O(n^7)$, but this is probably not best possible.)
  - If a finite graph $\Gamma$ whose vertices are labelled by pairwise distinct
primes is the Gruenberg-Kegel graph of only finitely many finite groups, then
all such groups are almost simple; moreover, $\Gamma$ has at least three
pairwise non-adjacent vertices, and $2$ is non-adjacent to at least one odd
vertex.
  - Groups whose power graphs, or commuting graphs, are isomorphic have the
same Gruenberg-Kegel graph.
  - The groups ${^2}G_2(27)$ and $E_8(2)$ are uniquely determined by the
isomorphism types of their Gruenberg-Kegel graphs.
  In addition, we consider groups whose Gruenberg-Kegel graph has no edges.
These are the groups in which every element has prime power order, and have
been studied under the name \emph{EPPO groups}; completing this line of
research, we give a complete list of such groups.

systems which we have studied. These systems' light curves were derived from
observations made by the Transiting Light Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and
some ground-based telescopes. We used Exofast-v1 to model these light curves
and calculate mid-transit times. Also, we plotted TTV diagrams for them using
derived mid-transit times and those available within the literature. O-C
analysis of these timings enables us to refine the linear ephemeris of four
systems. We measured WASP-12's tidal quality factor based on adding TESS data
as Q*'=(2.13+-0.29)*10^5. According to the analysis, the orbital period of the
WASP-46 b system is increasing. The WASP-36 b and WASP-33 b systems have not
shown any obvious quadratic trend in their TTV diagrams. The increase in their
period is most likely due to inaccurate liner ephemeris that has increased over
time. So, more observations are needed to evaluate whether or not there is an
orbital decay in the WASP-36 b and WASP-33 b systems.

  converting a time-series into a weighted complex network",,,,,"physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper proposes a new method for converting a time-series into a weighted
graph (complex network), which builds on the electrostatic conceptualization
originating from physics. The proposed method conceptualizes a time-series as a
series of stationary, electrically charged particles, on which Coulomb-like
forces can be computed. This allows generating electrostatic-like graphs
associated to time-series that, additionally to the existing transformations,
can be also weighted and sometimes disconnected. Within this context, the paper
examines the structural relevance between five different types of time-series
and their associated graphs generated by the proposed algorithm and the
visibility graph, which is currently the most established algorithm in the
literature. The analysis compares the source time-series with the network-based
node-series generated by network measures that are arranged into the
node-ordering of the source time-series, in terms of linearity, chaotic
behaviour, stationarity, periodicity, and cyclical structure. It is shown that
the proposed electrostatic graph algorithm produces graphs that are more
relevant to the structure of the source time-series by introducing a
transformation that converts the time-series to graphs. This is more natural
rather than algebraic, in comparison with existing physics-defined methods. The
overall approach also suggests a methodological framework for evaluating the
structural relevance between the source time-series and their associated graphs
produced by any possible transformation.

virus, and one of the most important was to 'keep sufficient distance'. In this
period cyclists were facilitated in distancing by the widening of cycle paths,
or the use of car lanes. The Corona measures also affected intersection
control, since one of the principles of signalizing is based on clustering of
traffic. The settings of the control take into account the way cyclists tend to
cluster close together at the stop line, so for optimal control, if the
clustering changes, the control should be adapted as well. This paper presents
measures for 'Corona-safe' intersection control for cyclists, and discusses the
effect of the measures and their (dis)advantages. Further it was investigated
how some municipalities used these measures and conveyed about it in the media
and how these measures were received by the public. The measures can be divided
in two groups: detection and timing. For the municipalities considered, the
least popular measures concerned the detection methods, such as adaptations in
use, or type, of push button, since the negative aspects can be large (effect
on throughput and costs). More popular were changes in the timing of the
control, the most conveyed measures being more frequent and longer green for
cyclists. The acceptance of the measures by the public (determined via
reactions on social media) is mixed, some are positive about the improved
control, others negative (effect on car traffic or costs). The most common
reactions are general complaints about intersection control, and about cyclists
behaviour. For future use the measure 'more frequent green' is most suitable,
permitted cyclists are detected to support the acceptance of the control. Also
bicycle apps can be applied, since these results in more comfort and have
limited negative effects.

asymmetric couplings. In SIN tunneling we find that the variation of the
electrically driven interactions generally brings an increase of
quasi-particles in the gap due to orbitally polarized depaired states,
irrespective of the inter-band phase rearrangement. The peak of SIN conductance
at the gap edge varies with a trend that depends both on the strength of the

electric field does not yield the characteristic matching peak at voltages
related with the difference between the gaps of the superconducting electrodes.
This observation sets out a distinctive mark for spectroscopically

point of its objective. However, due to the inherent non-concavity of its
objective, convergence to a first-order stationary point (FOSP) can not
guarantee the policy gradient methods finding a maximal point. A FOSP can be a
minimal or even a saddle point, which is undesirable for RL. Fortunately, if
all the saddle points are \emph{strict}, all the second-order stationary points
(SOSP) are exactly equivalent to local maxima. Instead of FOSP, we consider
SOSP as the convergence criteria to character the sample complexity of policy
gradient. Our result shows that policy gradient converges to an
$(\epsilon,\sqrt{\epsilon\chi})$-SOSP with probability at least
$1-\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\delta)$ after the total cost of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\dfrac{\epsilon^{-\frac{9}{2}}}{(1-\gamma)\sqrt\chi}\log\dfrac{1}{\delta}\right)$,

significantly where it requires
$\mathcal{O}\left(\dfrac{\epsilon^{-9}\chi^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\delta}\log\dfrac{1}{\epsilon\chi}\right)$.
Our analysis is based on the key idea that decomposes the parameter space
$\mathbb{R}^p$ into three non-intersected regions: non-stationary point, saddle
point, and local optimal region, then making a local improvement of the
objective of RL in each region. This technique can be potentially generalized

refractories.
  The objective of this work is the investigation of the volatile content of
icy particles that entered the COPS ram gauge.
  The ram gauge measurements are inspected for features that we associate to
the sublimation of the volatile component of cometary particles impacting the
instrument. All sublimation features with high enough signal to noise ratio are
modelled by fitting one or more exponential decay functions. The parameters of
these fits are used to categorise different compositions of the sublimating
component.
  From features attributable to ice sublimation, we infer the detection of 73
icy particles containing volatiles. 25 detections have enough volatile content
for an in-depth study. From the values of the exponential decay constants, we
classified the 25 inferred icy particles into three types, interpreted as
different volatile compositions, possibly further complicated by different
morphologies. Available data do not give indication as to which molecules
compose the different types. Nevertheless, we can estimate the total volume of
volatiles, expressed as the diameter of an equivalent sphere of water (density
of 1 g cm$^{-3}$). This was found to be on the order of hundreds of nanometres.

polynomial chaos (TD-gPC) use an adaptive orthogonal basis to better represent
the stochastic part of the solution space (aka random function space) in time.
However, because the random function space is constructed using tensor
products, TD-gPC-based methods are known to suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical method called the
'flow-driven spectral chaos' (FSC) which overcomes this curse of dimensionality
at the random-function-space level. The proposed method is not only
computationally more efficient than existing TD-gPC-based methods but is also
far more accurate. The FSC method uses the concept of 'enriched stochastic flow
maps' to track the evolution of a finite-dimensional random function space
efficiently in time. To transfer the probability information from one random
function space to another, two approaches are developed and studied herein. In
the first approach, the probability information is transferred in the
mean-square sense, whereas in the second approach the transfer is done exactly
using a new theorem that was developed for this purpose. The FSC method can
quantify uncertainties with high fidelity, especially for the long-time
response of stochastic dynamical systems governed by ODEs of arbitrary order.
Six representative numerical examples, including a nonlinear problem (the
Van-der-Pol oscillator), are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
FSC method and corroborate the claims of its superior numerical properties.
Finally, a parametric, high-dimensional stochastic problem is used to
demonstrate that when the FSC method is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo
integration, the curse of dimensionality can be overcome altogether.

are reliable. In particular, we compare the scaling relations retrieved from
SEDIGISM to those of other surveys, and we explore the properties of clouds
with and without high-mass star formation. Our results suggest that there is no
single global property of a cloud that determines its ability to form massive
stars, although we find combined trends of increasing mass, size, surface
density and velocity dispersion for the sub-sample of clouds with ongoing
high-mass star formation. We then isolate the most extreme clouds in the
SEDIGISM sample (i.e. clouds in the tails of the distributions) to look at
their overall Galactic distribution, in search for hints of environmental
effects. We find that, for most properties, the Galactic distribution of the
most extreme clouds is only marginally different to that of the global cloud
population. The Galactic distribution of the largest clouds, the turbulent
clouds and the high-mass star-forming clouds are those that deviate most
significantly from the global cloud population. We also find that the least
dynamically active clouds (with low velocity dispersion or low virial
parameter) are situated further afield, mostly in the least populated areas.
However, we suspect that part of these trends may be affected by some
observational biases, and thus require further follow up work in order to be

accounting for the presence of link quality fluctuations; the forwarder's
dilemma is a four-node interaction model with two source nodes and two
destination nodes. It is known to be very useful to study ad hoc networks. To
characterize the long-term utility region when the source nodes have to control
their power with partial channel state information (CSI), we resort to a recent
result in Shannon theory. It is shown how to exploit this theoretical result to
find the long-term utility region and determine good power control policies.
This region is of prime importance since it provides the best performance
possible for a given knowledge at the nodes. Numerical results provide several
new insights into the repeated forwarder's dilemma power control problem; for
instance, the knowledge of global CSI only brings a marginal performance
improvement with respect to the local CSI case.

bond percolation on each of the five Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, the
cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Looking at the
clusters from a dynamical point of view, i.e., comparing the clusters with
birth processes, we first prove that the first and second moments of the
cluster size are bounded by their counterparts in a certain branching process,
which results in explicit upper bounds that are accurate when the density of
open edges is small. Using that vertices surrounded by closed edges cannot be
reached by an open path, we also derive upper bounds that, on the contrary, are
accurate when the density of open edges is large. These upper bounds hold in
fact for all regular graphs. Specializing in the five~Platonic solids, the
exact value of (or lower bounds for) the first and second moments are obtained
from the inclusion-exclusion principle and a computer program. The goal of our

Therefore, understanding how information is stored and the impact this storage

introduce a method to transform deep neural network models into deep

distributed fashion and get accepted as soon as they are in the base station's
preference list with available quota. Several variants of the EA matching game
with preference list updating and reapplying are compared with the original and
stability-optimal deferred acceptance (DA) matching game, which implements a
waiting list at each base station and delays user association until the game
finishes. We show that matching stability needs not lead to optimal performance
in other metrics such as throughput. Analysis and simulations show that
compared to DA, the proposed EA matching games achieve higher network
throughput while exhibiting a significantly faster association process.
Furthermore, the EA games either playing once or multiple times can reach
closely the network utility of a centralized user association while having much

ad hoc networks is to use game theory. In this respect, simple interaction
models such as the forwarder's dilemma have been proposed and used
successfully. However, this type of models is not suited to account for
possible fluctuations of the wireless links of the network. Additionally, it
does not allow one to study the way a node transmits its own packets. At last,
the repeated game models used in the related literature do not allow the
important scenario of nodes with partial information (about the link state and
nodes actions) to be studied. One of the contributions of the present work is
precisely to provide a general approach to integrate all of these aspects.
Second, the best performance the nodes can achieve under partial information is
fully characterized for a general form of utilities. Third, we derive an
equilibrium transmission strategy which allows a node to adapt its transmit
power levels and packet forwarding rate to link fluctuations and other nodes
actions. The derived results are illustrated through a detailed numerical
analysis for a network model built from a generalized version of the
forwarder's dilemma. The analysis shows in particular that the proposed
strategy is able to operate in presence of channel fluctuations and to perform
significantly better than existing transmission mechanisms (e.g., in terms of
consumed network energy).

optics and photonics community. These sensors exploit simultaneously the
enhancement and the localization of electromagnetic fields close to the
interface between a metal and a dielectric. This enables, for example, the
design of integrated biochemical sensors at scales far below the diffraction
limit. Despite their practical realization and successful commercialization,
the sensitivity and associated precision of plasmonic sensors are starting to
reach their fundamental classical limit given by quantum fluctuations of light
-- known as the shot-noise limit. To improve the sensing performance of these
sensors beyond the classical limit, quantum resources are increasingly being
employed. This area of research has become known as `quantum plasmonic sensing'
and it has experienced substantial activity in recent years for applications in
chemical and biological sensing. This review aims to cover both plasmonic and
quantum techniques for sensing, and shows how they have been merged to enhance
the performance of plasmonic sensors beyond traditional methods. We discuss the
general framework developed for quantum plasmonic sensing in recent years,
covering the basic theory behind the advancements made, and describe the
important works that made these advancements. We also describe several key
works in detail, highlighting their motivation, the working principles behind
them, and their future impact. The intention of the review is to set a

Uncertainty in future trajectories stems from two sources: (a) sources that are
known to the agent but unknown to the model, such as long term goals and
(b)sources that are unknown to both the agent & the model, such as intent of
other agents & irreducible randomness indecisions. We propose to factorize this
uncertainty into its epistemic & aleatoric sources. We model the epistemic
un-certainty through multimodality in long term goals and the aleatoric
uncertainty through multimodality in waypoints& paths. To exemplify this
dichotomy, we also propose a novel long term trajectory forecasting setting,
with prediction horizons upto a minute, an order of magnitude longer than prior
works. Finally, we presentY-net, a scene com-pliant trajectory forecasting

transitions, including 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1), thus probing the moderately

resolution of 30'' and a typical 1-sigma sensitivity of 0.8-1.0 K at 0.25 km/s
velocity resolution, it gives access to a wide range of structures, from
individual star-forming clumps to giant molecular clouds and complexes. The
coverage includes a good fraction of the first and fourth Galactic quadrants,
allowing us to constrain the large scale distribution of cold molecular gas in
the inner Galaxy. In this paper we provide an updated overview of the full
survey and the data reduction procedures used. We also assess the quality of
these data and describe the data products that are being made publicly

and position-velocity maps of the molecular gas and use these to investigate
the correlation between the molecular gas and the large scale structural
features of the Milky Way such as the spiral arms, Galactic bar and Galactic
centre. We find that approximately 60 per cent of the molecular gas is
associated with the spiral arms and these appear as strong intensity peaks in
the derived Galactocentric distribution. We also find strong peaks in intensity
at specific longitudes that correspond to the Galactic centre and well known
star forming complexes, revealing that the 13CO emission is concentrated in a
small number of complexes rather than evenly distributed along spiral arms.

zeroes of a multivariate polynomial on a product set. This lemma motivates the
multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014], who showed
how to use this lemma to construct high-rate locally-decodable codes. However,
the algorithmic results about these codes crucially rely on the fact that the
polynomials are evaluated on a vector space and not an arbitrary product set.
  In this work, we show how to decode multivariate multiplicity codes of large
multiplicities in polynomial time over finite product sets (over fields of
large characteristic and zero characteristic). Previously such decoding
algorithms were not known even for a positive fraction of errors. In contrast,
our work goes all the way to the distance of the code and in particular exceeds
both the unique decoding bound and the Johnson bound. For errors exceeding the
Johnson bound, even combinatorial list-decodablity of these codes was not
known.
  Our algorithm is an application of the classical polynomial method directly
to the multivariate setting. In particular, we do not rely on a reduction from
the multivariate to the univariate case as is typical of many of the existing
results on decoding codes based on multivariate polynomials. However, a vanilla
application of the polynomial method in the multivariate setting does not yield
a polynomial upper bound on the list size. We obtain a polynomial bound on the
list size by taking an alternative view of multivariate multiplicity codes. In
this view, we glue all the partial derivatives of the same order together using
a fresh set $z$ of variables. We then apply the polynomial method by viewing
this as a problem over the field $\mathbb{F}(z)$ of rational functions in $z$.

applications to the Ioffe-time distributions, which are related to lattice QCD
calculations of parton distribution functions. Guided by the counting rules
based on the perturbative QCD at large momentum fraction $x$ and the color
coherence of gluon couplings at small $x$, we parametrize gluon distributions
in the helicity basis. By fitting the unpolarized gluon distribution, the
inferred polarized gluon distribution from our parametrization agrees with the
one from global analysis. A simultaneous fit to both unpolarized and polarized
gluon distributions is also performed to explore the model uncertainty. The
agreement with the global analysis supports the $(1-x)$ power suppression of
the helicity-antialigned distribution relative to the helicity-aligned
distribution. The corresponding Ioffe-time distributions and their asymptotic
expansions are calculated from the gluon distributions. Our results of the
Ioffe-time distributions can provide guidance to the extrapolation of lattice
QCD data to the region lacking precise gluonic matrix elements. Therefore, they
can help regulate the ill-posed inverse problem associated with extracting the
gluon distributions from discrete data from first-principle calculations, which
are available in a limited range of the nucleon momentum and the spatial
separation between the gluonic currents. Given various limitations in obtaining
lattice QCD data at large Ioffe time, phenomenological approaches can provide
important complementary information to extract the gluon distributions in the
entire $x$ region. The possibility of investigating higher-twist effects and
other systematic uncertainties in the contemporary first-principle calculations
of parton distributions from phenomenologically well-determined Ioffe-time
distributions in the large Ioffe-time region is also discussed.

consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than
magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia DR2.
Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for
approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources,
parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G_BP-G_RP) colour are also available. The
passbands for G, G_BP, and G_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease
of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this
release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial
velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an
updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical,
the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of
the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust
with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of
spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as
that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable
changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a
significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30
percent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the
systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the
parallaxes and by a factor ~2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also
features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across
colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G_BP, and
G_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics
above the 1 percent level.

activity with respect to that obtained by ordinary linear regression,
especially for those objects in which it can be significantly affected by a
single glitch. We discuss how this affects the theoretical upper bound on the
moment of inertia associated with the region of a neutron star containing the
superfluid reservoir of angular momentum released in a stationary sequence of

uncertainty on the activity estimated with the bootstrap method and allows for
models in which the superfluid reservoir is entirely in the crust.

two electrons have the exact same momentum, whereas the antimomentum is the
probability their momenta are the exact opposite. Momentum-balance (MB) is the
difference between the equimomentum and antimomentum, and therefore indicates
if equal or opposite momentum is more probably in a system of electrons. The
equimomentum, antimomentum and MB densities are also introduced, which are the

extrapolated-Full Configuration Interaction wave functions of atoms of the
first three rows of the periodic table are analyzed, with a particular focus on
contrasting the correlated motion of electrons with opposite and parallel spin.
Coulomb correlation between opposite-spin electrons leads to a higher
probability of equimomentum, whereas Fermi correlation between parallel-spin
electrons leads to a higher probability of antimomentum. The local contribution
to MB, given an electron is present, is a minimum at the nucleus and generally
increases as the distance from the nucleus increases. There are also
interesting similarities between the effects of Fermi correlation and Coulomb

presented DCM is meshfree and avoids any spatial discretization, which is
usually needed for the finite element method (FEM). We show that the DCM can
capture the response qualitatively and quantitatively, without the need for any

usually is the main bottleneck in most data-driven models. The deep learning
model is trained to learn the model's parameters yielding accurate approximate
solutions. Once the model is properly trained, solutions can be obtained almost
instantly at any point in the domain, given its spatial coordinates. Therefore,
the deep collocation method is potentially a promising standalone technique to
solve partial differential equations involved in the deformation of materials

$L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$ and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$) characterizing the

these intrinsic correlations and their applications in better constraining the
poorly known high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy. Several novel
correlations connecting the characteristics of SNM EOS with those of nuclear
symmetry energy are found. In particular, at the lowest-order of
approximations, the bulk parts of the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$ and
skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of the symmetry energy are found to be $L\approx K_0/3,
K_{\rm{sym}}\approx LJ_0/2K_0$ and $J_{\rm{sym}}\approx I_0L/3K_0$,
respectively. High-order corrections to these simple relations can be written
in terms of the small ratios of high-order EOS parameters. The resulting
intrinsic correlations among some of the EOS parameters reproduce very nicely
their relations predicted by various microscopic nuclear many-body theories and
phenomenological models constrained by available data of terrestrial
experiments and astrophysical observations in the literature. The unbound
nature of PNM is fundamental and the required intrinsic correlations among the

universal. These intrinsic correlations provide a novel and model-independent

domain $\Omega$, we look for a piecewise adaptive approximation to $f$.
Standard approximation techniques achieve reduced approximation orders near the
boundary of the domain and near curves of jump singularities of the function or
its derivatives. The idea used here is that the behavior near the boundaries,
or near a singularity curve, is fully characterized and identified by the
values of certain differences of the data across the boundary and across the
singularity curve. We refer to these values as the signature of $f$. In this
paper, we aim at using these values in order to define the approximation. That
is, we look for an approximation whose signature is matched to the signature of
$f$. Given function data on a grid, assuming the function is piecewise smooth,
first, the singularity structure of the function is identified. For example in
the 2-D case, we find an approximation to the curves separating between smooth
segments of $f$. Secondly, simultaneously we find the approximations to the
different segments of $f$. A system of equations derived from the principle of
matching the signature of the approximation and the function with respect to
the given grid defines a first stage approximation. An second stage improved
approximation is constructed using a global approximation to the error obtained

[210] direction in-plane and canted $\sim$ 30$^{\circ}$ out-of-plane. Density
functional theory calculations using this structure show that the observed
canting drastically alters the relevant electronic bands, relative to the
in-plane order, leading to a single set of well defined Weyl points.
Furthermore, we find the canting angle can tune the distance of the Weyl points
above the Fermi level, with the smallest distance at low canting angles.
Finally, transport measurements of the anomalous Hall Effect and longitudinal
magnetoresistance exhibit properties indicative of a chiral anomaly, thus
supporting the neutron scattering and DFT results suggesting EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is
close to the ideal situation of the Weyl ""Hydrogen atom"".

generalization of state-of-the-art deep models. For each training sample the LS
strategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its
distribution mass over the non ground-truth classes, aiming to penalize the
networks from generating overconfident output distributions. This paper
introduces a novel label smoothing technique called Pairwise Label Smoothing
(PLS). The PLS takes a pair of samples as input. Smoothing with a pair of
ground-truth labels enables the PLS to preserve the relative distance between
the two truth labels while further soften that between the truth labels and the
other targets, resulting in models producing much less confident predictions
than the LS strategy. Also, unlike current LS methods, which typically require
to find a global smoothing distribution mass through cross-validation search,
PLS automatically learns the distribution mass for each input pair during
training. We empirically show that PLS significantly outperforms LS and the
baseline models, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error
reduction. We also visually show that when achieving such accuracy gains the
PLS tends to produce very low winning softmax scores.

ever increasing amount of time. The prospect of increased simulation time
resulting in slower design iteration forces architects to use simpler models,

the task of migrating from a simple simulation to one with more detail often
requires multiple executions to find where simple models could be effective,
which could be more expensive than running the detailed model in the first
place. Also, architects must often rely on intuition to choose these simpler

  In this work, we present a method of bridging the gap between simple and

swapping out detailed models with simpler statistical approximations. We
demonstrate the potential of our methodology by implementing it in the

time-invariant statistics, but also those that vary with time (e.g., the L1D is
a form of a time-series function), and downstream side-effects (e.g., the L1D
filters accesses for the level two cache). Our simulation swaps out the

using the approximated cache models for over 90% of the simulation, and our
simpler models require two to eight times less computation per ""execution"" of

Additionally, we can tackle density matrices of arbitrary rank. The methods

the density matrix is more naturally expressed in terms of non-orthogonal

tasks such as registration. Registered multimodal image data are essential for
the diagnosis of medical conditions and the success of interventional medical
procedures. To overcome the shortage of data, we present a method that allows
the generation of annotated multimodal 4D datasets. We use a CycleGAN network
architecture to generate multimodal synthetic data from the 4D extended
cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom and real patient data. Organ masks are provided by
the XCAT phantom, therefore the generated dataset can serve as ground truth for
image segmentation and registration. Realistic simulation of respiration and
heartbeat is possible within the XCAT framework. To underline the usability as
a registration ground truth, a proof of principle registration is performed.
Compared to real patient data, the synthetic data showed good agreement
regarding the image voxel intensity distribution and the noise characteristics.
The generated T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography
(CT), and cone beam CT (CBCT) images are inherently co-registered. Thus, the
synthetic dataset allowed us to optimize registration parameters of a
multimodal non-rigid registration, utilizing liver organ masks for evaluation.
Our proposed framework provides not only annotated but also multimodal
synthetic data which can serve as a ground truth for various tasks in medical
imaging processing. We demonstrated the applicability of synthetic data for the
development of multimodal medical image registration algorithms.

the force and torque signals. The selection of a threshold is challenging for
robots operating in unstructured or highly dynamic environments, such in a
household setting, due to the variability of the characteristics of the objects
that might be encountered. We propose a multimodal contact detection approach
using time and frequency domain features which model the distinctive
characteristics of contact events in the auditory and haptic modalities. In our
approach the monitoring of force and torque thresholds is not necessary as
detection is based on the characteristics of force and torque signals in the
frequency domain together with the impact sound generated by the manipulation
task. We evaluated our approach with a typical glass placing task in a
household setting. Our experimental results show that robust contact detection
(99.94% mean cross-validation accuracy) is possible independent of force/torque
threshold values and suitable of being implemented for operation in highly

early detection and tracking of respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic

resulting in a non-specific, incomplete picture of lung health. This paper
introduces an algorithm to extract more respiratory information from the ECG

respiratory rate (RR), the algorithm derives the fractional inspiratory time

information. The algorithm is based on a gated recurrent neural network that
infers vital respiratory information from a single-lead ECG signal. We measure
our algorithm's performance on 5 subjects from the MIMIC dataset and 5 subjects

estimating the respiratory rate and outperforms current algorithms that extract
the respiratory cycle phases and FIT/ inspiratory:expiratory ratio (IER). Our
algorithm reports a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.06 in the computation

aims to generalize well to unseen/future tasks. Existing meta-learning
approaches have shown promising empirical performance on various multiclass
classification problems, but few provide theoretical analysis on the
classifiers' generalization ability on future tasks. In this paper, under the
assumption that all classification tasks are sampled from the same
meta-distribution, we leverage margin theory and statistical learning theory to
establish three margin-based transfer bounds for meta-learning based multiclass
classification (MLMC). These bounds reveal that the expected error of a given
classification algorithm for a future task can be estimated with the average
empirical error on a finite number of previous tasks, uniformly over a class of
preprocessing feature maps/deep neural networks (i.e. deep feature embeddings).
To validate these bounds, instead of the commonly-used cross-entropy loss, a
multi-margin loss is employed to train a number of representative MLMC models.
Experiments on three benchmarks show that these margin-based models still
achieve competitive performance, validating the practical value of our
margin-based theoretical analysis.

to deploy energy and resource-efficient models. A large body of research has
been devoted to developing methods that can reduce the size of the model
considerably without affecting the standard metrics such as top-1 accuracy.
However, these pruning approaches tend to result in a significant mismatch in
other metrics such as fairness across classes and explainability. To combat
such misalignment, we propose a novel multi-part loss function inspired by the
knowledge-distillation literature. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across different compression
algorithms, architectures, tasks as well as datasets. In particular, we obtain
up to $4.1\times$ reduction in the number of prediction mismatches between the
compressed and reference models, and up to $5.7\times$ in cases where the
reference model makes the correct prediction; all while making no changes to
the compression algorithm, and minor modifications to the loss function.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how inducing simple alignment between the
predictions of the models naturally improves the alignment on other metrics
including fairness and attributions. Our framework can thus serve as a simple
plug-and-play component for compression algorithms in the future.

obtain the undisturbed fluid velocity necessary to model the aerodynamic forces
on the particle. The two approaches are thoroughly evaluated for a single

the starshade and its optical edge. Our analyses of stray light sources -
including the leakage through micrometeoroid damage and the reflection of
bright celestial bodies - indicate that sunlight scattered by the optical edge
(i.e., the solar glint) is by far the dominant stray light. With telescope and
observation parameters that approximately correspond to Starshade Rendezvous
with Roman and HabEx, we find that the dominating noise source would be
exozodiacal light for characterizing a temperate and Earth-sized planet around
Sun-like and earlier stars and the solar glint for later-type stars. Further
reducing the brightness of solar glint by a factor of 10 with a coating would
prevent it from becoming the dominant noise for both Roman and HabEx. With an
instrument contrast of 1E-10, the residual starlight is not a dominant noise;
and increasing the contrast level by a factor 10 would not lead to any
appreciable change in the expected science performance. If unbiased calibration

Rendezvous with Roman could provide nearly photon-limited spectroscopy of

outcome but also the underlying mechanism through an intermediate variable of
interest. Principal stratification characterizes such a mechanism by targeting
subgroup causal effects within principal strata, which are defined by the joint
potential values of an intermediate variable. Due to the fundamental problem of
causal inference, principal strata are inherently latent, rendering it
challenging to identify and estimate subgroup effects within them. A line of
research leverages the principal ignorability assumption that the latent
principal strata are mean independent of the potential outcomes conditioning on
the observed covariates. Under principal ignorability, we derive various
nonparametric identification formulas for causal effects within principal
strata in observational studies, which motivate estimators relying on the
correct specifications of different parts of the observed-data distribution.
Appropriately combining these estimators yields triply robust estimators for
the causal effects within principal strata. These triply robust estimators are
consistent if two of the treatment, intermediate variable, and outcome models
are correctly specified, and moreover, they are locally efficient if all three
models are correctly specified. We show that these estimators arise naturally
from either the efficient influence functions in the semiparametric theory or
the model-assisted estimators in the survey sampling theory. We evaluate
different estimators based on their finite-sample performance through
simulation and apply them to two observational studies.

and reactive processes. First, the impact of using a fully compositional model
in the context of thermal simulations is considered. Detailed phase behavior
models rely on compositional descriptions of the oil using up to tens of
components. Lumping a large number of components into a smaller number of
pseudo-components in order to reduce the computational cost is standard
practice for thermal simulations. Lumping schemes are typically calibrated
using experimental data, in order to achieve a good approximation of the phase
behavior of the initial oil. Due to the evaporation and condensation of
components under thermal stimulation, the oil composition will widely vary in
time and space. This works illustrates that even if the lumped schemes were
able to capture the phase behavior of the initial oil, the lack of resolution
can lead to modeling artefacts and/or fail to capture the relevant displacement
processes. Then, the effects of different compositional interpretations of the
lumped pseudo-species appearing in typical reaction schemes are investigated. A
constant, mass-based fraction of the oil is allowed to react, and the reactive
components are modified. Due to molecular weight effects, the reaction rate is
larger when light and medium components are allowed to react. Those effects
result in an increased displacement, leading to faster fronts, larger oil banks
and more pressurization of the system.

for flow at supply points along an automated network of open-water channels.
The off-take flows are rigid-profile inputs to the system dynamics. In
particular, the channel operator can only shift orders in time to satisfy
constraints on the automatic response to changes in the load. This leads to a
non-convex semi-infinite programming problem, with sum-separable cost that
encodes the collective sensitivity of end users to scheduling delays. The
constraints encode the linear time-invariant continuous-time dynamics and
limits on the state across a \al{continuous} scheduling horizon. Discretization
is used to arrive at a more manageable approximation of the semi-infinite
program. A method for parsimoniously refining the discretization is applied to
ensure continuous-time feasibility for solutions of the approximate problem. It
is then shown how to improve cost without loss of feasibility. Supporting
analysis is provided, along with simulation results for a realistic irrigation
channel setup to illustrate the approach.

from a psychoanalysis test called word evocation experiment, where one word is
used to recall another. Although useful, such experimental data have been
significantly understudied for measuring embedding quality. In this paper, we
use three well-known evocation datasets to gain insights into asymmetry
encoding of embedding. We study both static embedding as well as contextual
embedding, such as BERT. Evaluating asymmetry for BERT is generally hard due to
the dynamic nature of embedding. Thus, we probe BERT's conditional
probabilities (as a language model) using a large number of Wikipedia contexts
to derive a theoretically justifiable Bayesian asymmetry score. The result
shows that contextual embedding shows randomness than static embedding on
similarity judgments while performing well on asymmetry judgment, which aligns
with its strong performance on ""extrinsic evaluations"" such as text
classification. The asymmetry judgment and the Bayesian approach provides a new
perspective to evaluate contextual embedding on intrinsic evaluation, and its
comparison to similarity evaluation concludes our work with a discussion on the

innovation in EBFT is egalitarian block generation: nodes randomly and
non-interactively propose blocks containing client transactions, rather than
relying on a leader to do so. Apart from deterministic safety and liveness
guarantees standard in BFT protocols, the egalitarian design provides two novel
features: (i) EBFT is resilient to attacks targeting the leader, such as
bribery and targeted DoS attacks, and (ii) EBFT does not require any fail-over
protocol to detect and replace the faulty leader. EBFT consists of three
protocols: EBFT-Syn for synchronous networks, EBFT-PSyn for partially

  We implement EBFT and evaluate its performance on AWS. To compare EBFT with

areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the
effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING
(pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma)
rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of
their collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the
macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC),
using numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire
(IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic
neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the
phase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type
I), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING
rhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the
collective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would
lead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay
arises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the
network by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying
within-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the
external excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows
the PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING
rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a
similar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify
a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of
coupled $\gamma$-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer
via communication through coherence.

end, we analyze the evolution of the shape and spin direction of proto-haloes,
i.e. of all the volume elements associated to a $z=0$ halo, with respect to the
present-day filaments. We find that the major axis of proto-haloes undergoes a
major change, from being strongly perpendicular to the filament spine in the
initial conditions, to being preferentially aligned at the present time. In
comparison, the spin orientation shows only a mild evolution: it starts
slightly parallel to the filament spine, but the subsequent evolution, up to
$z{\sim}1$, gradually changes its orientation to preferentially perpendicular.
In order to analyze these signals in the TTT framework, we split the haloes
according to their net spin growth with respect to the median TTT expectation,
finding a clear correlation with the spin--filament alignment. At the present
time, haloes whose spin grew the most are the ones most perpendicular to the
filament spine, while haloes whose spin grew below the median TTT expectation
are typically more aligned. The dependence of spin directions on net spin
growth is already present in the initial conditions, and gets further modified
by late-time, $z<2$, evolution. Also, spin directions mildly deviate from the
TTT predictions even at high redshift, indicating the need for extensions to
the model.

adaptively generate a specific metric for a new FSL task based on the task
description (eg, a few labelled samples). In this study, we structure the
metric using a three-layer deep attentive network that is flexible enough to
produce a discriminative metric for each task. Moreover, different from
existing methods that utilize an uni-modal weight distribution conditioned on
labelled samples for network generation, the proposed meta-learner establishes
a multi-modal weight distribution conditioned on cross-class sample pairs using
a tailored variational autoencoder, which can separately capture the specific
inter-class discrepancy statistics for each class and jointly embed the
statistics for all classes into metric generation. By doing this, the generated
metric can be appropriately adapted to a new FSL task with pleasing

improve forecasting. Estimating optimal weights that can outperform simple
averages is not always an easy task. In recent years, the idea of using time
series features for forecast combination has flourished. Although this idea has
been proved to be beneficial in several forecasting competitions, it may not be
practical in many situations. For example, the task of selecting appropriate
features to build forecasting models is often challenging. Even if there was an
acceptable way to define the features, existing features are estimated based on
the historical patterns, which are likely to change in the future. Other times,
the estimation of the features is infeasible due to limited historical data. In
this work, we suggest a change of focus from the historical data to the
produced forecasts to extract features. We use out-of-sample forecasts to
obtain weights for forecast combinations by amplifying the diversity of the
pool of methods being combined. A rich set of time series is used to evaluate
the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our
diversity-based forecast combination framework not only simplifies the
modelling process but also achieves superior forecasting performance in terms
of both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The value of our proposition
lies on its simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency, elements
that are important from both an optimisation and a decision analysis
perspective.

increased. The kink was formed by an electron-phonon coupling. And the
localized flat band might be closely related to an electron-phonon coupling.
Ultrafast optical spectroscopy identified multiple distinct time scales in the

significant lifetime temperature dependence at high temperatures, while this
starts to change slowly below ~ 100 K where an anomalous Hall coefficient
occurred. At low temperature, a coherent A1g phonon mode with a frequency of ~

state for neutron star dynamics, covering the wide range of charge chemical
potential ($\mu_Q$) and temperatures ($T$). Based on the nuclear-2SC continuity
scenario, we match equations of state for nuclear and two-flavor
color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter, where the matching baryon density is
$n_B\simeq 1.5n_0$ ($n_0\simeq 0.16\, {\rm fm^{-3}}$: nuclear saturation
density). The effective vector and diquark couplings in a quark matter model
evolve as functions of $n_B, \mu_Q, T$, whose low density values are
constrained by the nuclear matter properties and neutron star radii, with the
high density behavior by the two-solar mass ($2M_\odot$) constraint. With
couplings dependent on $n_B$, we examined how smooth the nuclear-2SC continuity
can be, and found problems in matching nuclear and 2SC entropies at low
temperatures. To proceed with the continuity scenario, we enforce smooth
matching by making the couplings ($n_B, \mu_Q, T$)-dependent. In effect, this
adds phenomenological contributions which we call ""X"". After the
phenomenological matching, we take the rest as our predictions. The 2SC and
color-flavor-locked (CFL) phases computed with these evolving couplings are
called 2SCX and CFLX. The CFLX appears around $n_B\simeq 2$-$4n_0$ and, in
contrast to the conventional CFL, has non-negligible dependence on $(\mu_Q,T)$.
To examine the astrophysical consequences of our modeling, we add charged
leptons and neutrinos, and study the composition of matter for lepton fractions
relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron star mergers. The abundance of
neutrinos and thermal effects reduce the strangeness fraction and stiffen
equations of state. For a neutrino trapped neutron star at $T\simeq 30 $ MeV

continuous satisfaction of quality objectives is still challenging and needs a
rigorous definition and analysis of system behavioral properties. Formal

vulnerable to adversarial examples, motivating the development of defenses

improve model robustness against individual specific perturbation types. Some
recent methods improve model robustness against adversarial attacks in multiple
$\ell_p$ balls, but their performance against each perturbation type is still
far from satisfactory. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the
\emph{multi-domain} hypothesis, stating that different types of adversarial
perturbations are drawn from different domains. Guided by the multi-domain
hypothesis, we propose \emph{Gated Batch Normalization (GBN)}, a novel building
block for deep neural networks that improves robustness against multiple

batch normalization (BN) layer, where the gated sub-network separates different
perturbation types, and each BN branch is in charge of a single perturbation
type and learns domain-specific statistics for input transformation. Then,
features from different branches are aligned as domain-invariant
representations for the subsequent layers. We perform extensive evaluations of
our approach on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and demonstrate that GBN
outperforms previous defense proposals against multiple perturbation types,

challenge task due to issues of extreme class imbalance and enormous size
variation. This paper aims to tackle these issues and proposes a dual-branch
network with dual-sampling modulated Dice loss. It consists of two branches:
large hard exudate biased learning branch and small hard exudate biased
learning branch. Both of them are responsible for their own duty separately.
Furthermore, we propose a dual-sampling modulated Dice loss for the training
such that our proposed dual-branch network is able to segment hard exudates in
different sizes. In detail, for the first branch, we use a uniform sampler to
sample pixels from predicted segmentation mask for Dice loss calculation, which
leads to this branch naturally be biased in favour of large hard exudates as
Dice loss generates larger cost on misidentification of large hard exudates
than small hard exudates. For the second branch, we use a re-balanced sampler
to oversample hard exudate pixels and undersample background pixels for loss
calculation. In this way, cost on misidentification of small hard exudates is
enlarged, which enforces the parameters in the second branch fit small hard
exudates well. Considering that large hard exudates are much easier to be
correctly identified than small hard exudates, we propose an easy-to-difficult
learning strategy by adaptively modulating the losses of two branches. We
evaluate our proposed method on two public datasets and results demonstrate
that ours achieves state-of-the-art performances.

the infinite interval into an appropriate finite interval. In this paper, a
truncation method, which is based on a truncation error analysis specialized to
the computation of $A^\alpha$, is proposed. Then, two algorithms are presented

computes $A^\alpha$ adaptively. Subsequently, the convergence rate of the DE

rate analysis shows that the DE formula converges faster than the Gaussian

other words, the superdense coding task is rigid. In particular, we show that
the sender and receiver only use additional entanglement (beyond the EPR pair)
as a source of classical randomness.
  We then explore whether higher-dimensional superdense coding, where the goal
is to communicate one of $d^2$ possible messages by sending a $d$-dimensional
quantum state, is rigid for all $d \geq 2$. We conjecture that $d$-dimensional
superdense coding is rigid up to the choice of orthogonal unitary bases, and
present concrete constructions of inequivalent unitary bases for all $d > 2$.
Finally, we analyze the performance of superdense coding protocols where the

structure. The aim of this study is to describe the system in terms of M pseudo
species such that we can avoid this artificial softening but at the same time
have a value of M << N. We use potential energy and pair excess entropy to
estimate an optimum number of species, M_{0}. We find that systems with
polydispersity width, {\Delta}{\sigma}_{0} can be treated as a monodisperse

also on the nature of the interaction potential, whereas, {\Delta}{\sigma}_{0}
weakly depends on the type of the polydispersity, but shows a stronger
dependence on the type of interaction potential. Systems with softer
interaction potential have a higher tolerance with respect to polydispersity.
Interestingly, M_{0} is independent of system size, making this study more
relevant for bigger systems. Our study reveals that even 1% polydispersity
cannot be treated as an effective monodisperse system. Thus while studying the
role of polydispersity by using the structure of an effective one component
system care must be taken in decoupling the role of polydispersity from that of

individual classifications of CapsNets has not been well explored. The widely
used saliency methods are mainly proposed for explaining CNN-based
classifications; they create saliency map explanations by combining activation
values and the corresponding gradients, e.g., Grad-CAM. These saliency methods
require a specific architecture of the underlying classifiers and cannot be
trivially applied to CapsNets due to the iterative routing mechanism therein.
To overcome the lack of interpretability, we can either propose new post-hoc
interpretation methods for CapsNets or modifying the model to have build-in
explanations. In this work, we explore the latter. Specifically, we propose
interpretable Graph Capsule Networks (GraCapsNets), where we replace the
routing part with a multi-head attention-based Graph Pooling approach. In the
proposed model, individual classification explanations can be created
effectively and efficiently. Our model also demonstrates some unexpected
benefits, even though it replaces the fundamental part of CapsNets. Our
GraCapsNets achieve better classification performance with fewer parameters and
better adversarial robustness, when compared to CapsNets. Besides, GraCapsNets

models to achieve personalization in practical scenarios. Existing approaches
are generally designed based on the assumption that users have a consensus on

reducing the spatial cost for implementing the contraction algorithm on general

pure states and then it extends to mixed states by the convex roof

Optimal Pure State Ensembles (OPSE) exist for the convex roof extension of the
entanglement number from pure to mixed states. We answer Gudder's question in
the affirmative, and therefore we obtain that the entanglement number vanishes
only on the separable states. More generally we show that OPSE exist for the
convex roof extension of any function that is norm continuous on the pure
states of a finite dimensional Hilbert space. Further we prove that the
entanglement number is an LOCC monotone, (and thus an entanglement measure), by
using a criterion that was developed by Vidal in 2000. We present a simplified
proof of Vidal's result where moreover we use an interesting point of view of
tree representations for LOCC communications. Lastly, we generalize Gudder's

unconstrained environments. Our work is motivated by the intuition that many
complex manipulation tasks, with multiple objects, can be simplified by
focusing on less complex pairwise object relations. We propose an
object-relation model that learns continuous representations for these pairwise
object relations. Our object-relation model is trained completely in
simulation, and once learned, is used by a separate precondition model to
predict skill preconditions for real world tasks. We evaluate our precondition

novel federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to
maintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids.
These centroids are central features of local data on each device, which are
aligned by the server every communication round. Updating local models with the
aligned centroids helps to form consistent decision boundaries among local
models, although the noise distributions in clients' data are different from
each other. To improve local model performance, we introduce a novel approach
to select confident samples that are used for updating the model with given
labels. Furthermore, we propose a global-guided pseudo-labeling method to
update labels of unconfident samples by exploiting the global model. Our
experimental results on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset and the Clothing1M dataset
show that our approach is noticeably effective in federated learning with noisy
labels.

  In this paper, we present FenceBox, a comprehensive framework to defeat
various kinds of adversarial attacks. FenceBox is equipped with 15 data
augmentation methods from three different categories. We comprehensively
evaluated that these methods can effectively mitigate various adversarial
attacks. FenceBox also provides APIs for users to easily deploy the defense
over their models in different modes: they can either select an arbitrary
preprocessing method, or a combination of functions for a better robustness
guarantee, even under advanced adversarial attacks. We open-source FenceBox,

Second, we created shocked clusters by a cluster blaster. Third, the shocked

Fourth, the distribution of energy barriers that control the generation of

generation across the barriers. Our main conclusions are as follows. (1) The
degradation of a-Si/c-Si stacks via defect generation is controlled by a broad
distribution of energy barriers. (2) We developed the SolDeg platform to track
the microscopic dynamics of defect generation across this wide barrier
distribution, and determined the time dependent defect density $N(t)$ from
femtoseconds to gigaseconds, over 24 orders of magnitude in time. (3) We have
shown that a stretched exponential analytical form can successfully describe
the defect generation $N(t)$. (4) We found that in relative terms
$V_\mathrm{oc}$ degrades at a rate of 0.2%/year over the first year, slowing

creates a semantic representation of Java source code using the code features

$\mu$K-arcmin in polarization, which are low enough that the typically used
quadratic estimator (QE) technique for analyzing CMB lensing is significantly
sub-optimal. Conversely, the Bayesian procedure extracts all lensing
information from the data and is optimal at any noise level. We infer the
amplitude of the gravitational lensing potential to be
$A_\phi\,{=}\,0.949\,{\pm}\,0.122$ using the Bayesian pipeline, consistent with
our QE pipeline result, but with 17\% smaller error bars. The Bayesian analysis
also provides a simple way to account for systematic uncertainties, performing
a similar job as frequentist ""bias hardening,"" and reducing the systematic
uncertainty on $A_\phi$ due to polarization calibration from almost half of the
statistical error to effectively zero. Finally, we jointly constrain $A_\phi$
along with $A_{\rm L}$, the amplitude of lensing-like effects on the CMB power

parameters both from an optimal lensing reconstruction and from the delensed

results demonstrate the feasibility of the Bayesian approach on real data, and
pave the way for future analysis of deep CMB polarization measurements with

both currents yielded a power-law relationship with empirical fitting

of FP is weakened as deeper backbones with more layers are used. In addition,
it cannot keep up accurate detection of both small and large objects at the
same time. To address these issues, we propose a new parallel FP structure with
bi-directional (top-down and bottom-up) fusion and associated improvements to
retain high-quality features for accurate localization. We provide the
following design improvements: (1) A parallel bifusion FP structure with a
bottom-up fusion module (BFM) to detect both small and large objects at once
with high accuracy. (2) A concatenation and re-organization (CORE) module
provides a bottom-up pathway for feature fusion, which leads to the
bi-directional fusion FP that can recover lost information from lower-layer
feature maps. (3) The CORE feature is further purified to retain richer
contextual information. Such CORE purification in both top-down and bottom-up
pathways can be finished in only a few iterations. (4) The adding of a residual
design to CORE leads to a new Re-CORE module that enables easy training and
integration with a wide range of deeper or lighter backbones. The proposed

protoplanetary disks. Theoretically, multiple origins potentially contribute to
the polarized emission but it is still uncertain what mechanism is dominant in
disk millimeter polarization. To quantitatively address the origin, we perform
radiative transfer calculations of the mixture of alignment and self-scattering
induced polarization to reproduce the 3.1 mm polarization of the HL Tau disk,
which shows azimuthal pattern in polarization vectors. We find that a mixture
of the grain alignment and self-scattering is essential to reproduce the HL Tau
3.1 mm polarization properties. Our model shows that the polarization of the HL
Tau at 3.1 mm can be decomposed to be the combination of the self-scattering
parallel to the minor axis and the alignment-induced polarization parallel to
the major axis, with the orders of $\sim 0.5\%$ fraction for each component.
This slightly eases the tight constraints on the grain size of $\sim
70~{\rm~\mu m}$ to be $\sim 130 {\rm~\mu m}$ in the previous studies but
further modeling is needed. In addition, the grain alignment model requires
effectively prolate grains but the physics to reproduce it in protoplanetary
disks is still a mystery.

reconstructs the sequences, and the second component performs active learning
to select sequences to be labeled based on cluster and classification

the dependencies are explored by mapping the systematic differences between

Different dependencies apply to the five- and six-parameter solutions in EDR3.

of the main reason comes from the fact that the predefined degeneration models

discrepancy with the real one, which results in these deep models overfit and
ultimately degrade their performance on real data. To well mitigate such a
problem, we explore the unsupervised blind HSI SR method. Specifically, we
investigate how to effectively obtain the degeneration models in spatial and
spectral domain, respectively, and makes them can well compatible with the
fusion based SR reconstruction model. To this end, we first propose an
alternating optimization based deep framework to estimate the degeneration
models and reconstruct the latent image, with which the degeneration models
estimation and HSI reconstruction can mutually promotes each other. Then, a
meta-learning based mechanism is further proposed to pre-train the network,
which can effectively improve the speed and generalization ability adapting to
different complex degeneration. Experiments on three benchmark HSI SR datasets
report an excellent superiority of the proposed method on handling blind HSI
fusion problem over other competing methods.

(BCI) systems use a large amount of channels for higher performance, which is
time-consuming to set up and inconvenient for practical applications. Finding
an optimal subset of channels without compromising the performance is a
necessary and challenging task. Approach. In this article, we proposed a
cross-correlation based discriminant criterion (XCDC) which assesses the
importance of a channel for discriminating the mental states of different motor
imagery (MI) tasks. Channels are ranked and selected according to the proposed
criterion. The efficacy of XCDC is evaluated on two motor imagery EEG datasets.
Main results. In both datasets, XCDC significantly reduces the amount of
channels without compromising classification accuracy compared to the
all-channel setups. Under the same constraint of accuracy, the proposed method
requires fewer channels than existing channel selection methods based on
Pearson's correlation coefficient and common spatial pattern. Visualization of
XCDC shows consistent results with neurophysiological principles. Significance.
This work proposes a quantitative criterion for assessing and ranking the
importance of EEG channels in MI tasks and provides a practical method for
selecting the ranked channels in the calibration phase of MI BCI systems, which
alleviates the computational complexity and configuration difficulty in the
subsequent steps, leading to real-time and more convenient BCI systems.

observations with the ATCA indicated the presence of anomalous neutral hydrogen
(HI) deviating from the kinematics of a regularly rotating disc. We conducted
follow-up observations with the MeerKAT radio telescope during the 16-dish
Early Science programme as well as with the MeerLICHT optical telescope. Our
more sensitive radio observations confirm the presence of anomalous gas in ESO
149-G003, and further confirm the formerly tentative detection of an
extraplanar HI component in the galaxy. Employing a simple tilted-ring model,
in which the kinematics is determined with only four parameters but including
morphological asymmetries, we reproduce the galaxy's morphology, which shows a
high degree of asymmetry. By comparing our model with the observed HI, we find
that in our model we cannot account for a significant (but not dominant)
fraction of the gas. From the differences between our model and the observed
data cube we estimate that at least 7%-8% of the HI in the galaxy exhibits
anomalous kinematics, while we estimate a minimum mass fraction of less than 1%
for the morphologically confirmed extraplanar component. We investigate a
number of global scaling relations and find that, besides being gas-dominated
with a neutral gas-to-stellar mass ratio of 1.7, the galaxy does not show any
obvious global peculiarities. Given its isolation, as confirmed by optical
observations, we conclude that the galaxy is likely currently acquiring neutral
gas. It is either re-accreting gas expelled from the galaxy or accreting

Full version of a paper accepted at SIROCCO 2021",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study fractional coloring from the angle of distributed
computing. Fractional coloring is the linear relaxation of the classical notion
of coloring, and has many applications, in particular in scheduling. It was
proved by Hasemann, Hirvonen, Rybicki and Suomela (2016) that for every real
$\alpha>1$ and integer $\Delta$, a fractional coloring of total weight at most
$\alpha(\Delta+1)$ can be obtained deterministically in a single round in
graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, in the LOCAL model of computation. However,
a major issue of this result is that the output of each vertex has unbounded
size. Here we prove that even if we impose the more realistic assumption that
the output of each vertex has constant size, we can find fractional colorings
of total weight arbitrarily close to known tight bounds for the fractional
chromatic number in several cases of interest. More precisely, we show that for
any fixed $\epsilon > 0$ and $\Delta$, a fractional coloring of total weight at
most $\Delta+\epsilon$ can be found in $O(\log^*n)$ rounds in graphs of maximum
degree $\Delta$ with no $K_{\Delta+1}$, while finding a fractional coloring of
total weight at most $\Delta$ in this case requires $\Omega(\log \log n)$
rounds for randomized algorithms and $\Omega( \log n)$ rounds for deterministic
algorithms. We also show how to obtain fractional colorings of total weight at
most $2+\epsilon$ in grids of any fixed dimension, for any $\epsilon>0$, in
$O(\log^*n)$ rounds. Finally, we prove that in sparse graphs of large girth
from any proper minor-closed family we can find a fractional coloring of total
weight at most $2+\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon>0$, in $O(\log n)$ rounds.

2-dimensional atomic layers have been extensively investigated. But there is no
explicit photogain equation that allows for fitting and designing
photoresponses of these devices. In this work, we managed to derive explicit
photogain equations for silicon nanowire photoconductors based on experimental
observations. The silicon nanowires were fabricated by patterning the device
layer of silicon-on-insulator wafers by standard lithography that were doped
with boron. It was found that the as-fabricated silicon nanowires have a
surface depletion region ~ 32 nm wide. This depletion region protects charge
carriers in the channel from surface scatterings, resulting in the independence
of charge carrier mobilities on nanowire size. It is consistent with our Hall
effect measurements but in contradiction with the accepted conclusion in the
past decades that charge carrier mobilities become smaller for smaller
nanowires due to surface scatterings. Under light illumination, the depletion
region logarithmically narrows down and the nanowire channel widens
accordingly. Photo Hall effect measurements show that the nanowire
photoconductance is not contributed by the increase of carrier concentrations
but the widening of the nanowire channel. As a result, a nanowire
photoconductor can be modeled as a resistor in connection with floating
Schottky junctions near the nanowire surfaces. Based on the photoresponses of a
Schottky junction, we derived explicit photogain equations for nanowire
photoconductors that are a function of light intensity and device physical
parameters. The gain equations fit well with the experimental data, from which
we extracted the minority carrier lifetimes that are consistent with the
minority carrier lifetime in nanowires reported in literature.

high photo gain in graphene is observed. The explicit gain equations are

lamellar colonies which are surrounded by $\gamma$ grains. The evolutions of
the alloy strength and creep resistance resulting from this ageing treatment
are measured by the related mechanical tests. The microstructural changes are
investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopies and by X-ray
diffraction. The main structural evolutions consist in a shrinkage of the
lamellar areas and in a precipitation of $\beta_0$ phase, which is accompanied
by a moderate segregation of tungsten and a decrease of the $\alpha_2$ lamellar
width. However, these evolutions are relatively limited and the microstructural
stability is found to result mainly from the low diffusivity of tungsten.
Conversely, a moderate effect of this ageing treatment on mechanical
properties, at room and high temperatures, is measured. Such experimental
results are interpreted and discussed in terms of the microstructural
evolutions and of the deformation mechanisms which are activated at different

Lipid-tail unsaturation plays a key role, but surprisingly contributes stepwise
rather than proportionally. Our results are in line with previously observed
changes in permeability, suggesting the distinction between liquid-disordered

Magellanic Clouds and show the clear improvements in precision and accuracy in
the new release. We also show that the systematics still present in the data
make the determination of the 3D geometry of the LMC a difficult endeavour;
this is at the very limit of the usefulness of the Gaia EDR3 astrometry, but it
may become feasible with the use of additional external data.
  We derive radial and tangential velocity maps and global profiles for the LMC
for the several subsamples we defined. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that the two planar components of the ordered and random motions are derived
for multiple stellar evolutionary phases in a galactic disc outside the Milky
Way, showing the differences between younger and older phases. We also analyse
the spatial structure and motions in the central region, the bar, and the disc,
providing new insights into features and kinematics.
  Finally, we show that the Gaia EDR3 data allows clearly resolving the
Magellanic Bridge, and we trace the density and velocity flow of the stars from
the SMC towards the LMC not only globally, but also separately for young and
evolved populations. This allows us to confirm an evolved population in the
Bridge that is slightly shift from the younger population. Additionally, we
were able to study the outskirts of both Magellanic Clouds, in which we
detected some well-known features and indications of new ones.

benefits, the decline in quality of access to care and services and overall
quality of life. Immunization from the anticipated vaccines will not be the
stand-alone guideline that will help surpass the pandemic and return to
normalcy. Four pillars of effective public health intervention include
diagnostic testing for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, contact
tracing, quarantine of individuals with symptoms or who are exposed to
COVID-19, and maintaining strict hygiene standards at the individual and
community level. Digital technology, currently being used for COVID-19 testing
include certain mobile apps, web dashboards, and online self-assessment tools.
Herein, we look into various digital solutions adapted by communities across
universities, businesses, and other organizations. We summarize the challenges
experienced using these tools in terms of quality of information, privacy, and
user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being
developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both
quality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding the
testing landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into the
multiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, and
miscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing for
COVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation and
ensuring ownership of the data to remain with the user. Another solution
involves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information.
In this early draft, we summarize the challenges and propose possible solutions
to address the same.

width $L$ is considered. Under the condition, that the wall is only partially
wet (or dry) while the stripe tends to be wet completely, a liquid drop is
formed above the stripe. The maximum height $\ell_m(\delta\mu)$ of the drop
depends on the stripe width $L$ and the chemical potential departure from
saturation $\delta\mu$ where it adopts the value $\ell_0=\ell_m(0)$. Assuming a
long-range potential of van der Waals type exerted by the stripe, the
interfacial Hamiltonian model is used to show that $\ell_0$ is approached
linearly with $\delta\mu$ with a slope which scales as $L^2$ over the region
satisfying $L\lesssim \xi_\parallel$, where $\xi_\parallel$ is the parallel
correlation function pertinent to the stripe. This suggests that near the
saturation there exists a universal curve $\ell_m(\delta\mu)$ to which the
adsorption isotherms corresponding to different values of $L$ all collapse when
appropriately rescaled. Although the series expansion based on the interfacial
Hamiltonian model can be formed by considering higher order terms, a more
appropriate approximation in the form of a rational function based on scaling
arguments is proposed. The approximation is based on exact asymptotic results,
namely that $\ell_m\sim\delta\mu^{-1/3}$ for $L\to\infty$ and that $\ell_m$
obeys the correct $\delta\mu\to0$ behaviour in line with the results of the
interfacial Hamiltonian model. All the predictions are verified by the
comparison with a microscopic density functional theory (DFT) and, in
particular, the rational function approximation -- even in its simplest form --
is shown to be in a very reasonable agreement with DFT for a broad range of
both $\delta\mu$ and $L$.

$N^*$ and $\Delta$ spectra. The future antiproton experiment PANDA will provide
direct access to final states containing a $\bar{\Xi}\Xi$ pair, for which
production cross sections up to $\mu$b are expected in $\bar{p}p$ reactions.
With a luminosity of $L=10^{31}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ in the first phase of the
experiment, the expected cross sections correspond to a production rate of
$\sim 10^6$ events$/$day. With a nearly $4\pi$ detector acceptance, PANDA will
thus be a hyperon factory. In this study, reactions of the type
$\bar{p}p\rightarrow \bar{\Xi}^+ \Xi^{*-}$ as well as $\bar{p}p\rightarrow
\bar{\Xi}^{*+} \Xi^{-}$ with various decay modes are investigated. For the
exclusive reconstruction of the signal events a full decay tree fit is used,

  Image-to-Image Translation","Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image synthesis from corrupted contrasts increases the diversity of
diagnostic information available for many neurological diseases. Recently the
image-to-image translation has experienced significant levels of interest
within medical research, beginning with the successful use of the Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) to the introduction of cyclic constraint extended to
multiple domains. However, in current approaches, there is no guarantee that
the mapping between the two image domains would be unique or one-to-one. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approach to unpaired image-to-image
translation based on the invertible architecture. The invertible property of
the flow-based architecture assures a cycle-consistency of image-to-image
translation without additional loss functions. We utilize the temporal
information between consecutive slices to provide more constraints to the
optimization for transforming one domain to another in unpaired volumetric
medical images. To capture temporal structures in the medical images, we
explore the displacement between the consecutive slices using a deformation
field. In our approach, the deformation field is used as a guidance to keep the
translated slides realistic and consistent across the translation. The
experimental results have shown that the synthesized images using our proposed
approach are able to archive a competitive performance in terms of mean squared
error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index when
compared with the existing deep learning-based methods on three standard
datasets, i.e. HCP, MRBrainS13, and Brats2019.

the visual appeal of photos and does not require in-depth knowledge of manual
image editing. However, fully-automatic approaches usually enhance the image in
a black-box manner that does not give the user any control over the
optimization process, possibly leading to edited images that do not
subjectively appeal to the user. Semi-automatic methods mostly allow for
controlling which pre-defined editing step is taken, which restricts the users
in their creativity and ability to make detailed adjustments, such as
brightness or contrast. We argue that incorporating user preferences by guiding
an automated enhancement method simplifies image editing and increases the
enhancement's focus on the user. This work thus proposes the Neural Image
Correction & Enhancement Routine (NICER), a neural network based approach to
no-reference image enhancement in a fully-, semi-automatic or fully manual
process that is interactive and user-centered. NICER iteratively adjusts image
editing parameters in order to maximize an aesthetic score based on image style
and content. Users can modify these parameters at any time and guide the
optimization process towards a desired direction. This interactive workflow is
a novelty in the field of human-computer interaction for image enhancement
tasks. In a user study, we show that NICER can improve image aesthetics without
user interaction and that allowing user interaction leads to diverse
enhancement outcomes that are strongly preferred over the unedited image. We
make our code publicly available to facilitate further research in this
direction.

sphere. We then specialize to $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs where one can preserve some
supersymmetry on a compact manifold by turning on appropriate background
fields. For deformations of the round sphere the $c$ anomaly receives
corrections proportional to the supersymmetric completion of the (Weyl)$^2$

of various correlators in the stress-tensor multiplet. We further show that the
double derivative of the free energy with respect to the marginal couplings is
proportional to the two-point function of the bottom components of the marginal
chiral multiplet placed at the two poles of the deformed sphere. We then use
anomaly considerations and counter-terms to parametrize the finite part of the
free energy which makes manifest its dependence on the K\""ahler potential. We
demonstrate these results for a theory with a vector multiplet and a massless
adjoint hypermultiplet using results from localization. Finally, by choosing a
special value of the hypermultiplet mass where the free energy is independent
of the deformation, we derive an infinite number of constraints between various

mechanism to convert binary attribute vector to rich attribute features. Then
three stacked generators generate $64 \times 64$, $128 \times 128$ and $256
\times 256$ resolution face images respectively by taking the attribute
features as input. In addition, an image-attribute matching loss is proposed to
enhance the correlation between the generated images and input attributes.
Extensive experiments on CelebA demonstrate the superiority of our AFGAN in
terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

interactions as the story unfolds, it is found that structural properties
remain approximately stable and comparable to real-world social networks.
Furthermore, the degrees of the most connected characters reflect a cognitive
limit on the number of concurrent social connections that humans tend to
maintain. We also analyse the distribution of time intervals between
significant deaths measured with respect to the in-story timeline. These are
consistent with power-law distributions commonly found in inter-event times for
a range of non-violent human activities in the real world. We propose that
structural features in the narrative that are reflected in our actual social
world help readers to follow and to relate to the story, despite its sprawling
extent. It is also found that the distribution of intervals between significant
deaths in chapters is different to that for the in-story timeline; it is
geometric rather than power law. Geometric distributions are memoryless in that
the time since the last death does not inform as to the time to the next. This
provides measurable support for the widely held view that significant deaths in
A Song of Ice and Fire are unpredictable chapter-by-chapter.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While many deep learning methods have seen significant success in tackling
the problem of domain adaptation and few-shot learning separately, far fewer
methods are able to jointly tackle both problems in Cross-Domain Few-Shot
Learning (CD-FSL). This problem is exacerbated under sharp domain shifts that
typify common computer vision applications. In this paper, we present a novel,
flexible and effective method to address the CD-FSL problem. Our method, called
Score-based Meta Transfer-Learning (SB-MTL), combines transfer-learning and
meta-learning by using a MAML-optimized feature encoder and a score-based Graph
Neural Network. First, we have a feature encoder with specific layers designed
to be fine-tuned. To do so, we apply a first-order MAML algorithm to find good
initializations. Second, instead of directly taking the classification scores
after fine-tuning, we interpret the scores as coordinates by mapping the
pre-softmax classification scores onto a metric space. Subsequently, we apply a
Graph Neural Network to propagate label information from the support set to the
query set in our score-based metric space. We test our model on the Broader
Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (BSCD-FSL) benchmark, which includes a
range of target domains with highly varying dissimilarity to the miniImagenet
source domain. We observe significant improvements in accuracy across 5, 20 and
50 shot, and on the four target domains. In terms of average accuracy, our
model outperforms previous transfer-learning methods by 5.93% and previous
meta-learning methods by 14.28%.

of very few compact steep-spectrum sources (CSS) detected in $\gamma$-rays.
Here, we perform a detailed spectroscopic and variability analysis and present
the first quasi-simultaneous optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution in
order to reveal physical mechanisms which dominate its emission at different
wavelengths, and arrive at a reliable optical source classification. The first
main result of our study reveals several pitfalls when applying simple broad-
or narrow-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1 or NLS1) classification criteria which only look
at the [OIII]-H$\beta$ complex. [OIII] and H$\beta$ can be dominated by the
same outflow components, in which case FWHM(H$\beta$) is no reliable
classification criterion, and extinction by intrinsic or intervening material
can make the highest-velocity H$\beta$ component undetectable. After careful
combination of all information from UV-optical spectra along with
multi-wavelength data, we confirm that 3C 286 can be classified as NLS1 galaxy,
with line properties and SMBH mass (of order 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ and accreting
near the Eddington limit) close to the BLS1 regime, making it an important
borderline object. The quasi-simultaneous SED taken with $swift$ shows a sharp
rise in the optical-UV, implying the presence of a strong accretion-disk
component with EUV excess, consistent with emission-line diagnostics. Finally,
we report the discovery of X-ray variability of 3C 286, plausibly dominated by
jet emission, and variable by at least a factor $\sim4$. This result suggests
to exercise caution when using 3C 286 as radio calibrator in high-resolution
radio VLBI observations.

  https://github.com/ShannonAI/Self_Explaining_Structures_Improve_NLP_Models",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Existing approaches to explaining deep learning models in NLP usually suffer
from two major drawbacks: (1) the main model and the explaining model are
decoupled: an additional probing or surrogate model is used to interpret an
existing model, and thus existing explaining tools are not self-explainable;
(2) the probing model is only able to explain a model's predictions by
operating on low-level features by computing saliency scores for individual
words but are clumsy at high-level text units such as phrases, sentences, or
paragraphs. To deal with these two issues, in this paper, we propose a simple
yet general and effective self-explaining framework for deep learning models in
NLP. The key point of the proposed framework is to put an additional layer, as
is called by the interpretation layer, on top of any existing NLP model. This
layer aggregates the information for each text span, which is then associated
with a specific weight, and their weighted combination is fed to the softmax
function for the final prediction. The proposed model comes with the following
merits: (1) span weights make the model self-explainable and do not require an
additional probing model for interpretation; (2) the proposed model is general
and can be adapted to any existing deep learning structures in NLP; (3) the
weight associated with each text span provides direct importance scores for
higher-level text units such as phrases and sentences. We for the first time
show that interpretability does not come at the cost of performance: a neural
model of self-explaining features obtains better performances than its
counterpart without the self-explaining nature, achieving a new SOTA
performance of 59.1 on SST-5 and a new SOTA performance of 92.3 on SNLI.

Due to the frequency-dependence of this SE, standard approaches are
computationally expensive and may yield non-physical solutions, in particular

Transforming the standard fixed-point problem of finding quasiparticle energies
into a global optimization problem with a suitably defined fitness function,
application of the GA yields uniquely the physically relevant solution. We
demonstrate the applicability of our method for a set of molecules from the

method (UCOM) and the tensor correlation and spin-orbit effects are described
by the two-particle two-hole (2p2h) excitations of nucleon pairs, in which the
two nucleons with a large relative momentum are regarded as a high-momentum
pair (HM). With the 2p2h configurations increasing, the total energy per
particle of neutron matter is well converged under this UCOM+HM framework. By
comparing the results calculated with AV4', AV6', and AV8' NN interactions, the
effects of the short-range correlation, the tensor correlation, and the

hydrodynamic simulations of an initially sub-critical individual filament that
is allowed to accrete gas from its neighbourhood and evolves under
self-gravity. Results obtained here support the idea that fibres form naturally
during the filament formation process. We further argue that the ambient
environment, i.e., the magnitude of external pressure, and not the filament
linemass alone, has bearing upon the morphology of its evolution. We observe
that a filament is susceptible to the \emph{sausage}-type instability
irrespective of the external pressure. The fragments, however, are pinched in a
filament experiencing pressure comparable to that in the Solar neighbourhood
($\sim 10^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$). By contrast, fragments are broad and spherical -
having density profiles similar to that of a stable Bonnor - Ebert sphere -
when the filament experiences a higher pressure, typically $\ge 10^{5}$ K
cm$^{-3}$, but $\le 10^{6}$ K cm$^{-3}$). The filament tends to rupture at even
higher external pressure ($\ge 10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$). These observations

complementary measures from which intracellular and extracellular microscopic
fractional anisotropies ($\mu$FA) and diffusivities can be estimated.
Metabolites are largely confined to the intracellular space and therefore
provide a benchmark for intracellular diffusivity of specific cell types. Here,
we aimed to estimate tissue- and compartment-specific human brain
microstructure by combining water and metabolites DDES experiments. We
performed DDES in human subjects in two brain regions that contain widely
different amounts of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM): parietal white
matter (PWM) and occipital gray matter (OGM) on a 7 T MRI scanner. Results of
the metabolite DDES experiments in both PWM and OGM suggest a highly

exception of gray matter glia. Tortuosity values in the cytoplasm for water and
tNAA, obtained with correlation analysis of microscopic parallel diffusivity
with respect to GM/WM tissue fraction in the volume of interest, are remarkably

is observed from the A-type stars, as expected. X-ray spectra of Capella and
HIP 23309 are derived and modeled here, and compared with the previous X-ray
observations of these stars to show the reliability of the method used. We find
that optical light can start to leak in the very soft energy bands below 0.5
keV for stars with V=8 mag. In the process, we present the first X-ray spectrum
of HIP 23309.

to understand and tailor many of the unique functionalities realized in oxide
perovskite thin films. Here, we present a comprehensive and technically sound
ab initio description of ${\rm V_{O}}$ in epitaxially strained (001) STO thin
films. The novelty of our first-principles study lies in the incorporation of
lattice thermal excitations on the formation energy and diffusion properties of
${\rm V_{O}}$ over wide epitaxial strain conditions ($-4 \le \eta \le +4$%). We
found that thermal lattice excitations are necessary to obtain a satisfactory
agreement between first-principles calculations and the available experimental
data on the formation energy of ${\rm V_{O}}$ for STO thin films. Furthermore,
it is shown that thermal lattice excitations noticeably affect the energy
barriers for oxygen ion diffusion, which strongly depend on $\eta$ and are
significantly reduced (increased) under tensile (compressive) strain, also in
consistent agreement with the experimental observations. The present work
demonstrates that for a realistic theoretical description of oxygen vacancies
in oxide perovskite thin films is necessary to consider lattice thermal
excitations, thus going beyond standard zero-temperature ab initio approaches.

of the Heckman model. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Heckman
sample selection model by allowing the sample selection bias and dispersion
parameters to depend on covariates. We show that the non-robustness of the
Heckman model may be due to the assumption of the constant sample selection
bias parameter rather than the normality assumption. Our proposed methodology
allows us to understand which covariates are important to explain the sample
selection bias phenomenon rather than to only form conclusions about its
presence. We explore the inferential aspects of the maximum likelihood
estimators (MLEs) for our proposed generalized Heckman model. More
specifically, we show that this model satisfies some regularity conditions such
that it ensures consistency and asymptotic normality of the MLEs. Proper score
residuals for sample selection models are provided, and model adequacy is
addressed. Simulated results are presented to check the finite-sample behavior
of the estimators and to verify the consequences of not considering varying
sample selection bias and dispersion parameters. We show that the normal

applications such as translating official documents, incorrect translation can
have unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences. This motivates recent
research on testing methodologies for machine translation systems. Existing
methodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textual
level (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or syntactic level (e.g., the distance
between grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translation
results. However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether the
original and translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., Semantic
similarity). Therefore, in this paper, we propose SemMT, an automatic testing
approach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking.
SemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similarity
between the original and translated sentences. Our insight is that the
semantics expressed by the logic and numeric constraint in sentences can be
captured using regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) where
efficient equivalence/similarity checking algorithms are available. Leveraging
the insight, we propose three semantic similarity metrics and implement them in
SemMT. The experiment result reveals SemMT can achieve higher effectiveness
compared with state-of-the-art works, achieving an increase of 21% and 23% on
accuracy and F-Score, respectively. We also explore potential improvements that
can be achieved when proper combinations of metrics are adopted. Finally, we
discuss a solution to locate the suspicious trip in round-trip translation,

different renormailzation schemes, namely: the traditional one that sets the
geometry of the spacetime to be Minkowski at the renormalization point, and new
schemes (originally proposed in [1,2]) which set the geometry to be that of a

fields in de Sitter spacetimes with masses much smaller than the expansion rate
$H$. We find that the scheme that uses the classical de Sitter background
solution at the renormalization point, stands out as the most appropriate to
study the quantum effects on de Sitter spacetimes. Adopting such scheme we
obtain the backreaction is suppressed by $H^2/M_{pl}^2$ with no logarithmic
enhancement factor of $\ln{\lambda}$, giving only a small screening of the
classical cosmological constant due to the backreaction of such quantum fields.

iterative procedure starts with the construction of an energy minimizing
snapshot space that can be used for approximating the solution of the model
problem. A spectral decomposition is then performed on the snapshot space to
form global multiscale space. Under this setting, each global multiscale basis
function can be split into a non-decaying and a decaying parts. The
non-decaying part of a global basis is localized and it is fixed during the
iteration. Then, one can approximate the decaying part via a modified
Richardson scheme with an appropriately defined preconditioner. Using this set
of iterative-based multiscale basis functions, first-order convergence with
respect to the coarse mesh size can be shown if sufficiently many times of
iterations with regularization parameter being in an appropriate range are
performed. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and

(CNNs) have been proposed for image splicing forgery detection. Most of these
detection methods focus on the local patches or local objects. In fact, image
splicing forgery detection is a global binary classification task that
distinguishes the tampered and non-tampered regions by image fingerprints.
However, some specific image contents are hardly retained by CNN-based
detection networks, but if included, would improve the detection accuracy of
the networks. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel network called
dual-encoder U-Net (D-Unet) for image splicing forgery detection, which employs
an unfixed encoder and a fixed encoder. The unfixed encoder autonomously learns
the image fingerprints that differentiate between the tampered and non-tampered
regions, whereas the fixed encoder intentionally provides the direction
information that assists the learning and detection of the network. This
dual-encoder is followed by a spatial pyramid global-feature extraction module
that expands the global insight of D-Unet for classifying the tampered and
non-tampered regions more accurately. In an experimental comparison study of
D-Unet and state-of-the-art methods, D-Unet outperformed the other methods in
image-level and pixel-level detection, without requiring pre-training or
training on a large number of forgery images. Moreover, it was stably robust to
different attacks.

essentially a (2+1) dimensional space-time lattice exhibiting periodicities in
both spatial and temporal dimensions. The near-resonant optical shaking
considered here dynamically couples the low-lying $s$ band and the first
excited $p$ bands by transferring a photon of shaking frequency. The
intertwined space-time symmetries are further uncovered to elucidate the
degeneracy in the spectrum solved with the generalized Bloch-Floquet theorem.
Setting the chirality of circular shaking explicitly breaks time reversal
symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of $p_\pm = p_x \pm ip_y$ orbitals, leading
to the local circulation of orbital magnetism, i.e the imbalanced occupation in
$p_\pm$ orbitals. Moreover, the dynamics of Berry connection is revealed by the
time evolution of the Berry curvature and the polarization, which have physical
observable effects in experiments. Interestingly, the dynamics is found
characterized by a universal phase shift, governed by the time screw rotational
symmetry involving a fractional translation of time. These findings suggest
that the present lattice-shaking scheme provides a versatile platform for the
investigation of the orbital physics and the symmetry-protected dynamics.

global convergence to desired paths or enable following self-intersected
desired paths due to the existence of singular points where navigation
algorithms return unreliable or even no solutions. One typical example arises
in vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms. These
algorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly
where the vector field diminishes. In this paper, we show that it is
mathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global
convergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple
closed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new
impossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected
or simple closed desired paths to non-self-intersected and unbounded
(precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher-dimensional

guiding vector field on a higher-dimensional space. The integral curves of this
new guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the
higher-dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral
curves on a lower-dimensional subspace converge to the physical
(lower-dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out
for the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we
show both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed
method is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory
tracking algorithms. Finally, to show the practical value of our proposed
approach for complex engineering systems, we conduct outdoor experiments with a
fixed-wing airplane in windy environment to follow both 2D and 3D desired

directly learn the nonlinear mapping between observed noisy images and
underlying clean images. They normally do not consider the physical
characteristics of HSIs, therefore making them lack of interpretability that is
key to understand their denoising mechanism.. In order to tackle this problem,
we introduce a novel model guided interpretable network for HSI denoising.
Specifically, fully considering the spatial redundancy, spectral low-rankness
and spectral-spatial properties of HSIs, we first establish a subspace based
multi-dimensional sparse model. This model first projects the observed HSIs
into a low-dimensional orthogonal subspace, and then represents the projected
image with a multidimensional dictionary. After that, the model is unfolded
into an end-to-end network named SMDS-Net whose fundamental modules are
seamlessly connected with the denoising procedure and optimization of the
model. This makes SMDS-Net convey clear physical meanings, i.e., learning the
low-rankness and sparsity of HSIs. Finally, all key variables including
dictionaries and thresholding parameters are obtained by the end-to-end
training. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis confirm the
denoising ability and interpretability of our method against the
state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods.

learning agility against sparsity of relevant sources to the target task of
interest. Satisfying these attributes shall facilitate practical deployment of
transfer optimization to scenarios with big task-instances, while curbing the
threat of negative transfer. While applications of existing algorithms are
limited to tens of source tasks, in this paper, we take a quantum leap forward
in enabling more than two orders of magnitude scale-up in the number of tasks;
i.e., we efficiently handle scenarios beyond 1000 source task-instances. We
devise a novel transfer evolutionary optimization framework comprising two
co-evolving species for joint evolutions in the space of source knowledge and
in the search space of solutions to the target problem. In particular,
co-evolution enables the learned knowledge to be orchestrated on the fly,
expediting convergence in the target optimization task. We have conducted an
extensive series of experiments across a set of practically motivated discrete

task-instances, of which only a small fraction indicate source-target

winter can be challenging, particularly when wind and solar resources are low.
This paper examines how to mitigate space heating demand peaks most
cost-effectively in a top-down, sector-coupled model with carbon dioxide
emissions constraint to be net-zero. It introduces the first model that
co-optimises both supply and efficiency simultaneously including all European
countries with hourly resolution. The competition between technologies to
address these heating peaks, namely building retrofitting, thermal energy
storage and individual hybrid heat pumps with backup gas boilers is examined. A
novel thought experiment demonstrates that the level of building renovation is
driven by the strong seasonal heat peaks, rather than the overall energy
consumption. If all three instruments are applied, total costs are reduced by
up to 17%. Building renovation enables the largest benefit with cost savings of
up to 14% and allows individual gas boilers to be removed from the energy

phonetic posteriorgram (PPG) representing content, F0 representing pitch, and
speaker embedding representing timbre, respectively. Proposed system is
composed of three modules: generator $G$, the audio generation discriminator
$D_{A}$, and the feature disentanglement discriminator $D_F$. The generator $G$
encodes the features in parallel and inversely transforms them into the target
waveform. In order to make timbre conversion more stable and controllable,
speaker embedding is further decomposed to the weighted sum of a group of
trainable vectors representing different timbre clusters. Further, to realize
more robust and accurate singing conversion, disentanglement discriminator
$D_F$ is proposed to remove pitch and timbre related information that remains
in the encoded PPG. Finally, a two-stage training is conducted to keep a stable
and effective adversarial training process. Subjective evaluation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Proposed system
outperforms conventional cascade approach and the WaveNet based end-to-end
approach in terms of both singing quality and singer similarity. Further
objective analysis reveals that the model trained with the proposed two-stage

We explore here new aspects of this proposal. We first develop an equivalent
Einstein-frame formalism to the current Jordan-frame formulation of the
mechanism and use this to highlight similarities and differences of self-tuning
to the sequestering mechanism. We then show how with an extension of the local
self-tuning action by a coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and a companion four-form
field strength, graviton loops can be prevented from incapacitating the
degravitation of the Standard Model vacuum energy. For certain cases, we
furthermore find that this extension can be recast as a Horndeski scalar-tensor
theory and be embedded in the conventional local self-tuning formalism. We then
explore the possibility of a unification of inflation with self-tuning. The
resulting equations can alternatively be used to motivate a multiverse
interpretation. In this context, we revisit the coincidence problem and provide
an estimation for the probability of the emergence of intelligent life in our
Universe as a function of cosmic age, inferred from star and terrestrial planet
formation processes. We conclude that we live at a very typical epoch, where we
should expect the energy densities of the cosmological constant and matter to
be of comparable size. For a dimensionless quantity to compare the emergence of
life throughout the cosmic history of different universes in an anthropic
analysis of the multiverse, we choose the order of magnitude difference of the
evolving horizon size of a universe to the size of its proton as the basic
building block of atoms, molecules, and eventually life. (abridged)

enhances the string stability of mixed traffic, car following efficiency, and
energy efficiency. Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to
reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we
decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is
comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on
that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV's
characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to
improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance
performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed
proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of
the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated
experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model

car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration

conditions of intervening media, source structure, and emission processes. With
new low-frequency radio interferometers observing over wide fractional
bandwidths, studies of spectral variability for a large population of
extragalactic radio sources are now possible. Using two epochs of observations
from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM)
survey that were taken one year apart, we search for spectral variability
across 100--230 MHz for 21,558 sources. We present methodologies for detecting
variability in the spectrum between epochs and for classifying the type of
variability: either as a change in spectral shape or as a uniform change in
flux density across the bandwidth. We identify 323 sources with significant
spectral variability over a year-long timescale. Of the 323 variable sources,
we classify 51 of these as showing a significant change in spectral shape.
Variability is more prevalent in peaked-spectrum sources, analogous to
gigahertz-peaked spectrum and compact steep-spectrum sources, compared to
typical radio galaxies. We discuss the viability of several potential
explanations of the observed spectral variability, such as interstellar
scintillation and jet evolution. Our results suggest that the radio sky in the
megahertz regime is more dynamic than previously suggested.

domain, where labelled data are available, and a target domain only represented
with unlabelled data. If domain invariant representations have dramatically
improved the adaptability of models, to guarantee their good transferability
remains a challenging problem. This paper addresses this problem by using
active learning to annotate a small budget of target data. Although this setup,
called Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), deviates from UDA's standard setup, a
wide range of practical applications are faced with this situation. To this
purpose, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Adversarial Gradient Embedding}
(SAGE), a framework that makes a triple contribution to ADA. First, we select
for annotation target samples that are likely to improve the representations'
transferability by measuring the variation, before and after annotation, of the
transferability loss gradient. Second, we increase sampling diversity by
promoting different gradient directions. Third, we introduce a novel training
procedure for actively incorporating target samples when learning invariant
representations. SAGE is based on solid theoretical ground and validated on
various UDA benchmarks against several baselines. Our empirical investigation
demonstrates that SAGE takes the best of uncertainty \textit{vs} diversity
samplings and improves representations transferability substantially.

the study of symmetric monoidal categories. In the last few years, they have
found application in the modelling of various computational structures, in
fields as diverse as Computer Science, Physics, Control Theory, Linguistics,

  In many such proposals, the transformations of the described systems are
modelled as rewrite rules of diagrams. These developments demand a mathematical
foundation for string diagram rewriting: whereas rewrite theory for terms is
well-understood, the two-dimensional nature of string diagrams poses additional
challenges.
  This work systematises and expands a series of recent conference papers
laying down such foundation. As first step, we focus on the case of rewrite
systems for string diagrammatic theories which feature a Frobenius algebra.
This situation ubiquitously appear in various approaches: for instance, in the
algebraic semantics of linear dynamical systems, Frobenius structures model the
wiring of circuits; in categorical quantum mechanics, they model interacting
quantum observables.
  Our work introduces a combinatorial interpretation of string diagram
rewriting modulo Frobenius structures, in terms of double-pushout hypergraph
rewriting. Furthermore, we prove this interpretation to be sound and complete.
In the last part, we also see that the approach can be generalised to model
rewriting modulo multiple Frobenius structures. As a proof of concept, we show
how to derive from these results a termination strategy for Interacting
Bialgebras, an important rewrite theory in the study of quantum circuits and

study, we propose a reactive and adaptive method for robotic pushing that uses
rich feedback from a high-resolution optical tactile sensor to control push
movements instead of relying on analytical or data-driven models of push
interactions. Specifically, we use goal-driven tactile exploration to actively
search for stable pushing configurations that cause the object to maintain its
pose relative to the pusher while incrementally moving the pusher and object
towards the target. We evaluate our method by pushing objects across planar and
curved surfaces. For planar surfaces, we show that the method is accurate and
robust to variations in initial contact position/angle, object shape and start
position; for curved surfaces, the performance is degraded slightly. An
immediate consequence of our work is that it shows that explicit models of push
interactions might be sufficient but are not necessary for this type of task.
It also raises the interesting question of which aspects of the system should
be modelled to achieve the best performance and generalization across a wide

fully exploit radial velocities (RVs). Correlated time variations are often
mitigated by Gaussian processes (GP). They rely on fitting kernel functions
that are motivated on mathematical grounds, and whose physical interpretation
is often elusive. We aim to establish a connection between stellar activity
affecting RVs and their correlations with physical parameters, and compare this
connection with kernels used in the literature. We use simple activity models
to investigate the relationship between the physical processes generating the
signals and the covariances typically found in data, and to demonstrate the
qualitative behaviour of this relationship. We use the StarSim code to
calculate RVs of an M dwarf with different realistic evolving spot
configurations. Their auto-correlation functions (ACF) show a very specific
behaviour and are related to the kernel. GP regression is performed using a
quasi-periodic (QP) and harmonic oscillator kernels. Comparison of the
resulting kernels with the exact ACFs allows us to cross-match the kernel
hyper-parameters with the introduced physical values, study the overall
capabilities of the kernels, and improve their definition. We find that the QP
kernel provides a more straightforward interpretation of the physics. It is
able to consistently recover both the introduced rotation period P and the spot
lifetime. Our study indicates that the performance can be enhanced by fixing
the form factor w and adding a physically motivated cosine term with period
P/2, where the contribution to the ACF for the different spot configurations
differs significantly. The new quasi-periodic with cosine kernel leads to
significantly better model likelihoods, can potentially distinguish between
different spot configurations, and can thereby improve the sensitivity of RV
exoplanet searches.

nucleon-nucleon interaction and the bulk properties of nuclear matter; thus,
they provide a stringent test and challenge for nuclear theory. The calcium
region has been of particular interest, as experimental evidence has suggested
a new magic number at $N = 32$ [1-3], while the unexpectedly large increases in
the charge radii [4,5] open new questions about the evolution of nuclear size
in neutron-rich systems. By combining the collinear resonance ionization
spectroscopy method with $\beta$-decay detection, we were able to extend the
charge radii measurement of potassium ($Z =19$) isotopes up to the exotic
$^{52}$K ($t_{1/2}$ = 110 ms), produced in minute quantities. Our work provides
the first charge radii measurement beyond $N = 32$ in the region, revealing no
signature of the magic character at this neutron number. The results are
interpreted with two state-of-the-art nuclear theories. For the first time, a
long sequence of isotopes could be calculated with coupled-cluster calculations
based on newly developed nuclear interactions. The strong increase in the
charge radii beyond $N = 28$ is not well captured by these calculations, but is
well reproduced by Fayans nuclear density functional theory, which, however,
overestimates the odd-even staggering effect. These findings highlight our
limited understanding on the nuclear size of neutron-rich systems, and expose
pressing problems that are present in some of the best current models of
nuclear theory.

objects in each frame of a video. In the semi-supervised setting, the first
mask of each object is provided at test time. Following the one-shot principle,
fine-tuning VOS methods train a segmentation model separately on each given
object mask. However, recently the VOS community has deemed such a test time
optimization and its impact on the test runtime as unfeasible. To mitigate the
inefficiencies of previous fine-tuning approaches, we present efficient
One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (e-OSVOS). In contrast to most VOS
approaches, e-OSVOS decouples the object detection task and predicts only local
segmentation masks by applying a modified version of Mask R-CNN. The one-shot
test runtime and performance are optimized without a laborious and handcrafted
hyperparameter search. To this end, we meta learn the model initialization and
learning rates for the test time optimization. To achieve optimal learning
behavior, we predict individual learning rates at a neuron level. Furthermore,
we apply an online adaptation to address the common performance degradation
throughout a sequence by continuously fine-tuning the model on previous mask
predictions supported by a frame-to-frame bounding box propagation. e-OSVOS
provides state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017, and YouTube-VOS

differential equations. However, the reliability and accuracy of the
approximation still represent delicate issues that are not fully resolved in

dependent on a variety of computational parameters as well as on the choice of
optimisation methods, a point that has to be seen together with the structure
of the cost function. The intention of this paper is to make a step towards
resolving these open issues. To this end we study here the solution of a simple

We consider two computational approaches for solving differential equations by
neural forms. These are the classic but still actual method of trial solutions
defining the cost function, and a recent direct construction of the cost
function related to the trial solution method. Let us note that the settings we
study can easily be applied more generally, including solution of partial
differential equations. By a very detailed computational study we show that it
is possible to identify preferable choices to be made for parameters and
methods. We also illuminate some interesting effects that are observable in the
neural network simulations. Overall we extend the current literature in the
field by showing what can be done in order to obtain reliable and accurate
results by the neural network approach. By doing this we illustrate the
importance of a careful choice of the computational setup.

journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the
crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this
work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious
=> Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model
integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown
measures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown
measures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the
second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the
Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to
diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with
the action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a period
of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of
vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we
analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise have
been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we have
analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of
infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2
infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirms

that ReCFR can converge to a Nash equilibrium at a rate of $O({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$.
Based on ReCFR, a new model-free neural CFR with bootstrap learning, Neural

measure. Recent research suggests that generative adversarial networks have the
ability to overcome this limitation and serve as a multi-modal loss, especially
for textures. Together with learned image compression, these two techniques can
be used to great effect when relaxing the commonly employed tight measures of
distortion. However, convolutional neural network based algorithms have a large
computational footprint. Ideally, an existing conventional codec should stay in
place, which would ensure faster adoption and adhering to a balanced
computational envelope.
  As a possible avenue to this goal, in this work, we propose and investigate
how learned image coding can be used as a surrogate to optimize an image for
encoding. The image is altered by a learned filter to optimise for a different
performance measure or a particular task. Extending this idea with a generative
adversarial network, we show how entire textures are replaced by ones that are
less costly to encode but preserve sense of detail.
  Our approach can remodel a conventional codec to adjust for the MS-SSIM
distortion with over 20% rate improvement without any decoding overhead. On
task-aware image compression, we perform favourably against a similar but

triggers in text. Different from English ED, Chinese ED suffers from the
problem of word-trigger mismatch due to the uncertain word boundaries. Existing
approaches injecting word information into character-level models have achieved
promising progress to alleviate this problem, but they are limited by two
issues. First, the interaction between characters and lexicon words is not
fully exploited. Second, they ignore the semantic information provided by event
labels. We thus propose a novel architecture named Label enhanced Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks (L-HGAT). Specifically, we transform each sentence
into a graph, where character nodes and word nodes are connected with different
types of edges, so that the interaction between words and characters is fully
reserved. A heterogeneous graph attention networks is then introduced to
propagate relational message and enrich information interaction. Furthermore,
we convert each label into a trigger-prototype-based embedding, and design a
margin loss to guide the model distinguish confusing event labels. Experiments
on two benchmark datasets show that our model achieves significant improvement
over a range of competitive baseline methods.

Degeneration (AMD), a common macular disease among people over 50. Previous
research efforts mainly focus on AMD categorization with a single-modal input,
let it be a color fundus photograph (CFP) or an OCT B-scan image. By contrast,
we consider AMD categorization given a multi-modal input, a direction that is
clinically meaningful yet mostly unexplored. Contrary to the prior art that
takes a traditional approach of feature extraction plus classifier training
that cannot be jointly optimized, we opt for end-to-end multi-modal
Convolutional Neural Networks (MM-CNN). Our MM-CNN is instantiated by a
two-stream CNN, with spatially-invariant fusion to combine information from the
CFP and OCT streams. In order to visually interpret the contribution of the
individual modalities to the final prediction, we extend the class activation
mapping (CAM) technique to the multi-modal scenario. For effective training of
MM-CNN, we develop two data augmentation methods. One is GAN-based CFP/OCT
image synthesis, with our novel use of CAMs as conditional input of a
high-resolution image-to-image translation GAN. The other method is Loose
Pairing, which pairs a CFP image and an OCT image on the basis of their classes
instead of eye identities. Experiments on a clinical dataset consisting of
1,094 CFP images and 1,289 OCT images acquired from 1,093 distinct eyes show
that the proposed solution obtains better F1 and Accuracy than multiple
baselines for multi-modal AMD categorization. Code and data are available at

from some unknown distribution $P$ over a known domain $[n]$. After the
sampling process, a decision must be made about whether $P$ holds some
property, or is far from it. The most studied problem in the field is arguably
uniformity testing, where one needs to distinguish the case that $P$ is uniform
over $[n]$ from the case that $P$ is $\epsilon$-far from being uniform (in
$\ell_1$). In the classic model, it is known that
$\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2\right)$ samples are necessary and sufficient
for this task. This problem was recently considered in various restricted
models that pose, for example, communication or memory constraints. In more
than one occasion, the known optimal solution boils down to counting collisions
among the drawn samples (each two samples that have the same value add one to
the count), an idea that dates back to the first uniformity tester, and was
coined the name ""collision-based tester"".
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of comparison graphs and use it to
formally define a generalized collision-based tester. Roughly speaking, the
edges of the graph indicate the tester which pairs of samples should be
compared (that is, the original tester is induced by a clique, where all pairs
are being compared). We prove a structural theorem that gives a sufficient
condition for a comparison graph to induce a good uniformity tester. As an
application, we develop a generic method to test uniformity, and devise
nearly-optimal uniformity testers under various computational constraints. We
improve and simplify a few known results, and introduce a new constrained model
in which the method also produces an efficient tester.
  The idea behind our method is to translate computational constraints of a
certain model to ones on the comparison graph, which paves the way to finding a
good graph.

  First, we study the competition between central counterparties through

initial margin requirements. However, our estimations are not precise enough to
use them as input to a predictive model for CCP choice by counterparties in the
OTC market.
  Second, we model counterpart choice on the interdealer market using a novel
semi-supervised predictive task. We present our methodology as part of the
literature on model interpretability before arguing for the use of conditional
entropy as the metric of interest to derive knowledge from data through a
model-agnostic approach. In particular, we justify the use of deep neural
networks to measure conditional entropy on real-world datasets. We create the
$\textit{Razor entropy}$ using the framework of algorithmic information theory
and derive an explicit formula that is identical to our semi-supervised
training objective. Finally, we borrow concepts from game theory to define
$\textit{top-k Shapley values}$. This novel method of payoff distribution
satisfies most of the properties of Shapley values, and is of particular
interest when the value function is monotone submodular. Unlike classical
Shapley values, top-k Shapley values can be computed in quadratic time of the
number of features instead of exponential. We implement our methodology and
report the results on our particular task of counterpart choice.
  Finally, we present an improvement to the $\textit{node2vec}$ algorithm that
could for example be used to further study intermediation. We show that the
neighbor sampling used in the generation of biased walks can be performed in

Our hierarchical framework builds a feature pyramid with increasingly richer

breakup of a liquid jet introduced through a cylindrical nozzle into a stagnant
viscous phase via a hybrid interface-tracking/level-set method to account for
the surface tension forces in a three-dimensional Cartesian domain. Numerical
solutions are obtained for a range of Reynolds (Re) and Weber (We) numbers. We
find that the interplay between the azimuthal and streamwise vorticity
components leads to different interfacial features and flow regimes in Re-We
space. We show that the streamwise vorticity plays a critical role in the
development of the three-dimensional instabilities on the jet surface. In the
inertia-controlled regime at high Re and We, we expose the details of the
spatio-temporal development of the vortical structures affecting the
interfacial dynamics. A mushroom-like structure is formed at the leading edge
of the jet inducing the generation of a liquid sheet in its interior that
undergoes rupture to form droplets. These droplets rotate inside the mushroom
structure due to their interaction with the prevailing vortical structures.
Additionally, Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices that form near the injection point
deform in the streamwise direction to form hairpin vortices, which, in turn,
trigger the formation of interfacial lobes in the jet core. The thinning of the
lobes induces the creation of holes which expand to form liquid threads that
undergo capillary breakup to form droplets.

If the
Bondi energy is Hamiltonian, it can thus only be a time dependent Hamiltonian.
In this paper, we show that the Bondi energy can be understood as a
time-dependent Hamiltonian on the covariant phase space. Our derivation starts
from the Hamiltonian formulation in domains with boundaries that are null. We
introduce the most general boundary conditions on a generic such null boundary,
and compute quasi-local charges for boosts, energy and angular momentum.
Initially, these domains are at finite distance, such that there is a natural
IR regulator. To remove the IR regulator, we introduce a double null foliation
together with an adapted Newman--Penrose null tetrad. Both null directions are
surface orthogonal. We study the falloff conditions for such specific null
foliations and take the limit to null infinity. At null infinity, we recover
the Bondi mass and the usual covariant phase space for the two radiative modes
at the full non-perturbative level. Apart from technical results, the framework
gives two important physical insights. First of all, it explains the physical
significance of the corner term that is added in the Wald--Zoupas framework to
render the quasi-conserved charges integrable. The term to be added is simply
the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to the background fields that
drive the time-dependence of the Hamiltonian. Secondly, we propose a new
interpretation of the Bondi mass as the thermodynamical free energy of
gravitational edge modes at future null infinity. The Bondi mass law is then
simply the statement that the free energy always decreases on its way towards
thermal equilibrium.

consider the visible region (VR) phenomenon in the SAoS aided mmWave system and
find that the optimal distance between RIS tiles is supposed to yield a total

this motivated the development of algorithm engineering, which is viewed as
experimental techniques related to software engineering. Currently, algorithm
engineering is a methodology for algorithmic research that combines theory with
implementation and experimentation in order to produce better algorithms with
high practical impact. Still, researchers have questioned whether the notion of
algorithms can be defined in a fully generable way and discussed what kinds of
entities algorithms actually are. They have also struggled to maintain a view
that formulates algorithms mathematically (e.g., Turing machines and
finite-state machines [FSMs]) while adapting a more applied view. Answering the
question of what algorithms have practical applications in software
specifications in particular, this paper proposes a diagrammatical definition
of an algorithm based on a new modeling machine called a thinging machine (TM).
The machine has five actions (e.g., create, process, release, transfer, and
receive) that can form a network of machines. The paper explores the
application of the definition in Turing machines and FSMs. The results point to
the fact that the proposed definition can serve as a middle-ground
representation of algorithms, a definition which is between formal
specification and the commonly used informal definition (e.g., set of
instructions).

new perspective to estimate correspondences in a detect-to-refine manner, where
we first predict patch-level match proposals and then refine them. We present
Patch2Pix, a novel refinement network that refines match proposals by
regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions defined by those
proposals and jointly rejecting outlier matches with confidence scores.
Patch2Pix is weakly supervised to learn correspondences that are consistent
with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our refinement
network significantly improves the performance of correspondence networks on
image matching, homography estimation, and localization tasks. In addition, we
show that our learned refinement generalizes to fully-supervised methods
without re-training, which leads us to state-of-the-art localization
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/GrumpyZhou/patch2pix.

magnitude term found in the Gaia DR2 photometry is no longer visible, and
overall there are no trends larger than 1 mmag/mag. Using one passband over the

better nonconvex relaxation form of this measure (NC-MCTF). The proposed models
encode low-rank insights for general tensors provided by Tucker and T-SVD, and
thus are expected to simultaneously model spectral low-rankness in multiple

based on few observed entries. Furthermore, we study the MCTF and NC-MCTF
regularization minimization problem, and design an effective block successive
upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm to solve them. This efficient solver
can extend MCTF to various tasks, such as tensor completion. A series of

calibration signal and algorithm. In respect to the calibration signal, our

are normally used for remote sensing, are used as calibration signals.
Moreover, our methods solve the ambiguity problem of analyzing a phase shift
which occurs when sinusoidal signals are used as calibration signals. In
regards to the algorithm, the Adam learning algorithm avoids learning in the
wrong direction, unlike the conventional gradient descent.
  Using our method, mathematical forms of received signals are acquired
successfully. Our method shows better effectivity compared to the conventional

algorithms and circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a
class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathfrak{C}$ can be
PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error
$1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2

$\mathsf{BQE} = \mathsf{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of
$\mathsf{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is
not hard to learn any class $\mathfrak{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T

most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a
marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major
consequences in complexity theory.
  Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and
computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial
classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira

algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show
among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound

uniform continuity with respect to the initial data fails. Thus, our result

governing differential equations of motion of nonlinear structural dynamic
systems. The problem of discovering governing equations is cast as that of
selecting relevant variables from a predetermined dictionary of basis variables
and solved via sparse Bayesian linear regression. The SS priors, which belong
to a class of discrete-mixture priors and are known for their strong
sparsifying (or shrinkage) properties, are employed to induce sparse solutions
and select relevant variables. Three different variants of SS priors are
explored for performing Bayesian equation discovery. As the posteriors with SS
priors are analytically intractable, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based
Gibbs sampler is employed for drawing posterior samples of the model
parameters; the posterior samples are used for variable selection and parameter
estimation in equation discovery. The proposed algorithm has been applied to
four systems of engineering interest, which include a baseline linear system,
and systems with cubic stiffness, quadratic viscous damping, and Coulomb
damping. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SS priors in
identifying the presence and type of nonlinearity in the system. Additionally,
comparisons with the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) - that uses a Student's-t
prior - indicate that the SS priors can achieve better model selection
consistency, reduce false discoveries, and derive models that have superior
predictive accuracy. Finally, the Silverbox experimental benchmark is used to
validate the proposed methodology.

problems - the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs). While the efficacy of DL
systems is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different
from that of humans. State-of-the-art systems solving RPMs rely on massive
pattern-based training and sometimes on exploiting biases in the dataset,
whereas humans concentrate on identification of the rules / concepts underlying
the RPM (or generally a visual reasoning task) to be solved. Motivated by this
cognitive difference, this work aims at combining DL with human way of solving

labels in a hierarchy, which are useful for image classification, product
categorization, and database search. However, many existing studies of
interactive graph search aim at identifying a single target optimally, and
suffer from the limitations of asking too many questions and not being able to
handle multiple targets. To address these two limitations, in this paper, we
study a new problem of budget constrained interactive graph search for multiple
targets called kBM-IGS-problem. Specifically, given a set of multiple targets T
in a hierarchy, and two parameters k and b, the goal is to identify a k-sized
set of selections S such that the closeness between selections S and targets T
is as small as possible, by asking at most a budget of b questions. We
theoretically analyze the updating rules and design a penalty function to
capture the closeness between selections and targets. To tackle the
kBM-IGS-problem, we develop a novel framework to ask questions using the best
vertex with the largest expected gain, which makes a balanced trade-off between
target probability and benefit gain. Based on the kBM-IGS framework, we first
propose an efficient algorithm STBIS to handle the SingleTarget problem, which
is a special case of kBM-IGS. Then, we propose a dynamic programming based
method kBM-DP to tackle the MultipleTargets problem. To further improve
efficiency, we propose two heuristic but efficient algorithms kBM-Topk and
kBM-DP+. kBM-Topk develops a variant gain function and selects the top-k
vertices independently. kBM-DP+ uses an upper bound of gains and prunes
disqualified vertices to save computations. Experiments on large real-world

drug-oriented exploration of large medical literature. Drugs and diseases are
identified according to the ATC classification and MeSH categories
respectively. More than 60K articles and 2M paragraphs have been processed from
the CORD-19 corpus with information of COVID-19, SARS, and other related

two-body problem. In recognizing the mathematical structure of the two-body
problem, we derive a robust path-following law that can stabilize in any
Keplerian orbit. We use the sliding mode control theory framework to achieve
that, which is only possible after we propose and prove asymptotic convergence
of a new kind of sliding surface, especially suitable for this path-following
problem. We can derive our control law with this new sliding surface, showing
that it is asymptotically stable. The applicability of this new path-following
is exemplified for three examples. In a moving path-following problem, a
particle is requested to orbit an accelerated moving point. A patched
hyperboles example shows the possibility of patching Keplerian trajectories for
obtaining a whole complex trajectory. Lastly, an orbital maintenance problem
around the asteroid Itokawa is shown.

the 19th century, an increase in scholarly interest in family photo albums
dates back to the early 1980s. Such collections of photos may reveal
sociological and historical insights regarding specific cultures and times.
They are, however, in most cases scattered among private homes and only
available on paper or photographic film, thus making their analysis by
academics such as historians, social-cultural anthropologists and cultural
theorists very cumbersome. In this paper, we analyze the IMAGO dataset
including photos belonging to family albums assembled at the University of
Bologna's Rimini campus since 2004. Following a deep learning-based approach,
the IMAGO dataset has offered the opportunity of experimenting with photos
taken between year 1845 and year 2009, with the goals of assessing the dates
and the socio-historical contexts of the images, without use of any other
sources of information. Exceeding our initial expectations, such analysis has
revealed its merit not only in terms of the performance of the approach adopted
in this work, but also in terms of the foreseeable implications and use for the
benefit of socio-historical research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that moves along this path in literature.

analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing, in which the observables in each redshift
bin are the mean number counts and the mean weak lensing profile of clusters
above a mass proxy threshold. The primary astrophysical nuisance parameter is
the logarithmic scatter between the mass proxy and true mass near the
threshold. For surveys similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Roman Space
Telescope High Latitude Survey (HLS), and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast aggregate precision on sigma_8 of 0.26%,
0.24%, and 0.10%, respectively, if the mass-observable scatter has an external
prior better than 0.01. These constraints would be degraded by about 20% for a
0.05 prior on scatter in the case of DES or HLS and for a 0.016 prior for LSST.
A one-month observing program with Roman Space Telescope targeting
approximately 2500 massive clusters could achieve a 0.5% constraint on
sigma_8(z=0.7) on its own, or a ~0.33% constraint in combination with the HLS.
Realizing the constraining power of clusters requires accurate knowledge of the
mass-observable relation and stringent control of systematics. We provide
analytic approximations to our numerical results that allow easy scaling to
other survey assumptions or other methods of cluster mass estimation.

the so-called curse of dimensionality. With just one offline computation, the
proposed PGD-IR scheme provides a computational vademecum that contains all the
possible solutions for a pre-defined range of the parameters. The proposed
approach is nonintrusive and it is therefore possible to be integrated with
commercial FE packages. The applicability and potential of the developed
technique is shown using a three dimensional test case and a more complex
industrial test case. The first example is used to highlight the numerical
properties of the scheme, whereas the second example demonstrates the potential
in a more complex setting and it shows the possibility to integrate the

e.g., climate change or biodiversity loss. Simultaneously, these associated
impacts have increased environmental awareness within societies across the
globe, thereby leading to dynamical feedbacks between the social and natural
Earth system. Contemporary modelling attempts of Earth system dynamics rarely
incorporate such co-evolutions and interactions are mostly studied
unidirectionally through direct or remembered past impacts. Acknowledging that
societies have the additional capability for foresight, this work proposes a
conceptual feedback model of socio-ecological co-evolution with the specific
construct of anticipation acting as a mediator between the social and natural
system. Our model reproduces results from previous sociological threshold
models with bi-stability if one assumes a static environment. Once the
environment changes in response to societal behaviour the system instead
converges towards a globally stable, but not necessarily desired, attractor.
Ultimately, we show that anticipation of future ecological states then leads to
metastability of the system where desired states can persist for a long time.
We thereby demonstrate that foresight and anticipation form an important
mechanism which, once its time horizon becomes large enough, fosters social

  Material Decomposition in Dual-Energy CT",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used in many
applications that need material decomposition. Image-domain methods directly
decompose material images from high- and low-energy attenuation images, and
thus, are susceptible to noise and artifacts on attenuation images. The purpose
of this study is to develop an improved iterative neural network (INN) for
high-quality image-domain material decomposition in DECT, and to study its
properties. We propose a new INN architecture for DECT material decomposition.
The proposed INN architecture uses distinct cross-material convolutional neural
network (CNN) in image refining modules, and uses image decomposition physics
in image reconstruction modules. The distinct cross-material CNN refiners
incorporate distinct encoding-decoding filters and cross-material model that
captures correlations between different materials. We study the distinct
cross-material CNN refiner with patch-based reformulation and tight-frame
condition. Numerical experiments with extended cardiactorso (XCAT) phantom and
clinical data show that the proposed INN significantly improves the image
quality over several image-domain material decomposition methods, including a
conventional model-based image decomposition (MBID) method using an
edge-preserving regularizer, a recent MBID method using pre-learned
material-wise sparsifying transforms, and a noniterative deep CNN method. Our
study with patch-based reformulations reveals that learned filters of distinct
cross-material CNN refiners can approximately satisfy the tight-frame
condition.

presented to dynamically allocate radio spectrum and computing resource, and
distribute computation workloads for the slices. To obtain an optimal RAN
slicing policy for accommodating the spatial-temporal dynamics of vehicle
traffic density, we first formulate a constrained RAN slicing problem with the
objective to minimize long-term system cost. This problem cannot be directly
solved by traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms due to complicated
coupled constraints among decisions. Therefore, we decouple the problem into a
resource allocation subproblem and a workload distribution subproblem, and
propose a two-layer constrained RL algorithm, named Resource Allocation and
Workload diStribution (RAWS) to solve them. Specifically, an outer layer first
makes the resource allocation decision via an RL algorithm, and then an inner
layer makes the workload distribution decision via an optimization subroutine.
Extensive trace-driven simulations show that the RAWS effectively reduces the
system cost while satisfying QoS requirements with a high probability, as

suggests that the electrons are accelerated or re-accelerated by merger shock
fronts propagating outward in the intracluster plasma. In the X-ray, some
relics do exhibit such shocks at the location of the relic, but many do not. We
explore the possibility that radio relics trace not the shock fronts but the
shape of the underlying distribution of seed relativistic electrons, lit up by
a recent shock passage. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster
mergers and include bubbles of relativistic electrons injected by jets from the
central AGN or from an off-center radio galaxy. We show that the merger-driven

spread the relativistic seed electrons preferentially in tangential direction

results for the Lipschitz stability analysis of the backward heat propagation

  Abstract of the first version: In this work, we study a Lipschitz stability
result in the reconstruction of a compactly supported initial temperature for
the heat equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$, from measurements along a positive time
interval and over an open set containing its support. We take advantage of the
explicit dependency of solutions to the heat equation with respect to the
initial condition. By means of Carleman estimates we obtain an analogous result
for the case when the observation is made along an exterior region
$\omega\times(\tau,T)$, such that the unobserved part
$\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\omega$ is bounded. In the latter setting, the method of
Carleman estimates gives a general conditional logarithmic stability result
when initial temperatures belong to a certain admissible set, and without the
assumption of compactness of support. Furthermore, we apply these results to
deduce a similar result for the heat equation in $\mathbb{R}$ for measurements
available on a curve contained in $\mathbb{R}\times [0,\infty)$, from where a
stability estimate for an inverse problem arising in 2D Fluorescence Microscopy
is deduced as well. In order to further understand this Lipschitz stability, in
particular, the magnitude of its stability constant with respect to the noise
level of the measurements, a numerical reconstruction is presented based on the
construction of a linear system for the inverse problem in Fluorescence
Microscopy. We investigate the stability constant with the condition number of
the corresponding matrix.

based on a kinematic parameterization of the actual configuration that makes
use of a center-line, a frame of directors, and local degrees of freedom
capturing the detailed shape of cross-sections. A relaxation method is applied
that holds the framed center-line fixed while relaxing the local degrees of

a one-dimensional strain energy depending on the apparent stretching, bending

such as mobile devices installing and uninstalling applications in the
lockstep, to boost their ranks in the app store? We model such tuples as
entries in a streaming tensor, which augments attribute sizes in its modes over
time. Synchronized behavior tends to form dense blocks (i.e. subtensors) in
such a tensor, signaling anomalous behavior, or interesting communities.
However, existing dense block detection methods are either based on a static
tensor, or lack an efficient algorithm in a streaming setting. Therefore, we
propose a fast streaming algorithm, AugSplicing, which can detect the top dense
blocks by incrementally splicing the previous detection with the incoming ones
in new tuples, avoiding re-runs over all the history data at every tracking
time step. AugSplicing is based on a splicing condition that guides the
algorithm (Section 4). Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method is
(1) effective to detect fraudulent behavior in installing data of real-world
apps and find a synchronized group of students with interesting features in
campus Wi-Fi data; (2) robust with splicing theory for dense block detection;
(3) streaming and faster than the existing streaming algorithm, with closely
comparable accuracy.

MPC only considers one single realization of the disturbances and its
performance strongly depends on the quality of the forecast of the
disturbances, which can lead to low performance. In fact, inadequate building
energy management can lead to high energy costs and CO$_2$ emissions. On the
other hand, a linearized model can fail to capture some dynamics and behavior
of the building under control. In this article, we combine a stochastic
scenario-based MPC (SBMPC) controller together with a nonlinear Modelica model
that is able to provide a richer building description and to capture the
dynamics of the building more accurately than linear models. The adopted SBMPC
controller considers multiple realizations of the external disturbances
obtained through a statistically accurate model, so as to consider different
possible disturbance evolutions and to robustify the control action. To this
purpose, we present a scenario generation method for building temperature
control that can be applied to several exogenous perturbations, e.g.\ solar
irradiance, outside temperature, and that satisfies several important
stastistical properties, in contrast with simpler and less accurate methods
adopted in the literature. We show the benefits of our proposed approach
through several simulations in which we compare our method against the standard
ones from the literature, for several combinations of a trade-off parameter
between comfort and energy cost. We show how our SBMPC controller approach
outperforms the standard controllers available in the literature.

dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. Notably, these parameters include intermediate
regimes where interactions and dissipation are comparable, and especially cases
with low occupations for which common semiclassical approximations can break
down. The presence of dissipation can alleviate instabilities in the method
that are known to occur for closed systems, allowing the simulation of dynamics
up to and including the steady state. Throughout the parameter space of the
model, we determine the magnitude of dissipation that is sufficient to make the
method useful and stable, finding its region of applicability to be

control of rigid and flexible spacecraft supported by a high-fidelity numerical
simulation environment. The demand for greater attitude pointing precision,
attitude maneuvering or recovery with the increased use of lightweight and
flexible materials necessitates the consideration of flexible dynamics in the
control strategy. These highly nonlinear dynamics which increase the order of
the system are extremely difficult to model with high degree of accuracy. A
general model for attitude and flexible dynamics for a class of spacecraft is
hence derived in detail based on the so-called hybrid coordinates approach. The
spacecraft considered has a star topology with a rigid central bus and flexible
plate-type appendages. Given that the flexible spacecraft is under-actuated,
the input-output feedback linearization technique is specifically used to
partition the system into two distinct parts, namely an external linear system
and an internal unobservable nonlinear system. A general internal/zero dynamics
theorem for a class of nonlinear systems is proved and then applied to a
flexible spacecraft which results in a linear asymptotically stable zero
dynamics. The overall closed-loop stability of the flexible spacecraft is also
analyzed rigorously and shown to be locally asymptotically stable using the
Lyapunov theory. The robustness of the controller against modeling and
parametric uncertainties is examined through extensive numerical simulations.
Overall, the feedback linearization control scheme has been proven to be
feasible and efficient for the attitude recovery of a spacecraft and has also
become front and center in other application areas in the recent years.

a one-way street with $n$ parking spots, where cars only drive forward.
Subsequently, parking functions have been generalized in various ways,
including allowing cars the option of driving backward. The set $PF_{n,k}$ of
$k$-Naples parking functions have cars who can drive backward a maximum of $k$
steps before driving forward. A recursive formula for $|PF_{n,k}|$ has been
obtained, though deriving a closed formula for $|PF_{n,k}|$ appears difficult.
In addition, an important subset $B_{n,k}$ of $PF_{n,k}$, called the contained
$k$-Naples parking functions, has been shown, with a non-bijective proof, to
have the same cardinality as that of the set $PF_n$ of classical parking
functions, independent of $k$.
  In this paper, we study $k$-Naples parking functions in the more general
context of $m$ cars and $n$ parking spots, for any $m \leq n$. We use various
parking function involutions to establish a bijection between the contained
$k$-Naples parking functions and the classical parking functions, from which it
can be deduced that the two sets have the same number of ties. Then we extend
this bijection to inject the set of $k$-Naples parking functions into a certain
set of obstructed parking functions, providing an upper bound for the
cardinality of the former set.

Network (GGNN) and Graph Long Short-term Memory (G-LSTM) are utilised as graph
encoders to exploit the graphical prosody boundary information.
Graph-to-sequence model is proposed and formed by a graph encoder and an
attentional decoder. Two techniques are proposed to embed sequential

results show that this proposed approach can encode the phonetic and prosody

comparative results with the state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence models with
better performance in the aspect of prosody. This provides an alternative

due to the complex interplay between multiple non-linear physical mechanisms
behind streamflow generation. While physically-based models are rooted in rich
understanding of the physical processes, a significant performance gap still
remains which can be potentially addressed by leveraging the recent advances in
machine learning. The goal of this work is to incorporate our understanding of
physical processes and constraints in hydrology into machine learning
algorithms, and thus bridge the performance gap while reducing the need for
large amounts of data compared to traditional data-driven approaches. In
particular, we propose an LSTM based deep learning architecture that is coupled
with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), an hydrology model that is in wide
use today. The key idea of the approach is to model auxiliary intermediate
processes that connect weather drivers to streamflow, rather than directly
mapping runoff from weather variables which is what a deep learning
architecture without physical insight will do. The efficacy of the approach is
being analyzed on several small catchments located in the South Branch of the
Root River Watershed in southeast Minnesota. Apart from observation data on
runoff, the approach also leverages a 200-year synthetic dataset generated by
SWAT to improve the performance while reducing convergence time. In the early
phases of this study, simpler versions of the physics guided deep learning
architectures are being used to achieve a system understanding of the coupling
of physics and machine learning. As more complexity is introduced into the
present implementation, the framework will be able to generalize to more
sophisticated cases where spatial heterogeneity is present.

  through Dirac oscillator interaction","1 figure",,"10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-08913-3",,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce a unique model for a fermion antifermion pair interacting
through Dirac oscillator interaction in the presence of external uniform
magnetic field. In order to acquire a non perturbative energy spectrum for such
a system we solve the corresponding form of a fully covariant two body Dirac
equation. The dynamic symmetry of the system allows to study in three
dimensions and the corresponding equation leads a $4\times4$ dimensional matrix
equation for such a static and spinless composite system. We can obtain an
exact solution of the matrix equation and arrive at a spectrum (in closed form)
in energy domain. The obtained energy spectrum shows that the composite system
that under scrutiny behaves like a single relativistic quantum oscillator. As a
result, we obtain relativistic Landau levels of a fermion antifermion pair
interacting through Dirac oscillator interaction and determine the components
of the corresponding bi-spinor. We think that our results can provide
enlightening informations about the quark antiquark systems and thus mass
formula for mesons.

fields are promising biomimetic systems to investigate the electroporation of
cells. In strong electric fields, vesicles undergo significant deformation,
which strongly alters the transmembrane potential, consequently the
electroporation. Previous theoretical studies investigated the
electrodeformation of vesicles in DC fields (which are not pulsed). In this
work, we computationally investigate the deformation of a deflated vesicle
under unipolar, bipolar, and two-step unipolar pulses and show sensitive
dependence of intermediate shapes on type of pulse and the pulse width.
Starting with the stress-free initial shape of a deflated vesicle, which is
similar to a prolate spheroid, the analysis is presented for the cases with
higher and lower conductivities of the inner fluid medium relative to the outer
fluid medium. For the ratio of inner to outer fluid conductivity,
$\sigma_\mathrm{r}$ = 10, the shape always remains prolate, including when the
field is turned off. For $\sigma_\mathrm{r} = 0.1$, several complex dynamics
are observed, such as the prolate-to-oblate (PO), prolate-to-oblate-to-prolate
(POP) shape transitions in time depending upon the strength of the field and
the pulse properties. In this case, on turning off the field, a metastable
oblate equilibrium shape is seen, that seems to be a characteristics of a
deflated vesicle leading to POPO transitions. When a two-step unipolar pulse (a
combination of a strong and a weak subpulse) is applied, a vesicle can reach an
oblate or a prolate final shape depending upon the relative durations of the
two subpulses.

lot of attention in the recent past. Using the encoder block of an autoencoder
the input image can be compressed into a meaningful representation. Then a
decoder is employed to reconstruct the compressed representation back to a
version which looks like the input image. It has plenty of applications in the
field of data compression and denoising. Another version of Autoencoders (AE)
exist, called Variational AE (VAE) which acts as a generative model like GAN.
Recently, an optimizer was introduced which is known as lookahead optimizer
which significantly enhances the performances of Adam as well as SGD. In this
paper, we implement Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) and Convolutional
Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) with lookahead optimizer (with Adam) and
compare them with the Adam (only) optimizer counterparts. For this purpose, we
have used a movie dataset comprising of natural images for the former case and
CIFAR100 for the latter case. We show that lookahead optimizer (with Adam)
improves the performance of CAEs for reconstruction of natural images.

In DDM, the dynamical evolution of the samples is investigated separately at
different length scales and extracted from a set of images recorded at
different times. A specific result of interest is the structure function that
can be computed via spatial Fourier transforms and differences of signals. In
this work, we present an algorithm to efficiently process a set of images
according to the DDM analysis scheme. We bench-marked the new approach against
the state-of-the-art algorithm reported in previous work. The new
implementation computes the DDM analysis faster, thanks to an additional
Fourier transform in time instead of performing differences of signals. This
allows obtaining very fast analysis also in CPU based machine. In order to test
the new code, we performed the DDM analysis over sets of more than 1000 images
with and without the help of GPU hardware acceleration. As an example, for
images of $512 \times 512$ pixels, the new algorithm is 10 times faster than
the previous GPU code. Without GPU hardware acceleration and for the same set
of images, we found that the new algorithm is 300 faster than the old one both
running only on the CPU.

therefore provide a better starting point for perturbative treatments of

represents one of the most important transportation modes in international
trade. Due to large volume and scale, in FTL, delivery time is often less
critical but cost and service quality are crucial. Therefore, efficiently
solving large scale multiple shift FTL problems is becoming more and more
important and requires further research. In one of our earlier studies, a set
covering model and a three-stage solution method were developed for a
multi-shift FTL problem. This paper extends the previous work and presents a
significantly more efficient approach by hybridising pricing and cutting
strategies with metaheuristics (a variable neighbourhood search and a genetic
algorithm). The metaheuristics were adopted to find promising columns (vehicle
routes) guided by pricing and cuts are dynamically generated to eliminate
infeasible flow assignments caused by incompatible commodities. Computational
experiments on real-life and artificial benchmark FTL problems showed superior
performance both in terms of computational time and solution quality, when
compared with previous MIP based three-stage methods and two existing
metaheuristics. The proposed cutting and heuristic pricing approach can
efficiently solve large scale real-life FTL problems.

  fails to account for key confounders and confuses correlation with causation","As submitted to Quantitative Science Studies",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Alessandro Strumia recently published a survey of gender differences in
publications and citations in high-energy physics (HEP). In addition to
providing full access to the data, code, and methodology, Strumia (2020)
systematically describes and accounts for gender differences in HEP citation
networks. His analysis points both to ongoing difficulties in attracting women
to high-energy physics and an encouraging-though slow-trend in improvement.
Unfortunately, however, the time and effort Strumia (2020) devoted to collating
and quantifying the data are not matched by a similar rigour in interpreting
the results. To support his conclusions, he selectively cites available
literature and fails to adequately adjust for a range of confounding factors.
For example, his analyses do not consider how unobserved factors -- e.g., a
tendency to overcite well-known authors -- drive a wedge between quality and
citations and correlate with author gender. He also fails to take into account
many structural and non-structural factors -- including, but not limited to,
direct discrimination and the expectations women form (and actions they take)
in response to it -- that undoubtedly lead to gender differences in
productivity. We therefore believe that a number of Strumia's conclusions are
not supported by his analysis. Indeed, we re-analyse a subsample of
solo-authored papers from his data, adjusting for year and journal of
publication, authors' research age and their lifetime ""fame"". Our re-analysis
suggests that female-authored papers are actually cited more than male-authored
papers. This finding is inconsistent with the ""greater male variability""
hypothesis Strumia (2020) proposes to explain many of his results.
